14019	18787	Tonight, February 13th, 2011, there will be no more hero games at Activision.
19108	21211	A survey hints at details on Dance Central 2.
21892	25679	And could your PlayStation 3 games soon require a serial number registration?
32079	32359	DarkSakura.com
48337	49478	I am dropping stuff.
49658	50178	Oh, no.
50578	54040	That's not a good way to start off the 401st episode of our show.
54240	54620	Yeah.
54740	56041	Into the next hundred.
56081	56921	Think we'll make it to 500?
57562	57822	Sure.
57882	58262	Why not?
58422	58802	Why not?
58902	59363	Exactly.
60023	60903	I got nothing else to do.
60924	62404	I got nothing better to do.
62484	62905	Why not?
63325	63545	All right.
63585	65926	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
66046	66326	Hello.
66686	67027	All right.
67067	67627	How are you, Loki?
67967	68507	I'm fine.
68747	69567	Good, good to hear.
69627	70348	How's the baby doing?
71908	73108	It's doing okay.
73408	76369	I enjoy reading the wife's blogs about the baby.
76409	84950	It's interesting because, you know, I don't have a child, but it seems like everybody around me, you know, not everybody, but many people around me are kind of starting to enter that, take that step.
85110	85291	Yeah.
85311	86511	It's kind of interesting to hear the stories.
87191	89031	Yeah, you will see posts once a month.
89691	91492	And it just reminds me, I'm getting old.
92232	95593	So, have you thought about what the baby's first video game should be?
95913	97333	Well, he's already played Grand Theft Auto, so...
98360	101142	Wait a minute, you let your baby play Grand Theft Auto?
101202	110368	Yeah, he can't really hold the controller well, but he had it at the point where he had one hand on the left analog stick and the other hand on the trigger and he was driving around.
110468	113671	So technically that is playing Grand Theft Auto.
114511	124578	Granted, he doesn't know what he's doing, but he had an Xbox 360 controller and he didn't kill anything, he just was driving around.
125058	126118	That's a story to tell.
126599	127379	Tell him when he's like 13.
128299	130400	Did you know your first game was Grand Theft Auto?
130740	135181	Because by then they'll be up to Grand Theft Auto 17 or whatever.
136202	140563	Anyhow, let's also introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show.
140603	144404	We don't have anybody else in the studio tonight, sadly, but we do have, of course, the chat room.
144444	147625	We are the show where every gamer has a voice and have been that way since 2002.
148686	152767	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you want to join us in our chat room.
153007	165394	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern But if you want to join our chat room you can do that at chat.orangeloungeradio.com What's this?
166555	167195	You took video?
167395	174980	Oh my You actually have a little picture of Josh playing the 360 control That is adorable That is really adorable
176180	179321	By the way, my secondary theme for tonight's show What's that?
179341	180542	That's so cute What's that, DarkSakura?
180602	186964	Is posting random stuff in the chatroom Posting random stuff in the chatroom, just because?
187424	203409	Yeah, I found a neat article in Cracked about Easter eggs hidden in albums And I think we need to start doing Easter eggs in our episodes Our episodes need Like, we have an epic burp and you run it through a spectrograph and it's a picture of a puppy
203709	204670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
231730	234537	Seriously, I'm like, this is why I didn't do this crap before.
234998	241272	Of course, now I'm doing all that crap on my level 85 character, so I'm like... And, um...
242896	247638	I also have Final Fantasy 3 on the DS, which is pretty cool so far.
248478	249318	I'm very happy with it.
263857	272308	We were at Dimple and we had some leftover credit because we traded in like a ton of our old DVDs that we had either replaced or just were crap.
272588	275432	Local music chain, by the way, which also sells games used new.
276241	278063	So we were like, well, let's just go ahead and use up our credit.
278103	279624	So I picked a game and Dan picked a game.
279805	281606	And then we said, well, let's use our discount card.
281987	284890	And it turned out we still had $5 left when we were done.
285250	286671	Because we thought we were using it all up.
286932	288353	So we still have credit there.
288373	289454	So I guess we're going to go back and get another game.
289474	291296	I still have no idea what that discount card's for.
291316	293278	I probably have a ton of stuff on there.
293338	296421	You get like a random 50% off on your purchases or something.
296681	297642	Am I a bad person?
297662	299663	Because I don't really shop at music stores anymore.
299723	301104	Not since Tower Records went under.
301744	303305	That was my chain was Tower Records.
303345	303625	I don't either.
303885	305786	I used to buy import CDs from Tower Records.
305806	309028	This was before the interwebs or when interwebs was all dial-up, right?
309508	312830	When Orange Lounge Radio had a 56K friendly stream, right?
313150	313991	That was a while ago.
314011	315972	That's when I was shopping at Tower Records before they went under.
316372	317973	And maybe Virgin Megastore once in a while.
317993	319674	Oh, Virgin was awesome for import CDs.
319694	322355	But now I have to admit... Who bought an activator at Virgin?
322516	324437	When I buy CDs, it's Best Buy.
325377	326478	Does that make me a bad person?
327098	328979	When I buy CDs, I don't rob.
329039	329919	I go on Amazon.
330659	332060	And I buy the mp3 downloads.
332960	335461	If I want them that badly.
335761	339603	Actually, this might make me really bad, but the last CD I bought was the Tron soundtrack.
339663	340543	I bought that at Target.
341587	342467	CeeLo Green's album for $5.
365957	369923	and they're all DRM free on top of it.
371426	378997	Now iTunes is too and you can convert from their format but it really is just super convenient to get it all on Amazon.
381940	387043	Yeah, I was playing some Final Fantasy 3 while I was waiting around for stuff.
387903	391905	And I started Oregon Trail today, and I'm like... Oh, the Facebook one?
392145	392805	I didn't like it.
392985	396307	I played it for like five seconds, and I was like, this just... This is overcomplicating it.
396327	397728	This game has died of dysentery.
398108	398708	Exactly.
398748	399789	I think that's the best way to put it.
399829	407873	No, the thing that gets it is that buying the tickets... Now, I'll just go download an Apple MU and play it that way.
408053	409053	The magic is gone.
409754	410654	The magic is kind of gone.
410754	412255	I have some friends that are into it on Facebook.
412275	412736	That's cool.
412776	413316	That's what you're into.
413336	414937	Look, I have no right to judge anyone.
415538	418781	I've been playing that Knights of the Clique game for forever, although I haven't touched it in like a week.
419481	420942	But I wasn't feeling Oregon Trail.
420962	422083	I'm three weeks clean on it, Rob.
422103	422624	Are you really?
423284	424826	You should get like a sober sticker for that.
424866	425686	That's amazing.
425987	427908	Good for you.
428248	429429	Rewinding to MMOs a bit.
429529	433633	Look, I don't want to dwell on WoW too much, but I will tell you one thing I've kind of been looking at.
433693	438577	As a lot of Warcraft players and other MMO players have been looking at, there's this new game coming out called Rift.
438857	440178	Have you read at all about this game?
440558	443841	Is it like based off of the tabletop rifts?
444181	445663	I'm not sure because I don't know enough.
445683	446343	Like the Palladium games?
446523	447945	I don't know enough about that scene.
448285	451768	But look at some of the YouTubes on Rift and tell me what you think.
452288	455050	Also, while you're at it, look at videos because we were doing this the other night.
455130	457693	Look at videos for Guild Wars 2 and tell me what you think.
457933	459995	I played Guild Wars for a while.
460015	462096	Guild Wars 2, much different than Guild Wars 1.
462717	467140	Take a look and see if either of those might woo you from WoW for a little bit.
467521	467641	So...
467990	471473	Well, it better not, because Dan doesn't want to buy any more games.
472374	475457	Well, the good news is Rift has an open beta starting really, really soon.
475897	476698	This does look pretty.
477038	478159	Take a look at those while we talk about it.
478179	479720	Look at some of the videos on YouTube.
479881	482283	Especially some of the PvP looks really pretty.
482503	484084	I know you're not into PvP, but it has both.
484304	485305	I've started doing PvP.
485465	485886	Have you really?
485906	486707	Well, I've done the battles.
487667	489169	I need to get you back on Horde House to talk about that.
489249	494994	Because our friend and listener got me PvP gear.
495799	496319	Good times.
497460	498801	Let's move on to Loki.
498841	499562	How was your gaming week?
500462	501683	Didn't play a whole lot this week.
502163	504225	Mainly just a few things.
504725	508388	Sword and Poker 2, still playing that in iOS.
509128	513311	This last dungeon is taking forever, but it's fun still.
513931	520296	I just unlocked more weapons I can buy, but they're really expensive, so I have to grind some more dungeons for that.
521316	548128	um and then I played um Marvel vs Capcom 3 a little bit of that um yeah that too that's an awesome awesome awesome game um I'm not very good at those types of games but it is somewhat button masher friendly I wouldn't say I'm just like a button masher but like I don't have any like real strategy into it you know it's just like okay I know the basic moves and stuff like that and
549707	550447	Let's see what happens.
550467	551268	You know, feel it out.
552368	554129	No, like, 50 hit combos for me or anything like that.
554149	555369	Did you say you're just feeling it up?
555789	556530	Feeling it out.
556930	557270	Okay.
557390	561212	I was going to say, because there's some pretty, you know, boobtastic characters in there.
563212	565253	And then, you know, Grand Theft Auto.
565773	567594	It's, you know, usual.
567674	568495	That's a must for you.
568735	569215	Exactly.
569775	571256	Well, we play that at work.
571496	574437	So, you know, obviously, we can play more of that.
576437	580959	I think it's being sued because of the name.
580999	581619	So there's a
605649	606269	DeadPixelLive.com
633444	636708	How did he get all these big name interviews when we weren't looking?
636728	637429	That's pretty awesome.
637709	638069	Good for you.
639030	639431	Let's see.
639831	642514	Chat.orange.com for more comments here.
642634	646358	Ziba is saying, I am loving Rift and can't wait for Guild Wars 2.
646639	648281	So both those games are getting a lot of buzz.
648621	653326	And of course, everybody's always going to ask, which one of these is going to be the WoW killer?
654147	655188	Probably neither.
655929	656309	You know what?
656390	659233	I will tell you what the WoW killer will ultimately be.
659413	660214	I can already tell you.
660514	661535	I will look at my crystal ball.
661595	663698	I will tell you what game is the WoW killer.
663798	664178	You ready?
664198	664418	WoW 2?
664919	665139	No.
665439	665720	WoW.
667321	667602	Yeah.
667722	669103	WoW is the WoW killer.
669724	670885	Wait and see.
671766	673048	That sounds very suicidal.
674045	677269	Well, no, because, well, who?
677549	678871	How did the Roman Empire fall?
678951	679972	Because of the Roman Empire.
681093	685999	More to quote an old Loki quote, an old, old Loki quote, Ow!
686479	688021	I just shot myself in the foot.
688642	690144	Why are you shooting me in the foot?
690424	691225	Rob, can I pet this?
692353	693794	Oh, is that Guild Wars 2 now you're looking at?
693814	694174	Yes.
695094	697635	That makes for great radio, by the way, when you're sitting there going, ooh, pretty.
697655	701436	You should post some of those links in chat just so people can take a peek for themselves.
701616	702917	No, you have to imagine it.
703517	708359	This place makes Stormwind look like an easy-to-navigate one-lane street.
709339	709619	All right.
709999	712200	Let me talk about my gaming week and some of the games I play this week.
713060	714561	Mostly the same type of stuff.
714601	718042	It's been somewhat of a slow month in gaming, just like it has been movies.
718062	719442	There's not been a lot of new stuff.
719482	720883	So, you know, more WoW, yeah, okay.
721503	722543	But I did play one new game.
722763	726484	One game kind of came out and it was kind of one of those blink and you might have missed it games.
726984	734326	I played You Don't Know Jack, the brand new game that just came out from THQ with Jellyvision, of course, who made the old You Don't Know Jack.
734566	738726	So maybe it's not really a brand new game because it's more like, hey, remember the 90s?
739046	740687	Because these games were huge in the 90s.
740727	746588	You Don't Know Jack and You Don't Know Jack the Ride, which I want to say originally was a Sierra thing.
747168	748349	I could be wrong on that.
748429	750631	Somebody might correct me on that in the chat room.
750911	752873	But that could explain why the long hiatus.
753613	760018	But regardless of how it happened, THQ has now put out a You Don't Know Jack game for the current generation of consoles.
760058	760799	And it's everywhere.
761019	765963	It's PC, it's 360, PlayStation, it's everywhere.
767083	777585	and the 360 is the version I played and I was at a little party with some friends last night and we were playing the new You Don't Know Jack game and the good news is it is pretty much what I remember.
777805	781066	It is a funny, quick, polished trivia game.
781506	784286	Lots of jokes, just kind of like one after the other.
784646	787527	That almost kind of dry sense of humor.
787567	794468	I don't want to say British sense of humor, not that dry, but just really like non-stop pun after pun and there's these weird jokes
794688	795269	Kitties Kitten
821488	823270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
842791	844592	You can also download expansions.
844692	846193	I believe three are planned right now.
846333	847053	One is up already.
847133	849014	Ten more episodes for five bucks.
849154	850795	So that is 50 cents an episode.
851336	859100	So the value of this game, I would really ask you, how much value are you going to get in like a party atmosphere?
859460	864783	Now the good news is you can play this on Xbox Live, but I think this would be the absolute worst game
865003	868345	Possible game you could play on Xbox Live with strangers.
868705	869226	I really do.
869326	877230	I think it would suck all the fun out of the game because you know you're going to have people out there with a finite number of episodes who already know the answers to all the questions and so on.
877531	879832	I just think that part, it might be a little bit ridiculous.
879972	884235	However, playing with trusted friends, I think it could be a great Xbox Live game.
884635	889518	So, one of those, and of course when I say Xbox Live, obviously the PlayStation has this comparable thing.
889778	890799	PC does not.
891339	892260	Which I find very interesting.
892340	893420	That's why the PC version is only $20.
893460	893500	So...
895121	895922	Even more value there.
896282	901405	And also, I mean, there's not a lot of people that would play that multiplayer on a PC.
901445	903486	Wouldn't that be kind of hard to play that multiplayer on a PC?
903506	903546	No.
903956	905957	Not really, it's where I play my WoW.
906197	910020	Yeah, but I meant like, you know, with friends, you know what I mean?
910360	913982	There's no real, you're not going to have like four controllers or something like that, you know?
914182	916264	Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying.
916324	919346	Yeah, it's a little tough there, I guess.
919906	922167	I don't own the PC version, so I don't know how they do it.
922227	923768	I don't know if you can have little buzzers or whatever.
924148	930813	I do hear, though, on the PlayStation 3 version, you can use the actual game buzz controllers, and you don't know Jack, which is nice.
931193	931593	That's cool.
931833	933014	Get a little more use out of those things.
933955	961376	I think single player will only be funny for so long the good news is it is a funny game so you'll get your lols out of it but I think the game works best in a party atmosphere so I think the question would really be are you going to be able to bring this to a party and get use out of this if so it might be worth your money I think it's been mildly successful so far it sold okay but it's something I could figure that will probably drop in price relatively quickly
961576	962957	Something to keep in the back of your mind.
963317	965678	The way they did the episodes is a little weird.
966198	970399	If you take your game from place to place, you're more likely to see repeats.
971040	972080	So just be careful.
972500	979303	If you really want to be smart, copy your game data to a memory card or a USB stick if you're going to take the game from place to place.
979703	982184	That way the game remembers what episode you've already seen.
982304	984305	Otherwise, you're really setting yourself up for repeats.
984725	988646	The game is pretty good about knowing which episodes you've already seen, especially if you're going to go on Xbox Live.
989146	994527	But if you take it from one place to another, it's not going to know because it's a new Xbox, right?
994827	996208	And there's nothing to read from.
996588	1001909	So you're going to see repeats because you only have so many episodes in the beginning.
1002289	1003590	So I just kind of want to throw that out there.
1003690	1004830	Just a word of caution.
1005150	1006510	The way they did that is a little weird.
1007791	1008831	So you don't know Jack.
1009631	1014657	Very polished, very funny, constant giggles from the group we were playing with.
1015118	1016239	I think it's a good value.
1016660	1025410	You know, 50 cents for a game is, you know, gosh, you go to Dave & Buster's and throw away money faster than that on those stupid crane games or skeeball or whatever.
1025791	1026812	So I think it's a decent value.
1026832	1026872	Um...
1028073	1055465	maybe a few more questions for the buck or maybe a different way to randomize them or something maybe could be the feedback but I will save that for You Don't Know Jack 2 which I do hope happens at this point or whatever they're going to end up calling it so I definitely give the game a favorable review especially if you like these game show games this blows that seen it shit out of the water like seriously this is the definitive trivia party game
1056145	1059450	The only possible contender maybe is Buzz on the PS3.
1059490	1061032	And if you have the Xbox, you don't really have that.
1061373	1063336	So this blows that Cena shit out of the water.
1063596	1064277	This is much better.
1064717	1065639	So, take a look.
1066500	1068403	Anyhow, that was really it for my gaming week.
1069705	1072567	So, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
1074428	1074888	Some housekeeping.
1074908	1077950	There was some, I don't want to say late-breaking news, but it just happened a little earlier.
1078330	1080151	We're competing against the Grammys tonight.
1080291	1081972	You know, last week it was the Stupor Bowl.
1082292	1083333	Tonight it's the Grammys.
1083413	1085114	In two weeks it's what, the Oscars?
1085214	1086395	It's like, we just can't fucking win.
1086415	1087335	Yeah, but no one cares about the Oscars.
1087355	1088336	Everything is on Sunday.
1089256	1090777	All the good stuff's going to be on YouTube.
1090817	1093799	If you want to see Gaga hatch out of an egg, it'll be on YouTube later.
1094358	1098921	I need to think of a good name to call the Grammys because I have the Super Bowl.
1099341	1099562	Yeah.
1099862	1102744	So Grammys should be the Shamys.
1103124	1104265	I don't know.
1105145	1107687	I like Kathy Griffin's The Shmemys or whatever she calls it.
1107707	1108928	Well, that's for the daytime Emmys.
1108968	1109388	Yeah, exactly.
1109448	1111750	Or the technical ones or whatever.
1111850	1116673	Anyway, besides, by the way, speaking of Kathy Griffin, just because I love that bitch, I got to give a shout out.
1116973	1118994	Did you hear she's going to have a brand new show on Broadway?
1119215	1119495	Really?
1119595	1122717	It's only going to be on for like a week in March, but it's called, ready?
1122757	1123718	Best name for a show ever.
1123818	1123998	Ready?
1124518	1125739	Kathy Griffin wants a Tony.
1128841	1129141	Anyhow.
1130542	1132083	But this isn't the Kathy Griffin podcast.
1132123	1132644	I digress.
1132664	1133144	I love her.
1133564	1134625	She's just really fucking funny.
1135105	1137787	I will listen to her stand up while I play WoW.
1137927	1139768	I listen to a lot of random stuff while I play WoW.
1139788	1141109	I listen to podcasts while I play WoW.
1141970	1144091	I listen to WoW podcasts while I play WoW.
1144151	1144611	It's very meta.
1144631	1145752	The whole thing is very meta.
1146212	1147553	Anyway.
1147653	1150615	Like when I was in Blade's Edge and we were on Blade's Edge.
1151056	1151336	Yes.
1151716	1152256	Very meta.
1152957	1153057	Okay.
1155455	1156036	What was I going to say?
1156116	1156777	Oh yeah, the Grammys.
1157558	1158679	That song won a Grammy.
1158759	1162905	The Baba Yetu from Civilization IV, which is a really great song.
1162945	1164807	If you've never heard it, I'll have to fire up a clip here.
1164827	1165928	I wasn't really prepared to play it.
1165968	1166129	Oops.
1166429	1170054	It won a Grammy, which is funny because the song is actually kind of old.
1170174	1170554	Like it's...
1171275	1176599	It's been out for a little while because Civilization 4 was kind of what it was written for, but here's how it works.
1177019	1179201	You see, it didn't win for being in Civilization 4.
1179941	1191549	The artist, Christopher Tin, put it in his recent CD that he released, and the CD, the song from the CD won, and I believe he actually won a Grammy for the whole CD as well.
1191789	1192930	He won two Grammys tonight.
1193230	1194691	So here's a clip if you've never heard this.
1195972	1205875	Seriously, if you haven't played Civilization 4, A, you're missing one of the best PC games ever, and B, you haven't had a chance to just sit on the title screen and listen to this.
1206375	1222200	Doesn't this song just kind of make you feel like, oh yeah, I'm going to rule the world?
1224090	1226331	This is going to be a military victory game.
1226471	1235076	Oh my god, this is offensive to Islam.
1235316	1235736	Shut up.
1236677	1237817	Oh, I'm sorry, that was a little big planet.
1238598	1239118	My mistake.
1240239	1240499	Anyhow.
1242099	1242620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1257358	1257558	Grammys
1275307	1277848	Alright, let's get into some more video game news tonight.
1277868	1281249	The stuff that's not late-breaking, but still is going on in the world of gaming this week.
1281529	1282709	Loki's going to start us off, as always.
1284430	1285750	Okay, so this is kind of funny.
1286110	1296973	Although it was fixed, and I'm sure that the person that runs Kevin Butler's fake account for the fake person probably didn't understand what was going on here.
1298055	1311405	But anyways, the person that ran the Kevin Butler on Twitter accidentally reposted the key for... Or one of the keys to the PlayStation 3.
1311505	1314768	Remember the whole lawsuit going on because the keys got leaked out?
1314848	1323735	Anyways, this is the key that turned out to be one used in the hack through the USB dongle, which I don't think anyone even really uses anymore, but...
1324655	1332060	Nonetheless, they retweeted, so let me guess, you sank my battleship, and then they retweeted the key.
1332080	1335542	4-6-D-C, oh, forget it.
1336203	1342547	Yeah, so, of course, you know, it was later removed off the Twitter account, but it is still funny.
1343247	1346930	Kind of like, oh, hey, someone's not paying attention.
1347390	1351473	Hopefully no one got fired over it, but, you know, still funny.
1352247	1360890	Well, if you don't know what it is, which I'm sure whoever runs this account on behalf of the Kevin Butler character probably didn't know what it was.
1361130	1364391	I mean, you know, if I didn't do this show, I wouldn't know what that is.
1364691	1368333	Actually, even doing this show, I would look at that and go, why is someone speaking to me in hex?
1368933	1369953	Like, what is your problem?
1369993	1372694	Exactly, and that doesn't even look, I mean, come on.
1373495	1376896	That does not look anything like battleship numbers.
1380069	1385693	Well, I mean, but if you're kind of that snarky character that Kevin Butler's supposed to be, it doesn't like that a little bit.
1387595	1390176	Huge Sony faux pas, or they'll get over it.
1390276	1396741	I think the funnier thing about this is that all these blogs are reporting on it with a screenshot of the tweet.
1397162	1401725	So now the tweet has been seen by like 10 times as many people as would have seen it originally.
1402806	1404487	I don't know why it's really funny, but it is.
1405854	1406434	Irony, Rob.
1406835	1407255	There you go.
1407355	1407615	Irony.
1408756	1412258	So, before we get into the next story, I got derailed by something in the chat room.
1412278	1413399	I just think this is kind of neat.
1413499	1416360	Like, I only have kind of heard of this.
1416521	1418382	Like, have you ever heard of this thing called GetGlue?
1419142	1421003	I've never... It's like a Foursquare.
1421544	1423485	Imagine like Foursquare for just stuff.
1424105	1425606	Like a video game you're playing.
1426466	1427227	You could check in.
1427287	1428708	I mean, you know...
1429048	1429829	You know how Foursquare works?
1429849	1433171	You check in to like... And then you cheat while you're driving by?
1433352	1436194	I'm at Pinkberry and I'm checking in so I can be the mayor.
1436674	1438676	And if my friends are nearby, I'll get a text message.
1438896	1442159	Well, now they have this thing called GetGlue where you can check into movies you're watching or whatever.
1442459	1445642	I just got told that Orange Lounge Radio has a GetGlue page.
1445662	1448604	And we have people that check in to listening to this on Sunday night.
1448644	1449705	I just thought that was really cool.
1450045	1451106	So I want to give a shout out to that.
1451126	1454529	So if you're listening to this on the podcast or whatever, you should check in on GetGlue.
1454869	1455190	Sweet.
1455210	1457712	That would be a nice way to help spread the word of OLR.
1458012	1463556	And I noticed that some of the related ones happen to be like All Games or Video Game Outsiders, which is also on the network.
1463616	1464296	It's just kind of funny.
1464316	1465677	And For Real.
1465737	1467939	Yeah, I've never... Who's For Real?
1467999	1473082	Is that the band from the 90s that did I Like to Move It, Move It?
1473443	1474543	Is that who For Real is?
1474624	1475124	I think it is.
1476165	1476645	I think it is.
1477506	1477726	All right.
1477746	1478206	Anyway, sorry.
1478246	1478987	I'm getting off track.
1480222	1481504	That's a little obscure, Rob.
1481524	1482486	It is very obscure.
1483267	1483527	Yes.
1483888	1489417	Well, it says they were on the... No, it's the one that did... It was a remix of something.
1489918	1490699	It was on Max.
1491300	1492662	I just don't remember what the hell it was now.
1497481	1500222	I'm telling you, for real, did I like to move it, move it.
1500242	1502323	This is so stupid that we're having this conversation.
1502423	1503403	Oh, Highs Off of You.
1503623	1504263	That's what it was.
1504403	1505443	Did that song, I guess.
1506384	1506824	Whatever.
1508404	1508985	Moving on.
1511485	1513286	Away from the 90s and into today.
1513826	1515707	Let's talk about the Xperia Play.
1515747	1519928	The Xperia Play is the Sony PlayStation phone, for lack of a better term.
1520268	1521189	This is basically what it is.
1521489	1522369	It's kind of cute.
1522449	1529331	It's like a little PlayStation Go, but this time it actually has a phone in it, so there's a lot of purpose to be getting this.
1530071	1531992	Xperia Play is, of course, the new smartphone.
1532252	1533733	It is coming out in early spring.
1533873	1536554	It will be on Verizon's network.
1536634	1537334	That's what they're saying.
1537905	1545151	There was a Sony Ericsson MWC 2011 press conference where this Xperia Play got its launch window.
1545291	1546832	It's going to be coming out in March.
1547312	1547773	The U.S.
1547933	1553157	will be one of the first destinations, and Verizon will be the first carrier for the phone.
1553437	1559742	They don't say that it will be the only carrier for the phone, just that it will be the first.
1560142	1564826	So it's been a pretty good year for Verizon so far between the iPhone and this, so...
1565253	1567654	Yeah, but carrier makes me think of a disease carrier.
1569155	1571135	I imagine some of the other carriers will be getting this too.
1571235	1574517	And for folks that are maybe like, I'm not feeling the iPhone.
1574597	1575477	I'm more of a gamer.
1575797	1579619	I think this is going to be a pretty good choice for them.
1579979	1588042	Now, by the way, just so you know, the Xperia Play, it's supposed to be preloaded with what they are saying is a legendary PlayStation 1 game.
1588442	1591263	It's also going to come with 50 different games from 20 publishers.
1591343	1591844	Not built in.
1591864	1592744	You're going to have to buy them.
1592984	1594886	But I think the legendary game is supposed to be Ridge Racer.
1595006	1595267	It is.
1596708	1598130	No, they're not saying that.
1598150	1600853	That's just according to Kaz Harai.
1601634	1603796	They haven't said exactly what the game is yet.
1605450	1606850	It's probably Ridge Racer.
1607491	1609491	It could be, but that would be a Namco game.
1609531	1609931	So I don't know.
1609951	1612372	I kind of think it would come from Sony's first party itself.
1612812	1613772	So I don't know.
1614573	1615973	Ridge Racer.
1616213	1619414	I'm going to be weird and say Twisted Metal.
1619474	1619954	I don't know why.
1620034	1623795	That just seems like an easy game to put there.
1624235	1624655	So we'll see.
1625656	1627016	I think it's going to be Gran Turismo.
1628388	1631930	I think it will be something from Sony in-house.
1632050	1633971	I don't think it's going to bring the third party into play.
1633991	1636292	It's going to be Irritating Stick.
1636913	1637333	Oh, I'm sorry.
1637993	1640034	I don't know why when you said that I thought Grand Theft Auto.
1641095	1642216	And I do that all the time.
1642336	1643756	No, but Grand Theft Auto should be on there.
1643977	1645457	Those two games couldn't be any more different.
1645477	1645758	You're right.
1645798	1647018	Gran Turismo would be a good choice.
1647498	1648299	It would be a very good choice.
1649259	1670884	uh just so you know most of the games that will be coming out for the device they are ports of course of other games i noticed uh there's actually a little guitar hero logo in here which is really funny considering what we're going to talk about in a minute uh but uh yeah some of the other games that will be there assassin's creed dead space battlefield fifa a multiplayer fifa game in mobile what's that
1672816	1680121	so, alright alright, well let's move on with some more news or actually wait, before we do, anyone gonna get one of these here in studio, anyone chat?
1680261	1682282	gonna pick up the experience?
1683122	1695070	I have a PSP I have a PSP, I have an iPhone and I'm locked into the iPhone contract, I can't go run out and get another phone I wouldn't care anyway, you know what, I keep getting flashbacks to the N-Gage and that was pretty bad
1696400	1698641	I think this will be better than the N-Gage though, let's be real.
1699601	1700701	Let's be for real.
1701201	1705322	If you want to play PlayStation 1 games on the go, just buy a PSP.
1705762	1710583	Hell, just buy a PSP 1000 and you can do it just as well.
1711783	1717065	Except you don't have the dual sort of analog sticks, you know what I mean?
1719185	1722406	If I want to play PS1 games on the go, I'll just bring my PS1 with me.
1723266	1723526	Amen.
1724270	1728471	and get a mobile monitor, which I think I've still got one somewhere.
1730092	1731732	I'm a little bit disgusted though, Rob.
1732773	1733193	Why is that?
1733593	1735614	Because about our next news story.
1736994	1737534	Disgusted.
1738174	1739215	Well, out with it.
1739255	1739755	What's going on?
1740828	1745494	Well, I'm sure many people know already, but the Hero franchise has gone BOOM!
1746856	1755147	Activision is discontinuing development of Guitar Hero for 2011 and disbanding their business unit.
1755928	1784977	and guess what else is included with that that's going to be DJ Hero as well they're not going to be releasing the new download content packs beyond what they already have and nothing new will be made however you can still download everything that's there now and basically they're saying that they've seen rapid declines in that genre but really I think that Rock Band does it better
1787194	1792579	Alright, well, I mean, let's be honest though, is this really a surprise?
1792919	1803449	No Uh, yes, it is a surprise because I would have thought they would have still tried to whore it out I mean, even if sales have dwindled a little bit, you know, why kill off the whole thing?
1804390	1808574	Well, I know why they killed off the whole thing It's because investors tell them what to do
1809778	1813140	Well, I mean, honestly, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, big surprise.
1813360	1814800	Like, you know, this was all over.
1814900	1817461	This news was so big it was on CNN.
1817702	1818722	It was all over Twitter.
1818742	1820943	It might have even been a trending topic for all I know.
1820963	1824565	But all these people were going, RIP Guitar Hero, dead and gone.
1824885	1825825	We hardly knew ye.
1825865	1826946	And it's kind of like, um...
1827606	1830107	Did anyone buy the last game in the series?
1830227	1832348	Did anyone buy Warriors of Rock?
1832528	1834909	I think we picked up the Green Day one for five bucks at Dimple.
1834969	1835649	That's Rock Band.
1835850	1837030	That's not even Guitar Hero.
1837050	1837730	Oh, not Green Day.
1838651	1841012	It was one of the... Van Halen, Metallica?
1841272	1842792	Yeah, one of the... It was a...
1845402	1870752	Guitar Hero and let's be real five bucks for that Van Halen one is probably about all it's worth like it was really a terrible bad game it was an obvious milking of the franchise so bad that they gave it away free to inflate the numbers of the Guitar Hero 5 series so they could say hey look how many Guitar Hero units have sold for the franchise way more than Rock Band granted they had way more versions come out than Rock Band so
1874335	1879960	It's still disappointing, I mean, because I don't think that they're done.
1880240	1887847	I think they're done with this, but when they see an idea where they can make some money, they're going to go after it.
1888228	1898037	And I have a feeling that the next game they do is going to be similar to Dance Central, because I don't think they want to be out of the market, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a dance hero.
1899677	1903558	What's interesting is that I see some folks in chat, and of course, Black Wolf jumping in.
1903698	1907399	I bought Warriors of Ra, I knew there'd be somebody, there'd be like one person that bought it.
1907439	1914921	I mean, it didn't sell to zero copies, it sold some, but what I'm just saying is that this decline has been a little bit obvious for a while now.
1915061	1919382	I think a lot of people out there that were the same ones touting R.I.P.
1919422	1925263	Guitar Hero were kind of rolling their eyes a little bit at the franchise and how it kind of has gone the past couple games.
1925683	1929247	There's been nothing really that new in the series for a while now.
1929827	1932890	And I kind of hate to say it, but DJ Hero was going down a very similar path.
1933271	1940077	I mean, the last game in the series wasn't terrible, but I didn't see where there was really a future in DJ Hero either.
1941779	1948806	Well, unfortunately one of the things we weren't going to be talking about is how they were saying that their digital downloads were up 20%.
1950809	1951569	Thank you for watching!
1967642	1971286	If you're lucky, DJ Hero was, for the first one, was much worse.
1971326	1972007	It had five.
1972567	1975170	I think five packs come out, if that.
1975490	1989785	And then DJ Hero 2 had about the same within a relatively short time frame, but I don't... You know, we were talking a little bit how they're basically going to...
1992199	1999847	You know, cease putting out download content for, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff like that.
2000387	2006974	But honestly, I don't think anyone would have noticed if they stopped because they weren't really doing much to begin with.
2008656	2011299	So, it's kind of, kind of sucked.
2011399	2014342	But, you know, they really kind of let that slip through their hands.
2015723	2021266	Yeah, I mean, again, I just don't think the series was kind of going anywhere.
2021286	2023347	It just was kind of on a one-track direction.
2023447	2027689	And again, I really challenge a lot of these developers to innovate.
2028129	2031051	That is how you're going to keep your games more interesting.
2031651	2032952	Well, but see, here's the thing.
2033032	2036714	Rock Band, I mean, it's the last band standing, so to speak.
2037114	2044438	But unfortunately, they didn't really innovate enough, I guess, with Rock Band 3 with the keyboard and everything.
2044458	2044838	How do you mean?
2045178	2048361	or they're not marketing it well enough, I guess.
2048661	2050863	It's not selling as well as the last one, period.
2051483	2052104	That's what I mean.
2052904	2053204	Okay.
2053765	2057588	Well, I'm just saying, you know, because you're saying they didn't innovate.
2058749	2059429	Let me take a step back.
2059469	2062372	Maybe they innovated, but they're not letting people know that so well.
2063272	2068715	I don't really see a lot of Rock Band 3 being marketed as now you can really learn to play an instrument.
2068995	2071217	You can really learn to play keyboard.
2071557	2075499	It wasn't on the daytime talk shows like I kind of thought it would be and so on.
2076239	2076579	I don't know.
2078220	2078501	I'm sorry.
2078521	2080762	I'm not trying to say that Rock Band hasn't really innovated.
2080862	2088306	I think it's done certainly more than Guitar Hero did, which is why it is now standing alone, so to speak.
2088886	2091027	Although I don't think there'll be a Rock Band 4 this year.
2092668	2096950	I would go so far as to say there's not going to be another rock band until there's another series of consoles.
2097730	2098250	But we'll see.
2098270	2099471	Anything's possible.
2099531	2105473	I honestly think it would be smart to support the current rock band and just put out more content.
2106033	2107913	Well, that's definitely what they're doing.
2107954	2108394	I mean, there's...
2109574	2117743	I honestly don't think there is a need to put out a new console game because their business model right now is just putting out tons of content for it.
2118283	2119785	So why do you need a new version?
2120325	2124670	They're making money that way and on top of that it is fairly cost effective.
2125632	2127593	because Activision's plan was kind of the opposite.
2127993	2134356	Well, we'll force them to buy a new copy of the game or a new version of the game because we're not going to put out a lot of content for it.
2134456	2138398	So the only way you're going to get new content is by spending the $60 to buy a brand new game.
2139939	2141940	Some interesting questions from chat here.
2141980	2148703	DDR Dollar Bill says, Guitar Hero started doing the DDR type scene where they made new songs but didn't advance the series much.
2149103	2153105	Kind of interesting though, DDR is still alive to tell the tale, so to speak.
2153285	2155066	DDR is still kickin'.
2155615	2161999	Yeah, DDR and Konami also promised that they're going to support DDR with tons of download content and they never fucking do.
2162480	2163801	Or for Karaoke Revolution.
2164021	2167643	Never had a ton of download content on a regular basis like they promised.
2167783	2174328	I'm thinking also DDR probably has a much lower budget than the Guitar Hero games and I don't think there's as high of an expectation there.
2174728	2177910	And I think in the end that's what's kept DDR going all these years.
2177950	2178891	And the weight loss thing.
2178991	2180712	Everybody thinks they're going to lose weight playing DDR.
2181112	2181673	DarkSakura.com
2199489	2201090	Let me bring up this other comment from our chat room.
2201170	2210376	Ezam in our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com says, although I think a good question here is, can Konami take advantage of the void and try to get Guitar Freak's Drum Mania stateside?
2210676	2213197	And my answer is a resounding giant no.
2214678	2216299	I'm going to be bluntly honest with you.
2216819	2217600	I don't want him to do it.
2218080	2219081	I don't want him to do it.
2219521	2221202	I don't think the games are as good as Guitar Hero.
2221502	2221822	I said it.
2222362	2224263	Might make you mad, but let's be real.
2224404	2224864	Well, no.
2225144	2226445	People are not going to get those games here.
2226465	2228646	Konami missed that whole thing.
2228846	2231307	And two words, rock revolution.
2231667	2235009	That was their attempt to bring those games stateside and don't think it wasn't.
2235909	2236410	And it was a...
2237270	2238810	Hot Mess to say nice.
2238850	2240451	Let me put it this way, and I put it in my Twitter.
2241131	2251254	If they want a second attempt at the guitar games and stuff like that, if you put out a decent release now, it might actually work because you're not going to have a lot of competition.
2251314	2254635	Granted, you're going to have rock bands competition, but you got to...
2256643	2265490	We tell our customers that we have... There's tons of people trying to get into the video game or movie market and stuff like that and people that want to sell on eBay and stuff.
2266090	2272275	And we tell them, you've got to have a niche because you're competing with people that have been established in the business for a long time.
2272375	2274337	Well, same with the music game genre.
2274777	2275678	You've got to have a niche.
2275878	2280381	Obviously, you're not going to be able to compete with the large library that Rock Band has.
2280841	2282743	You're going to need to come up with either...
2283223	2286967	Original songs, which granted, Konami is great at original songs.
2287588	2289129	Konami originals are just awesome.
2289189	2294855	And they have, for guitar games, they have a huge library of stuff that they can put in there.
2296677	2297778	A lot of people in the U.S.
2297838	2304004	may not necessarily get it or be really enthusiastic about some of that stuff, but
2304244	2329487	so what, just put it in the game as well and put some good licensed songs from the US in there and maybe don't fuck up the interface system with grey buttons or your stupid drum controller nobody wants to use just use the peripherals that are out there now, put out some good software and that's it and hell, call Guitar Freaks because you know what, you've got that franchise you have the rights to that, why not?
2331161	2337965	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, if Konami were to kill DDR, OLR and the rest of the computer would go on a rampage and go on a global-sized boycott.
2338485	2339746	No, not really.
2340286	2341107	To be honest, no.
2341367	2344549	I'm kind of surprised that news hasn't already come out.
2344709	2351853	Like, not to be a pessimist, I know a lot of you still love your DDR, but I'm going to be just, let's not mince words here.
2352073	2354154	It's not the same game I loved 10 years ago.
2356212	2356973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2373726	2374826	Yeah, that was terrible.
2374926	2376847	And it was created by an algorithm.
2376867	2380868	There wasn't actually any original steps for that.
2381208	2382608	And you couldn't make edits for those.
2382869	2385529	And they wanted you to buy four fucking pads for that.
2386269	2387750	Sorry, that's not gonna happen.
2389210	2390711	Anyway, back to the Activision news.
2390751	2396652	I will say, I'm a tiny bit sad that means there's probably not gonna be that DJ Hero game on the 3DS.
2397072	2402414	I mean, I don't know if that's already in the can, so to speak, but I am assuming that's not happening at this point.
2402984	2403785	and that's it.
2403805	2409611	It would have been interesting to see that like in the portable market and the whole 3D thing, but oh well.
2410191	2412713	Probably would have just been a cheap knockoff of the console games anyway.
2413234	2413494	Oh well.
2413815	2414255	What can you do?
2415836	2418279	Anyhow, Loki, what else you got for us?
2419823	2423065	Well, we're going to talk a little bit more about Activision and the fun stuff.
2423505	2425726	Of course, they're reducing their headcount by 500.
2425966	2429867	I think you can kind of guess where that's coming from.
2432048	2437270	And they're saying they're making significant investments elsewhere.
2437811	2448635	Our net headcount at the end of the year is probably not going to be materially different given that we're ramping up development teams around Blizzard's new MMO and around Call of Duty initiatives.
2449232	2454295	Yes, because you have to understand this is why Guitar Hero and the whole Hero franchise went away.
2454656	2468525	It's because I can sink, you know, if I'm Activision, I can sink, you know, say $50 million into, you know, a couple Guitar Hero games and maybe not make quite as much money back.
2468645	2470106	Maybe I'll make back my investment.
2470866	2476410	Or I can sink $50 million into a couple Call of Duty games and they're going to sell like hotcakes.
2476530	2478612	So that's where they're going to put their money.
2479672	2485455	Um, and then this is the other thing that didn't really make any sense to me, but I guess, hey, you paid for the license, so why not?
2487777	2488497	Spider-Man!
2488577	2490998	There's gonna be another Spider-Man game.
2491519	2495100	Because, I don't know, the last Spider-Man game did so well.
2496501	2498242	Um, so they have that coming in 2011.
2498602	2503345	And also, I guess, two TV licensed titles as well.
2504185	2504285	Um...
2505606	2519878	They're saying that they're going to see a new Family Guy game, because, God, the last Family Guy game was so wonderful, and a Wipeout game, which, to be honest, they did have a Wipeout game already, and it was not good.
2520119	2524583	So... Awesome.
2524663	2525143	Way to go.
2526364	2529367	That's totally awesome, just to keep that shit around, and...
2531195	2537877	Well, I mean, there is that new Spider-Man movie that's coming out, what, next year or whatever, the one they're filming right now with the whole, the reboot.
2538117	2540158	Yeah, but this is just based on that, though.
2540578	2541138	Really?
2541458	2545099	Yes, because this is just, it's going to be like Shattered Dimensions or something.
2545119	2545699	Oh, I would have thought.
2546840	2557823	Kind of going back to this, I was actually reading, there was a letter to, well, I guess, a letter from the editor and the newest Game Informer that, this is obviously before the whole Guitar Hero stuff went down,
2558403	2559024	Thanks for watching!
2574036	2575898	Why the fuck are you trying to make a Bond game?
2576318	2582324	The Bond franchise has kind of lost its appeal years ago.
2583005	2590072	And this is a game that not necessarily this company would be good to make a title for.
2590172	2591774	Maybe a good racing game instead.
2591934	2621030	well I don't know about the because honestly I thought that first Daniel Craig Bond movie Casino Royale which a couple years ago was really good it was like it was a nice swift kick in the pants a lot of people were very skeptical about it it was really good but I think the biggest problem was that they were putting out a Bond game when Bond wasn't really in people's minds because Quantum of Solace didn't do as well and some would argue it probably wasn't as good of a movie either and this new Bond game Bloodstone or whatever it was called came out like two years after that like people were not thinking about James Bond
2621710	2622931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2637200	2637781	They knew it.
2638661	2640782	And so they just kind of set him up to fail and they got rid of him.
2642343	2644185	By the way, there is a new Bond movie now coming out.
2644205	2645986	They finally confirmed they're going to do a new Bond movie.
2646006	2648447	Hopefully it'll be as good as Casino Royale was.
2649008	2651569	And I wonder who's going to make the game tie in for that one.
2651589	2654231	Oh, it's going to be Activision because they had the lights to the Bond franchise.
2655092	2656673	But how did Goldeneye end up doing for them?
2657321	2658741	That did okay, I think.
2658781	2659041	Did it?
2659121	2659822	But, I mean, come on.
2659882	2661062	It's just Goldeneye.
2661162	2663842	All it is is Goldeneye re-skinned with Daniel Craig on it, and that's it.
2663942	2666383	It probably sold more than the other one, sadly.
2666403	2666883	It probably did.
2666903	2668383	But that's not Bizarre's fault?
2668563	2669644	No, it's not Bizarre's fault.
2670184	2673485	Bizarre's fault, or there was really no fault to them anyways.
2673525	2682827	Yeah, they could have made the game as great as possible, but when you put it out a week before fucking Call of Duty comes out, no one's going to pay attention to that.
2682847	2684527	They're going to be like, fuck that, I'm getting Call of Duty.
2686215	2693840	The biggest problem, I think, with Blur is that it came out the exact same time as Split Second and Mod Nation Racers.
2694261	2695622	And people just didn't want to buy all those racers.
2695662	2696703	And Red Dead Redemption.
2697763	2700926	So, I mean, Blur, I'm sure, was a pretty good game.
2701126	2701286	It was.
2701306	2704428	But it's just tiny.
2704648	2706169	And Activision, I don't think, cares.
2706590	2706770	Yeah.
2710810	2711570	It's frustrating.
2711871	2718252	Oh, and by the way, I don't remember if this was mentioned before, but remember that Seven Studios, the one that put out that game Scratch?
2718292	2720332	Well, yeah, Activision bought them and then dissolved them.
2721453	2723493	Did Scratch even ever come out?
2723533	2728334	Nope, it never came out because they bought the studio and then they fired them all.
2728634	2730575	So that's awesome.
2731035	2731835	Way to go, Activision.
2731855	2733216	Way to get rid of your competition.
2733256	2734356	That's something.
2735456	2736537	All right, well, geez.
2737037	2740420	Oh, and then one more thing I was going to mention, too.
2741300	2744202	One other thing they said they weren't going to put out this year, a new Tony Hawk game.
2744242	2747765	Because the last two Tony Hawk games were terrible, so finally they learned a little bit.
2748325	2749646	No new Tony Hawk game this year.
2750087	2752508	All they need to do is go back to Pro Skater, and they'd be just fine.
2754370	2754670	All right.
2755351	2759954	I see you talking in our chat room, DarkSakura, to the listeners about James Bond.
2760399	2765060	Yeah, we were discussing, a couple of us had the same first Bond movie we saw in the theater.
2765600	2766600	That was A View to a Kill.
2766620	2767901	The 80s one, right, yeah.
2768241	2770861	With Duran Duran doing the intro and Grace Jones.
2771102	2772202	Grace fucking Jones.
2772542	2772962	I love her.
2772982	2775323	Fierce, fierce human being.
2775543	2776823	Just like, vicious.
2776863	2778843	She's next to the word fierce.
2778883	2780004	She invented fierce.
2780464	2781244	There is no other.
2781884	2785145	When you look in the dictionary, there's actually no words.
2785185	2788186	It just automatically links you mentally to Wikipedia about her.
2790226	2791588	You know what?
2791868	2796213	That's how Bizarre could have sold a million billion of the Bond game.
2796253	2797554	Just make it all about Grace Jones.
2798014	2798395	There you go.
2799537	2801679	Now I have to go on Wikipedia and look up Grace Jones.
2801899	2803180	Alright, let's move on.
2803200	2805482	You know how they sold a ton of games?
2805842	2806062	What?
2806883	2807883	Super Smash Bros.
2807944	2808324	Bond.
2809044	2811006	That'd be awesome.
2811386	2812767	Getting a little silly now.
2813388	2816090	Hey, the Xbox Live House Party is coming very soon.
2816130	2821514	You might remember this is the whole little let's do the Summer of Arcade promotion at a different time in the year.
2821754	2824957	You know, seriously, they need to host this with Kid and Play.
2825017	2825277	I mean...
2826838	2828399	I'm sorry.
2828419	2832302	They need to dig them out of wherever rehab center they're in.
2832622	2835704	I apologize if I've taken someone's story later.
2835744	2836284	I don't think I am.
2836304	2837405	I don't think this is coming up tonight.
2837425	2850114	But there's been more and more furious rumors this week that Xbox is planning on launching a TV network within Xbox, which some time ago Conan was wooed to be a part of before they decided to stick with something a little more traditional.
2851515	2855837	It would not be beyond all reason that Kid and Play could do some type of...
2856878	2857538	House Party
2878627	2878908	WolfGirl
2893653	2894194	Sounds like such crap.
2894214	2896436	And apparently she was in Pee Wee's Playhouse Christmas Special.
2897076	2897357	Awesome.
2897557	2898698	And in the Beastmaster.
2898718	2900359	Look, can I talk about the house party?
2900419	2906045	I realize Grace Jones was not invited to the house party, but I still want to talk about some of the awesome games that are coming out.
2906105	2908187	It all starts this week, February 16th.
2908267	2909508	The first release comes out.
2909848	2912210	Hardcore Uprising comes out first.
2912891	2915213	It's a game that is kind of like Contra.
2915573	2918256	It's really, really like Contra, but it's not.
2918536	2918796	$15 for that.
2919077	2919457	Bejeweled
2919517	2920197	Blitz Blitz Blitz Blitz
2948277	2950918	DarkSakura, what else you got for us besides links to Grace Jones' Wikipedias?
2950938	2952118	Oh, now I'm reading about Studio 54.
2952158	2952198	Um...
2977384	2982147	Well, according to EA, 7% of mobile gaming is done on the toilet.
2983948	2989432	They did some research, and this is actually from EA Mobile.
2990353	2998878	They basically said there were five different percentages of when people tend to play their games.
2999259	3002481	And also went over some myths.
3003041	3006904	So according to the research, 47% of the time is people playing at home.
3008204	3017107	12% of that time is during a commute, 14% while at work, 7% in the restroom, and 3% during school hours, and 1% at the airport.
3017347	3022608	Actually, we have a clip of DarkSakura playing on her mobile phone here.
3022628	3022968	Hold on.
3022988	3024688	Sitting on the toilet.
3026129	3027089	Sitting on the toilet.
3028569	3030990	Sitting on the toilet.
3031030	3032030	Sitting on the toilet.
3033431	3034411	Sitting on the toilet.
3037273	3037713	No.
3038274	3039294	Sitting on the toilet.
3040755	3041735	Sitting on the toilet.
3043236	3044177	Sitting on the toilet.
3045017	3046578	Sitting on the toilet.
3046838	3049079	That's enough of that, Rob.
3050240	3054342	There actually was a shirt that I almost got one time that says iPhone changed the way I pee.
3058084	3058904	I thought that was pretty funny.
3059024	3064567	I admit I used to play my phone sometimes at work, but
3065163	3070386	I think this one might have actually been a little more appropriate for mobile gaming Now flush
3090768	3091851	Can I be real though?
3092272	3092994	Let's be real.
3094017	3095722	I'm kind of surprised the number isn't higher.
3098448	3101751	I think that's people who admit to it.
3102692	3104093	Namco is having a sale right now.
3104333	3109958	A variety of companies are having iPhone game sales right now where you can get a lot of pretty good iPhone games really cheap.
3110018	3112560	And one of the games I bought this week was Pac-Man Championship Edition.
3113200	3116763	And it's a pretty faithful translation.
3116803	3120206	Controls could be a little better with actual tangible buttons, but whatever.
3120546	3123949	But I'll tell you, I probably played most of that game.
3125390	3144166	I play a lot of Solitaire on the toilet I will freely admit this, my toilet game of choice is Solitaire And reading my Facebook Loki, what's your favorite mobile game to play on the pooper?
3145227	3147409	I don't play games on the toilet Really?
3147950	3150272	Really, I don't What do you do, you just sit there and think?
3151286	3152426	Thanks for watching!
3172682	3173163	I don't need-
3185547	3193414	Okay, okay, there is one other game that actually I did play extensively in the bathroom and that was Angry Birds.
3195456	3198318	And Dan walked by the bathroom and hearing the tweet noises.
3198719	3200760	He's like, are you playing that game in there again?
3201081	3201461	Yes.
3202622	3205304	So, Angry Birds on the toilet.
3209228	3209328	Ah.
3211306	3213007	But hey, how about those other myths, by the way?
3213748	3215950	The myth, the top mobile games are all casual.
3218559	3224982	No, they said that their biggest performers, there was Epyx, Infinity Blade, and Dead Space, which were at the top of the App Store.
3225682	3229203	And that one size game fits all platforms, and not so.
3230023	3237546	Because the Android ones are specifically having to be redone for working on Android.
3238887	3239927	And brands don't matter.
3240167	3241368	And he says, yeah, they do.
3241448	3242888	The top iPhone games are all brands.
3243909	3245189	And this is as good as it gets.
3245589	3246850	And he said, no, there's going to be better.
3248988	3249588	Rob told me to.
3278058	3279640	There's not a lot coming out this week.
3280361	3281783	I will cut you.
3283565	3287531	I will put that sitting on the toilet on repeat and blast it.
3288252	3290034	Alright, sorry about that, Loki.
3290114	3290695	Very rude of us.
3290835	3291396	No, no problem.
3292229	3298336	Tomorrow, we have Dragon Quest VI Realms of Revelation coming out on the Nintendo DS, which is pretty cool.
3298976	3312209	If you're looking for a game with anthropomorphic consoles, because they have Hyperdimension Neptunia, the special edition with an art book in there.
3312850	3321255	They have chicks not really resembling consoles, but representing different consoles in that game.
3321415	3323016	Man, it's like the console wars for real.
3323336	3323997	That's on PlayStation 3.
3325538	3332242	Brunswick Pro Bowling on the Xbox 360 with Kinect, and that's going to be coming out this week as well.
3333082	3336885	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3336965	3340087	Definitely worth picking up that one.
3340167	3346852	Someone I know had it early because I have special connections in my new job.
3346912	3352936	The Gears of War Triple Pack is coming out this week in case you haven't played any of those games and you want to catch up before the new one comes out.
3353036	3353717	By the way, how is it?
3355123	3356144	Oh, Marvel vs. Capcom 3?
3356184	3356384	Yeah.
3356784	3357524	It's fucking awesome.
3357724	3358344	Okay.
3358485	3359265	It's awesome.
3359305	3360145	It's all about Deadpool.
3360465	3362506	He's just freaking sweet.
3362646	3369169	Oh, and by the way, Shu McGrath and Jill Valentine, unlock content.
3369489	3371230	There's a key for the download content.
3371350	3373671	It's not download content.
3373891	3374291	Of course.
3374672	3375732	It's paid unlock content.
3375852	3376733	Actually, I don't think it's paid.
3376833	3380974	I think it's just time delayed for people that don't have special editions.
3381154	3381915	Oh, alright.
3382395	3382675	Whatever.
3382995	3383636	But it may be paid.
3384316	3384516	Maybe.
3384738	3387181	We'll see.
3388223	3388423	Okay.
3388963	3389364	Other things.
3389524	3391587	Amnesia on PC coming out this week.
3391967	3395752	Dance Paradise on Xbox 360 and also supporting Kinect.
3395812	3396934	I hear it's terrible though.
3397975	3398616	Keep that in mind.
3404679	3415699	Dungeons on PC Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles I'm sorry that's actually getting to next week but that will be coming out on PSP next week or the week after next that's it
3417079	3421462	Alright, going on to Japanese release dates and what's coming out in Japan this week.
3421542	3425464	Well, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is getting its release in Japan this week as well.
3425504	3427505	That'll be out on the Xbox 360 this week.
3428586	3432768	Also on the 360 this week, Two Worlds 2, the Japanese version, and a game called Catherine.
3433408	3435550	This is a game from Atlus that is coming out.
3435650	3439552	It's the Personas Team first game for the HD system.
3439992	3440973	So it's about...
3441733	3445834	Vincent is a wishy-washy salaryman, a little too afraid to be tied down.
3446254	3451056	Facing the appeals of marriage from his longtime girlfriend Catherine, all he wanted to do was to escape.
3451356	3455437	And one night he succeeded into the arms of the beautiful young Catherine.
3455457	3461419	There's Catherine with a K and Catherine with a C. This sounds kind of weird, but it could be kind of awesome too.
3461459	3464700	It is a strategy game, and there's like these guys with sheep heads.
3464820	3465240	It's kind of weird.
3465260	3465701	It is fucking weird.
3465721	3466921	This looks like a scary game.
3467601	3470125	Like when you say Persona, I think, oh, it's going to be the Prinnies.
3470205	3471867	But no, this is like a freaking weird game.
3471887	3473309	No, it's a creepy, erotic game.
3474090	3474310	Sort of.
3474350	3474871	It's hot.
3477912	3479213	It's like Night Trap all over again.
3479233	3483876	Alright, moving on to the PlayStation 3 and the releases coming out over there.
3483996	3488258	On the PlayStation 3, of course, Catherine gets a release there as well, as well as Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3488899	3492841	Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is getting a price reduction this week, if you haven't checked that out.
3493341	3495943	And Two Worlds 2, also on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3496023	3498405	So, lots of cross-platform love this week.
3498785	3502567	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.
3502927	3504388	There is nothing on the Wii this week.
3504488	3505749	But next week, there's a Gundam game.
3506229	3507050	We'll get to that next week.
3507530	3508952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3530770	3557518	I don't know and on the Sony PSP if you're sad about Guitar Hero having gone under you might be a fan of this series DJ Max Portable 3 is a very big release for the music game fans this week on the PSP that is in regular and limited edition also Monochrome and My Mary May With Bee get price reductions this week that's really what it's called but DJ Max Portable 3 look at that
3558158	3564260	All the great K-pop songs in a Beatmania-esque style interface, but on your PSP.
3565281	3566421	Definitely a lot of cult fans.
3566441	3569362	There will be a lot of people listening to this show that import that game, I am sure.
3570162	3571383	That's it for Japanese release dates.
3571463	3574584	How about overseas in the old country?
3574960	3575500	A few things.
3576181	3581925	We have on the 16th, Hardcore Uprising on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3582625	3592131	And we also have on the 18th, Crash Time 4 for Xbox 360, Death Smiles, and then Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3592732	3594052	We also have PopCap hits.
3594893	3595994	Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3596874	3597775	And Death Smiles is pretty cool.
3598527	3600128	I think I know what a lot of people will be playing this week.
3600528	3601129	Death Smiles.
3601629	3601749	No.
3602830	3605251	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is totally worthy, by the way.
3606432	3606812	Oh, that's right.
3606832	3608533	You had a chance to check it out early too, huh?
3608593	3609013	What'd you think?
3609594	3609934	Worthy.
3611014	3614837	But Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting scheme not as great.
3615737	3616177	Interesting.
3616378	3616658	Really?
3617658	3621080	Yeah, I wasn't too fond of that when I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
3621421	3622341	It's very mash friendly.
3623582	3624462	Hey, sounds good for me.
3624522	3625283	I love button mashing.
3626328	3630030	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3630070	3630990	But we're not there just yet.
3631210	3631450	Loki.
3632811	3651719	Sony is claiming that the Gran Turismo Academy, one little event contest that they have going on right now where people race and report their times, I guess, in Gran Turismo 5 on different tracks for different specific categories, with a chance to win a spot as a real race driver.
3653058	3655299	Apparently they say round two was ruined by cheaters.
3656340	3659181	And it won't count, so they're moving everybody to round three.
3659581	3663583	But here's how they claim it was cheated.
3664184	3670627	Apparently the track has a nice little S turn in it, and so people were cutting corners in the track driving off-road.
3672608	3673649	You know, it's a design of the track.
3673689	3677551	It wasn't actually something that people used like a mod or something like that to cheat in.
3677591	3680472	They were just cutting corners off-road.
3681373	3681993	That's cheating?
3683444	3686806	Well, they're like, but in real racing, you would have gotten a penalty for that.
3687227	3691549	Well, maybe somebody that spent so long making their game... Well, then maybe the game should have penalized you.
3691589	3692110	Exactly.
3692350	3699335	Maybe if you had spent all that time, you know, perfecting your game, maybe you should have, I don't know, added a penalty for cutting the track like that.
3699695	3700455	It's interesting, though.
3700475	3708861	Like, I realize Gran Turismo is supposed to be, like, the real deal racing simulator and all that, but, like, games like Mario Kart and shit, and even things like Blur, you're kind of encouraged to do shit like that.
3708961	3709481	Or Burnout.
3709521	3710442	Especially Burnout.
3710962	3713204	Off-roading is encouraged and rewarded.
3713684	3714725	You know what I mean?
3714846	3715847	That game fuel.
3716187	3718089	That entire fucking game was off-roading.
3718109	3718590	You know what I mean?
3718830	3720271	It's not even a glitch.
3720552	3722254	I mean, it's just a part of the track.
3722274	3723395	You're cutting out the track.
3724622	3726803	Yeah, that seems a little silly.
3726984	3729365	It seems a little silly to throw the whole thing out because of that.
3730186	3731286	That's what I have to say about that.
3732027	3733548	I think your competition's stupid.
3733808	3740472	Although it's interesting because isn't the prize or whatever for winning the competition to race a real car?
3740492	3745396	And I hope that they race on that track with the S-curve and drive the fucker off-road because that would be hilarious.
3745416	3747417	Maybe they don't want people that are going to do that.
3748311	3749391	I'm gonna do that anyways.
3749672	3750512	That's what I would do.
3751252	3752913	I'd drive that thing straight into a wall.
3753393	3754533	Oh, expensive car.
3754673	3755534	Crash.
3755614	3758955	You might also get set on fire and I don't think you really want that.
3759235	3760296	You have a fire suit.
3760356	3761036	It's fine.
3763457	3764057	I don't know.
3765017	3768519	Oh, round three, though, does start on Monday, so whatever.
3769259	3771100	We'll see how people cheat on that real soon.
3771420	3771720	Yeah.
3772654	3776998	Alright, let's move on to some more stories for you guys.
3777018	3786427	And then we're going to get into the classic game of the week, which of course is DarkSakura diving into the vault and finding a game that she thinks you guys should be playing.
3786775	3787155	Dead Space 2
3812643	3826118	and unfortunately he's not able to walk forward with the mouse and you know this is kind of the bummer with a lot of games that have custom or don't have customizable controls is a lot of times they're customized really weird and people want to change them so
3827620	3828881	Dead Space 2, We Hear You, Steve Papautas
3850282	3851162	Sorry if I said that wrong.
3851742	3857424	Said that there will be a PC version patch enabling full control remapping.
3857924	3859545	It will be coming out soon.
3859925	3862025	There is some full remarks that were made.
3862485	3866887	The Dead Space 2 team is aware of the issue that disabled players are having with Dead Space 2 PC.
3867327	3877530	In fact, a number of folks on our team are so passionate about getting this fix done that they are currently working hard to allow players to remap key bindings to the mouse which should help disabled players enjoy the game.
3878610	3879250	That's very cool.
3879330	3882512	I'm glad that they listened, especially with that reason being in place.
3883093	3885534	A little silly it wasn't there the first time.
3886054	3889496	Hello, customizable controls is a very standard thing in this day and age.
3889897	3894559	However, maybe this lesson will help other developers learn it, right?
3895360	3897061	There's a lot of games, though, that really need to have...
3898767	3903210	I still... You remember how pissed off I got the very, very first time I played World of Warcraft and found I couldn't use my mouse?
3903370	3903591	Uh-huh.
3904351	3904972	Or a controller.
3905132	3905372	Oh, yeah.
3905732	3909755	Because I'd been playing Final Fantasy XI on a controller and I'd been playing PSO on a controller.
3913315	3940064	so they should just allow any kind of custom controller to work I think there's a mod for Warcraft where you can use a controller but it's not officially supported so you can't really count it I'm used to the damn keyboard now but I really think that games need to not limit people in how they can control that if you can map anything out on a keyboard then you should be able to map it out on a gamepad as well
3940644	3964897	and I think it's all this this type of story is a very humbling thing I think too for the developers who have to kind of stop and go oh yeah not everybody is as fortunate as I am to have every you know the 10 fingers and 10 toes doing you know what they what it does you know what I mean so it's uh it's a little bit humbling and just a reminder customizable controls go a long way in helping more people play your game
3966109	3969732	Alright, let's move on to a segment we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.
3969752	3977017	It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive through the vault and find a video game that she says, Hey, you ungrateful kids.
3977818	3978938	Hey, listen.
3979119	3980019	Hey, listen.
3980159	3981721	Stop watching those crappy Grammys.
3982041	3983021	Get off my lawn.
3983862	3986644	And play this classic game right now.
3986764	3989046	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3989554	3999403	The game is Star Parodia, which I had the hardest time finding because a lot of places romanize it as Parodier, which makes sense because it's a parody of Star Soldier.
4000103	4002786	And I've talked about this game before, but I haven't used it as a classic game.
4003006	4003386	I checked.
4003927	4004807	Alright, let's take a look.
4004827	4008350	I'm gonna play a little bit of music.
4014582	4015323	Thank you for watching!
4032325	4033526	And it only came out in Japan.
4034206	4038989	And they were going to be bringing it out in North America as Phantasy Star Soldier, but they did not.
4041430	4046173	It actually had a release through the Virtual Console in Europe on May 16th, 2008.
4047794	4051556	And, of course, it was released in America on August 11th, 2008.
4052157	4053617	So you guys can actually play this game now.
4053657	4054178	It's pretty funny.
4055098	4069921	So it's a vertically scrolling shooter like the Star Soldier games and has the collecting power-ups to upgrade your weapons and different bosses and mini-bosses and horizontal shooting with your vehicle of choice.
4070582	4076263	This one also has a high score time attack mode that were in Star Soldier.
4077023	4078244	But now for the parody part.
4078424	4083507	It's really cutesy, has very cartoony type of graphics, and not very violent.
4084148	4088210	Like when you kill an enemy, they don't die, they just wave white flags.
4089191	4091152	And you can choose one of three different vehicles.
4091192	4101699	You can choose the Paracelsus from Star Soldier, or a giant flying bomber man, or a PC engine that shoots cue cards and CD-ROMs at the enemies.
4102780	4104781	This game is super adorable cute.
4106042	4106762	I love this game.
4107102	4111884	And I remember when my friend, we were visiting my friend who lived in Berkeley at the time.
4112164	4114124	Like right now they're fighting the origami monster.
4114204	4115725	It looks like one of those tangrams.
4115965	4116265	Yeah.
4117345	4124107	But a friend of ours, you know, was just breaking out the most bizarre of her PC Engine collection and saying, play this.
4124287	4125227	And it's pretty fun.
4125287	4127868	So this is actually one I'm looking for a legit of.
4127908	4128868	I have a copy of it.
4129989	4131349	But it's a fun little game.
4132825	4135709	and... I mean, it's just... I love parody games.
4135769	4140637	I love games that are fun, you know, good, solid games that don't take themselves too seriously.
4141838	4144883	I mean, I love the Proteus series a lot more than this, obviously.
4145604	4147567	But... this one's just really...
4148307	4153991	And on top of that, I like that all the little guys that they talk to in the intro are little Bomberman guys.
4154792	4162277	And they're outfitting a PC Engine, you know, with a big smiley face, with a copy of Super Star Soldier, so it'll fight.
4163097	4163698	It's pretty funny.
4163718	4166699	I have a little sexy lady standing on the stage in the background there.
4166740	4170642	She's like, ooh, don't shoot me.
4170742	4173044	I think one of the enemies you fight in this is like a black Bomberman.
4174565	4175885	and all kinds of stuff.
4176145	4177646	It's really a fun little game.
4178767	4179627	And I love the music in it.
4179647	4180307	The music's great.
4181308	4182188	There's the giant fish.
4183209	4184229	I think that's a fish.
4184369	4185730	Who plays a maraca, apparently.
4185750	4186751	Yeah, it plays maracas.
4186911	4187431	Alrighty.
4188692	4190092	So yeah, it's totally worth it.
4190152	4191713	You can get it on Virtual Console.
4191873	4193294	I totally recommend it.
4193474	4196476	It's officially listed as Star Parodia.
4196536	4200197	I learned it as Star Parodia, so it doesn't matter.
4200257	4202959	It's written as Star Parodia.
4203795	4209002	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Star Parodia, or whatever you want to say.
4209343	4210744	Like Soldier, but, you know.
4211926	4213348	And it is available on Virtual Console?
4213889	4217714	Yes, it is, and America came out again on August 11th, 2008.
4219196	4219537	All right.
4220057	4222460	There you have it, your classic game of the week.
4223021	4225003	And now it's part of the show where we're going to take a quick break.
4225044	4225925	But don't go anywhere, guys.
4225945	4226766	We're going to come right back.
4227106	4234035	We've got a lot more stories to talk about in Part B tonight, including a very interesting story about possible serial numbers coming to PlayStation 3 games tomorrow.
4236718	4239402	and your Twitter topics.
4239482	4240763	Last chance to get those in you guys.
4241124	4243327	Twitter.com slash OLR.
4243387	4247672	Be sure to follow us on Twitter so you can interact with the show and send us your story suggestions.
4248473	4249614	Alright, so we're going to take a break.
4249695	4252098	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4258393	4267500	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, the February 13th of 2011, or 2011, whatever it is you prefer.
4268000	4272504	We're up against the Grammys tonight, but whatever, all the good stuff will be on YouTube later anyway.
4273171	4279313	That doesn't stop some of our live people from kind of watching it with one eye and listening to this show with their ears or what have you.
4280053	4285115	We're still here, you know, kind of moving away at the gaming news from the week.
4285675	4287515	And we're going to get into the Twitter topics real soon.
4287535	4289696	A chance for you guys to interact with us here live on the show.
4290416	4292677	Some rapid fire news, of course, in a moment as well.
4293357	4295358	Maybe more talk about Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
4295458	4295758	I don't know.
4296058	4297279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4312837	4313938	Comic Insanity.
4314459	4316781	And today we had a special guest on the show.
4317441	4321885	We had PJ Perez, who is the publisher for Pop Goes the Icon.
4322626	4323126	Very cool.
4324307	4336257	And I also host this with Maren Marvel, as we all know her as Tiara, and Shadow, or Dan Shadow, or whichever name he's deciding to go by this week.
4337378	4337698	Nice.
4337818	4338039	So...
4339380	4344123	We go live on Tuesday at InfamousNFAMOUS.net Awesome.
4345464	4351128	The spinoff show that I do is called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, or Horde House for short, if you're a fan of World of Warcraft.
4351588	4352449	You'll probably like this show.
4352509	4355931	It's myself and Extifer being really lulzy about the game.
4355972	4358153	And this week was some PvP-centric talk.
4358553	4361596	So if you are into PvP at all, you might want to check out this week's show.
4361916	4366099	But of course, all the Warcraft news and everything going on in the world of Warcraft.
4366639	4367099	on Horde House.
4367580	4368160	Check it out on iTunes.
4368180	4368800	It's very fun.
4369000	4370641	We're not cool enough to have a website yet.
4370941	4371521	Maybe someday.
4372082	4374203	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.
4374243	4377424	Some quick, quick stuff that just didn't make the show otherwise.
4377684	4380285	And definitely your last chance to get those Twitter topics in.
4380586	4383187	We'll be getting those right after the quick fire news stories.
4383887	4389712	Alright, well, Project M, a kind of a homebrew effort to make Super Smash Bros.
4389812	4392414	Brawl play a little bit more like Super Smash Bros.
4392595	4395297	Melee, has released its first demo.
4395337	4399740	Now, what's kind of cool about this hack is it doesn't require that you have any sort of mods done to your system.
4400281	4408227	All you need to do is dump it onto a SD card and pop it into your Wii, and away you go.
4409088	4438029	so you can download that from Project M's website which is projectm.smashmods.com and I believe that you do need a card though that is less than 2 gigs in size in order to be able to have the thing work but yeah check it out it's really more for the hardcore Malibu player because there's a lot of tweaks and stuff in there that most average people probably wouldn't get so that is out there to check out
4440996	4449700	In case you have a Netflix disc for your PlayStation Wii, well, unfortunately, it's not going to work after February 16th.
4450601	4460946	And I guess, you know, they're going to send out an email to all the members saying that the disc will cease to function, and that's it.
4461206	4461407	So...
4463267	4463567	Oh well.
4463968	4470851	But, of course, you can always download the streaming software via the Wii Shop channel because that's why they're getting rid of this.
4471072	4472472	There is another option for you.
4474013	4478056	Be sure to do that if you want to still stream stuff on your Wii.
4479336	4482620	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4500917	4508144	The Battle of Little Slugger, Kano's Salt, and those are going to be released as remixed extended versions.
4508684	4514590	And then the Beatus Blues, we're getting, I guess, a retro remix for that release.
4515526	4518107	That's going to be awesome because the music from Super Meat Boy is great.
4518727	4518967	Yes.
4519187	4519667	Just saying.
4520707	4523948	It's going to be probably some really hard stuff too, which will be awesome.
4523968	4530950	In fact, his comment was, I wanted to have some stuff in there for people who delight in 100%ing expert Dragon Force.
4531470	4533790	So that'll give you an idea of how hard it's going to be.
4534090	4534311	Nice.
4536091	4536431	All right.
4536691	4536971	Awesome.
4537131	4539312	And they're expected sometime after February 15th.
4539932	4540312	Very cool.
4541368	4570598	Alright, well, let's get to some other news, and this kinda sorta has to do with that same thing, except it's not Super Meat Boy, it's Rock Band, and what is coming out this week on Rock Band, the good news is, despite all of the stuff that's going on with Guitar Hero, Rock Band is still kicking, with some expansions, and I like this, this week is the February Heartache Duets Pack, which I think is great, which includes Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart.
4570618	4570838	That's
4571139	4571359	Lita Ford
4576421	4582386	No, we do have Animotion with Obsession, which I think is cool Bob, B.O.B.
4582446	4598857	with Hayley Williams with Airplanes Human League with Don't You Want Me Lady Antebellum with Need You Now Stevie Nicks with Stop Dragging My Heart Around Oh, now that's a good one By far the coolest No, this blows all the others out of the water You ready?
4599898	4602060	Paradise by The Dashboard Light by Meatloaf
4603360	4604141	Outstanding.
4605181	4606241	Absolutely outstanding.
4606401	4607922	But we just scared Shermie out with that list.
4608302	4610263	Not quite.
4610503	4611603	She is sitting in the doorway.
4611943	4614024	This might be something even Shermie could enjoy.
4614764	4622987	It's hitting the blogs this week about a three-year-old named Oliver Smith who was playing a game on the Nintendo Wii that his mom bought him.
4623287	4624528	Victoria is the mom's name.
4625108	4627669	The game is on the European version of the Wii.
4627709	4631290	It's called Countdown, which is based off a television show that they have over in Britain.
4631670	4634457	and basically you unscramble words.
4634477	4637324	They show up in whatever format and then you unscramble them.
4638760	4647303	Yeah, the kid got a word, S-H-A-H-S-I-T-E-D, and you know what that unscrambled into?
4648203	4648744	Shitheads.
4649324	4649744	That's right.
4650244	4650744	Shitheads.
4651525	4661248	So this little three-year-old got exposed to that word, and of course, according to the angry mother, I couldn't believe my eyes as the word was slowly unveiled as an obscene insult.
4661708	4665309	Oliver is a really bright kid, and we play this game to help him build up his word bank.
4665569	4667590	He was already asking what the word meant.
4669365	4669605	Nice.
4670445	4672607	Somebody let that one slip by in the dictionary.
4672707	4673127	Whoops.
4674128	4678711	But if you expose your children to it early, then it's not a special order and they won't be as inclined to say it.
4680012	4681053	And this last one.
4681333	4687138	God, I don't even really want to report on it, but it's just kind of sad because of everything we have going on with Guitar Hero and all that.
4687878	4690460	Yep, Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 2.
4691201	4691721	It's coming.
4692301	4693042	Oh, yeah.
4693062	4693743	20 more songs.
4694807	4696208	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4721039	4722040	A bunch of crap.
4722401	4723442	Actually, not crap.
4724063	4729349	Final Fantasy 1 and 2 is coming to PlayStation Network in Europe and it will be £7.99.
4730330	4735496	And they're going to be the UMD versions that came out in 2008.
4737018	4739121	Which, as far as I recall, weren't very great.
4740462	4743005	And then there's going to be a new DDR game for iOS.
4743366	4750835	It's going to be Dance Dance Revolution Freedom and it is free and has four songs.
4751636	4754239	And I like that the tap to start is a thumbprint.
4754299	4755140	That's actually cool.
4756021	4756301	But...
4758806	4759727	I don't know, it looks interesting.
4759767	4760567	Maybe I'll give it a try.
4760947	4761888	If it's free, why not?
4761968	4762248	Shoot.
4763289	4769613	And then it looks like Arcade Infinity is actually for real closing its doors.
4770734	4772255	So they're going to be closing on February 26, 2000.
4772835	4776097	As opposed to fake closing their doors like we had a couple months ago.
4776217	4778579	Yeah, they're closing on February 26, 2011.
4780160	4783262	And it's actually L.A.
4783302	4786564	County denied their application for business license extension
4789793	4803280	So, they have to close, the county wants them to close shop, pay for a new license, and wait for all of the hearings and city council votes in order for it to stay open, which could take up to eight months.
4803981	4808983	Why do they have such, what's their problem with this arcade?
4809003	4810784	I mean, seriously, it's like they hate them.
4812405	4816247	Well, they're saying it's not the money, it's just how long AI would have had to remain closed.
4816588	4819089	So, it's going away.
4820427	4821187	I hate you LA.
4822948	4823448	Officially.
4823588	4827109	Well, let's just, it's, you know, we kind of talked about this when the news came up the first time.
4827149	4830110	It's just kind of sad to hear about these arcades closing.
4830130	4830590	You know what I mean?
4831130	4840453	So, you know, but I'm sure there'll be no shortage of little arcades where ticket spitting machines come out and all that stuff.
4841174	4841534	Whatever.
4842754	4845055	Let's move into the Twitter topics.
4847153	4851477	Every week you guys send us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
4852097	4853839	We like to read some of our favorites here on the show.
4854880	4857242	So getting into some of the tweets sent to us tonight.
4857302	4857883	There's a few.
4857923	4859364	Gosh, there's tons of tweets tonight.
4859884	4866390	And getting into the first tweet here from Eternal Rapture says, Listening live for the first time tonight because I live in the UK.
4866470	4867711	I'm staying up till 5 a.m.
4867772	4868372	for you guys.
4869113	4870294	It's way past your bedtime.
4870954	4872436	I hope it's a three-day weekend or something.
4873076	4880563	Actdeft tweets us and says, Since Bobby Yetu won the Grammy it was nominated for, I think it's only fair to have it on OLR's I Love This Song this week.
4880603	4881304	Don't you think so?
4881724	4884306	Yes, I'm all for having actual content on the website.
4884326	4887349	That would be amazing.
4887769	4888270	Moving on.
4889171	4889531	Seg.
4890772	4895475	Sending us a tweet saying, the only relevant Grammy news, I'm sorry, is that it?
4895595	4896516	Oh, no, it is a tweet to us.
4896536	4903040	The only relevant Grammy news is Christopher Tinn winning one for Baba Yetu from Civ 4, which is very relevant.
4903140	4903520	I agree.
4904081	4905161	That is extremely relevant.
4906002	4906442	Glad to hear it.
4907743	4908844	All right.
4909644	4914427	Jake Jake LL sends us, sorry, that's a spam tweet.
4917609	4919371	Get an NFL game for free.
4919411	4919871	Who cares?
4921215	4921595	Let's see.
4922476	4928698	Blue Swim sends us a tweet here saying, Loki, have you seen the new Earth Defense Force insect Armageddon trailer, Pesticide Gun?
4929958	4930959	No, I haven't seen it yet.
4931159	4932519	Well, how about that?
4932559	4935821	Blue Swim sends us a link to that little video right here so we can take a look at it.
4935861	4936181	Hold on.
4936781	4938482	Let me pause this and turn this up.
4938882	4940142	You know what sucks about that game?
4940162	4941363	Is it's been delayed.
4965972	4967593	God damn it.
4967893	4969815	The fact that it's delayed to June.
4972037	4972397	You mad?
4973237	4973798	Yes, I am.
4974038	4975199	Well, not mad but disappointed.
4976048	4978169	and a couple from Tigerclaw here.
4978329	4982090	I guess a Plants vs. Zombies board game is actually happening.
4982770	4982970	What?
4983070	4983891	A board game?
4984591	4986592	That's a little strange, but kind of not surprising.
4986672	4989153	A lot of this stuff usually crosses over into other worlds.
4990153	4992194	So yeah, there's a Plants vs. Zombies board game.
4992234	4994134	It was spotted at Toy Fair 2011.
4994194	5004598	It's going to be a 2-4 player game with 80 zombie guards, cards, excuse me, 40 plant cards and different game boards on which you place these plants and battle the various zombies.
5005559	5008562	I got to play that on an iPad the other day.
5009483	5010684	I wanted an iPad after that.
5011707	5016091	The iPad works a little better, those versions, than the other ones.
5016491	5022796	Anyhow, also a tweet from Tigerclaw telling us that the World of Starcraft mod, remember this?
5022856	5030342	This was somebody taking Starcraft 2 and making a custom mod in it that was World of Starcraft, and Blizzard did not take too kindly to this.
5030382	5031963	We talked about this on Horde House a little bit this week.
5032344	5034265	It is now called Starcraft Universe.
5034786	5037448	So it has a name that I guess is a little less threatening to Blizzard.
5037688	5039409	And now Sony gets pissed off.
5039770	5041171	Just kidding.
5041371	5041812	We'll see.
5042172	5044334	So yeah, it has its name changed and there you go.
5045455	5050920	And lastly, SSJ100Matt says his tweet tonight saying, Resident hockey fan with some hockey game news.
5051281	5054904	NHL 2K11 is available now for the iPad for $5.
5055485	5057447	So if you're into hockey, check that out.
5058528	5059889	You know, it's not Blades of Steel though.
5059909	5062471	That will always be the best hockey game as far as I'm concerned.
5063372	5063813	There you go.
5066575	5067756	We got a couple last-minute tweets.
5067776	5068276	I'll read these.
5068616	5079384	SilverSonic tweets us on Twitter and saying, I just linked this in the chat room, but did you hear the story of the 11-year-old boy in the UK that spent 1 million pounds on Xbox Live?
5079464	5079904	No, I didn't.
5079924	5081045	He links us the story here.
5081845	5089891	I guess the 11-year-old kid racked up a 1,000-pound debt on the debit card through the Xbox Live.
5091072	5101006	he bought accessories and new games on the consoles after it saved details of a previously registered card it's hard to get those cards off there yeah it is
5102031	5102371	Wow.
5103452	5108136	But, I mean, why is she kind of letting the kid run rampant with this?
5108276	5115983	There's this little picture where her and the kid are kind of posing together, looking all, I don't know, I don't want to say happy, but they look kind of frumpy, I guess.
5117564	5126432	And what's interesting is that I guess she showed the thing to the kid, and she says, when I showed him, he burst into tears.
5126832	5129234	He unplugged the Xbox and said he didn't want it anymore.
5130216	5133468	I haven't punished him because he feels bad enough and I know he won't do it again.
5134778	5135418	I don't know though.
5135458	5137860	I'm working two jobs and I'm a single mother.
5139100	5140261	I can't pay this back.
5141061	5141782	Be responsible.
5141802	5143202	Why did you put the card in there in the first place?
5143222	5148945	They have parental things that they can enable to where you can disable live purchases.
5149225	5151687	Right.
5151747	5158890	If you don't pay attention on how to set controls on your consoles, then you can only blame yourself for when someone spends money on it.
5159991	5162132	Don't pretend, oh, I didn't know.
5164619	5166240	That's it for tweets tonight.
5166300	5170261	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter and send us some tweets for next week.
5171702	5173002	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
5173042	5173282	Loki.
5174243	5176604	I have no patience for those type of people.
5177964	5179685	This is kind of ironic, I guess.
5180125	5183206	Someone's suing Sony this time, so Sony's suing other people.
5183807	5191710	Apparently, LG has sent a lawsuit to Sony regarding their system, the PlayStation 3.
5192730	5200496	They claim that certain electronic devices having a Blu-ray disc player and components there violates four of its patents.
5201077	5204820	And that includes, I guess, a lot of devices like Bravia TVs.
5204880	5209763	But the only piece of hardware, I guess, they were singling out was the PlayStation 3.
5210524	5213066	And they actually have a specific model, which is the 160 gigabyte system.
5217710	5220792	The complaint with the U.S.
5220953	5227659	International Trade Commission has the power to block imports of products that violate U.S.
5227739	5229160	patents.
5229340	5235846	In short, LG is looking to have the ITC keep the PS3s off American shores.
5238038	5248442	They said they've also filed a civil suit against Sony in federal court in California making similar claims and seeking cash compensation for unauthorized use of its inventions.
5251462	5251963	Interesting.
5252603	5252863	Very.
5254324	5254804	I don't know.
5281758	5282098	All right.
5282758	5283819	Well, moving on with this.
5283979	5285720	This rumor just never stops.
5285880	5289502	This rumor is always around, and it's, when is Apple getting into gaming?
5289542	5290722	When is Apple getting into gaming?
5290742	5293343	It's kind of like, well, they're already in gaming if you consider the iPhone.
5293783	5295064	But okay, how about the consoles?
5295284	5296905	When are they going to get back into consoles?
5296925	5301107	Because I guess you could say the Pippin, but I think Apple would rather not talk about that.
5301607	5310514	But yeah, one of the rumors that keeps coming up is the Apple TV because, you know, they've sold this device for very cheap and it's kind of way to get Apple connected to your television.
5311134	5316478	And now the rumors are coming up again that perhaps Apple TV games are more real than you think.
5316638	5322481	But how, let me put it this way, the Apple TV, is it even powerful enough to run games on it?
5322541	5333105	I mean, I know it's, I think it's Intel Atom CPU, but, I mean, is that comparable to like an iPod or something, or an iPhone?
5333125	5337087	I mean, can they run, I mean, would they even be able to have the horsepower to do that?
5337432	5339853	I don't think you'd be talking top of the line stuff here.
5339973	5342994	I don't think you'd be playing exactly Gears of War on one of these things.
5343274	5355698	But maybe either some type of device between your iPhone and this, like maybe it can talk to the iPhone and kind of like what your PSP is supposed to do with the PS3 where you beam images from one source to the other.
5356878	5366068	That would be cool now if you could stream games from say your iPod or iPhone or something like that and then play them on the Apple TV with a controller.
5366649	5367770	A physical controller.
5368411	5374558	Although at the same time just like a physical controller for my iPod would be awfully nice.
5374778	5375579	Thanks for watching!
5394710	5397792	Could I use my remote control as a tangible controller, perhaps?
5398472	5398752	I don't know.
5399032	5402855	Well, wait, I didn't even tell you where this rumor comes from because you're going to laugh at this.
5402895	5404936	This is why this is a rumor all over again.
5405376	5411660	There's beta code out there for the new iOS 4.3 because, you know, they regularly do updates to iOS and so forth.
5412020	5420725	Well, 4.3 apparently in the code references ATV games and people think that means Apple TV because ATV.
5423291	5432474	and the code I guess also talks about controllers of some sort, leaderboards, scheduling games and of course, a storefront.
5434045	5435847	I mean, this news isn't, like, shocking.
5435907	5440951	I think this is kind of one of those matter-of-time types of things, but it's interesting to see what sort of things they have planned.
5441211	5444914	I think there would be a new Apple TV that would help facilitate this, and we'll see.
5445435	5447676	The price point's awfully nice of the Apple TV.
5447737	5451300	I mean, if they're trying to get people to bring it in as, like, a game console.
5451340	5451660	True, true.
5451840	5459346	Hell, if they even drop the price, like, say, another $20, $79.99, that would be pretty, you know, appealing to people that aren't necessarily...
5461833	5488313	into gaming and the other thing which would be kind of cool and I'm not too sure on the whole I don't know too much about the Apple TV other than the fact that you can stream shit from your PC your Apple or iTunes or whatever to it and stuff can you run apps on there already on the Apple TV can like I say browse Google or something you know do Facebook and stuff like that you can do on like the iPods and the iPhones and stuff can you do that stuff already on Apple TV
5489933	5492514	You can do the song.
5492594	5494254	Yeah, I think you can do movies and stuff.
5494414	5494935	I think so.
5495035	5497515	Okay, well you can do movies, but you can't run apps.
5497535	5499836	You can't do Facebook or anything like that.
5499856	5500076	No.
5500876	5506878	So that would be interesting if they did that because then they would be trying to compete with Google TV and stuff like that.
5507538	5512079	And if you throw gaming in there, that could be interesting seeing as it's way cheaper than Google TV.
5513450	5513790	I don't know.
5514250	5515771	It would be smart for them to do that.
5515811	5526394	It gets people to bring that shit into their house for the gaming, and then they can sell them on, hey, look, you can buy TV shows, or you can buy this.
5526754	5533636	This could be a real stretch here, but maybe this is part of what the whole iPad 2 thing has to do with.
5534076	5542101	because we haven't heard a lot out of iPad 2 besides that it's supposed to have this front-facing camera and might have the nice retina display.
5542161	5542501	Maybe.
5542541	5545462	We haven't really heard anything but a bunch of rumors.
5545843	5548624	But there will be that inevitable press conference at some point.
5549084	5553267	So could this maybe tie into that somehow?
5553327	5556468	They were saying even that the 3.4 – or was it 4.3?
5556568	5557149	I'm sorry.
5557169	5558670	The new –
5563192	5564614	DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the meantime?
5585931	5596137	Well, it looks like there has been an alleged Dance Central 2 survey that might be looking at a feature list.
5597477	5607102	So basically, Kotaku says that it has an email survey from Microsoft Game Studios that has a list of those features, that it's in pre-production.
5608203	5630735	and that it would have the ability to create custom dances and play as backup dancers or singers and then you can replay entire sequences and get specific feedback on your dancing and then they're also having a fitness mode and an online offline multiplayer contest and that you will have a social aspect to it so
5632236	5639280	God, does this mean that you can put a video of yourself, like, dancing through, captured via the Kinect, I don't know, like, somehow automatically?
5639661	5640921	I have no idea.
5644604	5645684	Sounds kind of scary to me.
5646225	5646725	A little bit.
5647833	5649994	Well, you know, they want that whole community thing.
5650034	5654576	And after all, they've been, you know, doing the first party Kinect games and take pictures of you.
5654916	5659678	Which I'm surprised you can't share those pictures, you know, with like Facebook and stuff.
5660578	5663419	At least I'm unaware that you can easily.
5664260	5666341	Because I would think that they would want to do something like that.
5666641	5674024	And wasn't there some sort of feature that was supposed to be coming where we can do screenshots from games and stuff like that and like share them on Facebook and that kind of crap?
5675236	5685042	Cause wasn't there like when they were talking about the whole Facebook integration and stuff And it's like, hey look, I just, you know, blah blah blah and Tiger Woods And here's a screenshot of me hitting a hole in one or some crap
5686707	5687167	SingStar has that.
5687187	5687828	SingStar has that.
5711625	5713426	and Def Jam Rapstar has that.
5713966	5714706	Come on, Konami.
5714746	5717066	You've got components for a good game in there.
5717367	5718287	It's kind of interesting.
5718307	5721968	Def Jam Rapstar is one of the better music games that's been put out recently.
5721988	5722508	It really is.
5725048	5726029	They have the potential.
5726069	5728909	They're just like, I don't want to do it.
5729230	5729890	I just don't.
5731870	5733731	This is kind of disappointing, I suppose.
5734512	5738334	Crysis 2 has been leaked online, including multiplayer.
5738854	5745318	It's not the final version of the game, but it's a near-final build of the game, including multiplayer.
5746018	5750640	And also, apparently, I guess that there's...
5751981	5759805	Some other things including that it doesn't have the DRM on it, that there's a way to bypass it and that kind of stuff.
5760045	5772372	I believe there's some stuff that's placeholder in it, like some of the sound effects, some of the assets are missing, but it is quite playable and is floating around out there for those unscrupulous types that may want to download that and check it out.
5775888	5777508	or you could support the game.
5778189	5779209	Or you can do them.
5779589	5781849	Also, all the dev tools are included with it, too.
5782210	5783750	Which means that came from the inside.
5785030	5786511	Yeah, it's a development copy.
5786611	5787991	Obviously, it came from the inside.
5789211	5791832	That's got to be frustrating, though, for the company as a whole.
5792312	5794132	What a way to screw over your coworkers.
5794152	5795393	Yep, a month before it comes out.
5795673	5796053	Awesome.
5797593	5797973	Yikes.
5798473	5800534	They're going to have to be doing some damage control on that.
5801451	5828400	yeah um it that I think the the same thing happened with the last crisis game as well that it leaked out before it came out I remember I remember that it did and I just didn't care though because that was a time when I actually was building computer for crisis um and so I actually got crisis with my graphics card that came with my computer so it wasn't such a big deal for me but um
5829656	5830397	That's gotta suck.
5832159	5835583	I mean, it would have sucked even more if it was on consoles.
5836985	5838186	Because that would have been terrible.
5838306	5839127	But let's see here.
5839148	5840009	I was just going to read.
5840069	5845996	They were talking about comments, though, of what's not exactly working in it and stuff.
5846476	5848699	Apparently...
5851417	5852017	Let's see.
5852137	5854579	There's, yeah, assets missing.
5854619	5861363	There's temporary sounds and stuff for certain things, and it's buggy, which is not surprising.
5866726	5868587	Well, I don't know.
5868627	5871289	You think this could be damaging for the entire series in the future?
5871349	5873851	I mean, could this jeopardize more than just Crysis 2?
5873911	5873991	No.
5878220	5884709	well no but I think that they definitely need to make sure that they what they should have done
5885580	5887021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5909719	5911840	Now we know who the goat killed.
5911920	5912500	Same with this.
5912580	5913681	This is a development copy.
5913881	5916922	It got leaked from the inside, so you gotta find out who leaked it.
5919884	5922565	I'm just imagining what the temporary sounds are like.
5924066	5927387	Like you shoot someone and he goes, I don't think it's anything like that.
5927487	5930809	I think if it's anything, it's probably stuff from the original Crisis game.
5932190	5932710	Stuff like that.
5933670	5937292	If I was a developer, I'd put in funny sounds as my placeholders.
5939434	5943141	I kind of want to check out the game though, honestly, because I liked the first one.
5943362	5945947	I just couldn't finish it because it was so goddamn buggy.
5945967	5949634	That's why I'm picking up the next one on console though.
5950195	5951237	Xbox 360 all the way.
5952947	5953287	All right.
5953327	5963477	Well, one more story for you guys before we get into some of the other segments here about the... This is kind of along the same lines because this could be an effect we might see in the future for this whole piracy.
5963617	5964017	I don't know.
5964157	5964918	I'm just saying.
5965218	5967741	Companies are doing what they want to do.
5968721	5974126	And this is about PlayStation 3 games possibly getting serial numbers.
5974947	5979869	Now, this is some sources that were speaking with the site PS3 Sense, which is Dutch.
5980469	5986271	Sony is going to implement a serial code security system for future PS3 game releases.
5986631	5988991	This will be very similar to what you already know on PC titles.
5989011	5990812	You get a long code that comes in the box.
5991252	5994374	You have to enter that in in order to play the game or install the game.
5994814	5997896	And that code can be used on up to five consoles.
5999177	6003079	Now, of course, folks are saying, well, you're just basically slowing down the inevitable.
6003139	6006181	People are going to find ways to hack around those serial number requirements anyway.
6006641	6009743	And then you just piss off those folks that buy this stuff legitimately.
6009903	6011604	And you've just killed the used market as well.
6011944	6012845	So, awesome.
6014286	6016507	I hope they don't do that because it's just dumb.
6017402	6026478	What's interesting is that Kotaku actually called Sony on this for comments, and Sony told him, we are looking at a few options, not ready to confirm our next steps yet.
6026498	6027439	So yes, they are looking at that.
6027459	6028461	They didn't flat out deny it.
6029642	6030502	Thanks for watching!
6053774	6056236	and you know what the problem with that is?
6056656	6058498	It's not even going to necessarily stop piracy.
6058518	6061199	It's going to stop people buying your console is what it's going to do.
6061239	6066443	It's going to stop people, especially people like the hardcore gamers out there that have multiple consoles.
6066903	6067363	You know what?
6067724	6068064	Fuck it.
6068204	6070085	I'm just not going to buy this game on the PS3.
6070285	6073988	I will buy it on the Xbox 360 or whatever other consoles are out there.
6074528	6075008	I agree.
6075028	6080412	That's exactly what's going to happen because I think Sony would be surprised how fast word is going to travel like that and if
6080592	6082873	And Piracy on their games is not a huge... I mean, let's put it this way.
6082893	6084754	The Xbox 360 has had Piracy on it for a very long time.
6084994	6087595	You don't see them going to very drastic measures like this.
6104362	6108104	Whereas PS3 piracy is just kind of getting around.
6108765	6113507	It's kind of cumbersome because Blu-ray rips aren't exactly the smallest things to download.
6114007	6118210	We're talking some games being 20 to 50 gigs in size.
6118590	6122992	That's not convenient for a lot of people to just download and pirate.
6123412	6130076	Granted, people could do it, and there are people out there that will do it, but it's a lot of...
6131747	6133488	Hoops that jump through, basically.
6133569	6139433	And to go this route and kind of punish everybody that owns a PS3, it's a really dumb idea.
6140154	6142415	I mean, if they think it's necessary, then great.
6142775	6143356	Go that route.
6143436	6145958	But don't be surprised if there's a huge backlash over it.
6147762	6152103	I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloundtrader.com to try and see some of the comments here.
6152723	6154883	Gamer Girl in our chatroom says, dude, that doesn't surprise me.
6154923	6157324	They're trying to put serial numbers on humans now, too.
6157524	6160445	So that might be a little bit too sci-fi for me.
6160485	6160785	I don't know.
6161525	6161945	Let's see.
6162085	6165626	Frisbee says, more of a reason for me not to buy a PlayStation 3 and its products.
6166126	6171267	Dartetsuya says, why is it the Earth's measures only seem to harm the legit users?
6172527	6176651	and RedTheHaze says, rumors from no-name site, something plausible from a no-name site.
6177612	6178492	Well, you never know.
6178612	6185218	You know, there's been things we've reported on in the past that, you know, they call us a no-name site, so, you know, whatever.
6185558	6188501	Like, I know we're not on the A list of internet gaming websites.
6188521	6190443	We're more like on the F list, which is fine.
6190723	6194066	If their console gets completely hacked open anyways...
6194864	6198371	Jailbreaking a console is okay Jailbreaking a console is okay
6204105	6210110	I mean, let's just say that they do implement some sort of serial code or whatever that can be tracked.
6210170	6218597	I mean, right now people have found ways to get past even the firmware checks because the newest firmware that's out there obviously breaks all the hacks that are out there.
6218917	6223160	Well, people have found ways around that even, and they're still able to connect to the PlayStation Network.
6223200	6227504	So if they can find a way around that, they can probably find a way around the authentication thing.
6228689	6245389	and then it doesn't even matter and on top of all that how the hell are you going to work that authentication thing in to people that don't have access to online if your console is not connected to the internet then you can't play your damn game that you bought so how's that going to work
6247155	6272380	I can say this for a business looking into something is not the same thing as implementing it and I think that they're smart to look at their options but if they do implement it then that's when it gets stupid they do kind of owe it to these third parties that you know some of them having a lot of problems you know we just reported on that crisis story or whatever they do kind of owe it to them to keep their system safe so I don't know
6273533	6274856	Alright, well let's get to the mailbag.
6275377	6280827	And every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura likes to dive into the email bag and read some of her favorite emails.
6281348	6282531	So DarkSakura, why don't you get to it?
6284150	6290652	Well, today's emails... Oh, we actually just got one more while I decided to check, so I'm going to read it to you.
6291352	6292832	God, we got a lot of emails today, Rob.
6294053	6296413	Which I guess is good in contrast to how it's been before.
6297333	6300454	Hey, OLR, this is Red the Haze, long-time listener since 2007.
6300574	6310157	If this email makes you in time for your February 13th show, as to I'm typing this last minute...
6310957	6318225	I called for the first time last week on your 400th show to congratulate you and I spoke about the Super Bowl and I would like to apologize to you guys about that.
6318365	6325813	OLR is one of my favorite podcasts and I felt bad in talking about something not game related or even food related so I came up with a last minute gaming question.
6326574	6327635	My question is this.
6327715	6331098	I'm about to join the Air Force soon when I finish basic training and go to tech school.
6331478	6335662	I won't be able to game on the consoles for a while and only be allowed to have a laptop or PC.
6336162	6340786	Can you guys recommend a gaming laptop, a pre-built PC, and some PC gaming controllers?
6341286	6351115	Since the Wired360 controller's D-pad is crap for some emulator action, I would say right away that probably the best gaming-specific laptops out there are the Alienwares.
6351815	6352876	You're gonna pay some money for them.
6371451	6375815	And seriously, I have an Asus Republic of Gamers laptop or whatever.
6376075	6377036	It works great for games.
6377236	6385944	I mean, the one I bought is pretty low-end, but I can run Grand Theft Auto in it, which is a very, I guess...
6388326	6409703	it could use some work as far as enhancing the game spec wise it can run Crysis fine chugs on Grand Theft Auto but you know you can just don't spend a lot of money because those aces not the aces but the Alienware ones can be like over a thousand dollars my PC is this what do I have again
6410023	6417025	I have an HP Quad Core that I picked up a couple years ago for $800 with a monitor and all.
6417705	6421966	And all I had to do was put in a new graphics card and power supply.
6422846	6428448	And I play everything I want to play and I do all my graphics work and it's just fine.
6429128	6429248	I've
6430649	6433770	Well, I mean, you guys have seen what games look like on my computer.
6433830	6434531	They run really well.
6434691	6438273	Well, also, he was saying he's playing on running emulators, right?
6438573	6438913	Oh, yeah.
6439153	6440274	You don't need anything super high-end.
6440294	6449899	Well, if you're running emulators, remember that, especially when it comes down to maim and stuff, the main things you're going to want to focus on are the speed of your CPU and...
6450839	6452900	Dude, most emulators will run on a freaking netbook.
6453001	6454201	Well, that's true.
6454842	6455943	But I'm talking about MAME here.
6456103	6458744	MAME, you're going to really need to focus on one thing.
6458785	6464008	It doesn't matter if it's dual core, quad core, because most of the MAME builds don't support the multi-threading and stuff like that.
6464568	6469672	But you're really going to have to focus on the actual core speed of it.
6469752	6474695	So you want something that's high twos to threes.
6474896	6476857	I don't think they have fours out there, but...
6477037	6479259	Dan's had MAME running just fine on his quad core.
6479379	6480359	Just so you know, I want to jump in here.
6480379	6492568	Well, yeah, but I'm saying, you know, a lot of stuff that's fine, but like if you're trying to run really high-end MAME stuff like, you know, Gauntlet Legends or something like that, I mean, that's going to require a 4 gigahertz processor.
6492748	6497113	Let me jump in here because RedTheHaze is actually in chat right now in our chat room and says, Money isn't a problem.
6497153	6498414	I'm willing to spend 1K+.
6498554	6499475	So there you go.
6499515	6500196	That's probably your answer.
6500757	6502538	Otherwise, I would say kind of two things here.
6502639	6509005	I have a Toshiba that I bought on sale for like $400 during a 4th of July sale at Fry's like two years ago.
6509446	6511568	And it runs wow, cataclysm.
6511588	6513150	I can't play max graphics settings, but...
6513590	6516011	I can get away with playing a few PC games.
6516051	6518272	I can play StarCraft 2 on it on low settings too.
6518692	6520853	So I can kind of get away with some of the newer stuff.
6520873	6523614	It's just I won't get that pristine gaming experience.
6523995	6524815	But that was only $400.
6524995	6530618	Keep in mind with my lower end, it was under spec for Star Trek Online, but I played Star Trek Online just fine.
6531098	6532378	It looked shitty, but it played.
6532899	6533739	And that's all I cared about.
6534902	6536924	I love this comment from Salacious Pop in our chatroom.
6536964	6540707	And maybe the best feedback is actually going to come from our chatroom on this because I haven't bought a laptop in a while.
6540747	6543169	But this is pretty much how I did it when I bought it.
6543309	6545071	And this is what Salacious Pop says in our chatroom.
6545371	6552438	To be honest, just look at what's on clearance at Best Buy that has a name brand ATI or Radeon card and then Google benchmarks.
6552838	6558303	And I think that's the smart thing to do is don't go in there and impulse buy something or don't buy something just because it's on sale.
6559204	6567249	Google the things, get reviews on them, see what they're capable of, and try to make the best informed decision you can.
6567590	6573794	But if you want me to recommend you something right off the cusp, oh my gosh, technology changes so fast, it's really hard for me to say something.
6573814	6576215	The Toshiba I bought two years ago, they probably don't even make anymore.
6576235	6578317	It's probably an even better one that's 400 bucks now.
6579998	6582059	I like that laptop Loki has.
6582119	6583260	It's pretty nice, the Asus.
6583600	6584781	My little dinky netbook.
6585301	6586702	I run SNES ROMs on it all the time.
6587903	6588904	And I run them in Linux.
6590006	6593011	So, of course, it's running more efficiently than it would have been in Windows.
6594173	6598340	Sadly, I'm not going to be able to name that definitive laptop for you, but I think you've got tons of options.
6598401	6600444	Just do your best to make an informed decision when you go shopping.
6600464	6601526	Don't impulse buy.
6601586	6602328	Do not impulse buy.
6603690	6605972	Thank you guys for all your hard work and passion for gaming.
6606112	6607413	I wish you all the best.
6607533	6607793	Bye.
6607873	6608553	I love you guys.
6608813	6609314	All hearts.
6610354	6610715	P.S.
6610815	6621021	Forgive any grammatical mistakes as to I've been up for the last 20 hours finishing up a special Valentine's video for my GF and forgot that you guys are on right now as I'm typing this letter.
6621141	6622102	Much love, RedTheHaze.
6622202	6627285	Or hey, if you want to spend a lot of money on a computer or something, do your own case mod.
6627385	6628426	Just build a fucking...
6629086	6657435	you know regular computer inside of like a you know a nice you know durable like suitcase type thing you can totally have a cut out Air Force logo and show your you know a really nice case mod for see that's the thing high end laptops are so fucking expensive and if you're like you know they're saying like there's some there $3,000 for $3,000 you can build a nice PC and a nice monitor if you spend just a little bit of time you know putting together even a very crude you know case mod for it
6657975	6658276	Next email.
6671980	6673141	This is from RubbaBuh.
6691040	6695741	When you were doing the listless, I'm thinking horror genre games.
6696201	6697342	Lonsdart Deathmatch.
6697362	6699622	The graphics would look like those airplane safety cards.
6700803	6701923	Davros Speak and Spell.
6701963	6703403	Spell Exterminate.
6704424	6705824	Teddy Ruxpin Soul Stealer.
6705904	6708245	Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin and you have to sleep sometime.
6709785	6710465	That was pretty funny.
6712025	6712246	Nice.
6713806	6716667	Those Teddy Ruxpin dolls were pretty scary back in the day, just so you know.
6716887	6717807	They were freaky.
6717998	6718098	TDU 2
6735919	6737660	Do cops know how to drive off-road this time?
6737680	6739882	Because that was hilarious in the last one.
6740142	6741142	Oh, there's cops chasing after me.
6741483	6742423	I'm going to drive off-road.
6742724	6743444	Ah, you can't get me.
6744605	6750509	The other news is that GameStop is giving out codes for TDU2 Casino to the first purchasers of the game.
6750709	6755092	The only problem is the day it was released, none of the casino codes worked.
6755652	6768974	I discovered that the codes weren't activated until February 9th at the earliest it was really great being able to find that on the Atari support forums but they never put it in on the news feeds on their site or in the in-game news feed
6771380	6772080	That's poopy.
6774341	6778243	Okay, email from CMD, whoever.
6778923	6783645	Hey guys, a couple of days ago my mother purchased on pre-order for me the Nintendo 3DS.
6784225	6792049	It is selling for $350 Australian, I guess that's AUD Australian, which includes the 3DS, one game, and an accessories pack.
6792069	6794150	So March 31st I am going to be super happy.
6794270	6795030	Keep up the good work.
6797091	6798191	Good for you, send us one.
6799112	6799772	Jamie wants one.
6800868	6802108	Hey guys, Molten Brown here.
6802168	6804509	I'm writing to congratulate you on your 400th episode.
6804889	6805830	Keep up the awesome work.
6805890	6807670	My weekends are never the same without you.
6808971	6812572	I'm not really writing in with game-related questions or news, but just some comments.
6812892	6818534	One, to Loki, over a comment you said a couple of episodes ago about a court's decision to allow the suit against J-Hat.
6819074	6825879	The idea that a court has jurisdiction against a person whose online activities has a presence in their state is not a new or random thing.
6826319	6843531	If I remember civil procedure correctly, depending on what the website is doing, directly advertising and soliciting customers, I think it's a message board site where the owners and other parties can communicate with each other or being a neutral site that just allows users to look up information will influence whether the court feels they have jurisdiction over a party.
6844171	6857678	The more the site seems to directly advertise and solicit customers, the more likely it is that the court will find they do have jurisdiction over the party who owns slash uses the website because the party has purposefully availed themselves to the privilege of doing business in the particular state.
6858239	6863401	This means that the party voluntarily subjected themselves to the jurisdictions of courts in that state.
6863702	6869905	A court can see J-Hat's website as soliciting customers because it was advertising a service, the ability to jailbreak your PS3.
6871573	6875076	I wouldn't say it's a service because all he was doing is sharing information.
6875796	6879639	That's not really, you know, hey, I'll jailbreak your PS3 for you.
6881040	6883803	I think it's a matter of perception, but it does have a point.
6884343	6886044	It's however the court decides to see it.
6886405	6892510	And I can understand if they were bringing him to California because his website's hosted in California, but that's not the case.
6893090	6897934	It was all because he communicated on Twitter, which pretty much everybody on the planet does nowadays.
6898514	6904798	and he had a PayPal account, which he had a donation thing on his webpage.
6905318	6906899	That was their criteria for it.
6907440	6909261	Really, it was because, hey, guess what?
6909281	6913083	They have a lot of lawyers on retainer in California, so that...
6915184	6934760	Whatever, it's still going through and I remember there's some extra stuff going on with the case right now where now he's surrendered his hard drive and stuff to the courts for Sony to go through as well as with his lawyer present of course.
6935260	6936741	So I think the translation is, ha ha!
6960743	6961744	It doesn't matter anyways.
6962105	6966229	Everybody's like, oh no, I hope he deleted his hard drive stuff and I hope all this stuff.
6966809	6971574	He didn't think he did anything wrong and he's out to prove that and so he has nothing to hide.
6974187	6979371	Number two, at Rob, your fake fight with Ranma during 400th episode made me think of this song.
6979511	6980271	YouTube link here.
6980672	6982693	Listening to the first few seconds will explain why.
6982773	6984394	The video isn't that impressive, but it's awesome.
6984434	6985535	I don't like that bitch.
6986256	6987216	I don't see her.
6988217	6989318	I don't like that bitch.
6990038	6990999	I don't see her.
6991760	6992140	Bitch.
6992720	6992981	Bitch.
6993021	6994622	Yeah, that's pretty much me and Ranma.
6994642	6995542	Bitch.
6995562	6996043	Bitch.
6996543	6997204	Hey, Ranma.
6997484	6997864	Bitch.
6998445	6998825	Bitch.
6999405	6999765	Bitch.
7000086	7000526	All right.
7000946	7002688	Someone can say the word bitch over and over.
7002708	7002988	Congrats.
7003992	7004793	3.
7004152	7004793	On my nickname.
7004853	7008296	Since Rob makes fun of my nickname from time to time, I felt I had to explain it.
7009077	7020627	When I was trying to figure out a nickname for America's Army, I created Molten Brown in homage to my eyes, which kind of look mahogany on the edges, the closest color I could think of, but as you get closer to the people, the color lightens up significantly.
7021067	7021588	I always thought...
7022308	7029970	My eyes had a molten feel to them like there was a flame behind my eyes that caused the color to lighten.
7030390	7036512	Additionally, when I'm angry or happy, my eye color seems to lighten up as if the fire is being turned up a notch because of how I am feeling.
7036552	7038452	So I thought Molten Brown made sense as a nickname.
7038792	7039433	That's poetic.
7039453	7041033	Okay, that's all from me.
7041053	7044594	Boy, don't I feel like crap for going straight to the poop reference.
7046234	7046875	Pun intended.
7047255	7047775	Take care.
7047915	7048735	That's a nice story.
7049255	7051836	Now I feel like Molten Brown myself.
7052757	7054279	This message is brought to you by snow.
7054319	7058524	The only substance I can think of that's beautiful but consistently makes me want to punch someone in the face.
7060227	7061068	That's a good way to sum it up.
7064010	7067151	This one is from Catastrophic Moggy.
7067931	7068712	Hi, OLR.
7069272	7078054	I'm sure this week you'll all be abuzz about the news of the deaths of Guitar Hero and DJ Hero, so I thought I'd pass on a bit of news that's got me excited.
7078694	7082355	I was more than a bit miffed when I heard that the 3DS was region locked.
7082935	7087376	I often import DS games because they are cheaper and usually release long before they are in Europe.
7087756	7090337	That is, if they remember to release them here at all.
7090977	7094879	I know it might sound silly, but I also prefer the cases that are used in the US.
7094939	7097740	Much better than the ugly, bulky, semi-clear cases we get here.
7098340	7103702	I actually like the European cases, honestly, but I see your point.
7104663	7109645	Anyway, what I am getting at is that I was seriously thinking about whether I'll bother getting a 3DS.
7109985	7113686	I mean, I only got a 360 a couple months ago and still have tons of games I want to try.
7114166	7117568	But I read that Cave Story is being released on it.
7117988	7119709	Well, that threw a spanner in the works.
7120649	7123211	and the concept art looks really impressive.
7124272	7126094	See you guys around Catastrophic Magi.
7126154	7127135	I have to look at this now.
7129016	7130518	I want to see what the art looks like.
7132480	7133220	Wow.
7135602	7136703	Wow, pretty.
7138625	7139846	Okay, Jamie wants this.
7141507	7143950	I'm going to link it in the chat room because it's pretty.
7145871	7146592	It's really pretty.
7149593	7152018	I tried Cave Story but I thought it was kind of meh.
7152438	7153520	But dude, this is pretty.
7154742	7155945	There you go, everyone.
7156045	7156666	Take a look in there.
7160060	7177697	and now for our next email and by the way, thank you CatastrophicMuggy for sharing that link it's pretty anyway, next email up hey OLR, seeing as the mailbag has been somewhat skimpy on average for a while now I thought that I'd send an email this week covering a few topics
7178217	7184921	First off, there is a free video available on PSN, iTunes, and the Xbox Live Zoom Marketplace which is the pilot of Mr. Sunshine.
7185342	7190044	It's easy to find on PSN and iTunes but it takes a little hunting to find it via Xbox Live Zoom.
7191806	7192206	Excuse me.
7193129	7199031	On a semi-related note, I found out a cool little deal that I'm sure that DarkSakura would make use of since she's a Marvel fan.
7199191	7199411	Yep.
7200172	7206514	Assuming that there's Target stores out west and sales are nationwide, not just reasonable, they have Planet Hulk on Blu-ray for dirt cheap.
7207294	7211856	At least at my favorite Target, the shelf tag listed as $10 however it rang up as $7.50.
7212757	7215818	Movies, especially Blu-rays, don't get much cheaper than that new or used.
7215918	7220159	After seeing it, I was awestruck over how gorgeous the animation was and how good the voice acting was.
7220339	7221380	All in all, it's a good buy.
7222060	7227361	As a side note, if you were able to do so, try picking up the animated Dante's Inferno movie released in tandem with the game.
7227961	7229482	It was equally as good as Planet Hulk.
7229582	7235103	Now, if you're a fan of certain voice actors, I should mention that both Mark Hamill and Steve Blum had roles in Dante's Inferno.
7235743	7242445	See, I would be interested in seeing Dante's Inferno, but I am not a Hulk fan at all because Marvel has just gone overboard with Hulk.
7242925	7246649	and every single freaking issue that Hulk should have nothing to do with.
7246969	7248291	Hulk was in Spider-Girl.
7248591	7250433	What do Hulk and Spider-Girl have in common?
7250914	7253316	But that's not an argument for this podcast.
7253436	7255298	So probably no Hulk for me.
7255398	7258181	But I did like the Ultimate Avengers ones.
7258201	7258562	Those are cool.
7260231	7266758	As for the last topic, I assume that you have already covered the story about Activision giving Guitar Hero the axe as well as shredding Tony Hawk.
7267119	7268200	Puns fully intended.
7268760	7270122	In my honest opinion, it's about time.
7270202	7275368	Activision really ran these two franchises into the ground and frankly they haven't learned that quality is greater than quantity.
7275988	7285816	Where they went wrong with Guitar Hero, at least, is the fact that they inundated the market with poorly supported via download content titles every year like clockwork.
7286256	7294462	Now, if they had followed EA's slash Harmonix lead and used the Rock Band business model, they would have fared better and the bottom wouldn't have fallen out of the music game market.
7294562	7300567	I bet that within two to three years' time, the Call of Duty series will likely suffer the same fate.
7301027	7303429	It isn't too far of a stretch to predict that happening.
7303769	7305550	Thanks for taking the time to read this email.
7305610	7307111	Errors and all, it's appreciated.
7307792	7308152	P.S.
7308372	7317378	Although I haven't fully put it together in time for this week's show, hopefully by next week if possible, I'd like to initiate a little contest open to USPS3 owners.
7317858	7322962	Sorry everyone else, you wouldn't be able to make use of the prize even if you won due to how PSN is set up.
7323062	7328506	It'll be one winner who will get some videos from the USPSN video store.
7328546	7330447	Anyone who has a PS3 and is in the US may enter.
7330987	7332929	I just need to come up with a wordy trivia question.
7334550	7334870	Hey.
7336171	7336651	That's shiny.
7337612	7338213	And last one.
7338813	7339534	Happy 401.
7340394	7342656	Is it wrong that I play Angry Birds on the toilet at work?
7343136	7343877	This is from Mike.
7344618	7345738	No, it's you and everyone else.
7348521	7349041	And that's it.
7349541	7349942	All right.
7350602	7351683	Thank you very much for the emails.
7352083	7359129	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to have them read next week here on Z Program.
7359602	7362023	And maybe I'll still have my, you know, disease voice.
7363583	7363943	All right.
7364504	7369325	We got a few more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the Skype line.
7370185	7373967	Oh, but before we get to those, we have to get into the FUs of the week.
7374387	7377248	It's the part of the show where we get angsty, as we've done for the last 400 weeks.
7396652	7413484	My F you goes towards people not understanding the difference between making a comment about an article and then spamming your Facebook with a bajillion comments arguing a political point that you really don't care to discuss.
7414805	7417126	So, forget it.
7418187	7420749	If it happens again, I'm going to do what I did this time and delete it.
7422450	7423451	This is the form of me.
7424266	7425266	My wall, me.
7425326	7426207	Your wall, you.
7428127	7429427	Respect my authority.
7429467	7430608	Facebook is serious business.
7431128	7432328	That's why I'm back on LiveJournal.
7434469	7435789	I never left LiveJournal.
7435829	7440410	I don't know why people are... I didn't leave LiveJournal, but I ignored it for a little bit.
7440991	7442891	I realize there's a lot of creepy shit on LiveJournal.
7442951	7443551	I get that.
7443631	7448072	I get the LOL, the Harry Potter stuff, but that's not what everybody's into.
7448273	7448693	Just saying.
7450293	7451733	Anyhow, Loki.
7453474	7453674	Um...
7455509	7457231	I know I was mad at something earlier this week.
7457251	7458332	I just don't remember what it was.
7458892	7461855	So, um... I don't know.
7462515	7463777	F you to Drama, I suppose.
7464978	7467600	That's a good fallback option, I guess.
7471243	7472925	F you to Dance360 for breaking.
7475267	7477449	Um... Dance in the back going, yeah!
7479113	7481939	F you to that little audio boo-boo I just had there going on there.
7482139	7483161	F you to not being perfect.
7483622	7486307	And F you to the fact I don't have tacos right now because tacos suck.
7486687	7488050	Oh, can I add one little tiny one?
7488290	7488450	Sure.
7488751	7489552	But you're going to help me.
7490114	7490274	What?
7490314	7491115	F you to my Ventrilo.
7493075	7495916	Oh yeah, I can help fix that for you though.
7496956	7499197	Otherwise, actually, I don't have a lot to be mad about.
7499257	7500277	Things are fine right now.
7501677	7501977	I don't know.
7502478	7505478	F you to the fact that I'm separated on Valentine's Day.
7505939	7508859	Not like separated in that context, maybe separated by distance.
7509359	7510220	But it's just a day.
7510560	7512460	I mean, you know, the meaning's still there.
7512480	7512960	Oh come on, Rob.
7513000	7514981	Somebody got decapitated, so you're okay.
7515001	7516661	No, no, it's fine.
7517622	7517902	Alright.
7519202	7524064	Anyhow, let's get back into a couple more gaming news stories and then we're going to get to your calls.
7525124	7525884	Should be fun tonight.
7542530	7549157	But now they're doing something very similar to the Contra thing where they have a project that's a collaboration between a bunch of different members.
7549858	7553822	They have one that's actually being done between 12 of the community members.
7553882	7556825	It's called Hansel and Gretel Bot.
7557365	7562629	It's a seven-level LittleBigPlanet 2 adventure that has cutscenes and everything.
7562669	7572055	And they say that the level design is on par with the single-player campaign that's with LittleBigPlanet 2.
7572956	7577519	So definitely worth checking out, and it will be out hopefully soon.
7579140	7581181	So that's pretty sweet.
7581201	7583463	And they actually covered it on the PlayStation blog as well.
7585126	7585907	Thanks for watching!
7603933	7606134	I have to really be picky choosy on what video games I buy.
7607834	7609535	Maybe I'll rent it or something.
7610255	7610555	I don't know.
7611615	7612976	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
7612996	7615276	Then we're going to get to the Skype line.
7615296	7618997	1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7619037	7623558	Do make sure if you're going to give us a call on Skype, you do call Echo 123 first to test your setup.
7623658	7625299	And remember the other rule of radio.
7625899	7629220	If you're going to call a radio show, mute your radio once you get through.
7629537	7632419	All right, one more story for you guys, though, and it has to do with dogs and kitties.
7632900	7639025	Nintendogs plus cats is one of the launch titles for the 3DS, and the breeds have been revealed.
7639885	7645089	And, of course, there are going to be several different versions of the game, duh.
7646170	7658636	One of them is Toy Poodle and Friends, which comes with a Toy Poodle, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Mini Schnauzer, Boxer, Bull Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Shih Tzu, Jack Russell, and Pomeranian.
7659176	7660116	Excuse me.
7660576	7661397	I'm not a dog person.
7661477	7661817	Excuse me.
7662455	7672539	French Bulldog and Friends comes with French Bulldog, Shetland Sheepdog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Chihuahua, Dalmatian, Yorkshire Terrier, German Shepherd, Husky, and Basset Hound.
7673259	7678101	And Shiba Inu and Friends, which will be Golden Retriever and Friends for those of us here in the U.S.
7678161	7678461	and Europe.
7679101	7686604	Shiba Inu, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Mini Pinscher, Dachshund, Maltese, Great Dane, Pugs, and Cocker Spaniels.
7686644	7688205	And your Great Dane will die in two years.
7689285	7689926	So there you go.
7690286	7692708	Now, I don't really see what the cats are yet.
7692748	7695511	I don't know if the cats are the same in every game or what the deal is.
7696512	7698253	I'd get which everyone has a Mal in it.
7699555	7700756	Because they were worshipped.
7700996	7703638	But I'd want a Fat Shermie too.
7703938	7707622	More information is available on the Japanese site, Nintendo.co.jp.
7708002	7709203	More information is available there.
7710204	7712026	I will probably get the one with the Welsh Corgi in it.
7712827	7714248	Even though it's a freaking poodle.
7715289	7715409	Ugh.
7715729	7718472	I want one with a big, big fat shirmy in it.
7718532	7722875	I don't want this game, but I feel compelled to buy this game.
7723156	7724377	I really don't want this game.
7725538	7727039	I don't either, and I feel compelled to buy it.
7727139	7729121	I do.
7729381	7734105	It's going to be one of those games that I play for like a day, and then I get so sick of it.
7735146	7735667	I know, me too.
7736192	7737233	But whatever, you know.
7766983	7771393	I just want Fat Shermie the game.
7772615	7775061	That's my new dream game, everybody, is Fat Shermie.
7775381	7776885	What would happen in Fat Shermie the game?
7777635	7782101	You get to poke her and have her make really weird faces at you and then you'd have to clean up her litter box.
7782942	7785986	And then you'd also have to figure out ways to keep her from shitting on the kitchen floor.
7786046	7787988	And you'd be very careful not to talk about the tester.
7789029	7790872	She's not in the room so we can talk about it all we want.
7791693	7792874	Let's go to the phones.
7793054	7794236	Calls already coming in.
7794516	7795417	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7795437	7795697	Who's this?
7796394	7797155	Hey, this is X-Link.
7797195	7798217	Hey, X-Link, how you doing, buddy?
7798658	7799299	Hey, doing good.
7799419	7799860	What's up, man?
7799880	7803887	I'd be better if I know I wasn't getting gypped off or you don't know Jack for the PC.
7804267	7807693	And it's kind of funny because the creators are Pokemon and PC people, but that's alright.
7808074	7808455	How so?
7809690	7829297	Well, I guess apparently on one of the forums, one of the guys took a screenshot of the Twitter account for You Don't Know Jack, and one of the guys replied by, because they were asking if they were willing to pay more money, if they could get more than two players local, and he goes, are more PC players too fat to fit more than two at a keyboard?
7831914	7832714	I was like, wow.
7832734	7833675	I was like, really?
7833995	7834435	Seriously?
7834475	7835735	That is kind of funny.
7835975	7836916	It's a little bit funny.
7837176	7838556	Yeah.
7838616	7849700	I don't know if they legitimately did it on purpose or they kind of did it as kind of like a test run to see how many people buy it and maybe put it down the road as possibly a DLC or a patch or something or what they're going to do.
7849840	7858483	But I hope they really seriously do just one or two because it doesn't feel like the full experience without like four players that I'm used to playing beforehand.
7859500	7887537	but you know before speaking of beforehand though we didn't have back in the 90s all this Xbox Live stuff and all that fun stuff like if you didn't have other people to play with in the same room it just yeah but at the same time too though if I have four people here at the house and I want to play with four people like my next door neighbors for example then I can't do that I can only play with one person at a time like if I were to play somewhere else and it's not like me and my girlfriend versus my two neighbors instead it will be either me and my girlfriend my girlfriend versus one of my neighbors or
7888266	7889587	or me versus my girl.
7889647	7890387	You know what I'm saying though?
7890507	7892548	Two people will be left out.
7892968	7894629	You are getting the shorter end of the stick.
7894669	7896950	Of course, it is $10 cheaper for what it's worth.
7898831	7902453	Yeah, but still, I'd rather pay if it was the extra $10 for the two.
7902613	7907375	Still, I would definitely pay that because it still feels a little left out.
7907415	7912818	But at the same time too, I hope they do something about that because at the same time too, a lot of people are complaining about it.
7913434	7922980	and I'm sure a lot more people were too and if it was like one of people like me for example who bought on day one and didn't know this I might have been a little hesitant and be like well screw this I'll wait till Steam has on sale then buy it.
7924360	7930784	But at the same time too though it's a great game and definitely worth 20 bucks and it has Steam achievements for the PC and it's definitely worth to buy.
7931824	7938068	Also Swords and Poker 1 and 2 are back on the iTunes store
7938702	7951632	I have a shit ton of fun, I guess I could say personally, playing those two games.
7952032	7954814	And I always bounce back and forth between the first and second one.
7954874	7957596	And it's a lot of fun, so if you're into card games, definitely buy those.
7957935	7959016	It is such an awesome game.
7959036	7960899	Seriously, now that it's on the App Store, you need to buy it.
7961059	7961900	It's like 99 cents.
7962160	7962761	Oh, they came back?
7962861	7963842	They came back.
7964203	7965965	Sword and Poker 2 and Sword and Poker 1.
7966325	7967987	Seriously, go buy it on the App Store.
7968428	7970630	It will take over your life.
7970771	7971091	It will.
7971692	7972272	I'll check it out.
7972292	7974075	That's a pretty big endorsement.
7974115	7974976	I'll have to look into that.
7975356	7977918	Both of them are about $5-$6.
7978358	7981260	I know the second one is like $3 and I think the first one is $2.
7982901	7988304	So yeah, you're looking at like $5-$6 worth of money.
7988545	7993208	Probably like at least 50 hours into the second game already.
7993908	8000432	Yeah, I'm like a few hours into the second one but I'm still trying to finish up the first one and the first one is just as bad as the second.
8001573	8003134	But it's a lot of fun though, it's very challenging.
8004025	8005766	Well, let me take it back to You Don't Know Jack for a minute.
8005806	8010628	As somebody who played it like a long time ago, these tech issues aside, were you really happy to see this come back?
8010668	8011628	Is this a worthy upgrade?
8012189	8014049	Yes and yes.
8014069	8021073	It has all the pretty much old features, like a few new things added as well, but anybody who's a trivia fan, definitely buy it.
8021153	8023974	It's worth the money, regardless of what system.
8024214	8026435	Do you think it will be the first of several revival games?
8027116	8027696	I hope so.
8027877	8030278	And I hope so in a good way, not in a bad way.
8030338	8032920	Because they did a pretty decent job, like I said before.
8032940	8038104	I just really wish that there were four players that could do something like that down the road or maybe add another one with it.
8038484	8039765	Then, yes, that would be awesome.
8039845	8043508	And the fact that it has DLC and stuff that's going to be attached to it would make it even worse.
8045589	8050893	Because now instead of buying, like, you don't know Jack Sports, now it's like, oh, you can get the Sports DLC for it.
8052034	8053235	So, definitely.
8053275	8060199	And also, I bought NBA Jam for the iTouch and iPad, and it's wonderful.
8060559	8060980	Really?
8061080	8062440	Yeah, I like it.
8062460	8065222	I would think on the iOS, though, those games would kind of blow.
8066383	8070445	No, it's a little smaller, but for me, I like it.
8070706	8075569	It's the same way as NBA Jam, and it has a lot of unlockable stuff.
8075989	8077670	I've been playing it for quite a while, so...
8078379	8078659	All right.
8079300	8086965	Well, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but enjoy the You Don't Know Jack, even though you didn't get it on Xbox 360, so I can't play with you, but I guess life goes on.
8087365	8088646	Hopefully make it one day PC.
8088886	8090247	You always have WoW to play.
8090848	8091268	Definitely.
8091348	8093610	Although... How do you do in Civ V, by the way?
8094310	8096051	I was playing it for a while, and then I went back to WoW.
8096312	8097312	Are you interested in Rift at all?
8097492	8098133	Any interest in Rift?
8098793	8099033	Maybe.
8099414	8099634	Maybe.
8099814	8100034	Maybe.
8100114	8100334	All right.
8100655	8100935	All right.
8100975	8101995	Got to let you go so we can get more calls.
8102096	8102476	Take care, buddy.
8102956	8103176	You too.
8103276	8103456	All right.
8103517	8103677	Bye.
8104617	8109200	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8109721	8110661	Let's go take another call.
8111462	8112282	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8112302	8112623	Who's this?
8115985	8116565	Hello?
8116786	8117146	Hi.
8117626	8118287	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8118307	8118647	Who's this?
8120468	8120888	Hi.
8121088	8122409	I was just calling in.
8123690	8127693	Bring back all these memories of like old games I used to play, like
8128035	8152552	Street Fighter, Metal Gear, Mortal Kombat, King of Fighters, Final Fantasy, Darkstalkers, Double Dragon, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Spyro,
8155322	8157043	You should turn down your speakers, dude.
8157223	8158543	No, I want to see how long you can keep going.
8158603	8160624	What other old classic games?
8171248	8172188	Like, what's the point?
8172268	8172928	Seriously.
8174309	8175209	I don't even understand.
8176649	8182511	Well, thank you very much to the caller from area code 612-670... Maybe I'll give the rest out later.
8182932	8183912	All right, let's take some more calls.
8185356	8186696	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8186716	8187036	Who's this?
8188196	8189057	Hey, this is D.R.
8189097	8189597	Dollar Bill.
8189857	8192157	Hey, what's on your mind?
8193017	8193257	Hey.
8193757	8195338	Hey, just quickly.
8195358	8196498	I didn't think I'd get through this quick.
8198018	8201979	First off, I was trying to remember if you didn't know Jack, the original PC version.
8202639	8205059	I don't think there was four players even on the original version.
8205899	8206460	There wasn't.
8206500	8208320	I think it was three on the original version.
8208880	8209000	Oh.
8210140	8214361	Yeah, so I couldn't say his thing about it should have been four players, but...
8215310	8221596	If it was based on the same concept, I'm trying to picture four people holding the keyboard together.
8221616	8223938	It just seems kind of crowded, don't you think?
8226320	8229002	At one keyboard, yeah, that might be a little bit comfy.
8230723	8233886	Yeah, I mean, the online multiplayer, I agree with.
8233986	8234927	They should do that.
8235047	8237990	But on a local machine, I don't know.
8238010	8239131	It just didn't seem right.
8240563	8260869	but you used to do three on one keyboard and I seem to remember the buzzer keys were like Q space bar and like right bracket or something they were kind of like spread out so you could sit kind of in an interesting arrangement and do it four might be getting a little comfy but you could like give a person the mouse and they could like click it I don't know ooh that would be a good one okay
8262176	8278887	All right, that one, and there was something else, and I... Oh, yeah, just really quick, because I heard at the beginning of the show, you guys were talking about DDR and Guitar Hero, how, like, they both seem to be following one point of the continuously kind of the same game, but very little evolution between the two.
8279707	8290234	Like, you know, DDR just slowly didn't really evolve much, just maybe some different step charts and maybe a couple different modes eventually, but it's still alive a lot longer than Guitar Hero.
8291764	8293265	Thank you for watching!
8303419	8306201	One theory that we had is that the games are simply lower budget.
8306541	8310724	Because keep in mind, Konami, they do license songs now, but they don't license quite as many.
8310764	8312465	It's like 10 songs maybe in a game.
8312785	8314586	And they use their in-house team for the rest of it.
8315006	8317428	And I think the expectations just aren't quite as high.
8317508	8320450	And I think they still sell quite a few through the whole weight loss thing.
8320790	8329516	Like it's not Wii Fit, but certainly... I was even listening to a morning show here locally where somebody brought up, and they were saying it jokingly,
8330036	8340305	It was some chick who got a Wii for Valentine's Day and she was saying to the host that she was going to play lots of Wii Fit and the host was going, you're not going to play any Wii Fit.
8340345	8346309	You're going to play it for three days and then you're going to be over it and then you'll say, oh, I'm going to play Dance Dance Revolution.
8346329	8347290	You'll play that two times too.
8347530	8351153	So the name is still out there is my point.
8351193	8358960	It's still getting name checked in some places but I just think overall those games are lower budget and so they have lower expectations and I think that's why those games still go.
8358980	8359460	And unfortunately
8359540	8360181	It shows.
8362903	8365545	And it's also still very Japan-centric.
8365625	8368367	I think Konami closed their offices here in the U.S.
8369067	8370408	They might have the one in L.A., I think.
8370468	8371189	They have the one in L.A.
8371289	8372270	But they don't have the one in Hawaii.
8372290	8374111	They don't have the one in North Bay.
8374671	8376813	Or, I'm sorry, NorCal in the Bay.
8377394	8378314	They don't have those anymore.
8378394	8380616	So most of that, I imagine, is coming out of Japan.
8380976	8382838	And those games are probably still selling in Japan.
8382898	8386180	Whereas Guitar Hero, what, did they have one in Japan?
8386440	8386881	And that was it?
8388235	8393660	I didn't think it ever got released in Japan I didn't think it would Guitar Hero?
8393700	8412697	I think there was like one I think one of them did get a localized Japanese release but I don't think it was huge I could be wrong, don't quote me on that or call me an idiot if I'm wrong but I want to say one time I do remember reading about it Okay, that's cool Anything else on your mind, buddy?
8414138	8415039	Anything else on your mind, buddy?
8416608	8418149	Uh, that's alright, man.
8418270	8420151	I just didn't have much to say except, hi guys.
8420912	8421832	Hey, what's up?
8421972	8425675	Alright, well at least you aren't high as hell like the last caller.
8426856	8427317	I know.
8428137	8428798	Alright, take care, buddy.
8429318	8429999	You too, bye guys.
8431917	8433818	Last Minute Stories for our listeners tonight.
8450594	8452296	Yeah, I was going to see here.
8453056	8455138	They're talking a little bit more about the Xperia Play.
8455439	8460984	Apparently, it's going to have battery life enough for five plus hours of gameplay, which is kind of cool.
8461284	8470113	It's got a 5.1 megapixel camera, 400 megabytes of onboard memory, as well as you can expand it via SD memory cards.
8471516	8473237	Thank you to Orange Wright in our chat room.
8473437	8475678	Very knowledgeable dude when it comes to the music games.
8475738	8478499	Guitar Hero 3 and Aerosmith were released in Japan.
8478879	8480840	Same as the other releases, no localization.
8481261	8482241	Thank you for the clarification.
8483341	8484102	Let's take some more calls.
8485478	8486339	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8486359	8486639	Who's this?
8487319	8488340	Hey, it's Ranma.
8488400	8490841	And this time, Rob, I'm not going to attack you tonight.
8490881	8491302	Thank you.
8491342	8492162	I appreciate it.
8492502	8493383	You're welcome.
8493403	8493883	All right.
8494684	8495244	So what's up?
8496145	8496865	Not too much.
8497466	8499607	I have some interesting topics I want to discuss.
8499647	8501308	I'll make them brief as possible.
8501508	8501648	Yeah.
8501808	8505311	But first, I would like to give my prediction for episode 500.
8508072	8508373	Okay.
8508413	8508873	What is that?
8511226	8515549	Number one, you and Salacious Pop get married live on the air.
8517770	8521033	I don't know about that, but okay, sure.
8521093	8521993	Predictions, predictions.
8523494	8528258	And right after that we find out DarkSakura is pregnant and she gives birth live on the air.
8528518	8529318	No, not happening.
8530939	8535943	And after all is said and done, Loki is still oblivious to the entire world as he still plays Grand Theft Auto IV.
8537803	8541546	Well, in two years they're going to have Grand Theft Auto 5, so I mean, come on.
8542366	8546349	And we're going to be playing Saints Row 3 later on this year, so I'm very excited about that.
8546569	8548230	At least a quick break on Grand Theft Auto.
8548270	8556496	But hey, gotta be honest though, the Grand Theft Auto games we play are not quite the Grand Theft Auto games that other people play.
8557196	8576120	and it's a little different type of an animal that we're playing lots of high explosives and people flying through the air and and bus foo there is bus foo in this game it's it's a sight that behold seriously we'll be making new videos once it's all done too I can't wait to see those
8580163	8582124	Alright, any other lovely predictions?
8582284	8583084	We got a ways to go.
8583964	8590106	That's all for the predictions, but as I've been listening for the last couple of podcasts, I've been trying to catch up.
8590986	8594688	My quick take on Sony's Neo Geo Pocket.
8598009	8601310	It says it's going to be 3G and all this enabled.
8601730	8602850	I can see it now.
8603330	8606111	They're going to market the portable console at about
8608223	8621393	$400.
8609164	8621393	And what they're going to do, they're probably going to partnership with either AT&T or T-Mobile where you go in and you get the console for $99.99 with a two-year contract with it.
8624976	8626497	Yeah, lock them in with a contract.
8626878	8627638	That's the way to do it.
8627658	8628799	That's what they're trying to do with the phone.
8630180	8632202	I mean, hey, it kind of worked for the taco.
8632242	8633223	Why not for the NGP?
8635239	8635600	Who knows?
8635880	8649437	Seriously, if anyone is serious about gaming with 3G on the NGP or even anything like the iPod or iPad, whatever, don't fucking sign up for this shit.
8649497	8650618	Just, I mean...
8651699	8654481	I think you just get the cheapest data plan possible.
8676096	8684718	But seriously though, if I want to game my laptop, and I got through a week of just using it for surfing the web, but I have MiFi.
8684798	8691459	I don't use it anymore because it's $45 a month for just data, whereas I can just tether it to my phone and I get the same shit.
8691699	8696900	Of course, they don't want you to do that, and that's done through a hack, but hey, whatever.
8697340	8700761	It was a relatively easy hack, so it can be done by pretty much anybody.
8701981	8726095	Oh, I know, my phone is the same way, I can do that with mine, but now that, you know, Version Mobile and everybody else, they're capping how much bandwidth you can spend when doing all of this, and guarantee, if everyone's gonna be on these 3G networks gaming, it'll be a funny thing that, as they're gaming, they hit their cap, and you see their network logo saying, sorry, you have used up all your bandwidth, push this button to add more time, or
8726155	8737081	There's no way you'll run through... Unless you're gaming 24-7 over 3G, and a lot of people have Wi-Fi in their houses, there is not going to be a time that you're into a cap problem.
8737121	8738301	It's just not fast enough.
8738822	8739122	I mean...
8741546	8742667	It's going to be rare to do that.
8742687	8746688	That's why they have those caps in place, because those people are using way more data.
8747248	8763213	I've tried streaming stuff on my phone, and it shows me the kind of data it's using, but unless you don't have Wi-Fi in your house, you're just on this 3G and that's it, then maybe it would take some really heavy use.
8763293	8769555	But for most people where they're near Wi-Fi, like I have Wi-Fi at work, I have Wi-Fi at home, there's Wi-Fi here.
8770055	8783123	I mean, I just have, I can bounce on all those with my phone, with my iPod, and there's very rare times that are in between that I actually need to use the 3G for anything, or, you know, my cable goes out or something like that.
8783703	8784183	Fair enough.
8784263	8789947	It's very rare, so I don't think that's really going to be an issue, but, you know, who knows.
8791047	8791708	Yeah, pretty much.
8793075	8804540	Alright, well Ranma, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls Alright, cool, that's cool Alright, take care buddy You got it, bye Alright, we got more calls coming in Why not, let's get to it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8806001	8808602	Yeah, hi Am I on?
8808742	8820588	Yes Oh, okay Yeah, I got a little Confession to make actually I have a really bad crack problem And I don't know I feel that
8821641	8824942	I don't know, playing video games sometimes helps, but I don't know.
8827282	8828202	I just don't know.
8829663	8832203	Well, what caused you to start smoking crack in the first place?
8834423	8838564	It was probably the Nintendo coming out with Mario Sports Mix.
8840044	8841625	Well, that's more of a recent thing.
8841645	8843405	I mean, Sports Mix hasn't really come out yet.
8843465	8845466	No, it's been out for a week.
8845926	8846546	Oh, one week.
8846626	8847906	So you've been addicted to crack for a week.
8851223	8851603	Uh-huh Uh-huh
8874388	8878751	No, I mean, well, I mean, I'm just kind of curious why you and your buddies want to like troll this online radio show.
8878791	8881653	I mean, like, we don't think we're like all that or nothing.
8881893	8883034	We do our show for free.
8883074	8888017	We've kind of worked our asses off for the past nine years to provide the show for free to people on the internet.
8888037	8890759	So I'm just wondering what made it worthy of trolling.
8890799	8891820	I mean, was it something we said?
8891860	8893581	Are you guys just like really fucking bored or what?
8894522	8896103	I think a small penis is involved.
8896123	8896383	Hold on.
8896423	8897984	Let's let the man have his say.
8898004	8898925	We don't need to troll him back.
8899285	8899866	What's up?
8900726	8901567	Just be real with me, dude.
8903754	8907721	Well, actually, we're pretty big fans, actually.
8908322	8910506	We've been looking at it a long time, and we just thought, you know...
8912742	8913602	Sure, okay.
8913762	8922705	So you've been really big fans, so for that you want to call in and talk about your crack problem and spam our picture feed and spam the Twitter account and all that stuff?
8922765	8927446	That's how you show your appreciation for us working our ass off for free for so many years?
8927546	8934369	I mean, if maybe I said something to make the interwebs angry, then cool, let us know.
8934749	8941051	What did we say to bring the wrath of whatever 4chan-y site you guys are with?
8941611	8942371	What's the deal?
8949101	8974328	well yeah just be real dude don't you don't have to like ask your friends for an answer or whatever like I applaud you for not hanging up the phone like a chicken shit when I called you out but like just be real with me what's up what is this all about are you don't you have something you want to promote or plug is there a website behind this whole thing
8978520	8981164	No, to be perfectly honest, this is boredom.
8981585	8982587	This is boredom?
8983308	8983649	Dude!
8983669	8988337	Hey, for the record, this is the only time we've actually done this.
8988517	8988918	I've never...

9015386	9016786	I just, I just, I don't know.
9016866	9017667	I don't get it, dude.
9017847	9019907	Like, I just kind of feel like you're wasting your time.
9020087	9020527	That's all.
9020707	9022488	I mean, but, I mean.
9022508	9023688	That's life.
9023708	9024449	Well, okay, that's cool.
9024509	9025269	And thanks for the hits.

9034212	9037073	But in all seriousness, dude, you guys really are cool.
9037133	9038754	I do like what you guys are doing.
9039314	9041735	We really do listen, and I'm being sincere about that.
9041975	9043315	Alright, you have a funny way of showing it.
9043635	9048777	I know, I'm just saying, you got a funny way of showing it, pal, but I... You know what?
9049097	9053879	I realize it's the internet, and that's the type of stuff we subject ourselves to doing a public show, but I'm just saying...
9055771	9057452	I've heard a lot worse in my lifetime.
9057732	9058152	Seriously.
9058312	9064414	Like, growing up as a gay guy for as many years as I've done and so forth, I've been subjected to a lot worse in my lifetime.
9064875	9068316	So, but... Anyhow, you have a lovely day.
9069236	9069896	Thanks for trolling.
9069916	9070777	Oh, yeah, you too.
9070917	9071477	Alright, bye.
9072778	9075319	At least he's not posting on the internet that I need to get back in the kitchen.
9078140	9079460	Given that I'm not the one that cooks.
9079820	9081221	I still want to know, like...
9082301	9082882	Who is it?
9083102	9083803	Like, just tell me.
9083863	9084664	Baba Booey?
9085185	9085866	You got his number.
9086006	9086767	What's the deal?
9087308	9088469	I do, but you know what?
9088570	9090692	If I give it... I'm not saying give it out.
9090713	9091353	I'm saying track it.
9092815	9093797	It's New York.
9093877	9095779	I don't... And it's one of those, like, I don't...
9096974	9097615	I just want to know.
9098736	9099337	Was it something?
9099717	9101779	Is it because you're a bitch, DarkSakura?
9101819	9102380	You're a bitch?
9102760	9104242	So they got to troll the show because you're a bitch?
9104582	9105063	You know what?
9105483	9105964	Fuck them.
9107445	9108587	That's what I have to say.
9108707	9110188	I can be as much of a bitch as I want.
9110209	9110909	I don't even care.
9110969	9112491	It's giving it more attention than it deserves.
9113672	9115094	Hey, we get answers.
9116235	9116595	That's all.
9117563	9117823	Alright.
9118564	9120525	Hey, who wants to follow that call?
9120545	9124028	1-877-GAME-OLR or use me on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
9124989	9125249	You know what?
9125269	9128152	The folks in chat seems to enjoy that last call.
9128172	9129373	I don't know.
9129873	9130153	Alright.
9134289	9139631	Oh, let's talk a little bit more about Activision and what they're focusing their efforts towards now.
9139911	9145132	Since they're not doing the Guitar Hero franchise, they are continuing on with their toy licensing franchise.
9145172	9147173	You know how they did the games with the Zuzu Pets and stuff.
9147473	9148473	Now with Squinkies!
9148833	9156475	Yes, Squinkies, based off of some sort of toy that's like those 25 cent machines where there's a little crappy toy that comes in the bubble.
9156975	9158456	Well, they're making a game based off that.
9158936	9162477	Also, they're making a game called Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, which has...
9164258	9164758	I don't know what the
9194605	9195266	I don't know what they did.
9195966	9198308	But yes, there's Activision pooping on your franchises.
9199189	9200270	Putting out kids games.
9200810	9203893	Because if it's highly marketable, then they're going to pimp it out.
9204841	9206523	Alright, let's go to some more calls.
9207484	9208384	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
9208404	9208725	Who's this?
9209385	9210186	Legend of Zaku.
9210346	9211287	Hey, my buddy.
9211307	9212128	How are you tonight?
9212788	9213929	Nah, doing pretty good.
9213989	9219975	Just trying to wait for the next day or so when I have to take the girl out for Valentine's Day.
9220615	9225320	And just lamenting over the death of the inevitable guitar hero.
9225380	9226441	We kind of knew that was coming.
9228956	9229536	Are you sad?
9229576	9234180	Are you one of those people that was on Twitter going, RIP Guitar Hero, pouring a 40 in your honor?
9234880	9235941	No, not at all.
9236702	9242406	As a matter of fact, I knew this was going to happen ever since Guitar Hero 3 came out.
9243127	9244548	Actually, no, more like World Tour.
9245168	9255136	That's when they started to have the whole Me Too attitude of, let's just milk the proverbial golden cap dry until we can pummel harmonics, which...
9256115	9257236	and Turn never worked out.
9257736	9259317	See, this is the thing with Activision.
9259917	9265121	In a nutshell, they take good franchises and they just run them and just send them straight to hell.
9265681	9267182	Like what they're going to do with Call of Duty.
9268203	9274647	I mean, when you have five Guitar Hero games out in a single year, that's almost like one per quarter.
9275667	9280691	That goes to show that you just don't give a shit about the franchise.
9281531	9291116	I mean, Konami, on the other hand, they at least make efforts to innovate and just please the hardcore fanbase while picking up the casuals along the way.
9291976	9294178	At least they're having some sort of consistency.
9294378	9305864	I don't know about now, but during their time with the whole DDR series, even with Bomani in general, they just kept it a little bit more consistent and not as bland.
9306164	9306344	Mm-hmm.
9307099	9317523	So, I mean, it's... The way I see it is that Harmonix now is tasked with just, like, trying not to, you know, make the same mistakes as Activision.
9317603	9319384	Obviously, they're well aware of that.
9319544	9322025	But more importantly, they have to innovate.
9322905	9327187	Because that's what made them survive that day.
9327907	9331429	And that's what will keep them going, you know, keep them going forward.
9335117	9345469	What do you think is the reason why, I mean I know you, you have been calling into this show for years, which I totally appreciate, don't get me wrong, especially in light of the last couple calls we've had.
9345569	9348472	You have called in about DDR and all this stuff.
9348492	9356321	What do you think about this whole, why does DDR seem to persevere when I'm not so sure DDR really innovates in the way that some other games do?
9356881	9372612	I mean, you still add, you still have the, I guess the way I see it is that Konami still recognizes that the hardcore players are still the ones that are going to be picking up DDR a lot more than, let's say, the casuals, by a slight edge.
9373332	9376815	So you have to please, you know, they're trying to please both demographics.
9377435	9382719	So they have a multi-pronged approach to their series.
9382919	9383059	Mm-hmm.
9384039	9387822	whereas Activision just treats it like shovelware.
9387862	9394107	Just try to get all the licenses, not really innovate in terms of new gameplay features.
9395008	9400312	What I heard was the most appalling innovation that they had was just the ability to change the guitar skin.
9401113	9410440	Unlike, let's say, Harmonix, which actually allowed you, in the third installment, play with a lot more instruments, like a keyboard.
9411638	9427183	and the ability to play them in pro mode, which says a lot about them, that they're really thinking long term with that whole franchise, whereas Activision just cares about how much money can we make with Guitar Hero in each quarter.
9428959	9431601	It's all about the bottom line Bills, bills, bills
9453038	9471589	Herald heralded that whole video game you know the whole genre into into near disaster or the video game crash I'm pretty sure you know I have a gut feeling that Activision will be the ones that's gonna herald everything to mediocrity like in two years I bet you in two years they're gonna have like a
9471969	9472569	Thank you for watching!
9491610	9491970	All right.
9492391	9494773	Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can go and wrap up the show.
9495153	9498395	But thank you, as always, for your insight, because I know you're passionate about the music games.
9498756	9499216	So I appreciate it.
9499236	9499496	All right.
9499857	9500157	All right.
9500277	9500697	Take care, buddy.
9501278	9501758	Have a good one.
9501958	9502178	Bye.
9503479	9503760	All right.
9503780	9505121	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9505681	9506762	Can't say it wasn't entertaining.
9507202	9507703	There you go.
9508503	9511606	Let's get to the last last minute stories from Loki.
9513474	9515116	Don't think I have much left here.
9516037	9518479	It hasn't been a very exciting Newsweek, all things considered.
9518519	9523964	Outside of the more and more and more stuff getting shut down over at Activision, there's not a lot else to it.
9524124	9526686	Yeah, I think I pretty much covered most of everything.
9529389	9531791	Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.
9532231	9532792	Alrighty then.
9533627	9539268	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we get down to the end of the show tonight.
9540388	9541748	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
9542028	9542689	What's your final thought?
9543829	9547969	You know that face that's really scrunchy that people do for trolls on the internet?
9548250	9548450	Yeah.
9548910	9555591	I kept imagining that call, just that mouth moving back and forward while that guy was talking, and it made me giggle a little bit.
9555611	9556311	That was pretty funny.
9556711	9561332	I actually saw a really funny gif of that with the whole, you mad, you mad, you mad, like rotating around it, and it's just funny.
9562092	9562172	So...
9563226	9564887	The internet, it's fun to be a part of.
9565007	9566308	Alright, Loki, what's your final thought?
9566348	9568870	People need to stop talking like they type on the internet.
9568990	9571972	I mean, it's... Lol, Loki!
9571993	9573914	It's seriously the worst... IKR?
9574715	9577437	It's the worst trend whatsoever.
9577497	9583361	I mean, it's just... Remember how people used to get pissed off at other people with the Ebonics and shit like that?
9583501	9584842	It's just getting worse.
9585002	9585162	ZOMG!
9586363	9589565	It's like, okay, yeah, we understand you mistyped on a keyboard.
9589585	9590485	Ha ha, that's funny.
9591286	9593367	You don't need to talk like that because you sound like an idiot.
9593807	9594667	I will say one thing.
9594728	9596849	We found OMG Yogurt and they were pretty good.
9598469	9601391	What is up with all these yogurt explosion chains recently?
9601451	9601951	It's crazy.
9602492	9604533	Oh, and I hate Kotaku's new layout.
9604573	9606494	I should say Gawker's new layout.
9606554	9612377	So, you know, sometimes you don't need to improve something because it's fine the way it was.
9613638	9614699	See, now go troll that.
9614759	9616059	That's a reason to go troll.
9616119	9623123	Well, trolling our website is like stalking Kathy Griffith or something like that.
9623183	9625404	It's just like, seriously, who cares?
9625724	9627725	I mean, no one cares.
9628505	9633228	And honestly, we don't get a lot of page hits, so no one's really going to notice that you're trolling.
9634928	9663222	whatever the more we talk about it the more they're going to be like we should do it again my final thought I want to do more traveling and I'm thinking a trip to Seattle would need to be in the near future possibly around Labor Day possibly you're telling me a different time because other traveling in March I'm thinking about a particular expo that goes on in Seattle every year anyhow we'll have to talk about that offline
9663908	9665469	Alright, anyhow, that's it.
