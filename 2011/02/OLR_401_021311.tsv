0	19080	Today, February 13th, 2011, there will be no more hero games at Activision.
19080	23680	A survey hints at details on Dance Central 2, and could your PlayStation 3 games soon
23680	32160	require a serial number registration?
32160	35160	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35160	38340	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
38340	42760	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
42760	45480	First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
45480	46480	Hi.
46480	48120	How are you, Miss Sommers?
48120	49760	I am dropping stuff.
49760	50760	Oh no.
50760	56200	That's not a good way to start off the 401st episode of our show into the next 100.
56200	57200	Think we'll make it to 500?
57200	58200	Sure.
58200	59200	Why not?
59200	60200	Why not?
60200	61200	Exactly.
61200	62200	I got nothing else to do.
62200	63200	I got nothing better to do.
63200	64200	Why not?
64200	65200	All right.
65200	66200	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
66200	67200	Hello.
67200	68200	All right.
68200	69200	How are you, Loki?
69200	70200	I'm fine.
70200	71200	Good.
71200	72200	Good to hear.
72200	73200	How's the baby doing?
73200	74200	It's doing okay.
74200	76520	I enjoy reading the wife's blogs about the baby.
76520	80880	That's interesting because I don't have a child, but it seems like everybody around
80880	85000	me, not everybody, but many people around me are starting to enter that, take that step.
85000	86000	Yeah.
86000	87000	It's kind of interesting to hear the stories.
87000	88000	Yeah.
88000	89760	You will see posts once a month.
89760	92280	And it just reminds me, I'm getting old.
92280	95680	So have you thought about what the baby's first video game should be?
95680	97720	Well, he's already played Grand Theft Auto, so.
97720	99120	Wait a minute.
99120	101200	You let your baby play Grand Theft Auto?
101200	102200	Yeah.
102200	105960	He can't really hold the controller well, but he had it at the point where he had one
105960	110520	hand on the left analog stick and the other hand on the trigger and he was driving around.
110520	114080	So technically that is playing Grand Theft Auto.
114080	121120	Granted, he doesn't know what he's doing, but he had an Xbox 360 controller and he played.
121120	122720	He didn't kill anything.
122720	125240	He just was driving around.
125240	128360	That's a story to tell him when he's like 13.
128360	130520	Did you know your first game was Grand Theft Auto?
130520	136280	Because by then they'll be up to Grand Theft Auto 17 or whatever.
136280	140640	Anyhow, let's also introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show.
140640	144480	We don't have anybody else in the studio tonight, sadly, but we do have of course the chat room.
144480	148960	We are the show where every gamer has a voice and have been that way since 2002.
148960	153040	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be if you want to join us in our chat room.
153040	157360	We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after
157360	160760	the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
160760	165120	But if you want to join our chat room, you can do that at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
165120	166580	What's this?
166580	167580	You took video.
167580	168580	Oh my.
168580	172600	You actually have a little picture of Josh playing the 360 controller.
172600	173600	That is adorable.
173600	176200	That is really adorable.
176200	179080	By the way, my secondary theme for tonight's show.
179080	180080	What's that?
180080	181080	That's so cute.
181080	182080	What's that, Darcy?
182080	184640	Is posting random stuff in the chat room.
184640	187480	posting random stuff in the chat room just because?
187480	194460	Yeah I found a neat article in Cracked about Easter eggs hidden in albums and I think we
194460	198720	need to start doing Easter eggs in our episodes.
198720	199720	Our episodes need...
199720	203760	Like we have an epic burp and you run it through a spectrograph and it's a picture of a puppy.
203760	208720	We need to have a wrong answer of the show actually to steal a bit from the new You Don't
208720	211720	Know Jack game, which we'll get into in a little bit because it is that time of the
211720	212720	show.
212720	213720	How was your gaming week?
213720	216920	My gaming week was good.
216920	227600	I played on my Worgen, who I'm actually doing the leveling stuff, like the profession leveling,
227600	230840	which makes real leveling so much slower.
230840	235000	Seriously, I'm like, this is why I didn't do this crap before.
235000	242760	Of course now I'm doing all that crap on my level 85 character, so I'm like ehh.
242760	248400	I also have Final Fantasy III on the DS, which is pretty cool so far.
248400	249880	I'm very happy with it.
249880	253560	Wow, it's a couple years old at this point, which no problem with that.
253560	257720	I mean sometimes we don't get around to playing games for years, so that happens.
257720	260280	But what put you in the mood?
260280	263880	Just you're like, I want an RPG where I can fight or run.
263880	269560	We were at Dimple and we had some leftover credit because we traded in a ton of our old
269560	272460	DVDs that we had either replaced or just were crap.
272460	276280	Local music chain, by the way, which also sells games used new.
276280	278140	So we were like, well, let's just go ahead and use up our credit.
278140	281240	So I picked a game and Dan picked a game and then we said, well, let's use our discount
281240	282240	card.
282240	286120	It turned out we still had $5 left when we were done because we thought we were using
286120	287120	it all up.
287120	289360	So we still have credit there, so I guess we're going to go back and get that again.
289360	291320	I still have no idea what the discount card's for.
291320	293360	I probably have like a ton of stuff on that card.
293360	296400	You get like a random 50% off on your purchases or something.
296400	299800	Am I a bad person because I don't really shop at music stores anymore.
299800	301440	Not since Tower Records went under.
301440	303800	You know, that was, that was my chain was Tower Records.
303800	305680	I used to buy import CDs from Tower Records.
305680	309600	This is before the Interwebs or when Interwebs was all dial up, right?
309600	313360	When, when Orange Tons Radio had a 56k friendly stream, right?
313360	314360	That's that was a while ago.
314360	317440	That's when I was shopping at Tower Records before they went under and maybe Virgin Megastore
317440	318440	once in a while.
318440	322580	Oh, Virgin was awesome for import CDs, but now I have an activator at Virgin.
322580	325440	When I buy CDs, like it's Best Buy.
325440	327160	Does that make me a bad person?
327160	330700	When I buy CDs, I go on Amazon.
330700	332960	And I buy the MP3 downloads.
332960	336040	If I bought, if I want them that badly.
336040	339620	Actually this might make me really bad, but the last CD I bought was the Tron soundtrack.
339620	341620	I bought that at Target.
341620	347160	So well actually the last CD that I bought was the Tron soundtrack and I bought it on
347160	348160	Amazon.
348160	351080	So there we go.
351080	356520	I like having the MP3s, you know, we are trying to downsize our packaging.
356520	357520	This is perfect.
357520	363280	And on top of that, Amazon tends to have like $5 specials, like they had CeeLo Green's album
363280	366200	for $5.
366200	374000	And they're all DRM free on top of it, which is, I mean now iTunes is too and you can convert
374000	382000	from their format, but it really is just super convenient to get it all on Amazon.
382000	388000	Yeah I was, I was playing some Final Fantasy III while I was waiting around for stuff.
388000	392080	And I started Oregon Trail today and I'm like, oh, the Facebook one?
392080	393080	I didn't like it.
393080	396280	I played it for like five seconds and I was like, this just, this is overcomplicating
396280	397280	it.
397280	398280	This game has died of dysentery.
398280	399280	Exactly.
399280	400280	I think that's the best way to put it.
400280	406160	The thing that gets it is that buying the tickets, now I'll just go download an Apple
406160	408040	MU and play it that way.
408040	409720	The magic is gone.
409720	410720	The magic is kind of gone.
410720	412400	I have some friends that are into it on Facebook.
412400	413400	That's cool.
413400	414400	That's what you're into.
414400	415400	Look, I have no right to judge anyone.
415400	418240	I've been playing that Knights of the Clicky game for forever, although I haven't touched
418240	421080	it in like a week, but I wasn't feeling Oregon Trail.
421080	422080	I'm three weeks clean on it, Rob.
422080	423080	Are you really?
423080	425000	You should get like a sober sticker for that.
425000	426000	That's amazing.
426000	427000	Good for you.
427000	431880	Um, speaking, rewinding the MMOs a bit, like I don't want to dwell on wow too much, but
431880	435200	I will tell you one thing I've kind of been looking at as a lot of Warcraft players and
435200	438560	other MMO players have been looking at, there's this new game coming out called Rift.
438560	440600	Have you read it at all about this game?
440600	444040	Is it like based based off of the tabletop rifts?
444040	450120	I'm not sure because I don't know enough about that scene, but look at some of the YouTubes
450120	452480	on Rift and tell me what you think.
452480	455200	Also while you're at it, look at videos because we were doing this the other night.
455200	459400	Look at videos for Guild Wars 2 and tell me what you think because I played Guild Wars
459400	460400	for a while.
460400	462800	Guild Wars 2 much different than Guild Wars 1.
462800	467520	Take a look and see if either of those might woo you from wow for a little bit.
467520	472440	Well, it better not because Dan doesn't want to buy any more games.
472440	475560	Well the good news is Rift has an open beta starting like really really soon.
475560	478240	So take a look at those while we talk about it.
478240	482160	Look at some of the videos on YouTube, especially some of the PVP looks really pretty.
482160	484240	I know you're not into PVP, but it has both.
484240	485520	I've started doing PVP.
485520	486520	Have you really?
486520	487520	Well I've done the battles.
487520	488520	Oh.
488520	489520	I need to get you back on Horde House and talk about that.
489520	495860	Because our friend and listener got me PVP gear.
495860	496860	Good times.
496860	497860	Good times.
497860	498860	Alright.
498860	499860	Let's move on to Loki.
499860	500860	How was your gaming week?
500860	502480	Didn't play a whole lot this week.
502480	506760	Mainly just a few things, sword and poker too.
506760	512820	Still playing that in iOS and it's this last dungeon taking forever, but it's fun still
512820	518640	and I just unlocked more weapons I can buy, but they're really expensive so I have to
518640	521860	grind some more dungeons for that.
521860	527880	And then I played Marvel vs. Capcom 3, a little bit of that.
527880	529120	Yeah, that too.
529120	533040	That's an awesome, awesome, awesome game.
533040	538680	I'm not very good at those types of games, but it is somewhat button masher friendly.
538680	544720	I wouldn't say I'm just like a button masher, but I don't have any real strategy into it,
544720	545720	you know?
545720	549840	It's just like, okay I know the basic moves and stuff like that.
549840	550840	Let's see what happens.
550840	552400	I feel it out.
552400	554160	No like 50 hit combos for me or anything like that.
554160	556040	Did you say you're just feeling it up?
556040	557040	Feeling it out.
557040	561040	Okay, I was gonna say, cause there's some pretty, you know, boobtastic characters in
561040	562040	there.
562040	567800	Um, and then, you know, Grant the thought of, you know, usual.
567800	568800	That's a must for you.
568800	569800	Exactly.
569800	576360	I will replay that at work, so, you know, obviously I'm gonna play more of that.
576360	577360	Alright, that it?
577360	580480	Um, I think so.
580480	583840	Let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.
583840	587880	I was just noticing there real quick, the dwarven women don't look like men.
587880	588880	You're watching a video for Rift, I see.
588880	592440	Actually, I wanted to talk about it, cause our chatters are now mentioning the game.
592440	597160	Dungeonbuster in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com starts us off saying, the MMO Rift is not
597160	602520	based off the PnP1 Dark Soccer, I'm assuming that means pen and paper, but I think it's
602520	607960	being sued because of the name, so there's a whole little Rift going on there.
607960	614760	But, really though, I don't think they have our thing, because the game is Rift, and it's
614760	619880	abbreviated, and this is just Rift.
619880	624120	Derek H., our pal from Dead Pixel Live, also on the All Games Network, wants to plug, he
624120	627960	actually had the executive producer of Rift on last week, so if you want to check that
627960	633520	out at deadpixellive.com, you can hear that whole little interview.
633520	636840	How did he get all these big name interviews when we weren't looking?
636840	637840	That's pretty awesome.
637840	638840	Good for you.
638840	642680	Let's see, chat.orangelandradio.com for more comments here.
642680	646680	Ziba is saying, I am loving Rift and can't wait for Guild Wars 2.
646680	648680	So both those games are getting a lot of buzz.
648680	654640	And of course, everybody's always gonna ask, which one of these is gonna be the WoW killer?
654640	655640	Probably neither.
655640	659280	I'll tell you, you know what, I will tell you what the WoW killer will ultimately be.
659280	662980	I can already tell you, I will look at my crystal ball, I will tell you what game is
662980	663980	the WoW killer.
663980	664980	You ready?
664980	665980	WoW 2?
665980	666980	No, WoW.
666980	667980	WoW 2?
667980	668980	Yeah.
668980	669980	WoW is the WoW killer.
669980	671880	Wait and see.
671880	673200	That sounds very suicidal.
673200	676960	Well, no, because, well, who?
676960	677960	More like a...
677960	679180	How did the Roman Empire fall?
679180	681180	Because the Roman Empire.
681180	687560	More to quote an old Loki quote, an old old Loki quote, ow, I just shot myself in the
687560	688560	foot.
688560	690280	Why are you shooting me in the foot?
690280	691560	Rob, can I pet this?
691560	694560	Oh, is that Guild Wars 2 now you're looking at?
694560	695560	Yes.
695560	697520	It's a great radio, by the way, when you're sitting there going, ooh, pretty.
697520	701400	You should post some of those links in chat just so people can take a peek for themselves.
701400	703600	No, you have to imagine it.
703600	708640	This place makes Stormwind look like an easy to navigate one lane street.
708640	713480	All right, let me talk about my gaming week and some of the games I play this week.
713480	717480	Mostly the same type of stuff, it's been somewhat of a slow month in gaming, just like it has
717480	718480	been movies.
718480	721560	There's not been a lot of new stuff, so, you know, more WoW, yeah, okay.
721560	722780	But I did play one new game.
722780	726040	One game kind of came out and it was kind of one of those blink and you might have missed
726040	727040	it games.
727040	731760	I played You Don't Know Jack, the brand new game that just came out from THQ with Jellyvision,
731760	734600	of course, who made the old You Don't Know Jack.
734600	738240	So maybe it's not really a brand new game because it's more like, hey, remember the
738240	739240	90s?
739240	740760	Because these games were huge in the 90s.
740760	745240	You Don't Know Jack and You Don't Know Jack the Ride, which I want to say originally was
745240	747040	a Sierra thing.
747040	748520	I could be wrong on that.
748520	750960	Somebody might correct me on that in the chat room.
750960	753760	But that could explain why the long hiatus.
753760	758400	But regardless of how it happened, THQ has now put out a You Don't Know Jack game for
758400	761760	the current generation of consoles and it's everywhere.
761760	767200	It's PC, it's 360, PlayStation, it's everywhere.
767200	771320	And the 360 is the version I played and I was at a little party with some friends last
771320	774240	night and we were playing the new You Don't Know Jack game.
774240	777840	And the good news is it is pretty much what I remember.
777840	781640	It is a funny, quick, polished trivia game.
781640	784840	Lots of jokes, just kind of like run one after the other.
784840	787520	That almost kind of dry sense of humor.
787520	792440	I don't want to say British sense of humor, not that dry, but just really like no nonstop
792440	793440	pun after pun.
793440	798720	And there's these weird kind of like pop culture references to the whole thing and a lot of
798720	799720	it's very current.
799720	802760	Like, what is the internet love more than anything right now?
802760	803760	Kitties.
803760	809560	So there's, you know, this whole bonus game, I will say, or a themed question that involves
809560	812440	kittens acting out a movie and you have to guess what movie it is.
812440	813480	It's really funny.
813480	819360	So yeah, a lot of that same old humor, same announcer that they had back in the day, Cookie,
819360	821560	is still there.
821560	825400	The game is 30 bucks, so it's a nice little deal.
825400	828200	73 episodes for 30 bucks.
828200	832760	So that is a little bit like, oh, I kind of thought these games had more questions in
832760	833760	the nineties.
833760	838840	So that is a little bit of a tiny step back because it's 73 episodes for 30 bucks.
838840	842840	So what, 50 cents an episode, 40 cents an episode maybe?
842840	844640	You can also download expansions.
844640	846360	I believe three are planned right now.
846360	849180	One is up already, 10 more episodes for five bucks.
849180	851380	So that is 50 cents an episode.
851380	857800	So the value of this game, I would really ask you how much value you're going to get
857800	859480	in like a party atmosphere.
859480	863760	Now the good news is you can play this on Xbox Live, but I think this would be the absolute
863760	868560	worst possible game you could play on Xbox Live with strangers.
868560	869560	I really do.
869560	872360	I think it would suck all the fun out of the game because you know you're going to have
872360	876660	people out there with a finite number of episodes who already know the answers to all the questions
876660	877660	and so on.
877660	880240	I just think that part, it might be a little bit ridiculous.
880240	884660	However, playing with trusted friends, I think it could be a great Xbox Live game.
884660	889200	So one of those, and of course when I say Xbox Live, obviously PlayStation has its comparable
889200	890200	thing.
890200	894320	PC does not, which I find very interesting, but that's why the PC version is only 20 bucks.
894320	896320	So even more value there.
896320	901240	And also, I mean, there's not a lot of people that would play that multiplayer on a PC.
901240	903720	You know, wouldn't it be kind of hard to play that multiplayer on a PC?
903720	904720	No, not really.
904720	905720	It's where I play my WoW.
905720	906720	So it's...
906720	910500	Yeah, but I meant like, you know, with friends, you know what I mean?
910500	914040	There's no real, you're not going to have like four controllers or something like that,
914040	915040	you know?
915040	916040	Yeah, yeah.
916040	917040	I get what you're saying.
917040	918040	Yeah.
918040	919760	It's a little tough there, I guess.
919760	920760	I don't know.
920760	921760	I don't own the PC versions.
921760	922760	I don't know how they do it.
922760	923920	I don't know if you can have the little buzzers or whatever.
923920	929040	I do hear, though, on the PlayStation 3 version, you can use the actual game buzz controllers
929040	930640	and you don't know Jack, which is nice.
930640	931640	That's cool.
931640	933800	You can get a little more use out of those things.
933800	936880	I think single player will only be funny for so long.
936880	941720	The good news is it is a funny game, so you'll get your lols out of it.
941720	945120	But I think the game works best in a party atmosphere.
945120	948880	So I think the question would really be, are you going to be able to bring this to a party
948880	950720	and get use out of this?
950720	952440	If so, it might be worth your money.
952440	958040	And I think it's been mildly successful so far, because I mean, it sold okay, but it's
958040	961840	something I could figure that will probably drop in price relatively quickly.
961840	965400	Something to keep in the back of your mind, the way they did the episodes is a little
965400	966400	weird.
966400	971400	If you take your game from place to place, you're more likely to see repeats, so just
971400	972520	be careful.
972520	977660	If you really want to be smart, copy your game data to a memory card or a USB stick
977660	979840	if you're going to take the game from place to place.
979840	982980	That way the game remembers what episodes you've already seen, otherwise you're really
982980	984760	setting yourself up for repeats.
984760	987600	The game is pretty good about knowing which episodes you've already seen, especially if
987600	989400	you're going to go on Xbox Live.
989400	993640	But if you take it from one place to another, it's not going to know, because it's a new
993640	994960	Xbox, right?
994960	996640	And there's nothing to read from.
996640	1002320	So you're going to see repeats, because you only have so many episodes in the beginning.
1002320	1005160	So I just kind of wanted to throw that out there, just a word of caution.
1005160	1007820	The way they did that is a little weird.
1007820	1013760	So You Don't Know Jack, very polished, very funny, constant giggles from the group we
1013760	1015020	were playing with.
1015020	1020840	I think it's a good value, you know, 50 cents for a game is, you know, gosh, you go to Dave
1020840	1024960	and Busters and throw them way money faster than that on those stupid crane games or skeeball
1024960	1025960	or whatever.
1025960	1028320	So I think it's a decent value.
1028320	1034040	Maybe a few more questions for the buck or maybe a different way to randomize them or
1034040	1036080	something, maybe could be the feedback.
1036080	1040560	But I will save that for You Don't Know Jack 2, which I do hope happens at this point,
1040560	1042660	or whatever they're going to end up calling it.
1042660	1046180	So I definitely give the game a favorable review, especially if you like these game
1046180	1047300	show games.
1047300	1050720	This blows that seen it shit out of the water.
1050720	1056160	Like seriously, like this is the like definitive trivia party game.
1056160	1059520	The only possible contender maybe is Buzz on the PS3.
1059520	1061400	And if you have the Xbox, you don't really have that.
1061400	1063360	So this this blows that seen it shit out of the water.
1063360	1064720	This is much better.
1064720	1066080	So take a look.
1066080	1069740	Anyhow, that was really it for my gaming week.
1069740	1073080	So let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
1073080	1074960	Some housekeeping.
1074960	1078400	There was some I don't want to say late breaking news, but it just happened a little earlier.
1078400	1080340	We're competing against the Grammys tonight.
1080340	1082500	You know, last week it was the Super Bowl.
1082500	1084080	Tonight it's the Grammys and two weeks.
1084080	1085080	It's what the Oscars.
1085080	1086560	It's like we just can't fucking wait.
1086560	1088840	But no one cares about everything is on Sunday.
1088840	1092180	So every all the good stuff is going to be on YouTube if you want to see Gaga hatch out
1092180	1093180	of an egg.
1093180	1094180	It'll be on YouTube later.
1094180	1099080	I need to think of a good name to call the Grammys because I have the Super Bowl.
1099080	1100080	Yeah.
1100080	1105040	So Grammys should be the shammy's.
1105040	1107980	I like Kathy Griffin's the shmemmies or whatever.
1107980	1108980	That's for the daytime Emmys.
1108980	1109980	Yeah, exactly.
1109980	1112040	Or the this the technical ones or whatever.
1112040	1115760	Anyway, besides by the way, speaking Kathy Griffin, just because I love that bitch.
1115760	1117000	I got to give a shout out.
1117000	1119640	She hears she's going to have a brand new show on Broadway, really.
1119640	1122880	It's only going to be on for like a week in March, but it's called Ready.
1122880	1124540	Best name for a show ever ready.
1124540	1127240	Kathy Griffin wants a Tony.
1127240	1132040	Anyhow, but this isn't the Kathy Griffin podcast.
1132040	1133040	I love her.
1133040	1134980	She's just really fucking funny.
1134980	1137160	I will listen to her like stand up while I play.
1137160	1138160	Wow.
1138160	1139160	Like I listen to a lot of random stuff.
1139160	1140160	I play.
1140160	1141160	I listen to podcasts.
1141160	1142160	Wow.
1142160	1143160	I listen to wow.
1143160	1144160	Podcast while I play.
1144160	1145160	Wow.
1145160	1146160	It's very meta.
1146160	1147160	Whole thing.
1147160	1148160	Very meta.
1148160	1149160	Anyway.
1149160	1151080	Like like when I was in Blade's Edge and we were on Blade's Edge.
1151080	1152080	Yes.
1152080	1153080	Very meta.
1153080	1156080	What was I going to say?
1156080	1157080	Oh yeah.
1157080	1158080	The Grammys.
1158080	1159080	That song won a Grammy.
1159080	1163640	The Baba Yetu from Civilization 4, which is a really great song if you've never heard
1163640	1164640	it.
1164640	1165640	I'll have to fire up a clip here.
1165640	1166640	I wasn't really prepared to play it.
1166640	1167640	Oops.
1167640	1170240	It won a Grammy, which is funny because the song is actually kind of old.
1170240	1175640	Like it's been out for a little while because Civilization 4 was kind of what it was written
1175640	1176640	for.
1176640	1177640	But here's how it works.
1177640	1179960	You see, it didn't win for being in Civilization 4.
1179960	1187720	The artist, Christopher Tin, put it in his recent CD that he released and the CD, the
1187720	1191800	song from the CD won and I believe he actually won a Grammy for the whole CD as well.
1191800	1193280	He won two Grammys tonight.
1193280	1195800	So here's a clip if you've never heard this.
1195800	1200220	Like seriously, if you haven't played Civilization 4, A, you're missing one of the best pieces
1200220	1205320	of PC games ever, and B, you haven't had a chance to just sit on the title screen and
1205320	1206320	listen to this.
1206320	1222600	This song just kind of like make you feel like, oh yeah, I'm going to rule the world.
1222600	1233200	This is going to be a military victory game.
1233200	1235080	Oh my God, this is offensive to Islam.
1235080	1236080	Shut up.
1236080	1237080	Oh, I'm sorry.
1237080	1238600	That was a little big planet.
1238600	1239600	My mistake.
1239600	1244680	Anyhow, by the way, if you've never played Civilization, you are missing out.
1244680	1248480	It really is like the greatest frickin' one of the, one of, I shouldn't say the greatest,
1248480	1251840	but one of the greatest game series there is.
1251840	1256520	And I even think, like, if you're like a console, you're like, I don't do games on PC, maybe,
1256520	1257680	wow, that's it.
1257680	1260800	Even the console games are really worth your time, and I think they're great entry-level
1260800	1262320	Civilization games anyway.
1262320	1263320	But I digress.
1263320	1268000	Congratulations, Christopher Tin, on his two Grammys, which is, if you think about it,
1268000	1271200	kind of the first time that a song written for a video game has ended up winning a Grammy,
1271200	1273160	even if it took a weird way to get there.
1273160	1274160	So congrats.
1274160	1275160	That's amazing.
1275160	1279200	All right, let's get into some more video game news tonight, the stuff that's not late-breaking
1279200	1281520	but still is going on in the world of gaming this week.
1281520	1283800	Loki's gonna start us off, as always.
1283800	1284800	Yeah.
1284800	1289120	Okay, so this is kind of funny, and although it was fixed, and I'm sure that the person
1289120	1295560	that runs Kevin, you know, runs Kevin Butler's fake account for the fake person probably
1295560	1297480	didn't understand what was going on here.
1297480	1307200	But anyways, the person that ran the Kevin Butler on Twitter accidentally reposted the
1307200	1311680	key for, or one of the keys to the PlayStation 3.
1311680	1314840	Remember the whole lawsuit going on, because the keys got leaked out.
1314840	1320840	Anyways, this is the key that turned out to be one used in the hack through the USB dong,
1320840	1323680	which I don't think anyone even really uses anymore.
1323680	1330320	But nonetheless, they retweeted it, so let me guess, you sank my battleship, and then
1330320	1333240	they retweeted the key.
1333240	1334240	So it was...
1334240	1335240	46DC.
1335240	1336240	Oh, forget it.
1336240	1341880	Yeah, so, of course, you know, it was later removed off the Twitter account, but it is
1341880	1342880	still funny.
1342880	1347600	Kind of like, oh, hey, someone's not paying attention.
1347600	1351480	Hopefully no one got fired over it, but, you know, still funny.
1351480	1357240	Well, like, if you don't know what it is, which I'm sure whoever runs this account on
1357240	1361000	behalf of the Kevin Butler character probably didn't know what it was.
1361000	1364600	I mean, you know, if I didn't do this show, I wouldn't know what that is.
1364600	1367720	Actually, even doing this show, I would look at that and go, why is someone speaking to
1367720	1368720	me in hex?
1368720	1370000	Like, what is your problem?
1370000	1373600	Exactly, and it doesn't even look, I mean, come on.
1373600	1377920	That does not look anything like battleship numbers.
1377920	1384120	Well, I mean, but if you're kind of that snarky character that Kevin Butler's supposed to
1384120	1387800	be, it does look like that a little bit, so.
1387800	1389960	Huge Sony faux pas, or they'll get over...
1389960	1395040	I think that the funnier thing about this is that all these blogs are reporting on it
1395040	1397200	with a screenshot of the tweet.
1397200	1400840	So now the tweet has been seen by, like, ten times as many people as would have seen it
1400840	1402640	originally.
1402640	1405560	I don't know why it's really funny, but it is.
1405560	1406560	It's irony, Rob.
1406560	1407560	There you go.
1407560	1408560	Irony.
1408560	1412240	So, before we get into the next story, I got derailed by something in the chat room.
1412240	1416360	I just think this is kind of neat, like, I only have kind of heard of this.
1416360	1419080	Like, have you ever heard of this thing called Get Glue?
1419080	1420080	I've never...
1420080	1421080	It's like a Foursquare.
1421080	1424160	Imagine, like, Foursquare for just stuff.
1424160	1429600	Like a video game you're playing, or you could check in if, I mean, you know how Foursquare
1429600	1430600	works?
1430600	1431920	You check in to, like...
1431920	1433240	And then you cheat while you're driving by?
1433240	1437920	I'm at Pinkberry, and I'm checking in so I can be the mayor, and if my friends are nearby,
1437920	1438920	I'll get a text message.
1438920	1441520	Well, now they have this thing called Get Glue where you can check into movies you're
1441520	1442520	watching or whatever.
1442520	1446560	I just got told that Orange Lawn's Radio has a Get Glue page, and we have people that check
1446560	1448560	in to listening to this on Sunday night.
1448560	1450040	I just thought that was really cool.
1450040	1451120	So I want to give a shout out to that.
1451120	1454520	So if you're listening to this on the podcast or whatever, you should check in on Get Glue.
1454520	1455520	Sweet.
1455520	1459500	That'd be a nice way to help spread the word of O-L-R. And I noticed that some of the related
1459500	1463600	ones happen to be, like, All Games or Video Game Outsiders, which is also on the network.
1463600	1464600	It's just kind of funny.
1464600	1465600	And For Real.
1465600	1466840	Yeah, I've never...
1466840	1467840	Who's For Real?
1467840	1470400	Is that the...
1470400	1473400	Is that the band from the 90s that did I Like to Move It, Move It?
1473400	1474560	Is that who For Real is?
1474560	1475560	I think it is.
1475560	1476560	I think it is.
1476560	1477560	All right.
1477560	1478560	Anyway.
1478560	1479560	Sorry.
1479560	1480560	I'm getting off track.
1480560	1481560	That's a little obscure, Rob.
1481560	1482560	It is very obscure.
1482560	1483560	All right.
1483560	1484560	Yes.
1484560	1485560	Well, it says they were on the...
1485560	1488360	No, it's the one that did...
1488360	1490000	It was a remix of something.
1490000	1491000	It was on Max.
1491000	1497400	I just don't remember what the hell it was now.
1497400	1500320	I'm telling you, For Real did I Like to Move It, Move It.
1500320	1502320	This is so stupid that we're having this conversation.
1502320	1503840	Oh, Highs Off of You.
1503840	1504840	That's what it was.
1504840	1506840	Did that song, I guess.
1506840	1508440	I don't remember.
1508440	1511440	Moving on.
1511440	1513960	Away from the 90s and into today.
1513960	1515760	Let's talk about the Xperia Play.
1515760	1520320	The Xperia Play is the Sony PlayStation phone, for lack of a better term.
1520320	1521520	This is basically what it is.
1521520	1522520	It's kind of cute.
1522520	1527320	It's like a little PlayStation Go, but this time it actually has a phone in it, so there's
1527320	1530080	kind of like a lot of purpose to be getting this.
1530080	1532240	Xperia Play is, of course, the new smartphone.
1532240	1533840	It is coming out in early spring.
1533840	1536720	It will be on Verizon's network.
1536720	1537920	That's what they're saying.
1537920	1545280	There was a Sony Ericsson MWC 2011 press conference where this Xperia Play got its launch window.
1545280	1547280	It's going to be coming out in March.
1547280	1552640	The U.S. will be one of the first destinations, and Verizon will be the first carrier for
1552640	1553640	the phone.
1553640	1560120	They don't say that it will be the only carrier for the phone, just that it will be the first.
1560120	1564760	So it's been a pretty good year for Verizon so far, between the iPhone and this.
1564760	1568960	Yeah, but carrier makes me think of a disease carrier.
1568960	1571280	I imagine some of the other carriers will be getting this, too.
1571280	1574520	And for folks that are maybe like, I'm not feeling the iPhone.
1574520	1575720	I'm more of a gamer.
1575720	1579800	I think this is going to be a pretty good choice for them.
1579800	1584400	Now, by the way, just so you know, the Xperia Play, it's supposed to be preloaded with what
1584400	1588500	they are saying is a legendary PlayStation 1 game.
1588500	1591440	It's also going to come with 50 different games from 20 publishers.
1591440	1592440	Not built in.
1592440	1593440	You're going to have to buy them.
1593440	1595000	The legendary game is supposed to be Ridge Racer.
1595000	1596000	It is.
1596000	1598240	No, they're not saying that.
1598240	1601640	That's just according to Kazurai.
1601640	1605480	They haven't said exactly what the game is yet.
1605480	1607480	So it's probably Ridge Racer.
1607480	1609880	It could be, but that would be a Namco game, so I don't know.
1609880	1612840	I kind of think it would come from Sony's first party itself.
1612840	1614440	So I don't know.
1614440	1619400	I'm going to just, I'm going to say, I'm going to be weird and say Twisted Metal.
1619400	1620400	I don't know why.
1620400	1624280	It seems like an easy game to put there.
1624280	1625280	So we'll see.
1625280	1632000	Uh, by the way, I think it will be something from Sony in house.
1632000	1634120	I don't think it's going to bring the third party into play.
1634120	1636120	It's going to be Irritating Stick.
1636120	1637120	Oh, I'm sorry.
1637120	1641120	I don't know why when you said that I thought Grand Theft Auto.
1641120	1642120	And I do that all the time.
1642120	1644020	No, but Grand Theft Auto should be on there.
1644020	1645520	Those two games couldn't be any more different.
1645520	1646520	You're right.
1646520	1647520	Grand Turismo would be a good choice.
1647520	1648520	It would be a very good choice.
1648520	1652520	Just so you know, most of the games that will be coming out for the device, they are ports
1652520	1653800	of course of other games.
1653800	1658480	I noticed there's actually a little Guitar Hero logo in here, which is really funny considering
1658480	1660560	what we're going to talk about in a minute.
1660560	1666240	But yeah, some of the other games that will be there, Assassin's Creed, Dead Space, Battlefield,
1666240	1667240	FIFA.
1667240	1670640	A multiplayer FIFA game in mobile.
1670640	1671640	What's that?
1671640	1672640	So, all right.
1672640	1676640	All right, well let's move on with some more news.
1676640	1679680	Actually, wait, before we do, anyone going to get one of these here in studio?
1679680	1680680	Anyone in chat?
1680680	1681680	No.
1681680	1682680	Going to pick up the Xperia?
1682680	1683680	No.
1683680	1684680	Yeah, I know.
1684680	1685680	It's kind of like...
1685680	1686680	I have a PSP.
1686680	1687680	I have a PSP.
1687680	1688680	I have an iPhone and I'm locked into the iPhone contract.
1688680	1689680	I can't go run out and get another phone.
1689680	1690680	I wouldn't care anyway.
1690680	1691680	You know what?
1691680	1694100	I keep getting flashbacks to the N-Gage.
1694100	1696280	And that was pretty bad.
1696280	1698200	I think this will be better than the N-Gage though.
1698200	1699680	Let's be real.
1699680	1700680	Let's be for real.
1700680	1705560	If you want to play PlayStation 1 games on the go, just buy a PSP.
1705560	1711000	Hell, just buy a PSP-1000 and you can do it just as well.
1711000	1719160	Except you don't have the dual sort of analog sticks, you know what I mean?
1719160	1722880	If I want to play PS1 games on the go, I'll just bring my PS1 with me.
1722880	1723880	Amen.
1723880	1730000	And get a mobile monitor, which I think I've still got one somewhere.
1730000	1732760	I'm a little bit disgusted though, Rob.
1732760	1733880	Why is that?
1733880	1736520	That is about our next news story.
1736520	1737520	Disgusted.
1737520	1738520	Completely.
1738520	1739520	Well, out with it.
1739520	1740520	What's going on?
1740520	1747040	Well, I'm sure many people know already, but the Hero franchise has gone...
1747040	1754060	Activision is discontinuing development of Guitar Hero for 2011 and disbanding their
1754060	1756000	business unit.
1756000	1757840	And guess what else is included with that?
1757840	1761040	That's going to be DJ Hero as well.
1761040	1767200	They're not going to be releasing the new download content packs beyond what they already
1767200	1769920	have, and nothing new will be made.
1769920	1775600	However, you can still download everything that's there now.
1775600	1782320	And basically they're saying that they've seen rapid declines in that genre, but really
1782320	1786160	I think that Rock Band does it better.
1786160	1787160	Alright.
1787160	1792880	Well, I mean, let's be honest though, is this really a surprise?
1792880	1793880	No.
1793880	1797840	Uh, yes, it is a surprise because I would have thought that they would have still tried
1797840	1798840	to whore it out.
1798840	1803280	I mean, even if sales have dwindled a little bit, you know, why kill off the whole thing?
1803280	1807080	Well, I know why they killed off the whole thing.
1807080	1809320	Because investors tell them what to do.
1809320	1813440	Well, I mean, honestly, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, big surprise.
1813440	1814840	Like you know, this was all over.
1814840	1817720	It was, this news was so big it was on CNN.
1817720	1818720	It was all over Twitter.
1818720	1822280	It might have even been a trending topic for all I know, but all these people were going,
1822280	1823280	R.I.P.
1823280	1824280	Guitar Hero.
1824280	1825280	Dead and gone.
1825280	1826280	We hardly knew ye.
1826280	1830300	And it's kind of like, um, did anyone buy the last game in the series?
1830300	1832400	Did anyone buy Warriors of Rock?
1832400	1835040	I think we picked up the Green Day one for five bucks at Dimple.
1835040	1836040	That's Rock Band.
1836040	1837040	That's not even Guitar Hero.
1837040	1838040	Oh, not Green Day.
1838040	1839800	The other, it was one of the...
1839800	1841120	Van Halen, Metallica?
1841120	1842120	Yeah.
1842120	1845880	It was a, it was a Guitar Hero one.
1845880	1849400	And let's be real, five bucks for that Van Halen one is probably about all it's worth.
1849400	1851200	Like it was really a terra bad game.
1851200	1852200	Let's, let's...
1852200	1853200	It was so bad.
1853200	1854200	It was an obvious milking of the franchise.
1854200	1858400	So bad that they gave it away free to, you know, inflate the numbers of, um, the Guitar
1858400	1863360	Hero 5 series so they could say, hey, look, look how many Guitar Hero units have sold
1863360	1864440	for the franchise.
1864440	1866040	Way more than Rock Band.
1866040	1870360	Granted, they had way more versions come out than Rock Band.
1870360	1875360	So, um, it's still disappointing.
1875360	1880120	I mean, because I don't think that they're done.
1880120	1883120	I think they're done with this.
1883120	1888360	But when they see an idea where they can make some money, they're going to go after it.
1888360	1892240	And I have a feeling that the next game they do is going to be similar to Dance Central
1892240	1896000	because I don't think they want to be, you know, out of the market.
1896000	1899760	But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Dance Hero.
1899760	1903480	What's interesting is that I see, uh, some folks in chat and of course, Black Wolf jumping
1903480	1904480	in.
1904480	1905480	I bought Warriors of Rock.
1905480	1906480	I knew there'd be somebody.
1906480	1907480	There'd be like one person that bought it.
1907480	1909800	I mean, it didn't, it didn't sell to zero copies.
1909800	1910800	It sold some.
1910800	1914760	But what I'm just saying is that this decline has been a little bit obvious for a while
1914760	1915760	now.
1915760	1919360	I think a lot of people out there that were the same ones touting R.I.P.
1919360	1923800	Guitar Hero were kind of rolling their eyes a little bit at the franchise and how it kind
1923800	1925840	of has gone the past couple games.
1925840	1929880	There's been nothing really that new in the series for a while now.
1929880	1933200	And I kind of hate to say it, but DJ Hero was going down a very similar path.
1933200	1938080	I mean, the last game in the series wasn't terrible, but I didn't see where there was
1938080	1940880	really a future in DJ Hero either.
1940880	1946560	Well, um, unfortunately, one of the things we weren't going to be talking about as how
1946560	1950600	they were saying that their digital downloads were up 20%.
1950600	1954820	I think those could have been up a lot more if they'd, you know, kind of gone the rock
1954820	1959440	band route and used their business model where they put out a few games and put out a ton
1959440	1960440	of download content.
1960440	1964640	Because, to be honest, there's not much coming out for Guitar Hero.
1964640	1967680	You may have one pack a month, and that was it.
1967680	1968680	If you're lucky.
1968680	1971240	DJ Hero was, for the first one, was much worse.
1971240	1972520	It had five.
1972520	1974740	I think five packs come out.
1974740	1975740	If that.
1975740	1986440	And then, DJ Hero 2 had about the same within a relatively short time frame, but I don't...
1986440	1994400	You know, we were talking a little bit how they're basically going to, you know, cease
1994400	2000560	putting out download content for Guitar Hero and stuff like that.
2000560	2005440	But honestly, I don't think anyone would have noticed if they stopped because they weren't
2005440	2007760	really doing much to begin with.
2007760	2013720	So, it's kind of, kind of sucked, but, you know, they really kind of let that slip through
2013720	2014720	their hands.
2014720	2021240	Yeah, I mean, I'm, again, I just, I just don't think the series was kind of going anywhere.
2021240	2026200	It just was kind of on a one-track direction, and I, again, I really challenge a lot of
2026200	2028200	these developers to innovate!
2028200	2030640	That is how you're going to keep your games more interesting.
2030640	2031640	That's what Rock Band did.
2031640	2033120	Well, but, see, here's the thing.
2033120	2040280	Rock Band, I mean, it's the last band standing, so to speak, but, unfortunately, they didn't
2040280	2045200	really innovate enough, I guess, with Rock Band 3, with the keyboard and everything.
2045200	2048680	Or they're not, well, here's the thing, or they're not marketing it well enough, I guess.
2048680	2051600	It's not selling as well as the last one, period.
2051600	2052600	That's what I mean.
2052600	2053600	Okay.
2053600	2057600	Well, I'm just saying, you know, because you're saying they didn't innovate.
2057600	2058600	I mean...
2058600	2059600	Well, let me take a step back.
2059600	2063280	Maybe they innovated, but they're not letting people know that so well.
2063280	2067800	Like I don't really see a lot of Rock Band 3 being marketed as, now you can really learn
2067800	2069000	to play an instrument.
2069000	2070760	You can really learn to play keyboard.
2070760	2074960	Like, you know, it wasn't on the daytime talk shows like I kind of thought it would be,
2074960	2075960	and so on.
2075960	2076960	I don't know.
2076960	2080720	I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to say that, like, Rock Band hasn't really innovated.
2080720	2087200	I think it is, it's done certainly more than Guitar Hero did, which is why it is now standing
2087200	2092400	alone, so to speak, although I don't think there'll be a Rock Band 4 this year.
2092400	2093400	I don't think so either.
2093400	2095960	I would go so far as to say there's not going to be another Rock Band until there's another
2095960	2099160	series of consoles, but we'll see.
2099160	2100160	Anything's possible.
2100160	2105120	I honestly think it would be smart to support the current Rock Band and just put out more
2105120	2106120	content.
2106120	2107120	Mm-hmm.
2107120	2108120	Well, that's what, yeah, that's definitely what they're doing.
2108120	2113480	I mean, there's, I honestly don't think there is a need to put out a new console game because
2113480	2118280	their, you know, business model right now is just putting out tons of content for it.
2118280	2120200	So why do you need a new version?
2120200	2121200	You don't need a new version.
2121200	2125760	They're making money that way, and on top of that, it is fairly cost effective.
2125760	2127760	Because Activision's plan was kind of the opposite.
2127760	2132360	Well, we'll force them to buy a new copy of the game, or a new version of the game, because
2132360	2134480	we're not going to put out a lot of content for it.
2134480	2137960	So the only way you're going to get new content is by spending the $60 to buy a brand new
2137960	2139960	game.
2139960	2144200	Some interesting questions from chat here, uh, DDR Dollar Bill says, Guitar Hero started
2144200	2149200	doing the DDR type scene where they made new songs but didn't advance the series much.
2149200	2153560	Kind of interesting though, DDR is still alive to tell the tale, so to speak.
2153560	2155480	DDR is still kickin'.
2155480	2160360	Yeah, DDR and Konami also promise that they're going to support DDR with tons of download
2160360	2162480	content, and they never fuckin' do.
2162480	2166840	Or for Karaoke Revolution, never had a ton of download content on a regular basis like
2166840	2167840	they promised.
2167840	2171800	I'm thinking also DDR probably has a much lower budget than the Guitar Hero games, and
2171800	2174760	I don't think there's as high of an expectation there.
2174760	2176760	And I think in the end, that's what's kept DDR going all these years.
2176760	2177760	Well, if you shoot low, you're gonna-
2177760	2178760	And the weight loss thing.
2178760	2179760	Well, I guess-
2179760	2181180	Everybody thinks you're gonna lose weight playing DDR.
2181180	2185240	If you shoot low, then I guess you don't really have that high expectation, and it's easy
2185240	2186660	to meet your goals.
2186660	2190440	But at the same time, if they tried harder, they may get a better result out of it.
2190440	2194800	But instead, they're just like, oh well, not that many people like it anymore, oh well,
2194800	2199520	let's just put a half-assed product out in the market, and then we'll call it done.
2199520	2201200	Let me bring up this other comment from our chat room.
2201200	2205360	Izam in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, although I think a good question here
2205360	2210720	is can Konami take advantage of the Void and try to get Guitar Freak Strawmania stateside?
2210720	2214440	And my answer is a resounding giant no.
2214440	2217960	I'm gonna be bluntly honest with you, I don't want him to do it.
2217960	2219400	I don't want him to do it.
2219400	2221560	I don't think the games are as good as Guitar Hero.
2221560	2222560	Said it.
2222560	2224440	Might make you mad, but let's be real.
2224440	2225440	People know.
2225440	2226440	People are not gonna get those games here.
2226440	2228920	Konami missed that whole thing.
2228920	2231800	And two words, Rock Revolution.
2231800	2235960	That was their attempt to bring those games stateside and don't think it wasn't.
2235960	2238720	And it was a hot mess to say nice.
2238720	2244000	Let me put it this way, and I put it in my Twitter, if they want a second attempt at
2244000	2249280	the guitar games and stuff like that, if you put out a decent release now, it might actually
2249280	2251040	work, because you're not gonna have a lot of competition.
2251040	2256680	Granted, you're gonna have Rock Band's competition, but you gotta...
2256680	2261480	We tell our customers that we have tons of people trying to get into the video game or
2261480	2266160	movie market and stuff like that, and people that want to sell on eBay and stuff.
2266160	2270080	And we tell them, you've gotta have a niche, because you're competing with people that
2270080	2272280	have been established in the business for a long time.
2272280	2274840	Well, same with the music game genre.
2274840	2275840	You gotta have a niche.
2275840	2280920	Obviously, you're not gonna be able to compete with the large library that Rock Band has.
2280920	2286880	You're gonna need to come up with either original songs, which granted, Konami is great at original
2286880	2287880	songs.
2287880	2292760	Their Konami originals are just awesome, and they have, for guitar games, they have a huge
2292760	2296560	library of stuff that they can put in there.
2296560	2303360	A lot of people in the US may not necessarily get it or be really enthusiastic about some
2303360	2305000	of that stuff, but so what?
2305000	2310240	Just put it in the game as well, and put some good licensed songs from the US in there.
2310240	2316520	And maybe don't fuck up the interface system with grey buttons or your stupid drum controller
2316520	2318520	nobody wants to use.
2318520	2323920	Just use the peripherals that are out there now, put out some good software, and that's
2323920	2324920	it.
2324920	2326880	And hell, call Guitar Freaks, because you know what?
2326880	2327880	You've got that franchise.
2327880	2328920	You have the rights to that.
2328920	2331160	Why not?
2331160	2334840	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, if Konami were to kill DDR, OLR and the rest of the
2334840	2338360	computer would go on a RAM page and go on a global-sized boycott.
2338360	2339840	No, not really.
2339840	2341200	To be honest, no.
2341200	2344960	I'm kind of surprised that news hasn't already come out.
2344960	2345960	Not to be a pessimist.
2345960	2350720	I know a lot of you still love your DDR, but I'm gonna be just...
2350720	2352100	Let's not mince words here.
2352100	2356280	It's not the same game I loved ten years ago.
2356280	2357280	It's not.
2357280	2361100	Well, their idea of innovation is seriously for DDR.
2361100	2362100	Let's add eight arrows.
2362100	2363520	We'll do eight arrows.
2363520	2364520	Awesome.
2364520	2367200	Because you know that was so awesome when you did quads.
2367200	2369520	Remember quads?
2369520	2373640	Four panel, you know, four DDR panels to play on?
2373640	2374640	Yeah, that was terrible.
2374640	2376880	And it was, you know, created by an algorithm.
2376880	2382960	There wasn't actually any original steps for that, and you couldn't make edits for those.
2382960	2386000	And they wanted you to buy four fucking pads for that.
2386000	2388560	Sorry, that's not gonna happen.
2388560	2390680	Anyway, back to the Activision news.
2390680	2395480	I will say, I'm a tiny bit sad that means there's probably not gonna be that DJ Hero
2395480	2396480	game on the 3DS.
2396480	2401280	I mean, I don't know if that's already in the can, so to speak, but I am assuming that's
2401280	2403000	not happening at this point.
2403000	2406720	And that would have been interesting to see that, like in the portable market and the
2406720	2410360	whole 3D thing, but eh, oh well.
2410360	2412800	Probably would have just been a cheap knockoff of the console games anyway.
2412800	2413800	Oh well.
2413800	2415800	What can you do?
2415800	2418800	Anyhow, Loki, what else you got for us?
2418800	2423080	Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about Activision and the fun stuff.
2423080	2427280	Of course, they're reducing their headcount by 500.
2427280	2432160	I think you can kinda guess where that's coming from.
2432160	2437800	And they're saying they're making specific or significant investments elsewhere.
2437800	2443560	Our headcount at the end of the year is probably not gonna be materially different given that
2443560	2447680	we're ramping up development teams around Blizzard's new MMO and around Call of Duty
2447680	2448680	initiatives.
2448680	2453800	Yes, because you have to understand, this is why Guitar Hero and the whole hero franchise
2453800	2454800	went away.
2454800	2464380	It's because I can sink, if I'm Activision, I can sink say 50 million dollars into a couple
2464380	2468840	Guitar Hero games and maybe not make quite as much money back.
2468840	2470920	Maybe I'll make back my investment.
2470920	2475560	Or I can sink 50 million dollars into a couple Call of Duty games and they're gonna sell
2475560	2476560	like hotcakes.
2476560	2480280	So, that's where they're gonna put their money.
2480280	2483480	And then this is the other thing that didn't really make any sense to me, but I guess,
2483480	2486920	hey, you paid for the license, so why not?
2486920	2488720	Spider-Man!
2488720	2491720	There's gonna be another Spider-Man game.
2491720	2496920	Because I don't know, the last Spider-Man game did so well.
2496920	2499740	So there you have that coming in 2011.
2499740	2505760	And also, I guess, two TV license titles as well.
2505760	2511280	They're saying that they're gonna see a new Family Guy game, because god, the last Family
2511280	2515440	Guy game was so wonderful, and a Wipeout game.
2515440	2520200	Which to be honest, they did have a Wipeout game already, and it was not good.
2520200	2526620	So awesome, way to go.
2526620	2531360	That's totally awesome, just to keep that shit around.
2531360	2535400	Well I mean, there is that new Spider-Man movie that's coming out next year or whatever,
2535400	2538440	the one they're filming right now with the whole reboot.
2538440	2540640	This isn't just based on that though.
2540640	2541640	Really?
2541640	2545240	Yes, because this is just, it's gonna be like Shattered Dimensions or something.
2545240	2546960	I would have thought it was tie-in.
2546960	2551280	Kind of going back to this, I was actually reading, there was a letter to, well I guess,
2551280	2556200	a letter from the editor, and the newest Game Informer that, this is obviously before the
2556200	2561760	whole Guitar Hero stuff went down, but he was complaining about how they just basically
2561760	2571160	let Bizarre Creations just go under, and their reasoning for it was because of the failed
2571160	2572160	Bond game.
2572160	2576320	They're all, well first off, why the fuck are you trying to make a Bond game?
2576320	2585980	The Bond franchise has kind of lost its appeal years ago, and this is a game that not necessarily
2585980	2592040	this company would be good to make a title for, maybe a good racing game instead.
2592040	2596520	Well, I don't know about the, because honestly I thought that first Daniel Craig Bond movie,
2596520	2599120	Casino Royale, which a couple years ago was really good.
2599120	2601080	It was like, it was a nice swift kick in the pants.
2601080	2603920	A lot of people were very skeptical about it, and it was really good.
2603920	2607680	But I think the biggest problem was that they were putting out a Bond game when Bond wasn't
2607680	2612760	really in people's minds, because Quantum of Solace didn't do as well, and some would
2612760	2616940	argue it probably wasn't as good of a movie either, and this new Bond game, Bloodstone
2616940	2619280	or whatever it was called, came out like two years after that.
2619280	2621200	People were not thinking about James Bond.
2621200	2624120	People were not looking for a James Bond game.
2624120	2626880	People were kind of looking at that going, what the hell is that?
2626880	2627880	What is this?
2627880	2634240	And on top of that, they released it one week, one week before Call of Duty Black Ops.
2634240	2637180	I mean, they knew it was gonna suck.
2637180	2638680	They knew it.
2638680	2642360	And so they just kind of set them up to fail, and they got rid of them.
2642360	2644240	By the way, there is a new Bond movie now coming out.
2644240	2647080	They finally confirmed they're gonna do a new Bond movie, and hopefully it'll be as
2647080	2651600	good as Casino Royale was, and I wonder who's gonna make the game tie in for that one.
2651600	2654360	Oh, it's gonna be Activision, because they had the lights to the Bond franchise.
2654360	2657460	But how did Goldeneye end up doing for him?
2657460	2658460	That did okay, I think.
2658460	2659460	Did it?
2659460	2661200	But I mean, come on, it's just Goldeneye.
2661200	2663960	All it is is Goldeneye re-skinned with Daniel Craig on it, and that's it.
2663960	2667160	It probably sold more than the other one, sadly.
2667160	2668160	That's not Bazaar's fault?
2668160	2670440	No, it's not Bazaar's fault.
2670440	2673560	Bazaar's fault, or there was really no fault to them anyways.
2673560	2677360	Yeah, they could have made the game as great as possible, but when you put it out a week
2677360	2682880	before fucking Call of Duty comes out, no one's gonna pay attention to that.
2682880	2686240	They're gonna be like, fuck that, I'm getting Call of Duty.
2686240	2691940	The biggest problem, I think, with Blur is that it came out the exact same time as Split
2691940	2695760	Second and Modnation Racers, and people just didn't want to buy all those racers.
2695760	2697800	And Red Dead Redemption.
2697800	2705240	So I mean, Blur, I'm sure, was a pretty good game, but it's just timing, and Activision
2705240	2706800	I don't think cares.
2706800	2711400	And it's just, it's frustrating.
2711400	2715800	Oh, and by the way, I don't remember if this was mentioned before, but remember that Seven
2715800	2719640	Studios, the one that put out that game Scratch, well yeah, Activision bought them and then
2719640	2721520	dissolved them.
2721520	2722520	So if you had any-
2722520	2723520	Did Scratch even ever come out?
2723520	2728680	Nope, it never came out, because they bought the studio, and then they fired them all.
2728680	2731060	So that's awesome.
2731060	2732060	Way to go Activision.
2732060	2734320	Way to get rid of your competition, that's something.
2734320	2736680	Alright, well, jeez, let's-
2736680	2741320	Oh, and then one more thing I was gonna mention too.
2741320	2744380	One other thing they said they weren't gonna put out this year, a new Tony Hawk game.
2744380	2747480	Because the last two Tony Hawk games were terrible, so finally they learned a little
2747480	2748480	bit.
2748480	2750120	No new Tony Hawk game this year.
2750120	2753640	All they need to do is go back to Pro Skater, and they'd be just fine.
2753640	2759440	Alright, I see you talking in our chat room, Dark Soccer, to the listeners about James
2759440	2760440	Bond.
2760440	2765680	Yeah, we were discussed, a couple of us had the same first Bond movie we saw in the theater.
2765680	2766680	That was A View to a Kill.
2766680	2768320	The 80s one, right, yeah.
2768320	2771160	With Duran Duran doing the intro, and Grace Jones.
2771160	2772440	Grace fucking Jones.
2772440	2773440	I love her.
2773440	2775860	Fierce, fierce human being.
2775860	2776860	Just like-
2776860	2777860	Vicious.
2777860	2780540	Vicious to the word fierce, and she invented fierce.
2780540	2782000	There is no other.
2782000	2786640	When you look in the dictionary, there's actually no words, it just automatically links you
2786640	2790160	mentally to Wikipedia about her.
2790160	2792960	They should've made- you know what?
2792960	2796580	That's how Bazaar could've sold a million billion of the Bond game, is just make it
2796580	2797580	all about Grace Jones.
2797580	2798580	There you go.
2798580	2801840	Now I have to go on Wikipedia and look up Grace Jones.
2801840	2803240	Alright, let's move on.
2803240	2806440	You know how they could've sold a ton of games?
2806440	2807440	What?
2807440	2808440	Smash Brothers Bond.
2808440	2809440	That'd be awesome.
2809440	2810440	Right.
2810440	2812440	Getting a little silly now.
2812440	2816120	Alright, uh, hey, the Xbox Live house party is coming very soon.
2816120	2820400	You might remember this is the whole little, uh, let's do the summer of arcade promotion
2820400	2821720	at a different time in the year.
2821720	2822720	Actually this is like their third one.
2822720	2823720	You know, seriously?
2823720	2829620	They need to host this with Kid N Play, I mean, I'm sorry, they need to dig them out
2829620	2833440	of wherever rehab center they're in, and just seriously.
2833440	2836840	I apologize if I'd taken someone's story later, I don't think I am, I don't think this is
2836840	2840780	coming up tonight, but there's been more and more furious rumors this week that Xbox is
2840780	2846960	planning on launching like a TV network within Xbox, which some time ago Conan was wooed
2846960	2851480	to be a part of before they decided to stick with something a little more traditional.
2851480	2858120	It would not be beyond all reason that Kid N Play could do some type of house party.
2858120	2862320	That sounds like, for some reason I'm just reminded of USA is up all night for some reason
2862320	2869760	when I run this year, I kind of hope if they do, do you end up having an Xbox network?
2869760	2876320	They have Xbox all night or something ridiculous, like fucking old school yo MTV raps, you know,
2876320	2882800	with fucking eighties rap stars and just covering, you know, re just music that's really old.
2882800	2887600	Imagine that Grace Jones was in a movie with Tim Curry was she really in 2001 that was
2887600	2893840	like the most fierce gay movie ever called wolf girl.
2893840	2896760	Sounds like apparently she was in Peewee's Playhouse Christmas special.
2896760	2897760	Awesome.
2897760	2898760	And in the Beastmaster.
2898760	2900360	Look, can I talk about the house party?
2900360	2903720	I realized Grace Jones was not invited to the house party, but I still want to talk
2903720	2906120	about some of the awesome games that are coming out.
2906120	2910080	It's all starts this week, February 16th, the first release comes out.
2910080	2912960	Hardcore uprising comes out first.
2912960	2915640	It's a game that is kind of like Contra.
2915640	2919080	It's really, really like Contra, but it's not $15 for that.
2919080	2924040	Bejeweled Blitz is the next game on February 23rd, 800 Microsoft points for that.
2924040	2928480	Beyond Good and Evil HD is on March 2nd for 800 Microsoft points.
2928480	2932960	Torchlight comes out on March 9th for 1200 Microsoft points.
2932960	2937280	And lastly, but not leastly, Full House Poker on March 16th for 800 points.
2937280	2942560	Is that the one versus 100 replacement or is that a different poker thing?
2942560	2946600	It's similar to the one versus 100, I guess, with poker.
2946600	2947600	Interesting.
2947600	2950880	Yeah, that's what I thought that was all about, but now they're going to chart.
2950880	2951920	It's not really free.
2951920	2952920	It is going to cost you.
2952920	2954480	It's going to cost you 800 points for that.
2954480	2956680	I am most looking forward to Absolutely a Torchlight.
2956680	2958320	I think Torchlight is an awesome game on the PC.
2958320	2960400	I'm kind of curious how they're going to translate that to console.
2960400	2964080	I think a lot is going to have to change in translation, so I'll be very curious about
2964080	2965080	that.
2965080	2966080	So, there you go.
2966080	2968800	The Xbox Live house party starting this week.
2968800	2970320	No Kid in Play this year.
2970320	2971320	Maybe next year.
2971320	2973760	What else you got for us besides links to Grace Jones' Wikipedias?
2973760	2976960	Well, now I'm reading about Studio 54.
2976960	2984000	Well, according to EA, 7% of mobile gaming is done on the toilet.
2984000	2990400	They did some research and this is actually from EA Mobile.
2990400	2998720	They basically said there were five different percentages of when people tend to play their
2998720	2999720	games.
2999720	3003080	They also went over some myths.
3003080	3008680	So according to the research, 47% of the time is people playing at home, 12% of that time
3008680	3015800	is during a commute, 14% while at work, 7% in the restroom, and 3% during school hours
3015800	3017560	and 1% at the airport.
3017560	3022640	Actually we have a clip of Dark Sakura playing on her mobile phone here.
3022640	3023640	No.
3023640	3024640	No.
3024640	3025640	No.
3025640	3026640	No.
3026640	3027640	No.
3027640	3028640	No.
3028640	3029640	No.
3029640	3030640	No.
3030640	3031640	No.
3031640	3032640	No.
3032640	3033640	No.
3033640	3034640	No.
3034640	3035640	No.
3035640	3053740	So there actually was a shirt that I almost got one time that says iPhone changed the
3053740	3054760	way I pee.
3054760	3058920	I thought that was pretty funny.
3058920	3064080	I used I I admit I used to play my you know phone sometimes at work
3064080	3067960	But I think this one might have actually been a little more appropriate for mobile gaming
3067960	3069960	Now
3069960	3088880	Oh now flush
3090360	3095600	Can I be real though? Let's let's be real. I'm kind of surprised the number isn't higher

3215640	3220600	No they said that their biggest performers there was
3220960	3229080	Epics infinity blade and dead space which were at the top of the App Store and that one size game fits all platforms and not so

3313840	3315840	chicks

3457040	3461500	That's this this sounds good kind of weird, but it could be kind of awesome to it
3461500	3468560	It is a strategy game, and there's like these guys with sheep heads. It's kind of a scary game like when you say persona
3468560	3470840	I think oh, it's gonna be the preenies, but no this is like a
3471280	3473280	No, it's a creepy erotic game

3519320	3525320	Like I don't know if they just want people to buy it early or what's going on, but um haku yoki zusoroku

3532960	3534400	on the Sony
3534400	3541120	PSP if you're sad about guitar hero having gone under you might be a fan of this series DJ max
3541280	3547840	Portable 3 is a very big release for the music game fans this week on the PSP that is in regular and limited edition

3561840	3564240	esque style interface, but on your PSP
3565120	3568680	Definitely a lot of cult fan. There will be a lot of people listening to the show that import that game
3568680	3571880	I am sure that's it for Japanese release dates. How about
3572920	3579120	Overseas in the old country a few things we have on the 16th hardcore uprising on
3579900	3582120	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and
3582920	3584920	We also have on the 18th
3585720	3590200	crash time for our Xbox 360 death smiles and
3590200	3593900	Then Marvel vs. Capcom 3 we also have pop cap hits
3594580	3597760	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and death smells is pretty cool
3597760	3601680	I think I know what a lot of people will be playing this week death smiles no
3602540	3605180	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is totally worthy by the way
3605980	3609860	Well, that's right. You had a chance to check it out early too. Huh? What'd you think worthy?
3610600	3612600	but Tatanoko
3612620	3614740	vs. Capcom fighting scheme not as great
3615640	3617220	interesting really
3617220	3622300	Yeah, I wasn't too fond of that when I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. It's very mash friendly
3623140	3625140	Hey sounds good for me. I love button mashing
3625980	3629940	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week
3629940	3631940	But we're not there just yet Loki
3632540	3634540	Sony's claiming that the Gran Turismo Academy
3635700	3637700	Yet one little
3637860	3643300	Event contest that they have going on right now where people race and report their times
3643300	3647460	I guess the Gran Turismo 5 on different tracks for different specific categories
3648820	3651580	With a chance to win a spot as a real race driver
3652860	3655500	apparently they say round two was ruined by cheaters and
3656420	3662140	Won't count so they're moving everybody the round three, but here's how they claim it was
3663020	3670220	Cheated apparently the track has a nice little s turn in it and so people were cutting corners in the track driving off-road
3670220	3672220	You
3672220	3673620	Know it's a design the track
3673620	3680340	It wasn't actually something that people use like a mod or something like that to cheat in they were just cutting corners off-road
3680940	3682940	That's cheating
3683020	3686620	Well, they're like putting real bracing you we've got a penalty for that
3686820	3692060	Well, maybe somebody spent a long making their game should have penalized exactly
3692060	3695380	Maybe if you had spent all that time, you know perfecting your game
3695380	3700380	Maybe you should have I don't know added a penalty for cutting the track like that. It's interesting though
3700380	3705660	Like I realize Gran Turismo is supposed to be like the real-deal racing simulator and all that but like games like Mario Kart and shit
3705660	3710340	And even things like blur you're kind of encouraged to do shit like that or burnout especially burnout
3710860	3717900	Off-roading is is encouraged and rewarded. You know, I mean if you can get a game fuel that entire fucking game was off-roading
3717900	3723300	You know, I mean, it's not even a glitch. I mean, it's just a part of the track you cutting out the track
3723300	3725300	Yeah, it seems
3726660	3728660	Seems a little silly to throw
3728820	3735940	That that's what I have to say about that. I think your competition's stupid. Although it's interesting because isn't the like
3736460	3740360	Prize or whatever for winning the competition like to race a real car
3740360	3745140	I hope that they race on that track with the s-curve and drive the fucker off-road. Well, that'd be hilarious
3745140	3747340	Maybe they don't want people that are gonna do that
3747860	3752820	I'm gonna do that. Anyways, that's what I would do. I'd drive that thing straight into a wall
3752820	3760220	Oh expensive car crash. You might also get set on fire and I don't think you really want that you have a fire suit
3760220	3762220	It's fine. I
3763180	3764780	Don't know
3764780	3771580	Around three though this start on Monday. So whatever. We'll see how people cheat on that real soon. Yeah
3772420	3774420	Alright, let's move on to
3774620	3779740	Some more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get into the classic game of the week
3779740	3783020	which of course is dark soccer diving into the vault and
3783820	3788340	Finding a game that she thinks you guys should be playing but first off a story real quick on
3788700	3792060	Dead Space 2 and I think this is kind of interesting because
3792980	3797540	There's this gamer and his name is Gareth Garrett. I think I hope I'm saying that correctly
3797900	3799900	He is a gamer who happens to have cerebral palsy
3800540	3802940	And he wanted there to be more
3803420	3807980	Customizable controls in this game because what he's trying to do is he's trying to play this game on his PC
3807980	3812060	and he has to use his chin to move the mouse and
3812780	3817060	Unfortunately, he's not able to walk forward with the mouse and you know
3817220	3821740	This is kind of the bummer with a lot of games that have custom or don't have customizable controls
3821740	3825400	There's a lot of times they're customized really weird and people want to change them
3826060	3827140	so
3827140	3832700	He thought it's a little weird the Dead Space 2 doesn't allow me to do this when tons and tons and tons of games do
3832700	3836260	Allow me to do it and they went and they made an internet petition
3836260	3841180	20,000 players signed this petition and
3841940	3846460	visceral games who made a Dead Space 2 says we hear you and
3847020	3849340	executive producer Steve Pappoutis
3849900	3854340	Sorry, if I said that wrong said that there will be a PC version patch
3854980	3859300	Enabling full control remapping it will be coming out soon
3859460	3861860	There is some full remarks that were made
3861860	3867940	the Dead Space 2 team is aware of the issue that disabled players are having with Dead Space 2 PC in fact a number of
3867940	3874180	Folks on our team is are so passionate about getting this fix done that they are currently working hard to allow players to remap key
3874180	3877420	Bindings to the mouse which should help disabled players. Enjoy the game
3878180	3883660	That's very cool. I'm glad that they listened especially with that reason being in place a little silly
3883660	3889980	It wasn't there the first time hello customizable controls is a very standard thing in this day and age. However
3889980	3897340	Maybe this lesson will help other developers learn it, right? There's there's a lot of games though that really need to have I
3898580	3901300	Still you remember how pissed off I got the very very first time
3901300	3904820	I played World of Warcraft and found I couldn't use my mouse. Uh-huh or controller
3904820	3909660	Oh, yeah, because I've been playing Final Fantasy 11 on a controller and I've been playing PSO on a controller
3911060	3912740	so
3912740	3919940	They should oh, they should just allow any kind of custom controller to work. I think there's a mod for
3920620	3923960	Warcraft where you can use a controller, but it's not officially supported
3925260	3927060	keyboard now, but
3927060	3934520	But I I mean, I really think that that games need to not limit people in how they can control right that if
3935100	3937220	You can map anything out on a keyboard
3937220	3942660	Then you should be able to map it out on a gamepad as well and I think it's all this this type of story is a very
3942660	3946260	Humbling thing I think too for the developers who have to kind of stop and go. Oh, yeah
3946820	3948820	Not everybody is
3948980	3954260	This fortunate as I am to have every you know, the ten fingers and ten toes doing you know
3954260	3957620	what they what it does, you know what I mean, so it's
3958740	3960740	It's a little bit humbling and just a reminder
3961340	3964860	Customizable controls go a long way in helping more people play your game
3964860	3969660	All right, let's move on to a segment. We do here every week on orange lounge radio
3969660	3971820	It's a chance for dark soccer to dive through the vault
3973300	3976900	Find a video game that she says hey you ungrateful kids
3977500	3983180	Hey, listen. Hey, listen, stop watching those crappy Grammys get off my lawn and
3983700	3987180	Play this classic game right now dark soccer
3987180	3989180	What is the classic human week?
3989180	3996500	The game is star Perotia, which I had the hardest time finding because a lot of places romanize it as Perotier
3996700	4002560	Which makes sense because it's a parody of star soldier and I've talked about this game before but I haven't used it as a classic
4002560	4004780	Game, I checked. All right. Let's take a look
4004780	4020620	I love the music in this game, by the way. At any rate, you can tell it's all, you know, CD audio
4021140	4026740	Because this was on the PC Engine CD-ROM as I said, it's parody of star soldier
4026740	4034660	which is sort of in the same vein as Proteus, but I don't think it's as silly as Proteus and it only came out in Japan and
4034660	4038820	They were going to be bringing it out in North America as fan as a star soldier, but they did not
4040820	4046620	It actually had a release through the virtual console in Europe on May 16th 2008 and
4047540	4053500	Of course, it was released in America on August 11th 2008. So you guys can actually play this game now
4053500	4057940	It's pretty funny. So it's a vertically scrolling shooter like the star soldier games and
4058660	4062540	has the collecting power-ups to create your weapons and
4063400	4067980	different bosses and mini bosses and you know horizontal shooting, you know with your
4068900	4071940	vehicle of choice this one also has a
4073300	4078140	High-score time attack mode that were in star soldier, but now for the parody part
4078140	4084240	It's really cutesy has very cartoony type of graphics and not very violent like
4084860	4088420	when you kill an enemy, they don't die they just wave white flags and
4088940	4091060	You can choose one of three different vehicles
4091060	4095900	you can choose the para Caesar from star soldier or a giant flying bomber man or
4096620	4101600	A PC Engine that shoots hue cards and CD-ROMs at the enemies
4102340	4104980	This game is super adorable cute. I
4104980	4111760	I love this game and I remember when my friend we were visiting my friend who lived in Berkeley at the time
4111760	4116080	Like right now they're finding the origami monster. Hey, it looks like one of those tangrams. Yeah
4116940	4125140	But a friend of ours, you know was breaking out the most bizarre for PC Engine collection and saying play this and it's pretty fun
4125140	4128820	This is actually one. I'm looking for a legit. I have a copy of it
4129580	4131580	but it's a fun little game and
4131580	4137000	And I mean, it's just I love parody games. I love games that are fun
4137140	4140860	You know good solid games that don't take themselves too seriously. I
4141500	4145700	mean, I love the proteus series a lot more than this obviously, but
4146300	4148000	This one's just really fun
4148000	4153780	And on top of that I like that all the little guys that they talk to in the intro a little bomber man guys
4153780	4162140	And they're outfitting a PC Engine, you know big smiley face with a copy of Superstar Soldier. So it'll fight
4162660	4166560	It's pretty funny. I have a little sexy lady standing on the stage in the background there
4169900	4172980	Like I think one of the enemies you fight in this is like a black bomber man
4174020	4180140	And all kinds of stuff. It's really a fun little game and I love the music in it. The music's great
4180140	4187220	There's the giant fish. I think that's who's played who plays a maraca apparently. Yeah, it plays maracas. All righty
4188260	4193460	So yeah, it's totally worth it. You can get it on virtual console. I totally recommend it. It's
4194780	4198220	Officially listed as star protea. I learned it as star protea. So

4372260	4376700	Let's get into some rapid-fire news some quick quick stuff that just didn't make the show
4376740	4383160	Otherwise and definitely your last chance to get those Twitter topics in we'll be getting those right after the quick fire news stories
4383420	4384500	All right
4384500	4391960	Well project M a kind of a homebrew effort to make Super Smash Brothers brawl play a little bit more like Super Smash Brothers
4392380	4393560	Melee
4393560	4395380	Has released its first demo now
4395380	4399700	What's kind of cool about this hack is it doesn't require that you have any sort of mods done to your system
4399700	4403900	all you need to do is dump it onto a SD card and
4404500	4406500	Pop it into your
4406620	4408620	Wii and away you go
4408620	4414940	so you can download that from project M's website, which is project M that smash mods calm and
4415820	4422180	I believe that you do need a card though. That is less than two gigs in size in order to be able to have the thing
4422180	4423700	work
4423700	4425700	Yeah, check it out. It's
4425780	4430740	really more for like kind of the hardcore Malik player because there's a lot of
4431140	4435180	Tweaks and stuff in there that most average people probably wouldn't get so
4435180	4437980	That is out there to check out
4440500	4442500	In case you have a
4442540	4444540	Netflix disc for your
4445060	4449900	PlayStation Wii well, unfortunately, it's not gonna work after February 16th and
4450740	4452620	I
4452620	4454620	Guess you know, they're gonna
4454940	4461660	Send out they send out an email to all the members saying that the disc will cease to function and that's it. So oh
4461660	4470540	Well, but of course you can always download the streaming software via the Wii shop channel because that's why they're getting rid of
4470540	4472900	This there is another option for you. So
4473580	4480140	Be sure to do that if you want to still stream stuff on your Wii and then finally
4481060	4488820	So cool stuff coming to Rock Band via the Rock Band Network some tracks from Super Meat Boy are making its way out
4488820	4492300	And these are coming from Danny
4492820	4494380	Baron Ouski
4494380	4500460	he did the soundtrack for Cannibal and Super Meat Boy and the tracks that are confirmed to be coming the
4501180	4503180	Battle of little slugger
4503220	4506060	Kano salt and those are going to be released as
4506500	4514500	Remixed extended versions and then the beat is blues will get him. I guess a retro remix for that release
4514500	4519540	That's gonna be awesome because the music from Super Meat Boy is great. Yes, just saying
4520260	4523100	It's gonna be probably some really hard stuff. Yes
4523100	4529060	In fact their comment or his comment was I wanted to have some stuff in there for people who delight in 100% teen
4529460	4531460	expert dragon force
4531700	4534180	Give you an idea how hard it's gonna be nice
4535620	4540300	All right, awesome and they're expected sometime after February 15th, very cool
4540300	4548260	All right. Well, let's get to some other news and this kind of sorta has to do with that same thing except
4548260	4552300	It's not Super Meat Boy. It's Rock Band and what is coming out this week on Rock Band?
4552300	4555380	the good news is despite all of the stuff that's going on with
4556180	4562700	Guitar hero Rock Band is still kicking with some expansions and I like this this week is the February
4563380	4565380	heartache duets pack
4565380	4570540	Which I think is great which includes Bonnie Tyler's total eclipse of the heart
4570540	4575100	I can think of no better duets than that one. That's do we have pretty awesome leader Ford?
4575980	4580180	No, we do have an emotion with obsession. So these cool Bonnie
4581060	4584100	Bob Bo B with Haley Williams with airplanes
4585380	4591420	I don't like the paramore chicken human league with don't you want me lady antebellum would need you now
4591420	4596420	Stevie Nicks would stop dragging my heart around. Oh, no, that's a good one by far the coolest
4596420	4598740	No, this just blows all the others out of the water. You ready?
4599740	4601940	paradise by the dashboard light by meatloaf
4603580	4607760	Outstanding absolutely outstanding, but we just cured sure me out with that list
4610900	4613820	Well, this might be something even sure me could enjoy
4614340	4620740	It's hitting the blogs this week about a three-year-old named Oliver Smith who was playing a game on the Nintendo
4620740	4627620	We that his mom bought him Victoria's the mom's name the game is on the European version of the Wii
4627620	4633740	It's called countdown, which is based off a television show that they have over in Britain and basically you unscramble words
4633740	4637320	You know they show up in whatever format, and then you unscramble them
4638420	4640760	Yeah, the kid got a word
4641700	4643300	shah
4643300	4647240	S I T E D and you know what that unscrambled into
4647240	4650640	You know shitheads. That's right shitheads
4651120	4655880	So this little three-year-old got exposed to that word and of course according to the angry mother
4655880	4661160	I couldn't believe my eyes as the world was as the word was slowly unveiled as an obscene insult
4661480	4665240	Oliver is a really bright kid, and we play this game to help him build up his word bank
4665240	4667520	He was already asking what the word meant
4668960	4670200	Nice
4670200	4672920	Somebody let that one slip by in the dictionary whoops
4672920	4678640	But if you expose your children to it early, then it's not as special older, and they won't be as inclined to say it
4679400	4683480	And this last one god. I don't even really want to report on it
4683480	4690320	But it's just kind of sad because of everything we have going on guitar hero and all that yep karaoke revolution glee volume 2
4690720	4692520	It's coming
4692520	4694400	20 more songs
4694400	4697680	From part 2 wow and one only 20
4697680	4704520	That's that that's some effort right there. Yep. Yeah, I can even see in one of the little screen caps here
4704520	4706760	Can't touch this I wonder what song that could be
4707640	4709640	Yep, so if you like glee
4709680	4713720	This is them all dressed up as Lady Gaga, so I want your love so you can sing to bad romance
4714560	4715760	whatever
4715760	4717200	whatever
4717200	4718560	big whatever
4718560	4720560	Dark soccer, what do you have for us a?
4720800	4723280	Bunch of crap actually not crap
4723280	4729480	Final Fantasy 1 & 2 is coming to PlayStation Network in Europe, and it will be 7 pound 99 and
4731480	4735680	They're going to be the UMD versions that came out in 2008
4736560	4739360	which as far as I recall weren't very great and
4740200	4744160	Then there's going to be a new DDR game for iOS. It's going to
4745400	4750440	Be dance dance revolution freedom, and it is free and has four songs
4750440	4755000	And I like that the tap to start as a thumbprint. That's actually cool
4755640	4757640	but I
4758480	4763600	Don't know it looks interesting. Maybe I'll give it a try if it's free why not shoot and then
4765240	4769480	It looks like our fading arcade infinity is actually for real closing its doors
4770360	4775920	So they're gonna be closed on February 26 as opposed to fake closing their doors like we had a couple months ago
4775920	4780560	yeah, they're closing on February 26 2011 and
4781280	4786560	They it's actually LA County denied their application for business license extension
4789440	4791440	So
4791560	4794880	They have to close the county wants them to close shop
4795240	4799640	Pay for a new license and wait for all of the hearings and City Council votes in
4799640	4805960	In order for it to stay open which could take a up to eight months. Why did they have like such?
4806120	4810720	Like what's their problem with this arcade? I mean seriously. It's like they hate them
4812000	4816720	Well, they're saying it's not the money. It's just how long AI would have had to remain closed so
4818040	4821100	It's going away. I hate you LA
4822920	4827080	Officially well, that's just it's you know we haven't talked about this when the news came up the first time
4827080	4832880	It's just kind of sad to hear about these arcades closing. You know what I mean, so no, but
4834400	4841480	I'm sure there'll be no a shortage of little arcades where ticket-spitting machines come out and all that stuff whatever
4842400	4845020	Let's move in to the Twitter topics

4934900	4938440	So we can take a look at it hold on let me pause this and turn this up
4938440	4965680	No, it sucks about that game is it's been delayed
4965680	4969620	In a game god damn it the fact is delayed to June
4971580	4972820	You mad
4972820	4978140	Yes, I am not mad with disappointed and a couple from Tiger Claw here
4978140	4983740	I guess a Plants vs. Zombies board game is actually happening. What a board game
4984180	4989140	That's a little strange, but kind of not surprising a lot of this stuff usually crosses over into other worlds
4989740	4994120	So yeah, there's a Plants vs. Zombies board game. It was spotted at Toy Fair 2011
4994120	4999740	it's going to be a two to four player game with 80 zombie guards cards excuse me 40 plant cards and
5000140	5004500	Different game boards on which you place these plants and battle the various zombies
5004860	5010640	You know I got to play that on an iPad. Yeah the other day, and I wanted an iPad after that
5011260	5014220	the iPad works a little better those versions than the
5015300	5021680	Other ones anyhow also a tweet from Tiger Claw telling us that the world of Starcraft mod
5021680	5026240	You remember this this was somebody taking Starcraft 2 and making a custom mod in it
5026240	5031620	That was world of Starcraft and Blizzard did not take too kindly to this we talked about this on Hoard House a little bit
5031620	5034140	This week it is now called Starcraft universe
5034340	5039200	So it has a name that I guess is a little less threatening to Blizzard or what now Sony gets pissed off
5040980	5045300	We'll see so yeah, it has its name changed and there you go and
5045900	5050820	Lastly SSJ100 Matt says his tweet tonight saying resident hockey fan with some hockey game news
5050820	5057340	NHL 2k11 is available now for the iPad for $5 so if you're into hockey check that out
5058080	5062380	You know it's not blades of steel though that that will always be the best hockey game as far as I'm concerned
5063060	5065060	There you go
5065580	5067700	Last time we got a couple last-minute tweets
5067700	5072020	I'll read these silver Sonic tweets us on Twitter and saying I just linked this in the chat room
5072100	5077820	But did you hear the story of the 11 year old boy in the UK that spent 1 million pounds on?
5077820	5082100	Xbox live no I didn't he links us the story here, I guess
5082780	5084780	the 11 year old kid
5085100	5089380	Racked up a 1,000 pound debt on the debit card through the Xbox
5090640	5096860	He bought accessories and new games on the consoles after it saved details of a previously registered card
5097900	5100900	It's hard to get those cards off there. Yeah, it is
5101640	5103060	Wow
5103060	5104900	but I mean
5104900	5108020	Why is she kind of letting the kid run rampant with this?
5108020	5113100	There's this little picture where her and the kid are kind of posing together looking all I don't know
5113100	5116740	I don't want to say all kind of frumpy I guess and
5117820	5121460	what's interesting is that he I guess she showed the thing to the kid and
5122580	5129020	When he when she says when I showed him he burst into tears he unplugged the Xbox and said he didn't want it anymore
5129020	5133620	I haven't punished him because he feels bad enough, and I know he won't do it again. I
5133620	5137640	I don't know though. I don't work at two jobs, and I'm a single mother
5141380	5143380	Why did you put the card in the house
5143740	5150420	Parental things that they can you know enable to where you can disable live purchases, right? Well, yeah
5151020	5155820	You know if you don't pay attention on how to set you know controls on your consoles
5155820	5158760	And you can only blame yourself for when someone spends money on
5158760	5162920	Don't pretend. Oh, I didn't know
5164200	5170200	That's it for tweet tweets tonight twitter.com slash olr if you want to follow us on Twitter and send us some tweets for next week
5171300	5173300	Let's move on with some more gaming news Loki
5174440	5176440	Have no patience for those type of people
5177520	5183200	This is kind of ironic. I guess someone suing Sony this time so Sony suing other people
5183720	5185720	apparently LG has
5185720	5191720	You know sent a lawsuit to Sony regarding their system the PlayStation 3
5192300	5198280	They claimed that certain electronic devices having a blu-ray disc player and components
5198280	5201720	They're violates four of its patents and that includes
5201720	5207080	I guess a lot of devices like Bravia TVs, but the only piece of hardware
5207080	5213040	I guess they were singling out was the PlayStation 3 and they actually have a specific model, which is the 100 and gate
5213040	5216160	hundred and sixty gigabyte system that says
5217240	5222360	They filed the complaint with the US International Trade Commission
5223200	5230800	Which has the power to block imports of products that violate US patents and says ensure LG is looking to
5231880	5235680	Have the ITC keep the ps3s off American shores
5237600	5242620	They said they've also filed a civil suit against Sony in federal court in California
5242620	5248320	Making similar claims and seeking cash compensation for unauthorized use of its inventions
5251440	5253440	Interesting very
5253720	5259060	It's kind of funny though. And now I think of it because wasn't Sony the one that came up with like the blu-ray format
5259080	5265880	Anyways, I thought they were the ones that kind of developed that stuff. I could be very wrong on that though. But um, oh
5266640	5268640	well karma bitch
5268640	5272520	Sony is just loving the litigation thing lately. I don't know
5272520	5276920	Yeah, I said you're in California suing the pants off people that really don't need to be in California
5276920	5278920	Then might as well get sued yourself. Sounds good
5279560	5281260	Keeps busy
5281260	5282320	All right
5282320	5285520	Well moving on with this this rumor just never stops
5285520	5290680	This rumor is always around and it's when is Apple getting into gaming when is Apple getting into gaming?
5290680	5294960	It's kind of like well, they're already in gaming if you consider the iPhone, but okay, how about the consoles?
5294960	5300640	When are they gonna get back into consoles? Cuz I guess you could say the Pippin but I think Apple would rather not talk about
5300640	5302240	That but yeah
5302240	5302680	I
5302680	5305720	One of the rumors that keeps coming up is the Apple TV because you know
5305720	5310640	they've sold this device for very cheap and it's kind of way to get Apple connected to your television and
5310880	5316920	Now the rumors are coming up again that perhaps Apple TV games are more real than you think but how?
5317400	5322480	Let me put it this way the Apple TV isn't even powerful enough to run games on it
5322480	5324480	I mean, I know it's I think it's uh
5324480	5326480	Intel atom
5327240	5329600	CPU but I mean is that
5330280	5334200	Comparable to like an iPod or something or iPhone. I mean can can they run?
5334200	5337000	I mean would they even be able to have the horsepower to do that?
5337000	5339800	I don't think you'd be talking top-of-the-line stuff here
5339800	5344920	I don't think you'd be playing exactly Gears of War on one of these things, but maybe either some type of
5345520	5350820	device between your iPhone and this like maybe you can talk to the iPhone and kind of like
5350820	5355460	God, which a PSP is supposed to do with ps3 where you beam images from one source to the other
5355980	5356780	That makes sense
5356780	5357460	That would be cool
5357460	5364740	now if you could stream games from say your iPod or iPhone or something like that and then play them on the Apple TV with a
5365380	5368620	Controller right a physical controller. Mm-hmm. Although
5369380	5374380	At the same time or just like a physical controller for my iPod would be awfully nice
5374380	5378820	They actually had that there was stuff that they cover but they were selling this device
5378820	5384140	I was for like 80 bucks or someone's a Bluetooth device actually snaps onto your iPod or actually is even for any
5384740	5390060	Mobile device that supports Bluetooth, but it had like kind of a you know a PlayStation setup
5390060	5394420	You know directional pad two analogs and you know four buttons or whatever
5394420	5398700	Could I use my remote control as a tangible controller perhaps? I don't know
5398700	5402780	Well, wait, I didn't even tell you where this rumor comes from and because you're gonna laugh at this
5402780	5407720	This is why this is a rumor all over again. There's beta code out there for the new iOS
5407720	5414820	4.3 because you know, they regularly do updates to iOS and so forth. Well 4.3 apparently in the code references
5415680	5421480	ATV games and people think that means Apple TV because ATV and
5423000	5425040	The code I guess also talks about
5426080	5428080	controllers of some sort
5428400	5429560	leaderboards
5429560	5432660	scheduling games and of course a storefront I
5432660	5438580	Mean this news isn't like shocking. I think this is kind of one of those matter-of-time types of things
5438580	5440860	But it's interesting to see what sort of things they have planned
5440860	5443940	I think there would be a new Apple TV that would help facilitate this
5444140	5447460	We'll see the price points awfully nice of the Apple TV
5447460	5453140	You mean if they're trying to get people to bring it in as like a game console true hell if they even drop the price
5453140	5458700	Like say another 20 bucks 79 99 that would be pretty, you know appealing to people that aren't necessarily
5458700	5460700	You
5461140	5465700	Know into gaming and the other thing which would be kind of cool and I'm not too sure on the whole
5465700	5471460	I don't know too much about the Apple TV other than the fact that you can stream shit from your PC your Apple or you
5471460	5477340	Know iTunes or whatever to it and stuff. Can you run apps on there already on the Apple TV can like I say
5477940	5481860	Browse Google or something, you know do Facebook and stuff like that
5481860	5486620	You can do on like the iPods and the iPhones and stuff. Can you do that stuff already?
5486620	5488620	on Apple TV
5489500	5491100	You can do
5491100	5494860	The song. Yeah, I think you can do like movies and stuff. I think so
5494860	5499940	Okay, well you can do movies, but you can't run like apps. You can't do like no Facebook or anything. No, okay
5500460	5506060	So that would be interesting if they did that because then they would be trying to compete with like Google TV and stuff like that
5506060	5512420	I think and if you throw gaming in there, that could be interesting seeing as it's way cheaper than Google TV. I
5512420	5519220	Don't know it would be smart for them to do that if they're that's because it gets people to bring that shit into the house
5519220	5522500	You know for the gaming and then they can sell them on
5522500	5528660	Hey, look, you can you know, we could buy TV shows or you can buy this this could be a real stretch here
5528660	5534580	But maybe this is part of what the whole iPad 2 thing has to do with because you know
5534580	5536580	We haven't heard a lot out of iPad 2
5536580	5543740	Besides that it's supposed to have this front-facing camera and might have the nice retina display. Maybe we haven't even we were haven't really heard
5543740	5549260	Anything but a bunch of rumors, but you know, there'll be that inevitable press conference at some point. So
5550700	5554580	Could this maybe tie into that somehow they were saying even that
5555260	5556500	the
5556500	5558060	3.4
5558060	5561420	Or was it 4.3? I'm sorry the new
5561420	5568620	New firmware where it was supposed to be coming out this week from what I heard or that was rumored like the 15th
5572300	5578220	All right, well we will see what develops of this whenever they decide to do another press conference over at Apple and announce what all
5578220	5580100	The lemmings will be buying next
5580100	5584060	Which will probably include myself. Don't get me wrong Dark Sakura. What do you have for us in the meantime?
5584060	5590580	Well, it looks like there has been an alleged Dance Central 2 survey
5591300	5592420	that
5592420	5594420	might be looking at a
5595220	5597100	feature list
5597100	5599100	so basically
5599120	5605780	Kotaku says that it has an email survey for Microsoft Game Studios that has a list of those features that it's in
5605780	5613540	pre-production and that it would have the ability to create custom dances and play as backup dancers or singers and
5614140	5619500	Then you can replay entire sequences and get specific feedback on your dancing
5620220	5625940	and then they're also having a fitness mode and an online offline multiplayer contest and
5626460	5629280	That you will have a social aspect to it
5630140	5631860	so
5631860	5637460	God, does this mean that you can put a video of yourself like dancing through captured via the Kinect?
5637460	5639860	I don't know like somehow automatically just
5644380	5646660	Sounds kind of scary to me a little bit
5647420	5651340	Well, you know they want that whole community thing and after all they've been you know
5651340	5657380	Doing the first party Kinect games and take pictures of you, which I'm surprised you can't share those pictures
5657380	5659580	You know with like Facebook and stuff
5659580	5661980	At least I'm unaware that you can
5662900	5663860	easily
5663860	5669100	Because I would think that they would want to do something like that and wasn't there some sort of feature that was supposed to be
5669100	5673940	Coming where we can do screenshots from games and stuff like that and like share them on Facebook and that kind of crap
5674820	5678940	Because wasn't there like when they were talking about the whole Facebook integration stuff and it's like hey look
5678940	5684980	I just you know, blah blah blah in Tiger Woods and here's a screenshot of me hitting the hole in one or some crap
5684980	5690500	This is kind of where gaming is going more and more and you know
5690500	5692620	We start talking about the next generation of consoles
5692700	5698020	Don't be surprised if this whole social network stuff is even more so a part of it
5698020	5701620	This doesn't really surprise me at all. I'm kind of surprised with rock band 3
5701620	5703540	That seems to be like one of the things they left out
5703540	5707980	I was always convinced that rock band 3 was gonna have a whole like upload your performance
5707980	5714860	I think like sing sing star have the sing star has that sing star has that and Def Jam rap star has that come on Konami you've
5714860	5716980	Got components for a good game in there
5716980	5722420	It just doesn't really do any rap stars one of the better music games has been put out recently. It really is
5723180	5726480	It's just it's they have the potential. They're just like
5728060	5730060	Do it
5731460	5733580	This is kind of disappointing I suppose
5733580	5738220	Um crisis 2 has been leaked online including multiplayer
5738380	5745460	it's not the final version of the game, but it's a near final build of the game including multiplayer and
5746260	5747860	also
5747860	5749380	apparently I
5749380	5751380	guess that there's
5751640	5753820	some other things including that
5755180	5759740	It doesn't have the DRM on it that there's a way to bypass it and that kind of stuff
5759740	5764580	I believe there are some stuff that's placeholder in it like some of the sound effects some of the assets are missing
5764580	5766580	but it is quite playable and
5767100	5772300	Is floating around out there for those unscrupulous types that may want to download that and check it out
5775180	5777380	Or you could you know support the game
5777900	5781360	Or you can do them also all the dev tools are included with it, too
5781360	5783660	So that's kind of which means that came from the inside
5784260	5787900	Well, yeah, it's development copy obviously came from the inside
5787900	5794100	That's got to be frustrating though for the company as a whole like what a way to kind of screw over your co-workers
5794100	5796100	It's a month before it comes out. Awesome
5797300	5802780	Yikes, they're gonna have to be doing some damage control on that. Yeah, it
5804180	5810900	That I think the the same thing happened with the last crisis game as well that it leaked out before it came out
5810900	5812900	I remember I
5812900	5818660	Remember that it did and I just didn't care though because I was a time when I actually was building computer for crisis
5819380	5820780	and
5820780	5828140	So I actually got crisis with my graphics card that came with my computer. So it wasn't such a big deal for me, but
5829220	5832340	That's gotta suck. It's I mean
5833580	5835580	It would have sucked even more if it was on consoles
5836660	5840300	Because that would have been terrible. But let's see here. I was just gonna read there was a
5840300	5845820	They're talking about comments though. What's not exactly working in it and stuff?
5848060	5850060	Apparently
5850980	5855500	Let's see, there's yeah assets missing there's temporary
5856540	5859380	Sounds and stuff for certain things and it's buggy
5860180	5862180	Which is not surprising
5864020	5866020	Hmm
5866020	5871220	Well, I don't know you think this could be damaging for the entire series in the future
5871220	5875820	I mean could this jeopardize I mean could this jeopardize more than just crisis to
5877820	5881300	Well, no, but I think that they definitely need to make sure that they
5883360	5885360	What they should have done is
5885540	5892780	If they are having people internally working on this stuff that they should maybe watermark them so that they know where they came from
5892780	5897220	You know like movie studios and stuff like that do that with film
5897940	5902200	Copies it sent out to theaters that way if they see a pirated one on the internet
5902200	5906180	They can go and find you know, the watermarks that are hidden within it and go
5906180	5912380	Okay, this came from such and such theater now. We know who to go kill, you know same with this
5912380	5917080	This is a development copy. It got leaked from the inside. So you got to find out who leaked it. I
5917080	5922440	I I'm just imagining what the temporary sounds are like
5923680	5927160	Like you shoot somebody goes. I don't think it's anything like that
5927160	5931280	I think if it's anything it's probably stuff from the original crisis game, you know
5931280	5937480	Just like stuff like that if I was a developer, I'd put in funny sounds too as my placeholders. I
5939160	5943080	Kind of want to check out the game though, honestly though, cuz I like the first one
5943080	5945720	I just couldn't finish it cuz it was so goddamn buggy
5945720	5947480	Mm-hmm
5947480	5951180	It's why I'm picking up the next one console though Xbox 360 all the way
5952440	5953200	All right
5953200	5957440	well one more story for you guys before we get into some of the other segments here about the
5957760	5963440	This is kind of along the same lines because this could be an effect we might see in the future for this whole piracy
5963440	5969260	I don't know. I'm just saying companies are doing what they want to do and this is about
5969680	5971680	PlayStation 3 games possibly
5971680	5979640	Getting serial numbers now, this is some sources that we're speaking with the site PS 3 cents, which is Dutch
5980120	5982120	Sony is going to implement a
5982140	5986160	Serial code security system for future ps3 game releases
5986160	5988920	This would be very similar to what you already know on PC titles
5988920	5994040	you get a long code that comes in the box you have to enter that in in order to play the game or install the
5994040	5997680	Game and that code can be used on up to five consoles
5997680	6001000	Now, of course folks are saying well, you're just basically
6001720	6005880	Slowing down the inevitable people are gonna find ways to hack around those serial number requirements
6005880	6011520	Anyway, and then you just piss off those folks that buy this stuff legitimately and you've just killed the use market as well
6011560	6016400	So awesome. I hope they don't do that because that's it's just dumb
6017020	6023640	What's interesting is that Kotaku actually called Sony on this for comments and Sony told them we are looking at a few options
6023640	6028280	Not ready to confirm our next steps. Oh, yes. They are looking in flat-out. Deny it
6029280	6034000	Yeah, if they would have said we don't comment or you know, no, that's not something we're doing
6034120	6036440	Yeah, they are looking at that as an option
6036440	6044060	So awesome that that's a terrible idea because I can tell you right now those serial codes really stop people hacking PC games
6044060	6048840	I mean that stuff gets broken like a day after it comes out. So I'm sorry that is
6049840	6051840	Terrible as a terrible idea
6051840	6052800	I
6052800	6058480	Yeah, yeah, and you know what the problem with that is and it's not even gonna necessarily stop piracy
6058480	6061880	It's gonna stop people buying your console is what it's gonna do. It's gonna stop people
6062560	6068020	Especially people, you know, like the hardcore gamers out there that have multiple consoles. You know what? Fuck it
6068020	6069840	I'm just not gonna buy this game on the ps3
6069840	6074940	I will buy it on the Xbox 360 or whatever other consoles are out there. I kind of I agree
6074940	6080080	That's exactly what's gonna happen because I think Sony would be surprised how fast word is gonna travel like that
6080080	6081920	And if you know it starts to get out there
6081920	6086600	Well, you can't sell back your used games so they don't sell for as much you can't let friends borrow your games
6086600	6091360	I can't do anything piracy on their games sell three is not a huge
6091360	6096040	I mean, let's put it this way the Xbox 360 has had piracy on it for a
6096640	6103320	Very long time. You don't see them going to dramatic, you know, very drastic measures like this
6103720	6107940	You know whereas ps3 piracy is just kind of getting around
6107940	6112980	And it's kind of cumbersome because blu-ray rips aren't exactly the smallest things to download
6112980	6119020	I mean, it's we're talking like, you know, some games being 20 to 50 gigs in size. That's not
6119980	6125180	Convenient for a lot of people to just download and pirate granted it people could do it
6125180	6127860	and there are people out there that will do it, but
6128940	6130940	it's a lot of
6130940	6137720	The hoops that jump through basically and to go this route and kind of punish everybody that owns a ps3
6138020	6143220	It's a really dumb idea. I mean if they think it's necessary then great go go that route
6143220	6145940	But don't be surprised that there's a huge backlash over it
6147220	6152080	I'm looking at our chat room at chat that orange lounge rated calm to try and see some of the comments here
6152380	6157660	Gamer girl in our term says dude, that doesn't surprise me. They're trying to put serial numbers on humans now, too. So
6158340	6160740	That might be a little bit too sci-fi for me. I don't know
6160740	6165580	Let's see Frisbee says more of a reason for me not to buy a PlayStation 3 and its products
6165780	6171500	dark Tetsuya says why is it the Earth's measures only seem to harm the legit users and
6172300	6176500	Read the haze says rumors from no-name site something plausible from a no-name site
6177200	6181020	Well, you never know, you know, there's been things we've reported on in the past that
6181700	6184020	You know, they call us a no-name site
6184020	6188440	So, you know whatever like I know we're not on the a-list of internet gaming websites
6188440	6193900	We're more like on the f-list, which is fine if but their console gets completely hacked open anyways
6194740	6202580	You know assuming they lose this court case and it sets some sort of precedent or whatever that jailbreaking a console is okay. I
6203820	6210000	Mean, let's just say that they do implement some sort of serial code or whatever that can be tracked
6210000	6213620	I mean right now people have found ways to get past even the you know
6213620	6218540	Firmware checks because the newest firmware that's out there obviously breaks all the hacks that are out there
6218540	6223060	Well people have found ways around that even and they're still able to connect to the PlayStation Network
6223060	6227660	so if they can find a way around that they could probably find a way around the authentication thing and
6228460	6231700	Then it doesn't even matter and on top of all that
6232060	6237560	How the hell are you gonna work that authentication thing in to people that don't have access to?
6237560	6243360	Online if your console is not connected to the internet, then you can't play your damn game that you bought so
6244160	6246160	How's that gonna work I?
6246960	6249840	Can say this for a business
6250480	6256680	Looking into something is not the same thing as implementing it and I think that they're smart to look at their options
6256680	6259720	But if they do implement it then that's when it gets stupid
6259720	6265600	They they do kind of owe it to these third parties that you know some of them having a lot of problems
6265600	6271020	You know we just reported on that crisis story or whatever. They do kind of owe it to them to keep their system safe, so
6271760	6273200	No
6273200	6279000	Alright, well, let's get to the mailbag and every week you guys send us emails and dark soccer likes to dive into the email bag
6279160	6282500	And read some of her favorite emails, so dark soccer. I want you to get to it
6283800	6290520	Well today's emails. Oh you actually just got one more while I decided to check, so I'm gonna read it to you
6291080	6293080	We got a lot of emails today Rob
6293080	6296160	Which I guess is good in contrast to how it's been before
6296880	6302920	Hey, Olr. This is red the haze longtime listener since 2007 if this email makes you in time for
6304600	6310120	Makes you in time for your February 13th show as to I'm typing this last minute
6310120	6315840	I called for the first time last week on your 400th show to congratulate you and I spoke about the Super Bowl sorry Super Bowl
6315840	6317980	And I would like to apologize to you guys about that
6317980	6323700	Olr is one of my favorite podcasts, and I felt bad in talking about something not game related or even food related
6323700	6325780	So I came up with a last-minute gaming question
6326140	6330900	My question is this I'm about to join the Air Force soon when I finish basic training and go to tech school
6330900	6335580	I won't be able to game on the consoles for a while and only be allowed to have a laptop or PC
6335740	6343600	Can you guys recommend a gaming laptop or pre-built PC and some PC gaming controllers since the wire 360 controllers d-pad is crap
6343600	6350800	For some emulator action I would also I would say right away probably the best gaming specific laptops out there are the alien
6350800	6357080	There's you're gonna pay some money for them. I'll say that might not be the best option though. It's super expensive to do that
6357080	6360360	Let me say just right off the top of my head. Those are probably the best
6360920	6366800	Laptops for gaming other than that as they build it yourself. I I would just look at what the specs are different laptops
6366800	6369640	I know everybody likes alien aware as a gaming laptop
6369640	6376920	But they're fucking expensive and seriously, like I have an aces Republic of gamers laptop or whatever works great for games
6376920	6383440	It's I mean the one I bought to preach, you know low-end, but you know, I can run Grand Theft Auto in it
6383440	6385880	Which is a very un I guess
6387360	6390760	It it could use some work as far as enhancing the game
6391640	6396880	Spec wise make a run crisis fine chugs on Grand Theft Auto, but um
6396880	6402680	you know, you can just don't spend a lot because those aces are the not the aces, but the
6403640	6410240	Alienware ones can be like over a thousand dollars. Well, my PC my PC is this what do I have again? I have a
6411080	6416920	An HP quad core that I picked up a couple years ago for 800 bucks with the monitor and all
6416920	6420400	and all I had to do was put in the new graphics card and
6420920	6422800	power supply and
6422800	6428600	It I play everything I want to play and I do all my graphics work and it's just fine. I
6430280	6434440	Well, I mean you guys have seen what games look like on my computer they run really well
6434440	6440240	Well, also if you've seen he's playing a running emulators, right? Oh, yeah, you don't need anything super high
6440240	6445600	If you're running emulators, remember that especially when it comes down to Maim and stuff the main things
6445600	6448680	you're gonna want to focus on are the speed of your CPU and
6448680	6454080	Do most emulators will run on a frickin netbook. Well that that's true
6454080	6458680	They will but I'm talking about Maim here Maim. You're gonna really need to focus on one thing
6458680	6462200	It doesn't matter if it's dual core quad core because most of the main bills don't support
6462200	6466520	You know the multi threading and stuff like that, but you're really gonna have to focus on
6467080	6468600	the actual
6468600	6473320	Core speed of it. So, you know you want something that's you know high twos to
6473320	6479120	Threes if not, I don't think they have fours out there but dance had Maim running just fine on his quad core
6479120	6480280	Just you know, I want to jump in here
6480280	6483320	Well, yeah, but I'm saying you know a lot of stuff though, that's fine
6483320	6489320	But like if you're trying to run really high-end Maim stuff like, you know, gauntlet legends or something like that
6489320	6492480	I mean that's gonna require a four gigahertz processor
6492480	6496520	Let me jump in here because read the haze is actually in chat right now in our chat room and say it says money isn't
6496520	6499980	A problem. I'm willing to spend 1k plus so that there you go. That's probably your answer
6499980	6505220	Otherwise, I would say kind of two things here. I have a Toshiba that I bought on sale for like 400 bucks
6506060	6510820	During a 4th of July sale at fries like two years ago, and it runs Wow cataclysm
6510820	6515780	Like, you know, I can't play max graphics settings, but I can get away with playing few PC
6515780	6520780	Yeah, I can play Starcraft 2 on it on low settings too. So it ain't gonna get away with some of the newer stuff
6520780	6523540	It's just like I won't get that pristine gaming experience
6523540	6529080	Well, that was only foreign about keep in mind with my with my lower and it was under spec for Star Trek online
6529080	6530620	But I played Star Trek online just fine
6530620	6536900	It looks shitty but it played and that's all I cared about and I I love this comment from salacious pop in our chat room
6536900	6540620	And maybe the best feedback is actually gonna come from our chat room on this because I haven't bought a laptop in a while
6540620	6545420	But this is pretty much how I did it when I bought it and this is what salacious pop says in our chat room to
6545420	6548740	Be honest, just look at what's on clearance at Best Buy that has a name-brand
6549140	6555940	ATI or Radeon card and then Google benchmarks and I think that's the smart thing to do is don't go in there and impulse buy
6555940	6558180	Something or don't buy something just because it's on sale
6558180	6562180	Google those things get reviews on them
6562740	6569180	See what they're capable of and try to make the best informed decision you can but if you want me to recommend you something right?
6569180	6573660	Off the cusp. Oh my gosh technology changes so fast. It's really hard for me to say something
6573660	6577260	I think the Toshiba I bought two years ago. They probably don't even make anymore. It's probably an even better one
6577260	6578820	That's 400 bucks now
6578820	6584660	The I like that laptop Loki has it's pretty nice the aces my little dinky netbook
6584660	6588880	No, I run SNES ROMs on it all the time. Yeah, so and I read them in Linux
6589580	6594300	So, of course, it's running more efficiently than it would be had it been in Windows. So sadly
6594300	6598300	I'm not gonna be able to name that definitive laptop for you, but I think you got tons of options
6598300	6602260	Just do your best to make an informed decision when you go shopping don't in action. Do not impulse buy
6603340	6609260	Thank you guys for all your hard work and passion for gaming. I wish you all the best. Bye. I love you guys all hearts
6609260	6616100	P.s. Forgive any grammatical mistakes as to I've been up for the last 20 hours finishing up a special Valentine's video
6616380	6621940	For my GF and forgot that you guys are on right now as I'm typing this letter much love read the haste
6621940	6627100	Oh, hey, you know if you want to spend a lot of money on a computer or something do your own case mod
6627100	6633100	Just build a fucking, you know regular computer inside of like a you know, nice, you know
6633100	6638460	a durable like suitcase type thing you could totally have a cutout Air Force logo and show your
6640380	6645420	A really nice case mod for see that's the thing high-end laptops are so fucking expensive
6645420	6649700	And if you're like, you know, they're saying like there's some there $3,000 for $3,000
6649700	6654100	You can build a nice PC and nice monitor if you spend just a little bit of time
6654100	6659860	You know putting together even a very crude, you know case mod for it. It would be really nice. I
6659860	6665460	I there was one of Dan's friends that built his PC out of a giant toolbox
6666540	6668540	And it was pretty cool
6668820	6670820	but next email
6671540	6675140	This is from rubba. I was listening to up
6675780	6682100	396 where you read my email about the 3ds and lazy eye. I was really wrong in stating. It's a muscular disorder
6682100	6686740	I had all sorts of causes. No, it has all sorts of causes and there are all sorts of treatments
6686740	6690020	I shouldn't talk about things. I know little about so I am correcting myself
6690660	6697220	When you were doing the listless, I thinking horror game genre games lawns dark deathmatch
6697220	6699580	The graphics would look like those airplane safety cards
6700660	6702660	Davros speak and spell spell
6702740	6704080	exterminate
6704080	6708000	Teddy Ruxpin soul-stealer. Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin and you have to sleep sometime
6709380	6711380	That was pretty funny
6711620	6713620	nice and
6713620	6717780	Teddy Ruxpin dolls were pretty scary back in the day. Just so you know, they were freaky
6717780	6722460	We also got another one from Rob a button since it's short. I'll read it. I just got TDU, too
6722460	6725740	I haven't played enough to check out the clubhouses and such I can say
6725900	6730660	That despite the claims of any modeling system the games driving feels very much like the original TDU
6730660	6735120	My only criticism of the gameplay so far is that it is very difficult to see intersections
6735420	6737540	Do cops know how to drive off-road this time?
6737540	6743440	Because that was hilarious in the last one. Oh, there's cops chasing at me. I'm gonna drive off-road. I can't get me
6744180	6750380	The other news is that GameStop is giving out codes for TDU to casino to the first purchasers of the game
6750380	6754940	The only problem is the day it was released. None of the casino codes worked
6754940	6761420	I discovered that the codes weren't activated until February 9th at the earliest. It was really great being able to find
6761420	6768860	That on the Atari support forums, but they never put it in on the news feeds on their site or in the in-game news feed
6769060	6770900	rubba-buh
6770900	6772900	That's poopy
6774060	6776060	Okay email from
6776820	6783500	CMD whoever hey guys a couple of days ago. My mother purchased on pre-order for me the Nintendo 3ds
6783500	6788320	It is selling for 350 Australian. I guess it's a UD Australian
6788320	6794920	In which includes the 3ds one game and an accessories pack. So March 31st. I'm going to be super happy. Keep up the good work
6796720	6798720	Good for you send us one
6800440	6805760	Hey guys Moulton Brown here, I'm writing to congratulate you on your 400th episode. Keep up the awesome work
6805760	6807760	My weekends are never the same without you
6808480	6814480	I'm not really writing in with game related questions or news, but just some comments one to Loki over comment
6814480	6818560	You said a couple of episodes ago about a court's decision to allow the suit against J hat
6818680	6822600	The idea that a court has jurisdiction against a person whose online activities
6822800	6825840	Has a presence in their state is not a new or random thing
6825840	6832160	If I remember civil procedure correctly, depending on what the website is doing directly advertising and soliciting customers
6832160	6837080	I think is the message board site where the owners and other parties can communicate with each other or being a
6837440	6843540	Neutral site that just allows users to look up information will influence whether the court feels they have jurisdiction over a party
6843540	6849460	the more the site seems to directly advertise and solicit customers the more likely it is that the court will find they do have
6849500	6854620	Jurisdiction over the party who owns slash uses the website because the party has purposefully availed themselves
6854860	6859920	To the privilege of doing business in the particular state. This means that the party voluntarily
6860620	6866180	Subjected themselves to the jurisdictions of courts in that state a court can see J hats website as soliciting customers
6866400	6870320	Because it was advertising a service the ability to jailbreak your ps3. I
6870320	6874600	I wouldn't say it's a service because all he was doing is sharing information
6875360	6879820	That's not really, you know, hey, I'll jailbreak your you know ps3 for you. I
6880820	6884040	Think it's a matter of perception, but it does have a point there
6884040	6887840	Well, it's however the court decides to see it and I can understand that they were sitting
6887840	6892420	You know bringing him to California because his websites hosted in California, but that's not the case
6892420	6900020	It was all because he communicated on Twitter, which pretty much everybody on the planet does nowadays and he had a PayPal account
6900580	6903260	Which he had a donation thing on his web page
6904220	6909220	That that that was their criteria for it really it was because hey, guess what?
6909220	6912020	they have a lot of lawyers on retainer in California, so
6912540	6914540	that I
6914580	6919560	Don't know whatever, you know, it's still going through and I remember there's some extra
6919560	6921480	You
6921480	6928080	Know stuff going on with the case right now where they you know now he's surrendered his hard drive and stuff
6928680	6930200	to the courts for
6930200	6937700	You know Sony to go through as well as you know with his lawyer present, of course, and then they were actually trying to subpoena
6938480	6945800	Google and Twitter and stuff to find out who the hackers were and fail overflow, but they were denied
6945800	6952520	So they can't really figure out who those other people are at this point and it doesn't matter anyways
6952520	6958800	Because they're not in the United States. So you can't I mean the laws are different. So I think the translation is
6960200	6965180	It doesn't matter. Anyways, everybody's like, oh no, I hope he you know, delete his hard drive stuff
6965180	6969240	And I hope all this stuff. He didn't think he did anything wrong and you know
6969240	6972200	He's out to prove that and so he has nothing behind. Yeah
6972200	6974200	I
6974200	6990800	Don't like that bitch. I don't see her. I don't like that bitch. I don't see her
6992560	6994560	Yeah, that's pretty much me and Rama
6996160	6998160	Hey Rama
6998160	7002680	Bitch bitch. All right, someone can say the word bitch over and over
7003440	7006600	Three on my nickname since Rob makes fun of my nickname from time to time
7006600	7011500	I felt I had to explain it when I was trying to figure out a nickname for America's Army
7011500	7013500	I created molten brown an homage to my eyes
7013880	7019060	Which kind of look mahogany on the edges the closest color I could think of but as you get closer to the people the color
7019060	7023860	Lightens up significantly. I always thought my eyes had a molten feel to them
7023860	7029940	Like they're a like there was a flame behind my eyes and that the color that caused the color to lighten
7030180	7035680	Additionally when I'm angry or happy my eye color seems to lighten up as if the fire is being turned up a notch because of
7035680	7039400	How I am feeling so I thought molten brown made sense as a nickname. That's poetic
7039820	7044820	Okay, that's all for me. Why don't I feel like crap for going straight to like the poop reference but
7045860	7049860	Pun intended take care. That's a nice story now. I feel like
7049860	7056220	I'm like molten brown myself. This message is brought to you by snow the only substance I can think of that's beautiful
7056220	7058220	But consistently makes me want to punch someone in the face
7059860	7061860	That's a good way to sum it up
7062020	7063660	Excuse me
7063660	7066940	This one is from catastrophic moggie
7067580	7069940	Hi, olr. I'm sure this week
7069940	7074820	You'll all be a buzz about the news of the deaths of guitar hero and DJ hero
7074820	7077620	So I thought I'd pass on a bit of news that's got me excited
7077620	7082180	I was more than a bit miffed when I heard that the 3ds was region locked
7082180	7087340	I often import DS games because they are cheaper and usually released long before they are in Europe
7087340	7090220	That is if they remember to release them here at all
7090220	7094780	I know it might sound silly but I also prefer the cases that are used in the u.s
7094780	7099420	Much better than the ugly bulky semi-clear cases we get here. I like actually like the
7100700	7103620	European cases honestly, but I see your point
7103620	7109540	Anyway, what I am getting at is that I was seriously thinking about whether I'll bother getting a 3ds
7109540	7113020	I mean only got 360 a couple months ago and still have tons of games
7113020	7116300	I want to try but I read that cave stories being released on
7117020	7119900	it well that threw a spanner in the works and
7120420	7123180	The concept art looks really impressive
7123900	7127300	See you guys around catastrophic moggie. I have to look at this now. I
7127300	7132580	I want to see what the art looks like. Okay cave stories Wow
7135220	7137220	Wow pretty
7138340	7140340	Okay, Jamie wants this
7141020	7143820	I'm gonna link it in the chat room because it's pretty
7145380	7147380	It's really pretty
7147500	7153420	Because I I was I I tried cave story, but I thought it was kind of meh, but this is pretty
7153420	7156660	There you go, everyone. Take a look in there
7158340	7160060	And
7160060	7167780	Now for our next email and by the way, thank you catastrophic moggie for sharing that link is it's pretty
7168900	7174500	Anyway, next email up. Hey, olr sing as the mailbag has been somewhat skimpy on average for a while now
7174500	7178620	I thought that it's in an email this week covering a few topics first off
7178620	7182820	There is a free video available on PSN iTunes and the Xbox Live zoom marketplace
7182820	7184820	Which is the pilot of mr. Sunshine?
7184860	7189940	It's easy to find on PSN and iTunes if it takes a little hunting to find it via Xbox Live zoom
7191540	7192700	Excuse me
7192700	7194060	Let's send my related note
7194060	7199340	I found out a cool little deal that I'm sure the dark soccer would make use of since she's a Marvel fan. Yep
7200020	7203900	Assuming that there's Target stores out west and sales are nationwide not just reasonable
7203900	7206420	They have Planet Hulk on blu-ray for dirt cheap
7206740	7212180	At least at my favorite Target the shelf tag listed is $10 hell of a ring up to 750
7212180	7216380	Movies, especially blu-rays don't get much cheaper than that new or used after seeing it
7216380	7221100	I was awestruck over how gorgeous the animation was and how good the voice acting was all in all it's a good
7221100	7227260	Bye as a side note if you were able to do so try picking up the animated Dante's Inferno movie released in tandem with the game
7227260	7231220	It was equally as good as Planet Hulk now if you're a fan of certain voice actors
7231220	7235060	I should mention that both Mark Hamill and Steve Blum have roles in Dante's Inferno
7235320	7237620	See I would be interested in seeing Dante's Inferno
7237620	7242620	but I am NOT a Hulk fan at all because Marvel has just gone overboard with Hulk and
7243060	7248180	Every single freaking issue that Hulk should have nothing to do with Hulk was in spider-girl
7248220	7253180	What do Hulk and spider-girl have in common, but that's not an argument for this podcast
7253180	7258580	So probably no Hulk for me, but I did like the the ultimate Avengers once those are cool
7259660	7260980	As for the last topic
7260980	7266600	I assume that you have already covered the story about Activision giving guitar hero the axe as well as shredding Tony Hawk
7266600	7269440	puns fully intended in my honest opinion
7269440	7275320	It's about time Activision really ran those two franchises into the ground and frankly they haven't learned that quality is greater than quantity
7275560	7280120	Where they went wrong with guitar hero at least is the fact that they are inundated
7280120	7287200	They inundated the market with poorly supported via download content titles every year like clockwork now if they'd followed EA
7287840	7293960	Harmonix lead and use the rock band business model they would have fared better and the bottom wouldn't have fallen out of the music game
7293960	7297080	Market, I bet that within two to three years time the Call of Duty series
7297800	7303380	Will likely suffer the same fate it isn't too far of a stretch to predict that happening
7303520	7307080	Thanks for taking the time to read this email errors and all it's appreciated
7307560	7312640	PS although I haven't fully put it together in time for this week's show hopefully by next week if possible
7312640	7317320	I'd like to initiate a little contest open to PA US PS 3 owners
7317480	7322860	Sorry everyone else you wouldn't be able to make use of the prize even if you won due to how PSN is set up
7322860	7326700	It'll be one winner and who who will get some videos from you
7327360	7332920	USPS and video store anyone has a ps3 and is in the US banter. I just need to come up with a wordy trivia question

7369160	7373780	Oh, but before we get to those we have to get into the F use of the week
7373780	7377820	It's the part of the show where we get angsty as we've done for the last 400 weeks
7395660	7401720	Dark Sakura my f you goes towards people not understanding the difference between
7401720	7408880	making a comment about an article and then spamming your Facebook with a bajillion comments
7409600	7412240	Arguing a political point that you really don't care to discuss
7413440	7415440	so
7415520	7419640	Forget it if it happens again, I'm gonna do what I did this time and delete it
7421200	7425120	This is the form of me my wall me your wall you
7425120	7430120	Respect my authority Facebook is serious business. That's why I'm back on my journal. I
7431680	7435160	Never left live journal. I don't know why people are I realize
7435680	7437600	Journal, but I ignored it for a little bit
7437600	7442720	Here's that I realize there's a lot of creepy shit on live journal like I get that like I get the lol the Harry Potter
7442720	7445840	Stuff, but you know, that's not what everybody's into just say it
7447360	7449360	Anyhow, Loki
7449360	7454480	I know I was mad at something earlier this week. I just don't remember it was so
7456640	7462760	No F you to drama I suppose good fallback option, I guess
7466160	7468160	Effie to dance 360 for breaking
7471440	7473440	Dance in the back going yeah
7473440	7478880	If you did that little audio boo-boo, I just had they're going on there if you did not being perfect and if you did the fact
7478880	7480960	I don't have tacos right now. It's talk with something. Oh
7482400	7486400	Sure, but you're gonna help me want you to my ventrilo. Oh
7487440	7490440	Yeah, I can help fix that for you though. I'll be fun. Um
7491320	7494960	Otherwise, I actually I don't have a lot to be bad about things are fine right now
7495520	7500800	I don't know if you did the fact that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you. I'm not gonna be able to talk to you
7500800	7505200	I don't know if you did the fact that I'm separated on Valentine's Day
7505520	7510160	Not like separated like in that context might be separated by distance, but it's just a day
7510160	7515400	I mean, you know the meanings come on Rob somebody got decapitated. So no, no, it's
7517160	7518920	All right
7518920	7523840	Anyhow, let's get back into a couple more gaming news stories and then we're gonna get to your calls
7524760	7526760	Should be fun tonight
7526760	7531760	Um something I really like about little big planet is the wonderful community made levels
7531760	7534200	And of course, you know with a little big planet one
7534200	7536200	They had some pretty awesome stuff that they did with
7536520	7541400	Contra which I hope they remake those for a little big plant to and time all together. That'd be really awesome
7542120	7548920	But now they're doing something very similar to the contra thing where they have a project that's a collaboration between a bunch of different members
7549420	7555280	They have one that's actually being done between 12 of the community members. It's called Hansel and
7555280	7563480	Gretel bot it's a seven level little big planet to adventure that has cutscenes and everything and they say that the
7564280	7567600	Level design is on par with that with the first
7568320	7572220	Roll the single-player campaign that's with little big planet, too
7572520	7577360	So definitely worth checking out and it will be out hopefully soon
7578760	7580000	so
7580000	7583640	That's pretty sweet. They actually covered it on the PlayStation blog as well. I
7583640	7584880	I
7584880	7588680	Need to not let that game slip through the cracks. I still have not bought little big planet, too
7588680	7589840	I really want to play it
7589840	7591560	It looks like they're doing a lot of amazing things
7591560	7595680	But maybe one of the F use I should give is that I don't have like shit tons of money right now
7595680	7601360	So, you know buying a $60 game is hard to justify. I did buy a $30 game though. So
7602000	7603080	but
7603080	7606820	Yeah, I have to really be picky-choosey on what video games I buy so
7607480	7610520	Maybe I'll like rent it or something. I don't know
7610520	7612880	Anyhow, one more story for you guys
7612880	7615480	Then we're gonna get to the Skype line one eight seven seven game
7615600	7620840	Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio do make sure if you're gonna give us a call on Skype you do call
7620840	7627080	Echo one two three first to test your setup and remember the other rule of radio if you're gonna call a radio show
7627560	7632120	Mute your radio once you get through. All right, one more story for you guys though, and it has to do with dogs and kitties
7632760	7638280	Nintendogs plus cats is one launch tiles for the 3ds and the breeds have been revealed
7638280	7644920	Revealed and of course there are going to be several different versions of the game, duh
7645680	7651960	One of them is toy poodle and friends which comes with a toy poodle a Pembroke Welsh corgi
7652360	7658560	Cornish Nouser boxer bull terrier Labrador retriever Shih Tzu Jack Russell and Pomeranian
7658960	7665900	Pomeranian, excuse me. I'm not a dog person. Excuse me French Bulldog and friends comes with French Bulldog Shetland sheepdog
7665900	7672660	Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Chihuahua Dalmatian Yorkshire Terrier German Shepherd Husky and Basset hound and
7673180	7678420	Shiba Inu and friends which will be golden retriever and friends for those of us here in the US and Europe
7678820	7686580	Shiba Inu golden retriever beagle mini pincher dachshund Maltese Great Dane pugs and cocker spaniels
7686580	7690340	Your Great Dane will die in two years. Mm-hmm. So there you go now
7690340	7695260	I don't really see what the cats are yet on if the cats are the same in every game or what the deal is
7695260	7698180	But I'd get which everyone has a mouth in it
7699260	7701260	Because they were worshiped
7702140	7706700	One of that sure me too more information is available on the Japanese site nintendo.co.jp
7707580	7714180	More information is available there. I will probably get the one with a Welsh corgi in it, even though it's a frickin poodle
7714740	7720540	Well, I want one with a big big fat. Sure me in it. I don't want this game, but I
7720540	7727040	I feel compelled to buy this game. I really don't want this game. I don't cuz I don't either and I feel compelled to buy it
7727040	7728040	I do
7728040	7734040	Imagine chinchillas, it's gonna be one of those games that I play for like a day and then I get so sick of it
7734040	7739720	I know me too. But maybe if we both get suckered into it, we can at least like trade cat toys
7740080	7741080	That'll be fun, right?
7741080	7747040	But it's gonna be it's just gonna be like any console release with me where I buy a bunch of games
7747040	7751780	I play them a little bit and I get bored with them except for like maybe one or two. That's really good
7751780	7757540	I did it with the Xbox 360. I bought like almost all launch titles and it really shouldn't have because
7758200	7760200	most of them I didn't give a shit about
7762360	7764360	But whatever, you know
7765640	7767640	Gotta support the devs I guess I
7768880	7771260	Just want that sure me the game
7771260	7776840	That's my new dream game. Everybody is fat. Sure me. What would happen in fat? Sure me the game
7777220	7781980	You get to poker and have her make really weird faces at you and then you'd have to clean up her litter box
7781980	7785900	And then you'd also have to figure out ways to keep her from shitting on the kitchen floor
7785900	7787940	And you'd be very careful not to talk about the tester
7788460	7794180	Very she's not in the room so we can talk about it all we want. All right, let's go to the phones calls already coming in
7794180	7799180	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is excellent kicks link. How you doing, buddy? Hey doing good
7799180	7803800	What's that be better be better if I know I wasn't getting gypped off or you don't know Jack for the PC
7803800	7808380	And it's kind of funny because the creators are poking fun at PC people, but that's all right. How so
7809260	7811420	Well, I guess apparently on one of the forums
7811420	7817380	that's when the guy took a screenshot of the Twitter account for you don't know Jack and when the guys replied by
7817660	7819500	Because he was they're asking
7819500	7824660	if they were if they were willing to pay more money if they can get more than it's two players local and he goes are
7824660	7829500	More are more PC players who've had to fit in the more to more than two out of keyboard. Oh
7831620	7837420	Like wow, I was like really serious that is kind of funny it's a little bit funny. Yeah
7838020	7839580	I don't know if they
7839580	7844500	legitimately did a purpose or they kind of did it kind of like a test run to see how many people buy it and maybe
7844500	7849660	Put it down the road as possibly a DLC or a patch or something or what they're gonna do
7849660	7857180	but I hope they really seriously do just want it to because it doesn't feel like the full experience without like four players that I'm
7857180	7859100	used to playing beforehand
7859100	7862180	But you know before the speaking of beforehand though
7862180	7865860	We didn't have back in the 90s all this Xbox Live stuff and all that fun stuff
7865860	7868380	Like if you didn't have other people to play with in the same room
7868700	7869820	It just yeah
7869820	7874220	But at the same time too though if I have four people at the bed here at the house and I want to play with
7874220	7877580	Four people like my next-door neighbors for example, then I can't do that
7877580	7880700	I can only play with one person at a time like if I were to play something else
7880700	7883900	It's not like me and my girlfriend versus my two neighbors
7883900	7889520	It said it will be either me my girlfriend my girlfriend versus one my neighbors or you know or me versus my girl
7889520	7894580	You know, I'm saying though. It's yeah, I get two people be left out. You are getting the shorter end of the stick
7894580	7896860	Of course, it is ten dollars cheaper for what it's worth
7898460	7905020	Yeah, but still I'd rather pay the if it was the extra ten four to two still I would I would definitely pay that because
7905020	7907300	It still feels a little left out
7907300	7908220	But at the same time too
7908220	7912840	I hope they do something about that because at the same time to a lot of people a lot of people are complaining about it
7912840	7916420	Right. I'm sure a lot more people were too and it was like one of people like me
7916420	7918460	For example who bought on day one. It didn't know this
7918460	7922840	I might have been a little hesitant and be like well screw this I'll wait to the steam has on sale then buy it
7923980	7925540	But at the same time too, though
7925540	7930620	It's a great game and definitely worth 20 bucks and a steam achievements for the PC and it's definitely worth to buy
7930620	7937260	I'm also swords first swords and poker one and two are back on the iTunes
7938140	7944020	For to purchase if anybody wants to purchase them. I just recommend highly recommend them for to do so
7944780	7948660	It was like Loki said I have a shit ton of fun
7948660	7955140	I guess I could say personally playing those two games and I always bounce back and forth between the first and second one and it's
7955140	7958600	A lot of fun. So if you're in a card game to definitely buy those is such an awesome
7958600	7963280	Seriously, now that's on the App Store. You need to buy it. It's like 99. Yes. It's oh they came back. They came back
7963280	7970440	Yes, yeah sword poker two and sword poker one. Seriously, go buy it on the App Store. It will it'll take over your life
7970440	7975880	It will I'll check it out. That's a pretty big endorsement. I'll have to look in that both of them are about
7976400	7981580	Five to six dollars. I think I know the second one's like three and I think the first one's two
7982480	7986040	So yeah, you're looking like five it's still worth it for that dollars
7986040	7993000	I've worked like worth of money probably like at least 50 hours into the first one are or the second game already
7993520	7996240	Yeah, I'm like a few hours in the second one
7996240	8000400	But I'm going through and still trying to finishing up the first one and the first one is just as bad as the second
8000400	8002840	So, but it's a lot of fun. It was very challenging
8003600	8004800	Well, let me take it back to you
8004800	8008660	Don't know Jack for a minute as somebody who played it like a long time ago these tech issues aside
8008660	8012880	Were you really happy to see this come back? Is this a worthy upgrade? Yes, and yes
8012880	8017880	and it has all the pretty much old features like a few new things that it as well, but
8018600	8023920	Anybody's a trivia fan definitely buy it. It's worth it's worth the money. Do you think will be the support system?
8023920	8026360	Do you think it will be the first of several revival games?
8026360	8032160	I hope so and I hope so in a good way not in a bad way because they did they did pretty decent job
8032160	8034900	Like I said before I just really wish that there was four players
8035040	8038040	They could do something like that down the road or maybe add another one with it
8038040	8039720	Then yes, they'll be awesome
8039720	8044120	And then the fact that it has DLC and stuff that's gonna be attached to it that would make it even more so. Mm-hmm
8045280	8050940	Because now instead of buying like you don't know jack sports now, it's like oh you can get to sports DLC for it
8051640	8055880	so definitely and also I bought NBA Jam for
8056440	8060920	The iTouch and iPad and it's wonderful. It's really
8061800	8065120	Yeah, I think on the iOS though those games would kind of blow
8065120	8070440	No, it's it's a little smaller, but it it for me. I like it
8071760	8077360	Same way as NBA Jam, so it has a lot of unlockable stuff, so I'm playing it for quite a while
8077360	8079600	So all right well, buddy
8079600	8081200	We're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls
8081200	8084880	But enjoy the you don't know jack even though you didn't get it on Xbox 360
8084880	8088600	So I can't play with you, but I guess life goes on sorry hopefully meet one day PC
8088600	8091400	So you always have Wow to play definitely although?
8091400	8098080	I was playing it for a while, and then I went back to Wow are you interested in rift at all any interest in rift?
8098440	8103560	Maybe maybe maybe all right all right gotta let you go so we get more calls. Take care, buddy. It's all right. Bye
8104280	8106560	Again, if you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game
8106560	8112560	Oh, well our our username on Skype is orange lounge radio. Let's go take another call hi on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8112560	8118560	Oh, hi, you know it's ready. Who's this?
8123360	8128600	Bring back all these memories of like old games. I used to play like Street Fighter
8129720	8131720	Metal Diggers Mortal Kombat
8132800	8134640	King of Fighters
8134640	8136440	Final Fantasy
8136440	8138440	Dark Stalkers
8138680	8140680	Double Dragon
8140680	8142680	net sure
8143000	8145000	Ninja Gaiden
8145000	8147000	nobody
8149240	8151240	Virtual Fighter
8154880	8159780	You should turn down your speakers dude now you know I want to see how long you can keep going what other what other old
8159780	8170900	classic games
8170900	8175180	Like what's the point seriously? I don't even understand
8176260	8179780	Well, thank you very much to the caller from area code six one two six seven zero
8180980	8183900	Maybe I'll give the rest out later all right. Let's take some more calls
8184960	8187020	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8187020	8190660	Hey, this is DR dollar bill. Hey, what's on your mind?
8191300	8192580	Hey
8192580	8196660	Hey, um just quick just quickly. I didn't get to do this quick um
8197660	8201940	First off. I was trying to remember the if you didn't know Jack the original PC version
8201940	8204820	I don't think there was four players even on the original version
8205500	8208460	There wasn't I think it was three on the original version. Oh
8209740	8214620	yeah, so I kind of says his like his thing about it should be in four players, but if
8214620	8221220	You know if it was based on the same concept. I I'm trying to picture four people holding the keyboard together
8221220	8223900	It just seems kind of crowded don't you think?
8225780	8228940	At one keyboard yeah, that might be a little bit comfy
8230380	8233180	Yeah, I mean the online multiplayer
8233180	8239020	I agree with they should do that, but on a local machine that and no no just didn't seem right
8239020	8245340	But you used to do three on one keyboard, and I seem to remember the buzzer keys were like Q
8245980	8249460	Spacebar and like right bracket or something they were kind of like spread out
8249460	8254780	So you could sit kind of in an interesting arrangement and do it for might be getting a little comfy
8254780	8258540	But you could like give a person the mouse and they could like click it. I don't know
8259180	8261180	That'd be a good one, okay
8261580	8266260	All right that one and it was something else and I oh yeah
8266260	8269620	Just really quick because I'd heard it begin to show you guys were talking about
8270220	8274580	DDR and guitar hero how like they both seen them were falling one point of the
8275420	8280380	Continuously kind of same game, but very little evolution between the two mm-hmm like you know our DDR
8280380	8286280	Just slowly didn't really evolve much. Just maybe some different step shots and maybe a couple different modes eventually
8286660	8290140	But it's still alive a lot longer than guitar hero
8290140	8295500	Did we actually figure out what might like what was some ideas like why this was so?
8297300	8301940	Run that by me one more time like like how's the DDR still survives um
8302980	8307820	One theory that we had is that the games are simply lower budget because keep in mind Konami
8307820	8310660	They do license songs now, but they don't license quite as many
8310660	8311540	It's like ten songs
8311540	8314580	Maybe in a game and they use their in-house team for the rest of it
8314580	8317360	And I think the expectations just aren't quite as high
8317360	8321860	And I think they still sell quite a few through the whole weight loss thing like it's not we fit
8321980	8327740	But certainly I was even listening to a morning show here locally where somebody brought up
8327740	8333460	And they were they weren't saying it jokingly like it was some chick who got a we for Valentine's Day
8333460	8335460	And she was saying to the host that she was going to
8335860	8340280	Play lots of we fit and the host was going you're gonna. You're not gonna play any we fit
8340280	8343060	You're gonna play it for three days, and then you're gonna be over it
8343060	8346300	And you know then you'll say oh, I'm gonna play dance dance revolution
8346300	8350460	You'll play that two times two so you know the name is still out. There is my point
8350460	8355740	Is that you know it's still getting name-checked in some places, but I just think overall those games are lower budget
8355740	8359980	And so they have lower expectations, and I think that's why those games to and unfortunately it shows
8362260	8365500	And it's also still very Japan centric
8365500	8369940	I think you know Konami closed their offices here in the US are they might have the one in LA
8369940	8375060	I think they have the one in LA, but they don't have the one Hawaii. They don't have one in North Bay that I'm sorry
8375060	8379260	Nor Cal in the bay. They don't have those anymore so most of that
8379260	8383720	I imagine is coming out of Japan and those games are probably still selling in Japan whereas guitar hero
8383900	8387060	What did they have one in Japan and that was it I?
8387980	8391540	Didn't think I released in Japan. I didn't think it would yeah
8392220	8398120	What guitar hero? I think there was like one. I think one of them did get a localized Japanese release
8398120	8404980	But I don't think it was huge. I could be wrong don't like quote me on that or call me an idiot if I'm wrong
8404980	8408020	But I want to say one time. I do remember reading about it, so
8409120	8410620	Okay, that's cool
8410620	8414980	All right wait anybody what's that anything else on your mind, buddy?
8416820	8422180	That's all right, I mean, I just didn't have much to say except hi guys hey, what's up? All right?
8422180	8426940	Well at least you aren't high as hell like the last caller, so all right. I know
8427660	8430100	All right, take care buddy. You too. Bye guys. Bye

8471140	8473140	Thank you to orange right in our chatroom
8473140	8479900	Very knowledgeable, dude when it comes to the music games guitar hero 3 and Aerosmith were released in Japan same as the other releases
8479900	8481900	No localization. Thank you for the clarification
8482980	8484980	Let's take some more calls
8484980	8491220	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Ranma and this time Rob. I'm not going to attack you tonight. Thank you
8491220	8495100	I appreciate it. You're welcome. All right, so what's up?
8495660	8501220	Not too much. Um, I have some interesting topics. I want to discuss. I'll make them brief as possible
8501220	8506140	Yeah, but first I would like to give my prediction for episode 500
8507720	8509720	Okay, what is that
8509720	8516360	Number one u.s. Lashes pop get married live on the air. I
8517440	8519440	Don't know about that. But okay
8520960	8528120	Predictions predictions. Yeah, and right after we find out Doc Sakura is pregnant and she gives birth live on the air
8528120	8530120	No, not happening
8530360	8536060	And after all is said and done Loki is still oblivious the entire world is he still plays grant depth auto for
8536060	8541240	Well in two years, they're gonna have grant that thought of five. So I mean, come on
8541860	8544740	And we're gonna be playing seems for a three later on this year
8544740	8549820	So I'm very excited about that at least a quick break on grand theft auto, but hey, you got to be honest
8549820	8552060	so the grand theft auto games we play are
8552940	8556660	Not quite the grand theft auto games that other people play. It's
8557540	8561560	It's a little different type of an animal that we're playing lots of high
8561560	8567240	Explosives and people flying through the air and at bus food. There is bus food in this game
8568480	8570820	It's it's a sight that behold seriously
8571840	8575960	We'll be making new videos once it's all done too. I can't wait to see those
8579680	8582980	All right any other lovely predictions we got a ways to go
8582980	8589720	Oh, that's all for the predictions. But um, as I've been listening for the last couple of podcasts. I've been trying to catch up. Um
8589720	8594700	My quick take on the on the on Sony's neogeo pocket
8596160	8597520	Uh-huh
8597520	8602680	It says it's going to be 3g and all this enabled. I can see it now
8602960	8606000	They're going to market the car the portable console at about
8607680	8609080	$400 and
8609080	8612160	What they're going to do they're probably gonna partner trip with either
8612160	8620040	AT&T or t-mobile where you go in and you get the console for $99.99 with a two-year
8620040	8622040	I'm contract with it
8624560	8628640	Yeah, lock them in with a contract that's that's the way to do it that's what they're trying to do with the phone
8629640	8633300	Yeah, I mean hey it kind of work for the taco. Why not for the NGP?
8634760	8641860	Who knows seriously if anyone is serious about you know gaming with 3g on the NGP
8641860	8649360	Or even anything like the iPod or I you know iPad whatever don't fucking you know sign up for this shit
8649360	8656040	Just I mean, I think you just get the cheapest data plan possible. Like I said not to sound like a
8656840	8663240	You know pitchman for Virgin Mobile, but seriously $25 a month for you know a phone that I can
8664280	8668840	Hack and tether to my iPod if I really need to surf, you know
8668840	8675280	I prefer surfing the web on the iPod over my Android phone because it's kind of slow but you know in the pinch
8675280	8679040	It works, but seriously though if I wanted like, you know game my laptop
8679040	8684600	And I got through a week of just you know, using it for surfing the web, but I have my fight
8684600	8686960	I don't use it anymore because it's $45 a month
8687560	8691380	For just data, whereas I can just tether to my phone and I get the same shit
8691380	8695060	of course, they don't want you to do that and that's done through like a hack but
8695060	8699980	Hey, whatever. It was a relatively easy hack so it can be done by pretty much anybody. Oh
8700700	8703700	I know I got my phone is the same way. I could do it with mine
8703700	8706500	But now that you know Virgin Mobile or everybody else they're capping
8707060	8714020	The how much bandwidth you can spend when doing all this and guarantee if I was gonna be on these 3g networks gaming
8714660	8720940	It'll be a funny thing that as their game and they hit their cap and you see a look their network logo saying
8720940	8728100	Sorry, you have used up all your bandwidth push this button to add more time there. There's no way you'll run through unless you're gaming
8728820	8732620	24-7 over 3g and a lot of people have Wi-Fi in their houses
8732620	8738500	There is not gonna be a time that you're into a cap problem. It's just not fast enough. I mean I
8739700	8741540	Just it's gonna be rare to do that
8741540	8744900	That's why they have those caps in place because those people are using on way more day
8744900	8749500	I mean I've tried streaming stuff on my phone and it shows me the kind of data
8749500	8755620	It's using but there's your unless you're dedicating, you know, you don't have Wi-Fi in your house
8755620	8762060	You're just on this 3g and that's it then maybe I mean it would take some really heavy use
8762060	8766860	But for most people where they're near Wi-Fi like I have Wi-Fi my work. I have Wi-Fi at home
8766860	8768660	I've you know, there's Wi-Fi here
8768660	8769180	I mean
8769180	8776220	I just have I can bounce on all those with my phone with my iPod and there's very rare times that are in between
8776220	8778220	That I actually need to use the 3g
8778220	8783900	For anything or you know, you know, my cable goes out or something like that, but fair enough. It's very rare
8783900	8787060	so it I don't think that's really gonna be an issue but
8788300	8790100	You know, who knows?
8790100	8792100	Yeah, pretty much
8792100	8796660	All right. Well, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls. All right, cool. That's cool. All right. Take care, buddy
8796660	8798660	All right. You got it. Bye. Bye
8799100	8803740	All right. We got more calls coming in. Why not? Let's get to it. Hi on orange launch radio. Who's this?

8811000	8812460	Okay
8812460	8818660	Yeah, I got a little bit confession to make actually a really bad crack problem and uh, I
8819460	8824880	Don't know. I feel that I don't know playing video games sometimes else, but I don't know
8826380	8828380	Uh-huh. I just don't know
8829300	8832140	Well, what cost you to start smoking crack in the first place?
8832140	8839100	It was probably the Nintendo coming out with Mario Sports Mix, uh-huh
8839620	8843340	Well that that's more of a recent thing. I mean sports mix hasn't really come out yet
8843340	8846380	So, I mean have you have you been it's been out for a week Oh one way
8846380	8848380	So you've been addicted to crack for a week
8852180	8855800	So, let me let me let me ask you a question because I can hear you laughing and everything
8856220	8860160	Like so I I know you're like trolling us or whatever. So like what's up?
8860160	8863500	Like why are you trolling like f-list online radio shows just curious. I

8875940	8878660	Why you and your buddies want to like troll this online radio show?

9123900	9130340	You know what the folks in chat seems to enjoy that last call. I don't know. All right. Oh
9134420	9136420	Let's talk a little bit more about Activision
9136420	9141700	Yes, please. They're focusing there's you know efforts towards now since they're not doing the guitar hero franchise
9141700	9147500	They are continuing on with their toy licensing franchise. You know how they did the games of the Zuzu pets is up now
9147500	9150240	It's squinkies. Yes squinkies based off of
9150240	9156320	Some sort of toy that's like those 25 cent machines where you know, there's a little crappy toy comes in the bubble
9156560	9162640	Well, they're making a game based off that also they're making a game called Skylanders Spyro's adventure, which has I
9163960	9170360	Don't know what the fuck they did the Spyro. It's weird, but they have these toys now that you can buy that will
9172600	9174360	Will come with you know
9174360	9181240	a couple toys and you basically put these toys on this mat and it scans it in and you get to play as the character that's
9181240	9184640	on the toy and the game's gonna cost you $70 and
9186640	9193400	What the fuck did they do to Spyro Cersei he looks like he's got he's like roid rage Spyro or something like that. I
9194280	9198280	Don't know what they did. But yes, there's Activision pooping on your franchises
9198280	9203840	But you know kids games, you know, cuz if it's highly marketable, then they're gonna pimp it out
9204360	9206360	All right. Let's go to some more calls
9207080	9211800	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Legend of Zaku. Hey, my buddy. How are you tonight?
9212360	9213600	No, I'm doing pretty good
9213600	9220120	just trying to try to wait for the next you know day or so when I had to take the girl out for Valentine's Day and
9220120	9228720	Just lamenting over the death of the inevitable guitar hero. We kind of knew that was coming. Are
9228720	9234000	You sad are you one of those people that was on Twitter going RIP guitar hero pouring the 40 in your honor?
9234000	9237400	There's no not not at all as a matter of fact
9237400	9242320	I knew this was gonna happen the first, you know ever since good to our hero 3 came out
9242840	9244760	Actually, no more like world tour
9244760	9250160	That's when they started to have the whole me to attitude of let's just spend let's just milk
9250160	9255040	the you know, the proverbial golden cap dry until we could pummel harmonics, which
9255600	9260600	In turn never worked out. So this is the thing with Activision and in a nutshell
9260600	9266920	They take good franchises and they just run them and just send them straight to hell like what they're gonna do a Call of Duty
9267240	9273320	Mm-hmm. I mean when you have five guitar hero games out in a single year, that's almost like one
9273320	9275240	That's like one per quarter
9275240	9280600	That's that that goes to show that you're just like you just you just don't give a shit about the franchise
9280600	9282920	I mean Konami on the other hand
9282920	9289280	they at least make efforts to innovate and just like, you know, please the the hardcore fanfare and fan base while picking up the
9289920	9294160	Casuals along the way. Mm-hmm. At least they're they're having some sort of consistency
9294160	9295040	I don't know about now
9295040	9301240	But when you know during their time with the whole DDR series even with in Bimani in general
9301240	9308160	They just kept it a little bit more, you know more consistent and not as bland. Mm-hmm. So, I mean it's
9309560	9314720	The way I see it is that harmonics now is tasked with just like try not to you know
9315200	9321960	Make the same mistakes as Activision. Obviously, they they're well aware of that but more importantly they have to innovate
9322600	9324880	Because that's what what that's what made them
9325120	9329240	That's what made them survive that day and that's what will keep them going
9329240	9331240	You know keeping them going forward
9334680	9340240	What do you think is the reason why I mean I know you you have been calling into this show for years
9340240	9344040	Which I totally appreciate don't get me wrong. Mm-hmm, especially in light of last couple calls. We've had
9344880	9349240	You you I've called in about like DDR and all this stuff. What do you think about this whole?
9349240	9356280	Why is DDR seem to persevere when I'm not so sure DDR really innovates in the way that some other games do
9356280	9361560	I mean you still add you still have the I guess what I guess the way I see it
9361560	9364360	Is that Konami still recognizes that the hardcores?
9364880	9370860	The hardcore players are still the ones that they're gonna be picking up DDR a lot more than let's say the casuals
9370860	9372860	Why it's by a slight edge
9372880	9376740	So you have to please you know, they're trying to please both demographics
9377000	9383120	So they they have a multi-pronged approach to to you know to their series. Mm-hmm
9383120	9388280	whereas Activision just like treats it like shovelware, you know, just try to
9388880	9393960	Just try to get all the licenses not really innovate in terms of like new gameplay features
9394200	9400240	Like what I heard was like the most appalling innovation that they had was just the ability to change the guitar skin
9400840	9406840	Unlike let's say harmonics which actually allowed you in the third, you know, the third installment, you know
9406840	9410640	play with with a lot more instruments, you know with like a keyboard and
9410640	9415560	And the ability and the ability to to do, you know to play them in pro mode
9416080	9422280	Which you know says a lot about them that they're really thinking they're really thinking long-term with that whole franchise
9422360	9427200	Whereas Activision just cares about how much money can we make with guitar hero in each quarter?
9428480	9430480	It's all about the bottom line
9430480	9436440	Bills bills on the other hand the way I see it is that Activision is going to you know
9436440	9442760	it's gonna the faint the same fate will bestow Call of Duty in the next two years and that worries me because
9443440	9449560	Remember what happened, you know, almost 30 years ago in that in our same industry when?
9450320	9452320	Atari basically
9452840	9458960	Harold heralded that whole video game, you know the whole genre into into near disaster
9459400	9464240	Or the video game crash. I'm pretty sure you know, I have a gut feeling that
9464240	9469600	Activision will be the ones that's gonna herald everything to mediocrity like in two years
9469600	9473160	I bet you in two years. They're gonna have like a they're gonna reach a point where
9473840	9477580	people are just gonna get sick and tired of video games in general or just
9477800	9483020	or just like most of the genres because you're gonna have one particular company that's just gonna like
9483360	9488440	They're gonna make everything they're gonna make that genre completely bland and untouchable for years to come
9488440	9496760	All right, well we're gonna let you go buddy so we can go wrap up the show but thank you as always for your insight
9496760	9502060	Cuz I know you're passionate about the music games. So appreciate. All right. All right. Take care buddy. Have a good one. Bye
9502960	9507600	All right, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight. Can't say it wasn't entertaining. There you go
9508120	9511600	Let's get to the last last-minute stories from Loki
9513120	9515120	Don't think I have much left here
9515120	9519280	It hasn't been very exciting news week all things considered outside of like, you know
9519280	9523840	The more and more and more stuff getting shut down over at Activision. There's not a lot else to it
9523840	9526360	Yeah, I think I pretty much covered most of everything
9529000	9532760	Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it I think no alrighty then
9533360	9538920	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we get down to the end of the show tonight
9540040	9542480	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. What's your final thought?
9542480	9547860	You know that face that's really scrunchie that people do for trolls on the internet
9547860	9548340	Yeah
9548340	9555540	I kept imagining that call just that mouth moving back and forth while that guy was talking and it made me giggle a little bit
9555540	9556220	That was pretty funny
9556220	9561260	I actually saw a really funny gif of that with the whole you mad you mad you mad like rotating around it and this is funny
9561680	9562780	so
9562780	9565580	The internet it's fun to be a part of all right, Loki
9565580	9569220	What's your final thought people need to stop talking like they type on the internet? I mean
9569220	9571220	it
9572020	9577940	Seriously the YK are is the worst friend whatsoever. I mean, it's just
9578620	9583220	Remember how people used to get pissed off at other people and you know with the bonics and shit like that
9583220	9590300	It's just getting worse the OMG. It's like okay. Yeah, we understand you mistyped on a keyboard. Haha. That's funny
9590300	9593140	You know you don't need to talk like that cuz you sound like an idiot
9593140	9596780	I will say one thing we found OMG yogurt, and they were pretty good
9596780	9604460	What is up with all these yogurt explosion chains recently? It's crazy. Oh, and I hate Kotaku's new layout
9604460	9607060	I should say gawkers new layout, so you know
9608540	9612260	Sometimes you don't need to improve something because it's fine the way it was
9613260	9616240	See now go troll that that's a reason to go troll well
9617300	9622660	Like trolling our websites like I know it's kind of like that's like stalking Kathy Griffith or something
9622660	9627500	It's just like seriously who cares I mean no one cares
9628020	9633020	And honestly we don't get a lot of page hits so no one's really gonna notice that you're trolling
9633660	9639180	It's what it whatever whatever we talk about it the more. They're gonna like yeah, we should do it again all right um
9640020	9644140	My final thought I I I want to do more traveling
9644140	9648060	And I'm thinking a trip to Seattle would need to be in the near future
9649260	9651260	possibly around Labor Day
9651260	9652820	possibly
9652820	9657260	Why you still you're telling me a different time thinking of other traveling in March?
9657740	9662140	I'm thinking about a particular expo that goes on yes every year all right anyhow
