0	18880	Tonight, February 27th, 2011, the 3DS launches in Japan.
18880	23680	We Dare might be too daring for the U.S., and will Guitar Hero get more download content
23680	29680	after all?
29680	34800	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
34800	38760	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
38760	44320	We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific,
44320	47200	9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
47200	48200	My name is Rob Roberts.
48200	51020	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.
51020	53880	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
53880	54880	Booze.
54880	55880	How you doing?
55880	56880	Booze.
56880	57880	What kind of booze?
57880	62320	Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.
62320	63320	No, no, no, no.
63320	64320	I have...
64320	65320	She dumb forgot.
65320	66320	Stop interrupting me.
66320	67320	I have Irish...
67320	69320	Wait, did you guys hear that?
69320	70320	I'm sorry.
70320	73720	This is worth interrupting because did you hear her say, stop interrupting me.
73720	74720	She's slurring already.
74720	75720	Stop interrupting me.
75720	76720	No.
76720	85560	I have Baileys Irish cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream,
85560	87260	but I've mixed the whipped cream into it.
87260	93400	So it cuts some of the alcohol and increases the calorie count tenfold.
93400	98720	It's like a tablespoon, but it is Supra delicious.
98720	99720	Sunday night.
99720	100720	Relax a little.
100720	101720	Yeah.
101720	104880	Since a belly button is in here.
104880	106680	Well, let me get to that.
106680	109020	Tech master Loki is out tonight.
109020	111720	He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.
111720	112720	Don't worry guys.
112720	113720	He's fine.
113720	118480	But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia
118480	119480	or...
119480	121720	The same kind his child did.
121720	123720	That's like father, like son, right?
123720	125440	Except in reverse, like son, like father.
125440	128660	So you know, and I'm only telling you what it is because I know he's going to give you
128660	131600	all the sort of details about it when he comes back.
131600	132600	It's a hernia.
132600	134080	I don't know if that'll be next week or two weeks.
134080	135080	Yeah.
135080	136080	I mean, it's...
136080	137080	Living with a hernia.
137080	141880	So he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or
141880	142880	something like that.
142880	145840	He didn't know he was going to have the surgery and suddenly it was like, you're having the
145840	146840	surgery.
146840	147840	Okay.
147840	149320	So he had the surgery, which, you know...
149320	153280	My favorite thing to do is confuse, and sometimes it's done on purpose, is confuse hernias and
153280	156120	hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut.
156120	157760	Little different, little different.
157760	159280	So yeah, he's recovering.
159280	160760	He's not able to drive out to the show.
160760	161760	He could be listening.
161760	163680	So hi, Loki, if you're listening.
163680	168520	But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gall
168520	172660	bladder thing, which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.
172660	174840	So that could be where Loki's at right now.
174840	175840	I don't know.
175840	176940	But regardless, he won't be here tonight.
176940	178940	So it's just Dark Soccer and I holding down the fort.
178940	182800	We didn't have enough time since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone
182800	183800	on the weekend.
183800	185760	We didn't have time to cook up a guest host.
185760	188240	So it's just here, just the two of us here.
188240	189500	And one of us has been drinking.
189500	191880	So this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.
191880	193520	Rob had some of my tasty beverage.
193520	194920	It is delicious, isn't it?
194920	195920	Nothing.
195920	200960	But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com joining us as you
200960	203640	do every week here as we tape live our show.
203640	207000	We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.
207000	208180	You guys are awesome.
208180	213440	And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, can we talk about
213440	214440	the Oscars?
214440	215440	Because that's going on tonight.
215440	218080	On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.
218080	219880	I want to call them the Betty White's curse.
219880	221360	Well, I'll get to that in a minute.
221360	229280	The Oscars are going on and it's one of the few shows that airs live on the West and the
229280	230280	East Coast.
230280	234360	I don't know of anything else, maybe the Super Bowl, that airs live on both coasts at the
234360	235360	same time.
235360	239200	So I think anybody who's watching, it's probably watching it in one eye and maybe listening
239200	241200	to our show or what have you or waiting for the podcast.
241200	242200	I don't know.
242200	246160	But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chat room because anybody
246160	248760	who cares probably already has on the TV, but whatever.
248760	249960	People want to yell it out.
249960	253840	And I think SSJ went under Matt a joke before the show that if Betty White's not at the
253840	255380	Oscars, who cares?
255380	259580	And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners, but you just
259580	262480	have to change everything so that Betty White won everything.
262480	265560	And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chat room.
265560	266900	But you know what, guys?
266900	268320	I think it's very well deserved.
268320	269320	You know why?
269320	270320	You know why it's well deserved?
270320	271320	Hold on.
271320	272320	Listen to this.
272320	273320	The reason I lied.
273320	275700	If I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what
275700	276820	you're trying to do.
276820	279080	How long have you been feeding this thing?
279080	280240	Six years.
280240	281840	Six years.
281840	287640	Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.
287640	290400	He threw it some scraps, and well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.
290400	293840	He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.
293840	294840	He just appeared.
294840	296720	You have no idea how he arrived here.
296720	298120	No, do you?
298120	303520	Well, your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded.
303520	306120	If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
306120	307120	There you go.
307120	309520	If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
309520	310520	That's why Betty White is awesome.
310520	311520	I love her.
311520	312520	Yes.
312520	313520	Amazing.
313520	316840	Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.
316840	320280	Really corny ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.
320280	321280	Of course.
321280	327380	Anyhow, let's see, yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our
327380	328380	chat room.
328380	329640	We're going to do a little bit of a short show.
329640	332600	We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle
332600	335560	and we're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.
335560	336560	Don't worry.
336560	337560	We're still going to take calls at the end.
337560	339200	We're still going to do all your favorite segments.
339200	342400	We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one, and it's
342400	343800	just the two of us.
343800	347720	With everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what, let's
347720	349680	have this be a minimum day.
349680	350680	Remember those in school?
350680	351680	You'd have a minimum day.
351680	352680	We never had such a thing.
352680	353680	Huh?
353680	354680	We didn't have minimum days.
354680	355680	Really?
355680	356680	We had minimum days here all the time.
356680	357680	We had teacher work days.
357680	358680	Oh, okay.
358680	359680	It's similar.
359680	362520	But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?
362520	364080	That would be all of us.
364080	365080	But the teachers did.
365080	366360	The teachers did.
366360	369940	We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.
369940	370940	So there you go.
370940	373080	Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell
373080	374080	you about.
374080	377280	Dude, Spazanator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.
377280	378280	That's no good.
378280	379280	You probably wouldn't do it.
379280	382480	I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.
382480	383480	Wow.
383480	384480	It's Mystique.
384480	385480	Mystique?
385480	388480	Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?
388480	391720	Come in and introduce yourself as- Oh, God, I love Mystique.
391720	392720	I'm so happy she's here.
392720	393720	Hold on.
393720	394720	Hello.
394720	395720	We gotta get her hooked up.
395720	396720	Live radio, folks.
396720	397720	I am the goddamn Batman.
397720	398720	That she is.
398720	401580	Why are you the goddamn Batman, which by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts
401580	405200	that they have anywhere?
405200	407820	Because I'm awesome.
407820	408820	What more do you need?
408820	411160	I'm awesome.
411160	413160	Then she's got a Batarang in her pants.
413160	414720	Okay, there.
414720	415920	I've got you your own mic now.
415920	416920	So there you go.
416920	417920	Sweet.
417920	419800	So what are you up to these days, Mystique?
419800	420800	What have you been playing?
420800	421800	You playing video games these days?
421800	422800	What are you playing?
422800	427480	Of course she is, because she just got the thing.
427480	428480	Tell them what you got.
428480	429480	I got what?
429480	430480	The Batman.
430480	435120	Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum, because that game was awesome.
435120	436480	But the new one's coming out.
436480	437480	I know.
437480	441280	It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.
441280	442280	Like now.
442280	443280	Because it's goddamn Batman.
443280	446680	Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman and the goddamn Joker.
446680	449800	See, it's not about Batman for her, it's about Joker.
449800	453120	It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.
453120	455320	Oh, what you got against Heath Ledger?
455320	456400	It's Oscar night.
456400	457400	I don't care.
457400	460240	Betty White's winning everything, by the way.
460240	464280	We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.
464280	465560	Unless Betty White did it.
465560	466560	Betty White is pretty awesome.
466560	467560	Yeah, that's right.
467560	470920	Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there
470920	471920	you go.
471920	473540	She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.
473540	477000	She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like...
477000	479880	I can totally see that shit.
479880	480880	Betty White is hardcore.
480880	481880	That's right.
481880	485800	And of course the next game coming out is Betty White versus Capcom.
485800	487560	I would totally play that game.
487560	491200	She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman, and this is what she said in
491200	492200	response.
492200	495200	If you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded...
495200	500360	If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
500360	501360	There you go.
501360	502360	I concur with that.
502360	503360	All right.
503360	504360	Anyhow.
504360	508220	I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one
508220	509220	of those.
509220	510220	I do wish I had a dick.
510220	511600	It would be awesome.
511600	512600	Why?
512600	516480	Because then I could pee wherever I was and...
516480	517800	It doesn't quite work like that.
517800	518920	Hold on.
518920	523160	And when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over
523160	524160	him.
524160	526120	Can't you kind of do that now?
526120	527280	I mean, I realize...
527280	528280	It's messier.
528280	530680	It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.
530680	531680	All right.
531680	532680	Look.
532680	533680	There's a lot of work.
533680	534680	Oh, look.
534680	539680	The listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.
539680	542600	I told them about you in wild chat last night, by the way.
542600	543600	Sweet.
543600	544600	I'm famous.
544600	545600	All right.
545600	546600	I'm living with video game chat.
546600	547600	Yeah.
547600	548720	So let's talk about how is your gaming week?
548720	549720	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
549720	550720	I played WoW.
550720	553200	And then I played WoW.
553200	555040	And then when I was done playing WoW...
555040	556040	Did you play more WoW?
556040	557040	I played WoW.
557040	559480	What are you doing in WoW?
559480	561880	Well, my mage is...
561880	566220	Because I basically power leveled everything up and didn't bother with my professions.
566220	569680	So now I've gone broke leveling dual crafting.
569680	573640	Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.
573640	575680	That's because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.
575680	576680	Holy shit.
576680	578720	She's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.
578720	579720	He's in the game.
579720	580720	Harrison Jones.
580720	581920	Shut the hell up.
581920	585160	And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.
585160	586160	Sweet.
586160	587160	Yes.
587160	588160	You gotta have a short round.
588160	589160	Yeah.
589160	590160	Oh, he's awesome.
590160	591920	I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.
591920	592920	But anyway.
592920	596320	You just need to play for Harrison Jones, because that's what it's all about, is the
596320	598640	whole archaeology thing in Oldham.
598640	599640	So cool.
599640	603840	But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.
603840	605200	I just call her my puppy.
605200	610720	I still hate dungeons on my puppy, because people don't know what a freaking tank is
610720	613000	apparently if you're lower than level 20.
613000	615240	But tanks run over people.
615240	618760	And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.
618760	620480	I wish I had a tank.
620480	621760	I want a tank for real life.
621760	622760	Wouldn't it be cool?
622760	625440	It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.
625440	626440	That would be pretty awesome.
626440	630240	You had your party, and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.
630240	631800	I'm Teflon.
631800	633480	I'm rubber, you're glue.
633480	636240	And you would always be able to find a parking spot.
636240	640880	And then you had your healer, who would basically go around going, it's OK, don't worry about
640880	641880	it.
641880	642880	You're going to be just fine.
642880	643880	They're idiots.
643880	644880	They're bitches.
644880	647880	And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.
647880	652640	Bitch, I heard what you just said.
652640	654120	It's on now.
654120	655120	Bring it.
655120	658520	That would be World of Warcraft for high school.
658520	659920	I just put it on my Facebook.
659920	662480	Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.
662480	663680	Just sort of point that out.
663680	664960	You're missed a lot.
664960	669640	Yeah, but our aim's improving.
669640	672320	I made Misty laugh.
672320	673320	Laughing is fun.
673320	674320	I had liquor.
674320	675320	Want some?
675320	676320	I know.
676320	677320	If it's not obvious.
677320	678640	What are you talking about?
678640	679640	She's always like this.
679640	682040	But I'm extra like this.
682040	683040	All right.
683040	686040	Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?
686040	687040	Betty White, the RPG.
687040	688040	All right.
688040	691840	Mystique, I think I already bugged you about this, but any specific games you've been playing
691840	693920	this week you want to share with the world?
693920	694920	Oh, wait.
694920	695920	Final Fantasy III.
695920	696920	OK.
696920	699260	Dude, I totally played some Dr. Mario.
699260	700260	You played Dr. Mario?
700260	701260	Hells yeah.
701260	702260	Old school 8-bit?
702260	703260	Yeah.
703260	704260	Game Boy, baby.
704260	705260	What?
705260	706260	Game Boy.
706260	707260	Dr. Mario.
707260	710680	What possessed you to get out the pills?
710680	713480	Because sometimes you just need pills.
713480	717680	Different colored pills, especially the red one.
717680	722640	Is there a particular virus that's like, is it the red virus or the yellow virus?
722640	724800	She has the G-virus.
724800	729720	So if she doesn't have her pills, she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains.
729720	731320	Because brains taste good.
731320	732320	Itchy.
732320	733320	Tasty.
733320	734320	Itchy, tasty.
734320	735720	So, Dr. Mario, wait.
735720	740160	Actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.
740160	742120	Music type A or B?
742120	745480	Music type B. B for bitchin'.
745480	746480	Yes.
746480	748600	Because I like to kick it old school.
748600	749600	What?
749600	750600	What?
750600	752280	You just made a song pop into my head.
752280	753280	What's that?
753280	754280	A dead milkman song.
754280	755280	It's a bitchin' Camaro.
755280	756280	Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.
756280	757280	I ran over my mother.
757280	758280	I love that song.
758280	766280	I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.
766280	772160	Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungerator.com, Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, I think the women
772160	773160	just hijacked the show.
773160	774160	You know, I think you're right.
774160	775160	I think...
775160	776160	Yay!
776160	777160	Estrogen!
777160	778160	Woo!
778160	781160	Oh my god, help me.
781160	782160	We've got this.
782160	784680	The powers of the jubbles compel you.
784680	788640	The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.
788640	789920	My hair is already braided.
789920	793120	Missy pays someone to do hers, so...
793120	794840	I just flat iron mine.
794840	795840	You know, with an iron.
795840	799480	I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.
799480	802500	You've got like a red X13 thing going on there.
802500	804760	Because this is always the color I have.
804760	805760	Black and purple.
805760	807760	Because she's secretly, well not so secretly, evil.
807760	808760	Did I say red X13?
808760	810320	That's a little bit redundant, isn't it?
810320	811320	It's red 13.
811320	812320	Red 13.
812320	813320	Alright.
813320	814320	Rob?
814320	817120	See, and it matches my shoes.
817120	818120	Her shoes are jokery.
818120	819120	Oh, they are jokery.
819120	820120	What is it about the joker?
820120	821120	I'm going to take a picture of Missy's shoes.
821120	822800	What is it about the joker you just love so darn much?
822800	824840	Because he likes to kill people, and that's a good thing.
824840	827560	She also likes prints for similar reasons.
827560	828560	Exactly.
828560	829560	Prints like to kill people too.
829560	830560	Shoes.
830560	831560	Alright.
831560	833760	This is our new album artist, Mystique Shoes.
833760	834760	Awesome.
834760	837520	Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week.
837520	841320	I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.
841320	845040	I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know there's, like when I say that,
845040	848880	there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh god, the iPhone.
848880	851280	I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.
851280	854360	Like, it's adorable and cute and...
854360	856960	And the new game, Jump the Shark.
856960	858480	Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?
858480	859480	I don't know.
859480	860480	There probably is somewhere.
860480	861480	Alright.
861480	863720	There was an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.
863720	864720	Mystique has left the building.
864720	869480	Alright, well, alright, everybody calm down, it'll be okay.
869480	872300	And then what else have I played this week?
872300	879240	I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way
879240	883160	of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.
883160	885680	Although I don't think this was developed by PopCap.
885680	889040	I mean, I think it was like in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come
889040	890880	up when I started the game.
890880	894040	And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this like right
894040	895040	off the bat.
895040	898360	Like, it just didn't have that same polish.
898360	900180	And I don't know how else to say this.
900180	902960	And I know I'm sounding like really harsh, but like when I go in there, especially with
902960	907440	the graphics, the graphics did not have that same polish that I have seen in the other
907440	908440	PopCap games.
908440	909880	It needs buffing.
909880	912940	And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished, I don't know.
912940	915640	But yeah, it's okay.
915640	916760	I mean, it is what it is.
916760	919360	It's a minute-long version of Bejeweled.
919360	922100	And you compete against your friends and have the leaderboards.
922100	925980	And you can do regular Bejeweled, or you can do the twisty Bejeweled, the Gyromancer version
925980	926980	of Bejeweled.
926980	928960	You can do either of those in a minute-long versions.
928960	931160	And there's also like a multiplayer version online.
931160	932720	I didn't get to really test that too much.
932720	934680	But you know, it's pretty much what you'd think.
934680	936480	It's multiplayer Bejeweled.
936480	937480	I gotta be honest, though.
937480	941820	I didn't see a whole lot that made me feel like I had to buy this game.
941820	947240	And there already is Bejeweled Twist, or Gyromancer and Gyromancer, and then Bejeweled 2 on the
947240	948240	marketplace.
948240	950560	And Plants vs. Zombies has Bejeweled.
950560	953040	Yeah, and Bejeweled.
953040	955220	And there's even the Jewel Quest, the knockoff game.
955220	959800	And I just, I didn't really feel like there was enough of a game there where it was just
959800	962480	minute-long versions of Bejeweled.
962480	965760	Which is weird, I know, because I do like the version on Facebook, or at least I did
965760	966760	for a long time.
966760	968880	And, you know, you can have the one on the phone.
968880	971600	It just, for me, didn't translate too well to the controller.
971600	977160	I do like some of the things they did where your left stick moves the cursor, and then
977160	982640	the Y, X, A, B buttons flip the gems in that direction.
982640	986680	And in the older Bejeweled games, you used to have to pick two gems, then swap them,
986680	988160	and it was more button presses.
988160	992120	So they kind of made that faster, which is important because the game only goes a minute.
992120	996920	But you can play it for free on Facebook, and it's got that same level of competition.
996920	1001360	Granted it doesn't have the twisty gem version, and granted it doesn't have multiplayer.
1001360	1005940	But I kind of feel like in PopCap's other games, you get enough of that.
1005940	1009460	So this kind of feels like a little bit of a cash-in to me.
1009460	1013240	I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other
1013240	1018820	Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.
1018820	1022000	But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit, and then go back
1022000	1024820	to the one on Facebook, if you really want to play Bejeweled.
1024820	1027760	Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while, when you
1027760	1030200	can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.
1030200	1034480	It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation, and it's kind of a bummer.
1034480	1037960	And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.
1037960	1038960	Maybe.
1038960	1042480	They probably just kind of let somebody else do it, so yikes.
1042480	1044680	They're going to give us how much money for this game?
1044680	1045860	Outsource the scrap.
1045860	1049800	It's $10, if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1049800	1052600	There's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that
1052600	1054280	I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.
1054280	1057160	Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.
1057160	1061480	Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight on Xbox Live.
1061480	1067840	I am so curious to see, speaking of a game that feels very one-way on the PC, I'm really
1067840	1071320	curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller, because apparently they
1071320	1072720	change quite a bit.
1072720	1074300	So I'll definitely be checking that out.
1074300	1079600	I think that's the 15th that that comes out, so I'll be looking at that.
1079600	1081600	And that does it for my gaming week.
1081600	1085320	So let's move on and go over some housekeeping real quick.
1085320	1086960	Not a whole lot.
1086960	1090080	I just want to mention of course our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and of
1090080	1093200	course you can follow OrangeLoungeRadio on Facebook as well.
1093200	1096960	And if you like OrangeLoungeRadio and you like all this craziness and zaniness that
1096960	1101560	we bring you every week that's sometimes very random as it was tonight.
1101560	1103140	I just found out something, Rob.
1103140	1104140	What's that?
1104140	1106880	You mentioning PopCap made me want to check for Peggle on Steam.
1106880	1108880	Peggle Extreme is free.
1108880	1109880	Free?
1109880	1110880	Really?
1110880	1111880	Free.
1111880	1112880	Free?
1112880	1113880	I'm installing it right now.
1113880	1114880	What's so extreme about Peggle Extreme?
1114880	1115880	No idea, but I love Peggle.
1115880	1116880	Oh, there you go.
1116880	1117880	PSA for the listeners.
1117880	1118880	Go check that out.
1118880	1120880	Well, now you made me lose my train of thought.
1120880	1123080	You interrupted me for some stupid Peggle.
1123080	1124700	Oh, yeah.
1124700	1128360	Help spread the word about the show and leave us a nice review on iTunes.
1128360	1129360	We always appreciate that.
1129360	1131520	And a couple more have popped up in the past few days.
1131520	1134880	We really, really do appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave us a nice review.
1134880	1136320	And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.
1136320	1138960	I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot
1138960	1142520	pole or wherever it is that you can read about podcasts if you can leave a nice review for
1142520	1143520	us.
1143520	1144520	That'd be awesome.
1144520	1145520	All right.
1145520	1147040	So, let's move on to some gaming news.
1147040	1148040	Let's get into the news tonight.
1148040	1150720	We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.
1150720	1153640	The 3DS did launch in Japan.
1153640	1155280	It did make its release date.
1155280	1160080	And I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining
1160080	1161380	up for it.
1161380	1163240	There were extras left over.
1163240	1164820	You didn't have to pre-order it.
1164820	1167880	They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.
1167880	1171760	However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units already gone.
1171760	1173000	That's the early word.
1173000	1174000	Yeah, not surprising.
1174000	1175000	Not surprising.
1175000	1176000	The same thing happens here.
1176000	1177200	Because it prints money.
1177200	1181820	I think if you're on it day one, you can get it, but it'll sell out that first shipment
1181820	1182820	pretty quick.
1182820	1187400	So, just so you know, they did have people that were camping out for it.
1187400	1190120	They had eight launch titles over in Japan.
1190120	1194160	Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the
1194160	1195160	numbers come out.
1195160	1198960	But people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that
1198960	1203520	Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big
1203520	1207760	sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.
1207760	1209760	Did Professor Layton make launch over here?
1209760	1210760	I'm not sure it did.
1210760	1211760	I don't recall.
1211760	1212820	I think it might have been.
1212820	1215040	The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.
1215040	1216040	Yeah.
1216040	1217040	Oh, yeah.
1217040	1218040	They definitely have their audience.
1218040	1219880	But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.
1219880	1223800	And honestly, Nintendogs, I think is going to be a huge one for Nintendo.
1223800	1228280	Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast,
1228280	1233440	but kids, you know, between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using this
1233440	1240840	the 3DS, maybe like 6, 7 on up through 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and cats.
1240840	1243160	And I think even some adults will be, too.
1243160	1247320	And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.
1247320	1248320	Big sucker.
1248320	1249320	Tee hee.
1249320	1250760	So there you go.
1250760	1251840	Yeah.
1251840	1253520	So it's sold out now in Japan.
1253520	1256040	So if you didn't already import this thing, you might have a hard time.
1256040	1257860	You're gonna have to wait for the next shipment.
1257860	1261120	But it does sound like it's a successful launch over there.
1261120	1263760	Now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out.
1263760	1266280	But I guess we'll just have to wait until E3.
1266280	1267280	Yeah.
1267280	1271680	Well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop
1271680	1275800	today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1275800	1277600	And they're pushing it.
1277600	1278920	So hey.
1278920	1282040	But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?
1282040	1283600	Yay, I love naughty things.
1283600	1284600	Naughty.
1284600	1286160	Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?
1286160	1288280	Because she's pretty naughty, too.
1288280	1289280	A little randy.
1289280	1290280	Oh, okay.
1290280	1291280	A little raunchy.
1291280	1292280	A little sassy?
1292280	1294320	Oh, more than a bit sassy.
1294320	1295320	Alright.
1295320	1297400	We have a game that's called We Dare.
1297400	1300440	It's a party game that's put out by Ubisoft.
1300440	1302640	And well, it's not coming out in America.
1302640	1309540	In fact, their spokesperson said it absolutely will not see release in the United States.
1309540	1313160	The trailer has been region locked to Europe.
1313160	1320920	And well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snogging your controller and getting
1320920	1321920	naked.
1321920	1322920	What?
1322920	1323920	Release in your underwear.
1323920	1324920	Okay, wait.
1324920	1326160	Is this the trailer here?
1326160	1329600	Can I watch this or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound
1329600	1330600	to Europe?
1330600	1331600	Or is this going to work?
1331600	1332600	It may, it may.
1332600	1333600	It may.
1333600	1334600	It's been two years.
1334600	1338520	Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.
1338520	1340160	Oh, this is a really slow site.
1340160	1341480	Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.
1341480	1343320	We're going to go to YouTube.
1343320	1344320	Okay.
1344320	1345320	I want to see this.
1345320	1346320	I literally have not.
1346320	1347800	I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.
1347800	1349920	Well, I'm going to pull up the- So it's like, what?
1349920	1350920	It's like Truth or Dare?
1350920	1355360	Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.
1355360	1362080	Wow, it's $16.99 over there.
1362080	1363080	And let's see.
1363080	1364080	Okay, wait.
1364080	1365080	Here we go.
1365080	1366080	Here we go.
1366080	1369080	I got a trailer.
1369080	1376240	Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background.
1376240	1382160	The cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and a fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels.
1382160	1383160	Wow.
1383160	1388160	Hold on, hold on.
1388160	1399000	Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple.
1399000	1400480	And the two of them are eating it.
1400480	1408080	And somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like,
1408080	1409080	it's a little bit.
1409080	1423080	I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.
1423080	1426220	Wow.
1426220	1430360	So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the
1430360	1431360	back of her pants.
1431360	1435720	And now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.
1435720	1446800	Now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.
1446800	1455200	And of course, the chicks get to spank each other.
1455200	1475800	Okay, I want someone to get that for me.
1475800	1476800	Here's the thing.
1476800	1478040	I'll send you candy.
1478040	1483680	Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that to be honest, what's the uproar
1483680	1484680	about this?
1484680	1487200	I would say that kids would play this because it's a Wii game.
1487200	1491240	And you know, the target audiences is usually kids because people over here have the big
1491240	1492240	anal stick.
1492240	1493240	Okay, here's the thing.
1493240	1496560	I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.
1496560	1499720	Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.
1499720	1504760	Yeah, like remember two minutes in the closet, spin the bottle.
1504760	1508900	Like all that I mean when you were 12 I was at a party five years ago where you're playing
1508900	1511880	spin the bottle.
1511880	1515160	Well you kind of defused the point I was about to make because I was going to say now you're
1515160	1518000	trying to tell me that a bunch of 20 year olds are going to play these same games that
1518000	1519320	we played when we were 12.
1519320	1520320	Yes.
1520320	1521320	Look, we were drunk.
1521320	1522320	Okay, that's all I'm saying.
1522320	1524440	I don't need a Wii to help you with that.
1524440	1525440	You know what I mean?
1525440	1527680	I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.
1527680	1528680	It's a fun idea.
1528680	1533680	I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh the Americans are going to preach at us.
1533680	1537320	They're going to sing Jesus on us.
1537320	1543080	No, it's a little silly that the game can't come out here.
1543080	1546240	You know, Gripper 01 says it's 16 quid cheap by the way.
1546240	1551440	Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says
1551440	1557720	not for kids and then honestly it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.
1557720	1561760	Because people here don't give a shit.
1561760	1563760	They don't read the box.
1563760	1564760	The kids read the box.
1564760	1565920	Their parents don't read the box.
1565920	1570040	They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.
1570040	1571040	And guess what?
1571040	1572040	No.
1572040	1574040	And then they get all mad.
1574040	1579960	Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.
1579960	1585000	Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?
1585000	1587560	Hi?
1587560	1589640	So I guess it's just too much for us.
1589640	1591560	Do your damn job.
1591560	1593800	You could import it I guess if you really wanted.
1593800	1597280	But I will send a bunch of American candy.
1597280	1598280	Will this come out in Canada?
1598280	1599280	To anyone.
1599280	1600280	I wonder.
1600280	1601280	I think that's a fair question to ask.
1601280	1602280	Maybe it will come out in Canada.
1602280	1603840	I can get it from Amazon CA.
1603840	1604840	Uh huh.
1604840	1605840	Ooh, let's check.
1605840	1606840	Exactly.
1606840	1607840	All right.
1607840	1608840	Meanwhile, I'm going to move on to something else.
1608840	1611640	Although if they get me President Cat, first I'll be happy.
1611640	1615080	I'm going to move on to something else that sounds like a lot of fun, but in a totally,
1615080	1616180	totally different way.
1616180	1620760	This isn't really naughty fun so much as it is, well, you know, you know the dark soccer
1620760	1621760	myself.
1621760	1624720	I like Disneyland more than anything and this has to do with the theme park.
1624720	1627960	I do like booze a lot.
1627960	1628960	Is there a beer land?
1628960	1632340	Like, is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?
1632340	1633340	Probably not.
1633340	1635400	Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.
1635400	1636400	There's a California adventure.
1636400	1643520	A brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections
1643520	1644520	in it.
1644520	1645520	This is legitimate.
1645520	1646520	This is not like a trolling thing.
1646520	1648680	There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.
1648680	1650240	By the way, not coming out in Canada.
1650240	1651240	It's not on their list.
1651240	1652240	Oh, bummer.
1652240	1653240	All right.
1653240	1654920	The park is called Joyland.
1654920	1657720	It's going to be in the Wuzhen District of China.
1657720	1660000	There's going to be five district areas.
1660000	1665240	World of Legend, Mole's World, the Island of Mystery, and then there is Universe of
1665240	1668460	Starcraft and Terrain of Warcraft.
1668460	1670900	The park is supposed to be opening in March.
1670900	1674620	Some pictures have leaked to the internet and you can see the construction going on
1674620	1676000	there and it looks pretty impressive.
1676000	1679460	Like they're actually building like a castle that looks like the one in Stormwind and one
1679460	1684320	of those little outpost thingies that the aliens have in Starcraft.
1684320	1686480	This actually looks really cool.
1686480	1695640	It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international
1695640	1701080	thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.
1701080	1706740	Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment,
1706740	1708960	but of course I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.
1708960	1710920	We wish we thought of this first.
1710920	1714520	Well, that's kind of what I was getting to is that a lot of people, you know, you've
1714520	1717080	seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.
1717080	1719400	A lot of people think this is a cool idea.
1719400	1725360	So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest
1725360	1726880	in something like this?
1726880	1728960	Like for real, why don't we have like a video game theme park?
1728960	1731280	We've got a Harry Potter park too late.
1731280	1732960	Why not?
1732960	1739000	Do you think that maybe the audience is just not, I mean, for a World of Warcraft theme
1739000	1742240	land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?
1742240	1748180	I think that they're looking at overall closures of theme parks in the US and thinking that
1748180	1754600	something like that would be too much of a risk to venture the money on.
1754600	1758360	Why not try to fix something that's already there?
1758360	1760580	And I'll give you a great example, honestly.
1760580	1765520	Here in Northern California, one of the only theme parks we have is a place called Great
1765520	1768200	America in Santa Clara.
1768200	1771680	And that place used to be awesome, but it's kind of gone downhill in the past couple of
1771680	1772680	years.
1772680	1776600	And then they lost the Paramount licensing so they don't have Top Gun the ride anymore.
1776600	1778800	It's Flight Deck.
1778800	1782680	And I think the only like tie-ins they have is they have like Nickelodeon areas and they
1782680	1785160	have a Survivor ride.
1785160	1788800	Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.
1788800	1789800	It's actually really cool.
1789800	1793440	It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly, but it's just basically a little
1793440	1796600	disc-oriented rollercoaster that really has nothing to do with the damn show.
1796600	1798160	You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.
1798160	1799160	That'd be cool.
1799160	1805160	But my thought is, why not try to team up with a park that's badly in need of some fresh
1805160	1806420	air?
1806420	1809160	Or here's another great example, Knott's Berry Farm.
1809160	1810680	I've never been.
1810680	1815640	Knott's Berry Farm's always kind of been the laughing little brother sitting in Disneyland's
1815640	1816640	shadow.
1816640	1821000	And so maybe something like this could help bolster a park's image and give people a reason
1821000	1822000	to go.
1822000	1825840	Especially, I mean, Great America being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon
1825840	1829480	Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?
1829480	1830840	Right.
1830840	1831840	They should do it.
1831840	1832840	I think they should do it.
1832840	1833840	Or they should just buy it.
1833840	1838280	I mean, Blizzard could probably sneeze and buy it, you know, with their rich money snot,
1838280	1839280	I guess.
1839280	1840280	Yeah, I know.
1840280	1842580	So Bobby is linking me to this.
1842580	1847160	And I remember he was telling me about this before previously.
1847160	1854400	There's this website, I guess, of folks that are trying to build a theme park called DemandGameNation.com.
1854400	1856000	So I'm actually bringing up this website real quick.
1856000	1858920	So I apologize for any autoplay that's on here.
1858920	1863460	The first experimental video game theme park and resort.
1863460	1865240	And they show kind of all the latest news.
1865240	1866240	Let's see.
1866240	1867240	What is this?
1867240	1869200	Let me click on this.
1869200	1877640	In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.
1877640	1880880	Visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet
1880880	1882540	to be told.
1882540	1886840	So in the next 12 months, they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the
1886840	1887840	park.
1887840	1895640	Dude, I'm telling you, just take something existing that needs the help, seriously.
1895640	1900680	But I'm glad at least some people are already on it, but that's a monumental undertaking.
1900680	1902840	That's going to take a lot of money and investments.
1902840	1908480	And you're right, Jamie, theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.
1908480	1911120	In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.
1911120	1914720	So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park
1914720	1916280	that's already there.
1916280	1918360	Buy an old one out and do your thing.
1918360	1920000	Reimagine the rides.
1920000	1921000	Exactly.
1921000	1924680	And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.
1924680	1928860	Don't build it, you know, in South Dakota.
1928860	1935120	No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but, you know, you got what?
1935120	1936120	Mount Rushmore?
1936120	1938440	Hi, I'm in Delaware.
1938440	1939440	So you know what I mean?
1939440	1941480	You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.
1941480	1942480	Seriously?
1942480	1945640	Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, we need an orange lounge radio theme park.
1945640	1950560	You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.
1950560	1954720	Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.
1954720	1959640	We would get a little corner of a room, the orange lounge radio booth.
1959640	1961320	That would probably be the best we could do.
1961320	1962320	All right.
1962320	1965080	We'd have, actually we probably wouldn't even have a booth.
1965080	1967400	We'd probably just, you know, be outside the front door.
1967400	1968400	Exactly.
1968400	1969400	It's cold.
1969400	1970400	We're so cold.
1970400	1972040	Let us in.
1972040	1973040	You know what?
1973040	1975880	We get to drive the bus that goes from the parking lot to the front.
1975880	1976880	That's what we'll get to do.
1976880	1978260	We get to clean up after the tram.
1978260	1980760	And we'll get to, you know, give the little speech.
1980760	1984040	Hey guys, it's the orange lounge radio safety speech.
1984040	1987700	No eating, no drinking, no smoking.
1987700	1995080	Keep your arms, feet, hands, legs, and ass inside the tram at all times.
1995080	1998680	That'll be us.
1998680	2002480	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
2002480	2003480	Yeah.
2003480	2011640	Well, how about, um, something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal
2011640	2021840	2, well, the German Playstation blog was told that it completely supports the move.
2021840	2023920	But it's not fully integrated yet.
2023920	2029160	Actually, Valve's like, no.
2029160	2032400	It was mistranslated from the English to the German.
2032400	2038520	And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.
2038520	2039680	So nope.
2039680	2048560	They say that for the PC it will support the Hydra controller, and that it's going to support
2048560	2051720	the regular console controllers, but no move.
2051720	2056960	It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows.
2056960	2059240	We don't know that it'll make the game better.
2059240	2064680	There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.
2064680	2071480	So as they said, though, for the Hydra, that they actually invented puzzles specifically
2071480	2074480	for how the Hydra would work.
2074480	2079640	So no move, oops, nine.
2079640	2085640	I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the Move in, because, you
2085640	2090760	know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that
2090760	2097640	aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the USB-C version.
2097640	2101560	With the whole Steam integration and everything like that.
2101560	2106520	So it would be weird if they had the Move in the PS3 version and then nothing for Kinect.
2106520	2109200	It would just be weird.
2109200	2111480	Who said Loki and Tingle?
2111480	2112480	Oh, that's...
2112480	2114840	They're talking about the stupid theme park.
2114840	2120720	This OLR theme park they want to have, where the ferret and President Kat would be mascots.
2120720	2121720	That's fantastic.
2121720	2122720	I love our chat room.
2122720	2123720	Frisbee says there'd be a roller coaster.
2123720	2124720	I love our chat room.
2124720	2125720	Oh, boy.
2125720	2129040	Alright, let's travel the world and check out some release dates, things that are actually
2129040	2134200	happening near you at a local game store near you.
2134200	2137440	Coming out this week in the US, since Loki's not here, I'll do the US dates real quick.
2137440	2139080	Do the Loki voice.
2139080	2140480	What's the Loki voice?
2140480	2143900	We got some stuff coming out.
2143900	2144900	This game's coming out.
2144900	2147240	It's probably gonna suck.
2147240	2148240	And some shit on PlayStation 3.
2148240	2149240	God damn you, Nintendo.
2149240	2150240	God damn you.
2150240	2152480	God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.
2152480	2153480	Who's gonna play that?
2153480	2156760	Yeah, it's the dude in the Loki voice so that we can pretend we have him here.
2156760	2159960	March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.
2159960	2160960	Is that a movie or something?
2160960	2161960	I think it is.
2161960	2162960	Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.
2162960	2165000	I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.
2165000	2166680	That is coming out on March 1st.
2166680	2168160	I believe some people already have it.
2168160	2170280	If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.
2170280	2172520	The official release date for the game is March 1st.
2172520	2174440	This is a new MMO.
2174440	2177440	Some people are saying it's the WoW Killer, but I hate that term.
2177440	2178640	It's not the WoW Killer.
2178640	2180320	The only WoW Killer is WoW.
2180320	2181320	Like the Remnant Empire.
2181320	2182320	Yep.
2182320	2186780	Disgaea, the Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.
2186780	2190300	More versions of Rango on other systems, including the Xbox 360, blah blah blah.
2190300	2192780	A brand new racing wheel, if you're so inclined.
2192780	2197040	You need one for your PC, you can get a $300 racing wheel.
2197040	2199100	Should I show that to Dan?
2199100	2202280	Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.
2202280	2205600	And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.
2205600	2211480	For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.
2211480	2212480	Let's see if there's anything else here.
2212480	2214200	I'm the people who really, really like Mahjong.
2214200	2215680	Well, it's party time.
2215680	2220320	Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3, oh that's a pretty big one there.
2220320	2221320	Sounds like life at my house.
2221320	2227280	Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.
2227280	2229600	That's coming out.
2229600	2231960	And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.
2231960	2235720	Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.
2235720	2236720	Really?
2236720	2238800	What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?
2238800	2241240	Is it dodging bullets?
2241240	2244440	And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?
2244440	2247560	Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters.
2247560	2251080	Like, I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things
2251080	2254820	that happen at Chuck E. Cheese, but let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take
2254820	2255820	my child.
2255820	2257520	No, no.
2257520	2259680	Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.
2259680	2260680	Yes, it was.
2260680	2262400	Now it's a dangerous place.
2262400	2270120	Now it's a frightening place, loaded with bad food and unwashed children.
2270120	2275760	Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week, and let's see if there's anything
2275760	2277400	else here I want to mention.
2277400	2279880	Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.
2279880	2284520	If you're a fan of that crappy game show, then you can get a crappy game to go with
2284520	2285520	it.
2285520	2286520	I've never heard of that one, Rob.
2286520	2287520	What is that?
2287520	2289920	It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 15 years
2289920	2290920	old.
2290920	2292640	And it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.
2292640	2293640	He's such a bro.
2293640	2294640	He is.
2294640	2295640	He's a dude bro.
2295640	2298960	And he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw
2298960	2301080	ping pong balls into cups.
2301080	2302520	Like it's the weirdest.
2302520	2303520	That's bizarre.
2303520	2310400	It's like, you know, the budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths
2310400	2314320	that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.
2314320	2315320	And I guess that's a whole-
2315320	2318780	We made this game out of the dollar store.
2318780	2321980	So here's the deal, guys.
2321980	2329080	If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version
2329080	2334420	or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic
2334420	2339680	cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.
2339680	2345760	Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.
2345760	2351120	Shitty.
2351120	2353880	I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.
2353880	2357800	People are tarred.
2357800	2361320	And folks in chat rooms speaking up there, Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's
2361320	2362320	from the Food Network.
2362320	2363320	Yes, that's his name.
2363320	2364320	Guy.
2364320	2365320	I think he owns a joint.
2365320	2367320	Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?
2367320	2368560	I have no idea.
2368560	2369560	Guy Fairey.
2369560	2370560	Yeah.
2370560	2371560	That's it.
2371560	2372560	I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.
2372560	2373560	There's one of those out in Roseville.
2373560	2374560	Overpriced.
2374560	2375560	Yeah.
2375560	2382520	Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.
2382520	2383520	Kinda.
2383520	2384520	Kinda.
2384520	2385520	I'm serious.
2385520	2386520	I'm serious.
2386520	2388840	Dark Sakura, I would love nothing more.
2388840	2392560	You know how people do like those YouTube reaction shots of people watching Two Girl
2392560	2394480	One Cup for the first time or whatever?
2394480	2395480	Yeah.
2395480	2398360	What I would like to do is I'd like to have a reaction shot of you watching Minute to
2398360	2403180	Win It for the first time and just you going, what the fuck is this?
2403180	2404180	People fucking watch this?
2404180	2405640	This is why I don't watch TV.
2405640	2408440	This is a million dollars they give away for this?
2408440	2410400	I have to say something to X-Link real quick.
2410400	2411400	What's that?
2411400	2413240	Says that he needs to lose weight and not talk about food.
2413240	2415320	No, I don't want a skinny chef.
2415320	2416320	That's true.
2416320	2418440	You don't trust a skinny chef.
2418440	2426360	Julia Childs or those two fat British women who made everything with cream and lard because
2426360	2431160	you know their food was fucking delicious.
2431160	2432960	I want the fat British women to cook my food.
2432960	2433960	All right.
2433960	2435440	I have to think one of them died.
2435440	2436440	Can I do Japanese releases?
2436440	2437440	Yeah, I guess.
2437440	2438440	All right.
2438440	2442660	Coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and a Hokuto Musou get price
2442660	2445040	reductions because they go into the platinum collections.
2445040	2449160	Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.
2449160	2452640	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.
2452640	2453640	Yep.
2453640	2457840	They also get Samurai Dou 4 comes out there from Spike.
2457840	2460560	That is a, what kind of game is this here?
2460560	2462720	I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.
2462720	2468920	This looks like kind of like a adventure-y type of Yakuza-y type of game, but set in
2468920	2473880	more like the ancient Japan and I doubt it's quite as in depth as those Yakuza games because
2473880	2477800	I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can
2477800	2479240	do in them.
2479240	2481320	On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.
2481320	2482480	It's the Nintendo Wii.
2482480	2484240	There's nothing coming out for it.
2484240	2488200	On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.
2488200	2492760	On the 3DS, Shanghai 3D Cube and Super Monkey Ball 3D come out this week.
2492760	2493760	More Mahjong!
2493760	2494760	More Mahjong!
2494760	2495760	That's right.
2495760	2501120	Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.
2501120	2502760	No one curr.
2502760	2510720	On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Stross Wars Red and Blue.
2510720	2513720	Digimon, Dr. Soccer, you were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.
2513720	2516240	Oh, I liked the anime.
2516240	2517880	And then you don't like the games?
2517880	2518880	I had a Digimon.
2518880	2523200	Lastly, on the PSP, this is a huge, huge release, probably the biggest release of the week,
2523200	2528080	Dissida 012, Duodecim Final Fantasy, that's right, the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida
2528080	2532120	makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP, so I'm sure there will be a lot of folks
2532120	2533120	into that.
2533120	2536160	Alright, how about the UK?
2536160	2538420	Well for the UK, we do have some interesting news.
2538420	2543080	This is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom.
2543080	2550760	Okay, actually on the first we have Fable 3, again, Fable 3 was kind of crap.
2550760	2557840	We have Two Worlds 2, we have Beyond Good and Evil HD, that one's on the second by the
2557840	2558840	way.
2558840	2563400	On the fourth we have Fight Night Champion, Hybrid Dimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black,
2563400	2570480	Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.
2570480	2575120	It wasn't that bad, Rift was interesting, but I don't know, I can't pay for another
2575120	2577360	MMO right now, I've got too many other expenses to worry about.
2577360	2579520	I can't pay for them either.
2579520	2580520	So, that's it?
2580520	2581520	That's it.
2581520	2585660	Alright, then let's move on to some rapid fire news, we're gonna go over some news very
2585660	2586800	quickly here.
2586800	2589640	By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in, we're gonna be doing
2589640	2594280	Twitter topics in just a moment, so get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, we're gonna
2594280	2596680	be doing those in just a minute.
2596680	2600560	But first, I'm gonna start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.
2600560	2605560	Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live, and it's getting a lot of good reception out
2605560	2608280	there, it's also on the PC and so forth.
2608280	2611440	Dragon Age 2 is gonna be coming out very soon, and they have announced that there's going
2611440	2617180	to be a theme song in the game by Florence and the Machine, who's a pretty popular band
2617180	2618440	these days.
2618440	2621720	They were really indie for a while, and then she did the dog days are over thing at the
2621720	2624600	MTV awards, and it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere.
2624600	2630200	Anyway, she's really awesome, actually, and a song from the album Lungs, called I'm Not
2630200	2633440	Calling You a Liar, is being reimagined.
2633440	2638280	So it's gonna be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.
2638280	2640920	Here's the original, if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.
2640920	2659400	So you kinda get the idea, they'll rework that song a little bit, it's not gonna sound
2659400	2662640	just like that, but that's gonna be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.
2662640	2667680	Some websites shut down this week, some community-based websites, as you probably heard about before
2667680	2673360	on the show before us, Bobby Black Wolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360, and
2673360	2676680	unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.
2676680	2681180	Mygamercard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this
2681180	2684520	week, so we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.
2684520	2689360	The story behind mygamercard.net, though, a little more dramatic.
2689360	2693920	The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site, saying,
2693920	2700000	quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community
2700000	2706520	stuff that has been going on has stagnated, and even used the term lack of respect, ouch.
2706520	2711240	But yeah, it does seem like things have changed a little bit community-wise over at Xbox.
2711240	2717360	I mean, you know, they closed the Gamerscore blog a little while ago, I know Trixie360
2717360	2721480	isn't involved anymore, she went to another company, you know, it's just...
2721480	2722480	She's great.
2722480	2725960	Yeah, she's cool, and it's just different over there now.
2725960	2728280	So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.
2728280	2732120	I wonder if this will serve as a wake-up call to Microsoft.
2732120	2734880	Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.
2734880	2738160	I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this, or if
2738160	2739160	they just don't care.
2739160	2741720	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.
2741720	2746000	Because a lot of people were using that GamerCard service, you know, on their websites, and
2746000	2748320	I even had it on my LiveJournal.
2748320	2749320	We had a little, you know...
2749320	2751440	Yeah, set it up when it worked.
2751440	2752760	Just for kicks.
2752760	2753760	Yeah.
2753760	2757760	Unfortunately, yeah, they're shut down, so yikes.
2757760	2763560	Anyhow, one other quick thing I want to mention to you guys, it's something called Every Air.
2763560	2770040	It's a program that will let you play PlayStation 3 games on an iOS device, like the iPhone,
2770040	2772720	the iPad, or the iPod, what have you.
2772720	2777120	Yeah, it's a group of iOS developers that are working on a customizable software that
2777120	2781060	lets you play high-end PS3 games on your iOS.
2781060	2786220	So it's something where they've done this with wrangling of hardware and software.
2786220	2790960	They will actually let you play PS3 games on the iPhone, iPad, and so on.
2790960	2794800	I think what's going on, they actually like stream it.
2794800	2796760	They explain how this works.
2796760	2802680	The trick is to connect a capture device and a USB mouse keyboard device to the PS3.
2802680	2807500	The capture device sends video data to the PC, and the USB keyboard and mouse sends the
2807500	2808680	button presses.
2808680	2813400	On the PC itself, you run a custom build of Every Air, which understands custom gestures
2813400	2819560	and pipes the input into the PC, which then sends it to the PS3 via the input interpreter.
2819560	2824160	Gotta be honest, this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical,
2824160	2826160	but they do show some video of this thing running.
2826160	2827960	There's a whole little YouTube there.
2827960	2832360	Let's see if we can get past the animation there, get to this thing actually working.
2832360	2838600	Yeah, there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone, starting it up.
2838600	2844960	So, I don't know though, that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod.
2844960	2848240	It doesn't, I don't know.
2848240	2852120	But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.
2852120	2853120	Why do it?
2853120	2854120	Because we can.
2854120	2855120	Exactly.
2855120	2857040	We do what we must because we can.
2857040	2858040	Absolutely.
2858040	2859040	So there you go.
2859040	2860040	Yeah.
2860040	2863040	Well, how about some other news, Rob?
2863040	2869120	First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP, is going to be having a price drop.
2869120	2872240	It's going to go down to $130.
2872240	2876400	So I wonder if that's, you know, preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory
2876400	2881160	for the new thingies coming out, but, you know, they've been slashing them, so now it's
2881160	2882680	actually somewhat affordable.
2882680	2886280	Who knows, right?
2886280	2888840	And another happy, happy, happy news.
2888840	2893040	The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.
2893040	2900640	We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time, older than a lot of our listeners.
2900640	2905920	And of course, we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out, hopefully
2905920	2908520	before too long.
2908520	2911520	And pretty cool stuff.
2911520	2914840	Rob, did you start off with the first one?
2914840	2915840	Which one?
2915840	2916840	I'm sorry.
2916840	2917840	The first Legend of Zelda.
2917840	2918840	Oh, gosh, yes.
2918840	2919840	Of course.
2919840	2920840	That was my very first Zelda game.
2920840	2921840	I remember playing that in the fourth grade.
2921840	2924840	That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
2924840	2925840	Fantastic game.
2925840	2926840	And it was gold.
2926840	2931560	Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old, because that means I'm old.
2931560	2932880	No.
2932880	2938600	And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.
2938600	2947800	Actually it's done by Projector Games, and it's called, well, I just said, Fortresscraft.
2947800	2952360	There's a Twitter for it, and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.
2952360	2959760	Chapter one is Minecraft Creative, chapter two is Crafting, three is Life, four is Machinery,
2959760	2964860	five is Minions, six is PvP, seven is Fortress Assault Mode.
2964860	2969560	So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.
2969560	2974040	March 4th, 80 bucks.
2974040	2975040	Beware the Ides of March.
2975040	2976040	Alright.
2976040	2977040	That's not the fourth, is it?
2977040	2978040	Whatever.
2978040	2979040	Not yet.
2979040	2980040	So yeah.
2980040	2985000	Alright, let's go to the Twitter, and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent
2985000	2986880	us tonight.
2986880	2990480	Which isn't a lot.
2990480	2993120	The tweets are looking very thin tonight, it must be because everybody's tweeting about
2993120	2994720	the Oscars, I don't know.
2994720	2995720	They're watching Betty White.
2995720	2996720	I guess.
2996720	3001600	Let's see, going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played
3001600	3002600	pinball yesterday.
3002600	3003600	Oh, that's sweet.
3003600	3006600	What's going on in the pinball world?
3006600	3009160	Pinacogo's coming up I think next month.
3009160	3010640	What, Pinacogo's that big convention?
3010640	3011640	Is that the one in Dixon?
3011640	3012640	I think it's the one in Dixon.
3012640	3013640	Oh god.
3013640	3015760	But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.
3015760	3016760	Oh, that's good.
3016760	3017760	That'll be good.
3017760	3020080	Last year it was still too hot.
3020080	3022680	Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?
3022680	3023920	Whatever Stern's put out.
3023920	3027560	Oh yeah, there was the, they had a Dark Knight table, I remember seeing it.
3027560	3028880	Stern's the only one doing anything.
3028880	3032640	The last one, the last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.
3032640	3033640	Oh wow.
3033640	3038560	And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.
3038560	3042880	Let's see, Flaming Toilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was mailbag
3042880	3044080	at OrangeLaundry.com.
3044080	3047320	It is actually mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com.
3047320	3048880	There you go.
3048880	3051440	Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.
3051440	3054880	Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.
3054880	3060680	Apparently Take Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.
3060680	3069680	They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net,
3069680	3073000	and HammersteinFaust.com.
3073000	3076440	People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand
3076440	3077440	Theft Auto.
3077440	3080600	It is Take Two that actually registered these domains, they're not just like random things
3080600	3081600	out of the blue.
3081600	3084800	So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft
3084800	3090320	Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.
3090320	3091320	We'll see.
3091320	3093760	It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.
3093760	3095960	I'm looking, I'm looking.
3095960	3104160	Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed
3104160	3107200	its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.
3107200	3110640	You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject,
3110640	3115600	but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI, which closed their doors last night, Saturday,
3115600	3117760	was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.
3117760	3118960	So there was a bunch of people there.
3118960	3121400	Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?
3121400	3122400	Yeah.
3122400	3123400	Kind of creepster.
3123400	3126640	But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown
3126640	3130240	Fair did actually close.
3130240	3131400	Sad.
3131400	3135400	Supposedly though, there is some hope, it does sound like they're going to move to an
3135400	3138360	unspecified location in Williamsburg.
3138360	3143440	So perhaps it's not gone forever, it will just be in a new place.
3143440	3145360	I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.
3145360	3146360	Look at that.
3146360	3148920	They have little sit down super street fighter machines.
3148920	3151320	Last call was at 1245 AM.
3151320	3152320	Aww.
3152320	3153320	Bye guys.
3153320	3154320	Good luck.
3154320	3157760	I'm always sad to see more Arcades close.
3157760	3159160	Alright.
3159160	3160560	One last tweet for you guys here.
3160560	3162960	This is from Tigerclaw.
3162960	3166080	It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.
3166080	3174480	Yeah, it's some type of, it's called Fabricate Yourself and it uses 3D models that the Kinect
3174480	3178960	captures to make 3D printed figures.
3178960	3180460	Interesting.
3180460	3184440	They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction
3184440	3185440	Conference.
3185440	3190200	They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect and then they got turned
3190200	3193400	into big giant puzzle pieces.
3193400	3198340	So all these like people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces
3198340	3200800	and I can't really explain this on the radio.
3200800	3205320	But I don't know, they look like little bars of soap with raised imprints of people.
3205320	3209960	But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to I guess, you know, do that really cheap,
3209960	3213280	I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline
3213280	3214720	a body real quick with that.
3214720	3215720	So that's pretty cool.
3215720	3217400	Rob, Rob, breaking news.
3217400	3218400	What's that?
3218400	3221320	JC Penney has a new logo and it's shitty.
3221320	3222400	Who cares?
3222400	3223760	I care.
3223760	3224760	Alright.
3224760	3227760	That's it for the tweets tonight.
3227760	3230920	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.
3230920	3231920	Meanwhile.
3231920	3232920	Look at that.
3232920	3233920	It's horrible.
3233920	3234920	What are they thinking?
3234920	3235920	Who cares?
3235920	3236920	Remember it's a video game show.
3236920	3237920	Remember?
3237920	3238920	I care.
3238920	3239920	I'm a designer.
3239920	3240920	I care.
3240920	3241920	Alright.
3241920	3242920	Moving on.
3242920	3243920	And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.
3243920	3244920	Well now that's, that's a little better.
3244920	3245920	Alright.
3245920	3246920	Yeah.
3246920	3249560	More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.
3249560	3252660	This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed
3252660	3254720	down the franchises, they were done for good.
3254720	3259600	In fact, the official Twitter feeds at a one time said there's not going to be any more
3259600	3262120	content, but they have changed course this week.
3262120	3268320	Both series said on their Twitter feeds that feeds that continued support from the communities
3268320	3269900	have announced a change.
3269900	3273380	They will be doing more DLC for both franchises.
3273380	3277080	Now we don't usually see weekly content in these games.
3277080	3281040	It's usually more of a monthly thing, but it's still kind of exciting that there'll
3281040	3285600	be something else, especially because that whole pendulum pack went to a DJ Hero last
3285600	3286600	time.
3286600	3287600	That was a pretty awesome pack.
3287600	3291240	So more information coming soon.
3291240	3293240	And of course that's all we know.
3293240	3294240	Soon.
3294240	3295240	Tempting us.
3295240	3296240	I know.
3296240	3302880	Well, you know Telltale, they're a company that we're a pretty big fans of.
3302880	3307600	Well they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and we're told no.
3307600	3314160	The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley said, he put it on his Twitter that they approached him,
3314160	3316080	but he did not want it to be an Avenger game.
3316080	3321680	He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was pretty, pretty sad though.
3321680	3323520	I think it could have done both.
3323520	3324520	Yeah.
3324520	3328980	I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so
3328980	3329980	hot.
3329980	3335920	So, I mean, maybe a, well, I don't want to say a better game because the game that came
3335920	3339920	out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole eight bit throwback kind of way.
3339920	3341520	And it's, it's pretty great.
3341520	3346760	But I mean, another game wouldn't have, uh, I think hurt things, but maybe, and it's hard
3346760	3352360	to tell from this story, but maybe, uh, Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up
3352360	3353360	ultimately happening.
3353360	3355800	I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.
3355800	3358060	I mean, this could have been years ago.
3358060	3360680	We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.
3360680	3366320	Uh, so, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about the walking dead, uh, having
3366320	3370840	its comic book being adapted, uh, even though it's happens to be a TV show now.
3370840	3378180	And then, uh, there was the fable, the, um, the fairytales fables, the adult ones that's
3378180	3379500	being translated as well.
3379500	3383800	So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.
3383800	3386240	So Scott Pilgrim of course was a comic book before it was a movie.
3386240	3389840	So, um, that would have been great, but yeah, it would have been great, but I mean, what
3389840	3392120	came out was good, was fine.
3392120	3393120	Yeah.
3393120	3394120	It was better than fine.
3394120	3395120	It was great.
3395120	3396120	Yeah.
3396120	3397860	So, but it would be nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably
3397860	3399080	could have been pretty awesome too.
3399080	3400080	Oh yeah.
3400080	3406400	So who knows, but, uh, yeah, so that is, uh, not happening.
3406400	3409340	Also not happening Blockbuster.
3409340	3413200	This is kind of a blast from your past, but yeah, Blockbuster is going to be selling off
3413200	3418120	its assets, which are valued at $290 million.
3418120	3419120	Here's the deal.
3419120	3424280	Uh, a limited liability company actually bought all the funds of Blockbuster, which is Cobalt
3424280	3431680	Video Hold Co, and, uh, they have actually stepped in to sell off Blockbuster's assets.
3431680	3438240	Uh, so they're going to be, uh, uh, fielding offers, I guess it's $290 million is the starting
3438240	3439240	point there.
3439240	3444040	And, uh, they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago, so this isn't really surprising.
3444040	3446720	We've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time.
3446720	3448920	That was in September of 2010.
3448920	3451480	So what happens from here, I'm not sure.
3451480	3456120	I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take
3456120	3460000	over from there, or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything, which
3460000	3463320	could be if there, especially if there isn't a buyer, uh, they'll probably end up having
3463320	3464320	to do that.
3464320	3465320	It's really not surprising.
3465320	3470120	Um, no, they're probably going to go away.
3470120	3471920	I think that's what a lot of people is expecting to happen.
3471920	3477200	I mean, especially in this day, day and age of, uh, you know, the Netflix and the Amazon.
3477200	3483080	Well, that's the same thing that happened with, uh, Hollywood is they liquidated, um,
3483080	3487880	to try to, uh, get, to keep from going into bankruptcy, but it looks like Blockbuster's
3487880	3489040	already in.
3489040	3490040	Yeah.
3490040	3491040	They're, they're going to go.
3491040	3492040	Bye bye.
3492040	3493040	Yep.
3493040	3497480	So they're, they went to the mail, you know, too late in the game.
3497480	3499200	They're they're gone.
3499200	3502960	It's kind of weird because as I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster,
3502960	3506480	so it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood now folding and
3506480	3509320	going away forever.
3509320	3511440	But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?
3511440	3515160	I couldn't even tell you a long time ago, a very long time ago.
3515160	3519080	We're ready to get to the email bag, mailbag at orangeslawnsradio.com.
3519080	3525560	Let us do such a thing.
3525560	3527080	We have one email.
3527080	3528080	One.
3528080	3533240	Dear OLR, long time email or first time listener.
3533240	3537520	I think the fall of the hero franchise is due to one simple reason.
3537520	3539760	The Will and Grace Syndrome.
3539760	3544000	Like the groundbreaking NBC sitcom that limped through its final seasons by stunt casting
3544000	3548000	out the wazoo, the equally groundbreaking Guitar Hero took the same route with its own
3548000	3549000	stunt casting.
3549000	3553600	Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Morello, no doubt, Kurt Cobain, et cetera, limping to its final installment
3553600	3555840	with Gene Simmons.
3555840	3559800	While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band centric
3559800	3563800	games like and such as the Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.
3563800	3567960	Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band,
3567960	3571480	these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special
3571480	3574680	and less awkward.
3574680	3579920	Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy
3579920	3581320	roommate.
3581320	3585700	While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end, it makes you wonder if it really added
3585700	3587800	anything besides being quick publicity.
3587800	3590840	It might be fun once or twice, but after a while, you stop caring and start to get annoyed
3590840	3591840	by it.
3591840	3595040	Stay black and get well soon, Loki, flaming toilet.
3595040	3596720	That's it.
3596720	3601800	I think the emailer is actually really onto something there with the whole it just it
3601800	3607120	did become a bit of a carnival of sports, carnival of crap.
3607120	3608920	Rock Band never kind of went there.
3608920	3611840	You know, I was always able to take Rock Band more seriously.
3611840	3615560	And I'll tell you what it really boiled down to for me was the support.
3615560	3619440	I mean, it's funny that we had that story a little bit ago about the whole support with
3619440	3625600	the download content and more of it coming out on the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games,
3625600	3629320	because I always kind of felt that Rock Band was so much better supported with the download
3629320	3630320	content.
3630320	3632480	And that's part of what kind of swayed me over to that series.
3632480	3634040	No, I agree.
3634040	3639120	And the whole like Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.
3639120	3640120	Yeah.
3640120	3642080	And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.
3642080	3643200	I mean, maybe they're out there.
3643200	3649360	I just don't know them, but I don't think it's that big a deal.
3649360	3652400	So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.
3652400	3653400	I don't know.
3653400	3654400	I don't know.
3654400	3657480	All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.
3657480	3675800	It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.
3675800	3681640	My FU first goes to my tooth, which I think I got something caught under it, but OK.
3681640	3684740	Just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me.
3684740	3687720	My canines are still my baby teeth.
3687720	3689240	So they don't have long roots.
3689240	3693800	So things get caught under them really easily and it hurts.
3693800	3694800	So yes.
3694800	3701000	Another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100 percent about Betty White and Trent
3701000	3702000	Reznor.
3702000	3707520	FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White.
3707520	3715480	And FU to being too busy.
3715480	3717880	Done.
3717880	3721760	My FUs of the week, FU to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.
3721760	3723760	FU to his hernia.
3723760	3724760	That's right.
3724760	3729960	FU to his hernia and FU to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.
3729960	3733480	Although I would want every pill of the world if I had just had surgery too.
3733480	3735360	So I feel you.
3735360	3744400	Seriously, though, I would say an FU to FU to expenses and how quickly they add up FU
3744400	3745400	to money.
3745400	3749960	I mean, money is great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be well, money
3749960	3751560	can also be kind of a pain in the ass.
3751560	3752760	Hey, Rob, what's that?
3752760	3756660	I'm going to offer an anti FU to Irene because she's hilarious.
3756660	3759800	Why is that?
3759800	3762960	She called you a shirt because she's trolling me on Facebook.
3762960	3765440	Whatever.
3765440	3766440	All right.
3766440	3767440	It made me laugh.
3767440	3768440	One more story for you guys.
3768440	3771080	Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.
3771080	3772080	Oh yeah.
3772080	3774840	That was a thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.
3774840	3779000	FU to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.
3779000	3780000	I know, right?
3780000	3783720	Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft
3783720	3784720	Punk is better.
3784720	3785720	Sorry.
3785720	3786720	Said it.
3786720	3787720	Buttholes.
3787720	3788720	Anyhow.
3788720	3791960	They're smelly stinky crusty buttholes.
3791960	3796740	You might've heard that, uh, they, uh, really made it harder to get into E3 this year.
3796740	3800860	If you are a, uh, independent journalist and so forth, you need X number of hits on your
3800860	3802960	website in order to be able to get in.
3802960	3805240	And so a lot of people are not able to go this year.
3805240	3806960	Well, guess who's coming to the rescue.
3806960	3809800	Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?
3809800	3810800	Your mom.
3810800	3812160	No, but close.
3812160	3813160	Kmart.
3813160	3814160	What?
3814160	3815300	Yes, that's right.
3815300	3821520	The home of things from the 1990s, uh, is going to be sending folks to E3.
3821520	3823400	The place with the old lady clothes?
3823400	3824400	Yep.
3824400	3825400	So there you go.
3825400	3831080	Uh, Kmart is, uh, running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky writers
3831080	3834440	to the event, including airfare and hotel.
3834440	3839200	The writers get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on
3839200	3841200	Kmart gamer.
3841200	3847120	Um, I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on
3847120	3851320	in the media and so forth, uh, with E3 and the, the crackdown and all that.
3851320	3857260	This kind of pisses me off actually, is that it's kind of like poo pooing what was really
3857260	3858920	insulting to a lot of people.
3858920	3861480	I think that we're working very hard.
3861480	3865400	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest,
3865400	3867440	but it's only three people.
3867440	3871240	Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?
3871240	3874160	Like, I bet there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.
3874160	3876080	It's only one person or it's only two people.
3876080	3879840	So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a
3879840	3881440	clamped down show?
3881440	3884760	If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.
3884760	3889520	Like it's just, I'm sorry, but that's probably how I feel from the E3 people.
3889520	3893360	And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of paid them a bunch of
3893360	3894360	money.
3894360	3896000	Well, that's just me.
3896000	3899800	And then sucked a little bit of, you know, yeah, probably involve that too.
3899800	3900800	I don't know.
3900800	3903640	All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.
3903640	3908400	Every week here on the show, dark soccer likes to take a trip down memory lane and find a
3908400	3914040	game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you ought to be playing this game this week.
3914040	3915680	It's a classic game of the week.
3915680	3916680	Dark soccer.
3916680	3917680	What is the classic game of the week?
3917680	3919840	I sometimes trip over the game and fall on my face.
3919840	3920840	Oh, oh, sorry.
3920840	3922840	Did I say that out loud?
3922840	3923840	My bad.
3923840	3926760	Um, today's game is Pokemon snap.
3926760	3928600	Yay.
3928600	3934040	It is a first person rail shooter, um, slash simulation game.
3934040	3939760	And it was, uh, done by how laboratory with packs soft NECA and it was published by Nintendo
3939760	3942080	for the Nintendo 64.
3942080	3949640	And basically in this game, um, you go around as this, uh, dude with a camera you play well
3949640	3958040	in a Japan, his name is Toru, um, over here, he's Todd snap, who is a Pokemon photographer
3958040	3964360	and professor Oak or Okey-doke, I should say, wants him to, uh, take pictures around the
3964360	3969840	island so that they can, uh, show Pokemon in their natural habitats.
3969840	3975080	So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the zero one and you take pictures
3975080	3979920	of the Pokemans, my Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.
3979920	3988600	So, uh, you, uh, get different points based for, uh, the size and the pose and keeping
3988600	3993140	it in frame, you get double points if it's centered, you have extra points for capturing
3993140	3998320	them in a special pose, for example, a surfing Pikachu, or if you get multiples of the same
3998320	4007100	Pokemon in the same image and you, uh, basically, uh, hold onto your photos, you can get better
4007100	4010640	photos as you go, but you've got different levels, you have the beach, the tunnel, volcano,
4010640	4017640	river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud, um, but some of the items have you play through
4017640	4021880	the levels, again, you'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level so you
4021880	4028800	can get hidden Pokemon or alternate routes, um, get, uh, different photographs and then
4028800	4034560	you get pester balls cause it's super effective, you use those to knock out Pokemon or to get
4034560	4040720	them out of hiding, you get a Poke Flute, which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate,
4040720	4048360	or hatch them, and then it can make them dance, and, uh, they can do certain dances, and then
4048360	4052800	you get a dash engine which lets you go faster than usual, and then you also get this thing
4052800	4057280	called an album mark where you can, uh, mark which ones are your favorite photos.
4057280	4058280	Pretty fun, huh?
4058280	4064840	This game is addicting, it's crap, seriously, but it originally was developed as a Nintendo
4064840	4072800	64 double D game, and it has, uh, 63 of the original generation of Pokemon, and it came
4072800	4078560	out on March 21st, 1999 in Japan, and June 30th and September 15th in North America and
4078560	4086120	PAL regions, both in 1999, the virtual console we got it, um, that, uh, well, you couldn't
4086120	4093240	save your, well, because it's different hardware, we, you actually would be able to, uh, share
4093240	4097000	the photos with your friends on different ways, and it came out on December 4th, 10th,
4097000	4106160	and 11th, uh, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively, and, uh,
4106160	4111080	it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.
4111080	4112080	And guess what?
4112080	4113080	That's true.
4113080	4118160	I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this, that completely sucks
4118160	4121840	and I spent too much money on it, and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, it
4121840	4128440	came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase, so that was pretty cool.
4128440	4134600	Back to Pokemon Snap, um, it was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster, and,
4134600	4140200	um, the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies
4140200	4145160	of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed, and, um, we had the same thing
4145160	4148640	at the Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap, I wish we did a few of those, and they actually had
4148640	4153080	a contest where you could take your best shot and, uh, you win a trip to Australia.
4153080	4155440	I remember that, because we tried to do that, I wanted to go to Australia.
4155440	4156920	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
4156920	4157920	Yeah.
4157920	4162880	And then, um, Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training
4162880	4170320	Tour, so, uh, it sold, like, a bunch in Japan for its first week, it ranked fifth in the
4170320	4174920	United States, it sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release, and
4174920	4181280	it was the most rented game up to October 22, 1999, and it was one of the top ten, uh,
4181280	4184840	best selling games as of November of the same year.
4184840	4192800	It was really, really cool, so it sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, so, uh, very,
4192800	4193800	very cool stuff.
4193800	4201720	It was super fun, um, it got a 77 on Metacritic, it, it really, honestly, I think of all of
4201720	4209160	the, uh, Pokemon games that came out, it was just so fun, really, it was so different and
4209160	4215800	so unique, that it really, I don't see how it couldn't have, you know, have won.
4215800	4222120	It was, it was a fantastic game, and there are certain people that says that this is
4222120	4231960	a game that should have never worked, but it just did, so, but, honestly, I, I, like
4231960	4237520	I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well,
4237520	4245920	and like, remember the, uh, Africa taking pictures of animals thing, and, uh, Dead Rising
4245920	4248760	even had the, the snap thing, remember?
4248760	4252360	Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead Rising, the original one.
4252360	4259200	So it's not as if the concept isn't well-liked, it's just a matter of execution, and I really
4259200	4264880	think this was executed well, and the other thing too, is because of how brilliantly marketed
4264880	4265880	it was.
4265880	4267480	Do you remember, Rob, don't you?
4267480	4270720	Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever, I mean, I did go there a
4270720	4274680	little bit when I was more in, like, college, but when I was younger, like, we didn't really
4274680	4279120	go to Blockbuster, so we didn't, we had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't
4279120	4282600	get any of that, like, printer stuff, and I didn't own it in Nintendo 64 anyway.
4282600	4287960	They were also doing, because at the same time they also had, um, the Pikachu Gankidechu,
4287960	4292640	which in Japan, that's what it was, in the US it was, um, Hey You Pikachu, where you
4292640	4298120	could talk to Pikachu, and remember C-Man, basically, had that, and, um, Pokemon Stadium,
4298120	4304280	which I thought was a fantastic concept, but this one of the, you know, 3D entrances of
4304280	4308680	Pokemon, I think this one, to this day, is the best.
4308680	4313560	This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing,
4313560	4319040	even though it's a Nintendo 64 title, I mean, I was, when we got ready for Nintendo 64 the
4319040	4322960	first time around, I was pissed off, because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?
4322960	4328640	Well, thankfully there's the Wii Virtual Console on it, but, um, I remember that was a big
4328640	4334120	deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect, one of the few changes they
4334120	4335120	made, I guess.
4335120	4336120	Wonderful!
4336120	4339360	Yeah, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on the Wii,
4339360	4341840	so, you totally could do it.
4341840	4343200	Wonderful!
4343200	4351600	And the voice acting, uh, I like it, because it had such limited voice capacity, so, I
4351600	4356640	thought, Nintendo's always done this, though, that they've had, you know, a couple lines
4356640	4360960	of dialogue to sort of give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like
4360960	4363800	without recording full-on dialogue.
4363800	4367520	I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself, but I guess we'll have to wait another week for
4367520	4368520	that.
4368520	4369520	Perhaps.
4369520	4374720	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap, for the Nintendo
4374720	4375720	64.
4375720	4378760	A game that I really like, just so you know.
4378760	4383800	So, all right, uh, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username
4383800	4388080	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're going to take some calls here to close out the show.
4388080	4391680	Remember guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight,
4391680	4395680	uh, Loki was recovering from surgery, we didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind
4395680	4399920	of a, it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on,
4399920	4404000	so we're going to just, we're doing a minimum day, we call it here at OrangeLoungeRadio,
4404000	4405840	like the days we used to have in school.
4405840	4409920	So we do have the Skype line open, I would ask if there's last minute stories, but Dark
4409920	4412240	Soccer usually doesn't go hunting for those, that's a Loki thing, so.
4412240	4415200	Pink Berry is our last minute story.
4415200	4419440	The Oscars were won by Pink Berry and Betty White.
4419440	4422800	So we're going to wait for some calls here, uh, I'll try to see if there's anything real
4422800	4425960	quick here that I can pull up.
4425960	4429840	I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual
4429840	4434560	because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.
4434560	4437660	But what we do have, what's that?
4437660	4444840	We have, um, Shermy, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.
4444840	4446400	Why would Shermy be offended by me?
4446400	4449040	She's offended by everybody.
4449040	4451920	She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this
4451920	4455440	morning by accident.
4455440	4458280	Let me get into a couple last minute stories for you guys.
4458280	4461760	I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.
4461760	4464960	I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.
4464960	4471320	There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Cramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming
4471320	4473680	for free, which I think is awesome.
4473680	4477840	You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you, you can just get
4477840	4479040	this for free.
4479040	4485220	By the way, the internets, which was the other bonus levels, where these two other new levels
4485220	4489760	are going into, they're all going to be in the internets section, you used to have to
4489760	4496280	get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage, which
4496280	4497960	I think is pretty awesome.
4497960	4499640	So check that out.
4499640	4501240	All right.
4501240	4504540	That's pretty cool.
4504540	4506520	Let's look at some other stories here.
4506520	4511320	Oh, apparently, um, breast milk ice cream, um, is sold out at a London store.
4511320	4512320	Disgusting.
4512320	4513320	Sounds so disgusting.
4513320	4517080	It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.
4517080	4518280	I just caught that.
4518280	4519280	It's hilarious.
4519280	4520280	It was on NPR.
4520280	4521280	Gross.
4521280	4524400	Hey, that's what babies drink.
4524400	4527000	But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.
4527000	4529640	You drink breast milk from cows.
4529640	4531440	It's just different.
4531440	4536680	DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii if you are still following
4536680	4537680	this series.
4537680	4544260	Of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games going to be coming out on the 29th of April.
4544260	4546440	New features and innovations they're saying.
4546440	4547440	All right.
4547440	4548440	Well, we'll see.
4548440	4551920	I guess you're supposed to be using now, uh, the Wii remote, the nunchuck and the dance
4551920	4556280	mat all together to do hot new dance moves.
4556280	4563800	There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore Lord.
4563800	4567840	I guess they're trying to do more of a full body thing with all those parts, like kind
4567840	4569180	of what you do with the connect.
4569180	4571160	That's what they're trying to do with the hottest party.
4571160	4573360	I guess we'll see how that actually plays out.
4573360	4575360	Yeah, I know.
4575360	4579920	I just want DDR.
4579920	4582640	Let's see the fate of freestyle games.
4582640	4587760	The DJ Hero developer still undecided, and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement
4587760	4589920	that there's still download content coming.
4589920	4593320	So freestyle games has not had the plug pulled on it yet.
4593320	4597360	They may be able to make other games, maybe even a new DJ Hero game.
4597360	4602200	I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that 3D DJ Hero thing that
4602200	4605780	they showed at E3.
4605780	4608320	Would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?
4608320	4611000	Uh, you know, I could see it happening.
4611000	4614000	I think it would actually be really cool.
4614000	4620240	There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.
4620240	4622280	I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.
4622280	4629880	It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the
4629880	4637240	works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi, as it's on the official website.
4637240	4639880	Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.
4639880	4641760	It's uh, it definitely is pretty.
4641760	4644600	It'll be out on March 22nd.
4644600	4647600	Alright, let's go to the phones.
4647600	4649600	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4649600	4650600	Who's this?
4650600	4651600	This is CT.
4651600	4653600	Hey, Dartetsuya, what's on your mind, buddy?
4653600	4654600	Oh, hang on.
4654600	4655600	Turn down your speakers.
4655600	4661440	Yes, first rule of radio, you gotta mute what you're listening to, or you'll hear yourself
4661440	4663240	and it messes with you.
4663240	4664240	What's up, buddy?
4664240	4665240	Yeah, sorry.
4665240	4672080	I wanted to talk about this new MMO outfit.
4672080	4673080	Is it The Rift?
4673080	4677320	It's called, oh no, it's called NESstalgia.
4677320	4679320	NESstalgia?
4679320	4683720	I seem to, I think I saw something, a late tweet had come in on this after that segment
4683720	4684720	was done.
4684720	4685720	But what's NESstalgia?
4685720	4694640	Well, imagine like Dragon Warrior, but like an MMO, like Warcraft.
4694640	4695960	How exactly does this play?
4695960	4699000	Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?
4699000	4703840	Yeah, well yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with
4703840	4707760	lots of other people.
4707760	4711720	And what makes this game fun?
4711720	4716720	Well it's, it's...
4716720	4717720	It's old school.
4717720	4719720	That's why it's awesome.
4719720	4720720	Yeah.
4720720	4721720	Yeah.
4721720	4727400	It's like playing, it's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.
4727400	4731040	Can you make your own content in this or is it like kind of a linear thing?
4731040	4736680	Oh no, you can create your own character, choose different colors and all that.
4736680	4737680	Gotcha.
4737680	4738680	Different classes.
4738680	4739680	All right.
4739680	4740680	I'm watching a video of it.
4740680	4747000	It looks interesting, but honestly I like World of Warcraft.
4747000	4750880	Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?
4750880	4751880	Is it free?
4751880	4752880	Oh yeah.
4752880	4753880	Oh, that's cool.
4753880	4754880	Free is good.
4754880	4755880	All right.
4755880	4757880	What's the website where we can check it out?
4757880	4762440	Oh shoot, I have to, I don't have to find it.
4762440	4765160	I'll have to Google it to find out.
4765160	4766160	Yeah.
4766160	4767160	All right.
4767160	4768640	DT, I will check that game out.
4768640	4769640	I promise.
4769640	4771200	Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?
4771200	4772680	No, that's it.
4772680	4773680	All right.
4773680	4774680	We'll check it out.
4774680	4775680	Take care, buddy.
4775680	4777920	It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.
4777920	4778920	Oh, there it is.
4778920	4780480	Gamer girl just said in a chat room there.
4780480	4783920	It's silkgames.com is where you can get that.
4783920	4786560	Yeah, I don't think so.
4786560	4787560	Why?
4787560	4790040	It doesn't look that good?
4790040	4792360	I'm already paying for something, so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.
4792360	4793360	This is free.
4793360	4795400	Yeah, but I won't have time.
4795400	4797300	Sometimes the diversion is nice.
4797300	4799720	That's why I have a DS.
4799720	4803120	I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3, and usually that's when I don't want to talk to
4803120	4804120	people.
4804120	4809960	And honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.
4809960	4815080	So I can play that for free too, and it looks better.
4815080	4817200	All right.
4817200	4818840	Let's try to take some more calls here.
4818840	4819840	Hi.
4819840	4820840	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
4820840	4821840	Who's this?
4821840	4822840	Dark Jester.
4822840	4823840	How you doing?
4823840	4824840	Hey, good.
4824840	4825840	How are you, buddy?
4825840	4826840	I'm doing okay.
4826840	4827840	What's on your mind?
4827840	4835640	Well, I want to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener, and I've listened
4835640	4841360	to a few of your past ones, and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.
4841360	4845880	And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.
4845880	4846880	Oh, really?
4846880	4851840	Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.
4851840	4852840	That's cool.
4852840	4857320	I hope it was good stuff and not the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom
4857320	4858920	wall for a good time.
4858920	4859920	No, no, no, no.
4859920	4860920	It was good stuff.
4860920	4861920	Oh, good.
4861920	4862920	That's cool.
4862920	4865040	So where are you calling from, if you don't mind me asking?
4865040	4866040	I'm sorry?
4866040	4867040	Where are you calling from?
4867040	4868040	Louisiana.
4868040	4869040	Cool.
4869040	4871040	Well, I'm an Alabama native.
4871040	4872040	Really?
4872040	4873040	Yeah.
4873040	4874040	From Mobile.
4874040	4885480	Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas, so I've never really been to Mobile
4885480	4886480	either.
4886480	4887480	Well, that's okay.
4887480	4888480	You're not missing much.
4888480	4889840	Just Mardi Gras.
4889840	4895000	So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?
4895000	4898960	It was All Gen Gamers.
4898960	4899960	All Gen Gamers.
4899960	4906640	I have to admit, I have heard of that show, but I don't think I've listened to them lately,
4906640	4908920	so I'll have to check it out.
4908920	4909920	It's fairly new.
4909920	4915960	They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and
4915960	4921740	one of the other hosts on the show said that it's a big deal for them, but it was an even
4921740	4926520	bigger deal for you guys hitting those 400 episodes.
4926520	4927520	I wish them luck.
4927520	4930680	I hope they stick it out.
4930680	4934920	Doing what we do here, it's not that hard, honestly.
4934920	4941600	It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it
4941600	4943400	for the right reasons.
4943400	4945040	We know we're not going to be super famous.
4945040	4949240	That's not the reason to be in this, but just the crowd that we have here in the chat room
4949240	4953280	really makes it worth it, and just the positive feedback that we do get.
4953280	4957880	Believe me, we've got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to get through to that, but you
4957880	4962440	do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.
4962440	4966960	I already approve of them because they had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with
4966960	4967960	the dog Snuggie.
4967960	4970480	That was a great episode.
4970480	4971480	Pretty awesome.
4971480	4975600	Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you, and 370 to go.
4975600	4976600	You can do it.
4976600	4977600	All right.
4977600	4984520	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?
4984520	4985520	Not that I can think of.
4985520	4988520	I had a couple of things, but they just kind of flew out of my brain.
4988520	4990280	I don't really remember them now.
4990280	4991480	That tends to happen on live radio.
4991480	4992480	It happens to me all the time.
4992480	4995920	But if you think about it, send us an email later on, all right?
4995920	4996920	I sure can.
4996920	4997920	Thank you.
4997920	4998920	All right.
4998920	4999920	Welcome to the show, and have a good one.
4999920	5000920	Thanks for calling.
5000920	5001920	You're welcome.
5001920	5002920	Thanks.
5002920	5003920	Bye-bye.
5003920	5004920	You know, that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before.
5004920	5007680	I thought that was one of those, like, long-time listener, first-time caller types of things,
5007680	5008680	but I guess not.
5008680	5013120	I'm actually on their Twitter right now, giving them a thank you.
5013120	5014120	Very cool.
5014120	5019240	1877 Game OLRs, the number you can call, or our user name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
5019240	5022760	Now, see, what happened is that we were sitting there, like, completely empty for, like, five
5022760	5025680	minutes, and then all of a sudden, the whole thing lights up.
5025680	5030040	So hopefully I can get to a couple more of those calls at least.
5030040	5031040	We'll do that.
5031040	5032040	All right.
5032040	5033040	Let's see.
5033040	5034040	Oh, there it goes.
5034040	5035040	Phone's ringing.
5035040	5036040	Let's go take some more calls.
5036040	5037040	Hi.
5037040	5038040	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
5038040	5039040	Who's this?
5039040	5040040	Hello?
5040040	5041040	Hola.
5041040	5042040	Bienvenidos.
5042040	5043040	Orange Launch Radio.
5043040	5044040	Deadline.
5044040	5045040	The person's not really there.
5045040	5052040	You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.
5052040	5053040	It's always a good thing to do.
5053040	5056640	Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.
5056640	5058200	Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.
5058200	5059200	Hi.
5059200	5060200	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
5060200	5061200	Who's this?
5061200	5062200	Hey, hey.
5062200	5063200	It's Rhonda from animejamsession.com.
5063200	5065640	Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.
5065640	5067760	Anybody else want to plug their show?
5067760	5071560	It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.
5071560	5072920	What's up, buddy?
5072920	5073920	Not too much.
5073920	5079240	I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon 17 con report.
5079240	5080240	Yes.
5080240	5081240	KatsuCon 17.
5081240	5085920	I went to KatsuCon 13, I think?
5085920	5086920	What year?
5086920	5087920	I think it might have been 15.
5087920	5091520	And yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as
5091520	5092520	the Black Mage.
5092520	5093520	Oh, great.
5093520	5094520	Joy and Rapture.
5094520	5098800	All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy DC.
5098800	5099920	How was it?
5099920	5102760	It was good, but this time we're no longer in DC.
5102760	5103760	Oh.
5103760	5110640	Yeah, from my understanding, the omnishore on the Hoity Toity Hotel got tired of the
5110640	5114920	con, axed the contract, and told them, get the steppin'.
5114920	5120800	So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel Spa and Resort in National
5120800	5122880	Harbor, Maryland.
5122880	5124880	Gaylord.
5124880	5125880	Only you.
5125880	5126880	I know.
5126880	5129000	Well, how'd the con go?
5129000	5130000	What was up?
5130000	5133440	What kind of fun things were to be seen at KatsuCon 17?
5133440	5135800	A lot of cool stuff.
5135800	5139720	It was like, for me, it was just very spread out, very laid back.
5139720	5141680	I had a good time.
5141680	5144240	My partner in crime, he did most of the panel work.
5144240	5148740	Me, I just did a lot of the footwork of pictures and photography and what was trending in long
5148740	5150760	lines of cosplay.
5150760	5152960	And what was trending in cosplay?
5152960	5155840	Again, it's Hetalia.
5155840	5160920	And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since
5160920	5162160	the release of 13.
5162160	5163160	Of course.
5163160	5169600	I played one, I actually wanted to cosplay Japan for Hetalia.
5169600	5173440	I have yet to see Hetalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.
5173440	5179000	I've seen some crazy ones, well, a friend of mine's going to Comiket this year, and
5179000	5183600	I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay
5183600	5184600	from Japan.
5184600	5186520	Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stalking?
5186520	5188440	Because that's my favorite new one.
5188440	5189440	Yes.
5189440	5190440	Awesome.
5190440	5193520	You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?
5193520	5194640	Oh, God.
5194640	5195960	You and that show.
5195960	5200560	It's like your new, you always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.
5200560	5202120	And there's been other ones in the past.
5202120	5204800	But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.
5204800	5205800	I know.
5205800	5206800	Thanks to Becky.
5206800	5207800	It's super strong now.
5207800	5208800	Blame Becky.
5208800	5209800	It's all related stuff.
5209800	5212960	Before we get into video games, you mentioned pantyhose and stalking.
5212960	5217880	I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.
5217880	5219840	Did you cosplay from pantyhose and stalking?
5219840	5220840	Yes.
5220840	5221840	I was garter-built.
5221840	5222840	Awesome.
5222840	5223840	That's awesome.
5223840	5224840	Nice.
5224840	5225840	Very nice.
5225840	5226840	Yes.
5226840	5228000	Very nice.
5228000	5230920	What video game content was there at Katsucon?
5230920	5236280	A massive gaming room, and I know I've probably said this once before, and I'll most likely
5236280	5242320	say it again, Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions.
5242320	5243720	Ah, sad face.
5243720	5245720	Why is that?
5245720	5247160	They don't get the machines.
5247160	5252520	Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically
5252520	5256240	an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.
5256240	5263800	So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock
5263800	5264800	Band.
5264800	5269200	Do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?
5269200	5270200	I have.
5270200	5272920	I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.
5272920	5273920	Oh.
5273920	5274920	Nice.
5274920	5279520	I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.
5279520	5281520	Excuses, excuses.
5281520	5283620	You have to go to Fauna Mae this year.
5283620	5285960	I can't do Fauna Mae this year.
5285960	5286960	I'm broke.
5286960	5289600	I really want to do Fauna Mae.
5289600	5291160	I'm planning on doing Fauna Mae.
5291160	5294280	You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.
5294280	5298760	I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.
5298760	5302920	Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting
5302920	5304760	to do some type of cosplay.
5304760	5309100	But anyway, well, let me ask one more question then.
5309100	5314560	What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?
5314560	5317040	T-shirts mostly.
5317040	5318040	Any good t-shirts?
5318040	5319040	What kind?
5319040	5321000	What were some funny slogans you saw?
5321000	5322000	Alright.
5322000	5327080	They have a female shirt with two boos on it.
5327080	5330760	Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?
5330760	5331760	Yes.
5331760	5336160	And it says someone lines up, don't touch my boos or leave my boos on.
5336160	5337160	Thank you.
5337160	5338160	Please stop looking at my boos.
5338160	5339160	Oh, it's boo.
5339160	5341640	I thought it was like actual, like I thought it was like one of those shirts where they
5341640	5345880	draw the tuxedo on it or something, but like it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.
5345880	5346960	And I was like, why is that?
5346960	5347960	That's not funny.
5347960	5348960	That's weird.
5348960	5349960	That's redundant.
5349960	5350960	I get it.
5350960	5351960	Booze.
5351960	5354480	I like, I like the one that Becky has though, of the d twenties.
5354480	5355480	It says, yes, they're natural.
5355480	5356480	Oh yeah.
5356480	5358080	I've seen that before at conventions.
5358080	5361280	And don't forget the cleric shirt.
5361280	5362280	Plus one shirt.
5362280	5363280	Cloth shirt.
5363280	5364280	No, no, no.
5364280	5366960	It's a parody of the clerk's logo, but it says clerics.
5366960	5371960	It says they hate, they may heal you, but they still hate you.
5371960	5373880	Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
5373880	5374880	Yeah.
5374880	5375880	That's it.
5375880	5376880	All right.
5376880	5377880	One more question.
5377880	5380880	Thing they most need at KatsuCon 18.
5380880	5381880	Chicken katsu.
5381880	5382880	Febreze.
5382880	5383880	What's that?
5383880	5384880	Febreze.
5384880	5385880	Febreze.
5385880	5386880	All right, buddy.
5386880	5388040	I'm going to let you go.
5388040	5389040	Have a good one.
5389040	5390040	For you.
5390040	5391040	One more thing.
5391040	5392040	I'm posting this in the chat.
5392040	5396640	Um, the masquerade was great, but there was a link to a video of my friends doing a Super
5396640	5398040	Mario Brothers musical too.
5398040	5399320	What will Brian boy Tano do?
5399320	5400320	It was really fun.
5400320	5401320	Jesus.
5401320	5402320	Okay.
5402320	5403320	Wait, I'm looking at this here.
5403320	5425320	I can't see an O. There was issues with where they put us for recording videos.
5425320	5447520	You know what the best part about watching these videos, Rama, you know what the best
5447520	5448880	part is?
5448880	5449880	That being?
5449880	5455400	It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't
5455400	5457440	the nerdiest thing I could be doing.
5457440	5458440	Yeah.
5458440	5462760	I've seen a wedding at AX.
5462760	5466320	I've seen wedding proposals at masquerades.
5466320	5467640	All right.
5467640	5468920	I'm really letting you know now, buddy.
5468920	5469920	Have a good one.
5469920	5470920	All right.
5470920	5472920	Thanks for the call.
5472920	5474800	All right.
5474800	5475800	What the hell?
5475800	5476800	One more call.
5476800	5477800	Hi, you're on Orange is on its radio.
5477800	5478800	Who's this?
5478800	5479800	Hi, guys.
5479800	5480800	What's up?
5480800	5481800	Hey, it's DDR dollar bill here.
5481800	5482800	DDR dollar bill.
5482800	5483800	What's on your mind?
5483800	5484800	I don't know much.
5484800	5489080	I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in, so I figured, damn what happened.
5489080	5490080	Well, then it all flooded.
5490080	5491400	It always works that way.
5491400	5495280	I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between
5495280	5498280	when we do things here in studio and then when you guys hear it.
5498280	5502120	It used to be like 15 seconds and then I don't know, all games change some things around
5502120	5503760	and I think we bounce.
5503760	5507480	I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you
5507480	5508480	now, but whatever.
5508480	5510560	Hey, you know what?
5510560	5512280	At least we have a place to do our show.
5512280	5516480	What's on your mind, buddy?
5516480	5519480	And nothing much.
5519480	5522120	Just calling in fast if I say hi.
5522120	5526800	Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.
5526800	5527800	Gaming laptop.
5527800	5529800	What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?
5529800	5533040	Let's put it this way.
5533040	5539480	This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something
5539480	5545760	like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.
5545760	5547760	So you can't do a little netbook.
5547760	5550520	You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.
5550520	5553600	Right, but here's something funny today though.
5553600	5559320	I tried a couple over at the Best Pie just for kicks and giggles.
5559320	5565720	I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.
5565720	5567440	You crashed every laptop at Best Pie?
5567440	5569640	You know, some people do that on purpose.
5569640	5572880	Some people will go into like fries and try to like crash all the computers before they
5572880	5577080	get caught by the, you know, burly looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.
5577080	5579080	What are you doing?
5579080	5582360	Not that I would know, but I've just, you know, I've heard.
5582360	5586040	But I did this on accident, all of them.
5586040	5589880	Were you hitting Control-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by and, you know?
5589880	5590880	No.
5590880	5594640	Actually, it's not as bad of a thing to do on a computer as it used to be.
5594640	5595640	I did something else.
5595640	5599280	I just, from half of them I was just checking out some of the specs, some of them I was
5599280	5606120	just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run
5606120	5607120	your game.
5607120	5614200	I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one and I'll get it later
5614200	5615200	on.
5615200	5620120	I got a couple of those and it just, they started crashing and then I had to reboot
5620120	5621120	a couple of them.
5621120	5622920	I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
5622920	5625520	Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?
5625520	5627280	A couple of questions in our chat room here.
5627280	5630920	Dark Toegak says, 60 frames a second is overkill.
5630920	5633280	I get 30's not cutting it for you?
5633280	5635440	Hell fucking no.
5635440	5637080	I saw that coming.
5637080	5638080	Why not?
5638080	5642800	No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest.
5642800	5648240	30 frames per second actually, it's not accurate.
5648240	5654160	It doesn't feel real and no, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's
5654160	5657280	a smooth motion because then it feels more real to me.
5657280	5662240	30 frames is all choppy and I'm missing shots left and right.
5662240	5663880	I need to be that precise.
5663880	5667980	And Brad from Pod Culture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?
5667980	5669440	That is a good question.
5669440	5673280	It's not quite as easy to build as the desktops.
5673280	5674280	Oh I know.
5674280	5676680	You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?
5676680	5681000	Yeah, I know it's hard, but he said he could do it, so I'm just giving him a couple more
5681000	5683480	days to get me some specs on it.
5683480	5688200	He says he can do it, so I didn't say I wasn't going to buy it yet, but I'm very curious
5688200	5693460	if he can and how, because even I'm like, that's a lot of money to actually get parts
5693460	5698620	for it, especially since most of them cost half the damn laptop itself.
5698620	5701800	You might just have to find a really small computer case and try to cram it all in there.
5701800	5703120	I don't know.
5703120	5709800	It's difficult because the idea is that it's supposed to have where it sits on my lap,
5709800	5713400	so I'm playing one game and my girlfriend plays next to me, so sometimes we play Warcraft
5713400	5720540	together, so we have the TV going on rather than me in one room and her in another room.
5720540	5725920	That's a lot of visual sensory stuff going on at once.
5725920	5728760	I know, but I've done it before.
5728760	5729760	All right.
5729760	5733940	Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?
5733940	5738160	I got to rewire my damn pads so I can play DDR again.
5738160	5740720	There's a new one coming out on the Wii.
5740720	5741720	That's the reason.
5741720	5745320	I need a rewire so I can play on the Wii.
5745320	5747400	New Lady Gaga and Paramore.
5747400	5748400	And PS3.
5748400	5750400	All right, buddy.
5750400	5752340	Good luck on your quest for new DDR.
5752340	5753340	Have a good one.
5753340	5754340	Thanks, guys.
5754340	5755340	Check you later.
5755340	5756920	PSDDRdollarBill is not just a clever name.
5756920	5757920	All right.
5757920	5759120	We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.
5759120	5760600	Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.
5760600	5764360	You can always send us an email, mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.
5764360	5767520	I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.
5767520	5772080	Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper,
5772080	5773080	then hide all the icons.
5773080	5774080	That's evil.
5774080	5775080	Oh, yeah.
5775080	5776080	That's evil.
5776080	5783560	Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops, so the manager of our
5783560	5788600	group would actually go in and do, you know, those little rotating word screen savers?
5788600	5789600	Oh, yeah.
5789600	5795080	He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it
5795080	5802700	on tile and, or put up like some sort of really bizarre, like this one dude who was like doodly
5802700	5805520	doodly, and he put up a picture of like a pink pony.
5805520	5806520	Hot.
5806520	5807520	Yeah.
5807520	5808520	Very hot.
5808520	5809520	All right.
5809520	5811840	Well, that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.
5811840	5814600	I know it was a short show tonight, but hey, you know what?
5814600	5816280	Sometimes real life gets in the way.
5816280	5818720	So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5818720	5820280	Dark Soccer, have you sobered up?
5820280	5821280	Excuse me.
5821280	5822280	Yes, that's a yes.
5822280	5824280	Oh, it tasted like ice cream.
5824280	5826280	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
5826280	5827280	Pinkberry!
5827280	5834440	Uh, my final thought is, I don't know, stuff.
5834440	5835440	IDK.
5835440	5836440	IDK.
5836440	5837440	LOL.
5837440	5838440	WTF.
5838440	5839440	BBQ.
5839440	5840440	You mad?
5840440	5841440	You mad?
5841440	5843640	Well, that's it for another episode here of Orange Lawn Radio.

5857440	5861600	Hopefully Loki's back, but even if he's not able to come back, we'll have some type of
5861600	5862600	guest host.
5862600	5863600	Do you have our special tribute ready for him?
5863600	5864600	I will.
5864600	5865600	I'll have that ready after the show.
