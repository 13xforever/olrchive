10139	24335	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, February 27th, 2011 The 3DS launches in Japan We Dare might be too daring for the US And will Guitar Hero get more download content after all?
31345	32346	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers Booze Booze
57040	62445	I have... Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.
62465	62905	No, no, no.
62986	64147	I have... She done forgot.
65572	66392	Stop interrupting me.
66932	69293	I have Irish... Wait, did you guys hear that?
69313	69653	I'm sorry.
69693	70413	This is worth interrupting.
70433	71134	Did you hear that?
71414	72494	Stop interrupting me.
73614	74495	She's slurring already.
74515	75455	Stop interrupting me.
75715	75935	No.
76575	88519	I have Bailey's Irish Cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream, but I've mixed the whipped cream into it, so it cuts some of the...
89039	89720	www.DarkSakura.com
105097	106298	Well, let me get to that.
106598	108239	Techmaster Loki is out tonight.
108979	111560	He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.
111600	112200	Don't worry, guys.
112240	112841	He's fine.
113681	118583	But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia.
119984	121465	The same kind his child did.
121525	121745	That's...
122125	122666	Living with a hernia
136457	156990	so he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or something like that but he like didn't know he was gonna have the surgery and suddenly was like you're having the surgery okay so he had the surgery which you know my favorite thing to do is can is confused and sometimes it's on purpose it's confused hernias and hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut a little different little different
157710	159151	So yeah, he's recovering.
159211	160712	He's not able to drive out to the show.
160752	162672	He could be listening, so hi Loki if you're listening.
163553	172497	But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gallbladder thing which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.
172617	175218	So that could be where Loki's at right now, I don't know.
175578	176859	But regardless, you won't be here tonight.
176899	178900	So it's just DarkSakura and I holding down the fort.
178920	185564	We didn't have enough time to, since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone on the weekend, we didn't have time to cook up a guest host.
185724	187585	So it's just here, just the two of us here.
188145	191287	And one of us has been drinking, so this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.
191787	193348	Rob had some of my tasty beverage.
193528	194668	It is delicious, isn't it?
194708	195048	Nothing.
195508	203572	But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com joining us as you do every week here as we tape live our show.
203632	206953	We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.
206993	207673	You guys are awesome.
208113	214136	And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, you know, can we talk about the Oscars?
214156	215576	Because that's going on tonight.
215596	217957	On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.
218197	219838	I wanna call them the Betty Whiteskers
242717	254920	But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chatroom Because anybody who cares probably already has on the TV But whatever, people want to yell it out And I think SSJ went under mad a joke before the show That if Betty White's not at the Oscars, who cares?
255340	266562	And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners But you just have to change everything so that Betty White won everything And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chatroom But you know what, guys?
266962	268763	I think it's very well deserved You know why?
269103	270003	You know why it's well deserved?
270043	270803	Hold on, listen to this
271303	276426	The reason I lied, if I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what you're trying to do.
276766	278107	How long have you been feeding this thing?
278688	279268	Six years.
280208	281609	Six years?
283350	285812	Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.
287453	288934	So we threw it some scraps.
289094	290595	Well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.
290615	293497	He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.
293817	294437	He just appeared.
294457	295978	You have no idea how he arrived here.
296718	297299	No, do you?
298960	302441	Your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded?
303502	305402	If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
306003	306603	There you go.
306963	308944	If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.
309364	310424	That's why Betty White is awesome.
310444	310904	I love her.
310924	311885	Yes, amazing.
313245	315846	Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.
316486	319527	It was a really corny-ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.
320308	320568	Of course.
321648	323008	Anyhow, let's see.
323869	327949	Yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our chat room.
328309	329570	We're going to do a little bit of a short show.
329590	332470	We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle.
332550	335411	We're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.
335471	335811	Don't worry.
336071	337271	We're still going to take calls at the end.
337291	338772	We're still going to do all your favorite segments.
339132	341932	We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one.
342372	346553	It's just the two of us, and with everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what?
346873	348994	Let's have this be a minimum day.
349494	352376	Remember those in school, you'd have a minimum day so the teachers could get service?
352396	353316	We never had such a thing.
353336	353416	Huh?
353456	354417	We didn't have minimum days.
354917	355177	Really?
355237	356398	We had minimum days here all the time.
356418	357258	We had teacher work days.
357618	357939	Oh, okay.
358079	358779	It's similar.
359139	362041	But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?
362441	363282	That would be all of us.
364042	364862	But the teachers did.
365343	366183	The teachers did.
366303	369705	We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.
369925	370525	So there you go.
370726	373267	Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell you.
373598	376499	Dude, Spazinator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.
377099	377759	That's no good.
377779	382240	I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.
384180	384500	Wow.
384840	385680	It's Mystique!
386380	386600	Mystique!
386620	388541	Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?
388561	389661	Come in and introduce yourself.
390681	391721	Oh God, I love Mystique.
391761	392561	I'm so happy she's here.
392581	394202	Hold on, we gotta get her hooked up.
394262	394842	Live radio, folks.
394862	395722	I am the goddamn Batman.
397462	398082	That she is.
398582	399883	Why are you the goddamn Batman?
399903	402323	Which, by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts that they have anywhere.
404994	405774	Because I'm awesome.
407715	408636	What more do you need?
408876	409316	I'm awesome.
411017	412497	That and she's got a batarang in her pants.
414318	414738	Okay, there.
414758	416419	I've got you your own mic now, so there you go.
416579	417200	Sweet.
417420	419521	So, what are you up to these days, Mystique?
419541	420461	What have you been playing?
420481	421802	Are you playing video games these days?
421822	422362	What are you playing?
423102	425924	Of course she is, because she just got the thing.
427404	428265	Tell them what you got.
428805	429285	I got what?
429305	430085	Batman.
430426	430826	Batman.
431614	435196	Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum because that game was awesome.
435256	436097	But the new one's coming out.
436617	437017	I know.
438218	440059	It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.
441200	441600	Like, now.
442120	443181	Because it's goddamn Batman.
443401	444561	Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman.
445242	446042	And the goddamn Joker.
447203	448664	See, it's not about Batman for her.
448684	449704	It's about Joker.
449764	453246	It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.
453526	455167	Ooh, what you got against Heath Ledger?
455247	456108	It's Oscar night.
456545	457305	I don't care.
457746	459226	Betty White's winning everything, by the way.
460187	463509	We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.
464289	465090	Unless Betty White did it.
465530	466510	Betty White is pretty awesome.
466530	467211	Yeah, that's right.
467231	471113	Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there you go.
471413	472634	She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.
473494	478457	She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like... I can totally see that shit.
479858	481118	Betty White is hardcore.
481518	484040	And of course the next game coming out is Betty White vs. Capcom.
485516	487057	I would totally play that game.
487517	491579	She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman and this is what she said in response.
491599	491939	There you go.
503092	503773	Alright, anyhow.
504594	508618	I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one of those.
509039	510100	I do wish I had a dick.
510560	511381	It would be awesome.
511582	511882	Why?
512362	517588	Because then, I could pee wherever I was, and It doesn't quite work like that.
517648	518109	Hold on.
518790	523415	And, when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over them.
524756	526118	Can't you kind of do that now?
527219	527920	It's messier.
528100	530604	It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.
530664	531184	All right, look.
531204	533147	There's a lot of work.
533407	539755	Oh, look, the listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.
539855	542078	I told them about you in Wild Chat last night, by the way.
542759	543880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
566131	568854	So now I've gone broke leveling jewel crafting.
569614	573218	Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.
573498	575660	Just because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.
576120	578522	Holy shit, she's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.
578622	580104	He's in the game, Harrison Jones.
580704	581365	Shut the hell up.
581785	584447	And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.
585088	585568	Sweet.
585809	586069	Yes.
586449	587430	You've got to have a short round.
587690	588671	Yeah.
589272	589892	Oh, he's awesome.
589912	591394	I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.
591414	591714	But anyway.
593103	597807	You just need to play for Harrison Jones because that's what it's all about is the whole archaeology thing in Oldham.
597827	598847	So cool.
599848	603130	But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.
603931	604792	I just call her my puppy.
605292	612137	I still hate dungeons on my puppy because people don't know what a freaking tank is apparently if you're lower than level 20.
612918	614319	But tanks run over people.
615179	618382	And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.
618902	619803	I wish I had a tank.
620600	621780	I want a tank for real life.
621800	622361	Wouldn't it be cool?
622701	625442	It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.
626102	626762	That would be pretty awesome.
626782	629403	You had your party and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.
630423	631304	I'm Teflon.
631964	633044	I'm rubber, you're glue.
633404	635445	And you would always be able to find a parking spot.
636185	640887	And then you had like your healer who would basically go around going, it's okay, don't worry about it.
641537	642638	You're going to be just fine.
642678	643418	They're idiots.
643438	644038	They're bitches.
644518	648100	And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.
648660	650301	Bitch, I heard what you just said!
652582	653563	It's on now.
653923	654383	Bring it.
654823	656624	See, that would be World of Warcraft for high school.
658565	659766	I just put it on my Facebook.
659986	662307	Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.
662327	663547	Just want to point that out.
663567	664548	You're missed a lot.
665648	666689	Yeah, but our aim's improving.
669773	671154	I've made Misty laugh.
672235	672996	Laughing is fun.
673316	673857	I had liquor.
674237	674577	Want some?
674778	676379	If it's not obvious.
676619	678541	What are you talking about?
678561	679342	She's always like this.
680122	681524	But I'm extra like this.
681944	685147	Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?
686046	686767	Betty White, The RPG
710609	733774	because sometimes you just need pills different colored pills especially the red one is there a particular virus that's like is it the red virus or the yellow virus she has the G virus so if she doesn't have her pills she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains because brains taste good itchy tasty itchy tasty
734674	739420	So, Dr. Mario, wait, actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.
739921	741262	Music type A or B?
741946	745148	Music type B. B for bitchin'.
745409	745729	Yes.
746610	748311	Because I like to kick it old school.
750132	750312	What?
750612	752034	You just made a song pop into my head.
752234	752534	What's that?
752594	753495	A Dead Milkman song.
753515	756537	It's a bitchin' Camaro.
756777	758338	Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.
758478	759479	I ran over my mother.
760700	761681	I love that song.
762882	765564	I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.
767882	773187	Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, Dark Tatuya says, Rob, I think the women just hijacked the show.
773207	774068	You know, I think you're right.
775449	776991	Yay, estrogen!
777331	777471	Woo!
778292	779674	Oh my God, help me.
781121	782261	We got this!
782522	784643	The powers of the jubbles compel you.
784663	788564	The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.
788644	789945	My hair is already braided.
789965	791646	Misty pays someone to do hers, so.
793206	795667	I just flat iron mine, you know, with an iron.
795927	799169	I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.
799409	801970	You've got like a Red X-13 thing going on there.
802367	802787	DarkSakura.com
822535	823918	Because he likes to kill people.
824820	827005	She also likes Prince for similar reasons.
827446	827947	Exactly.
828308	829671	Prince likes to kill people too.
831214	833299	This is our new album artist Mystique Shoes.
834736	835036	Awesome.
835516	836877	All right, I'll talk about my gaming week.
838137	840778	I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.
841378	848661	I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know when I say that, there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh, God, the iPhone.
848981	851341	I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.
851922	853302	It's adorable and cute.
853622	855443	And the new game, Jump the Shark.
856952	858234	Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?
858254	858734	I don't know.
858754	860016	There probably is somewhere.
860556	860817	All right.
860837	863580	There's an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.
863620	864681	Oh, Mystique has left the building.
864801	865082	All right.
865262	867905	Well, everybody calm down.
867965	868486	It'll be okay.
869405	871346	And then, what else have I played this week?
872406	882749	I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.
883150	885490	Although, I don't think this was developed by PopCap.
885770	890352	I mean, I think it was in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come up when I started the game.
890832	894593	And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this right off the bat.
894693	896134	It just didn't have that same...
897074	897774	Polish.
898315	899795	And I don't know how else to say this.
900135	908259	And I know I'm sounding really harsh, but when I go in there, especially with the graphics, the graphics do not have that same polish that I have seen in the other PopCap games.
908379	909140	And it's buffing.
909800	912041	And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished.
912081	912421	I don't know.
912801	914202	But yeah, I...
914662	916063	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
941698	942058	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
971653	972173	Thanks for watching!
992006	993187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1009578	1018705	I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.
1018765	1024569	But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit and then go back to the one on Facebook if you really want to play Bejeweled.
1024709	1029553	Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while when you can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.
1030173	1033176	It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation.
1033316	1034056	It's kind of a bummer.
1034437	1037279	And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.
1037819	1038119	Maybe.
1038479	1040720	They probably just kind of let somebody else do it.
1040960	1042041	Yikes.
1042401	1044121	They're going to give us how much money for this game?
1044601	1045562	Outsource this scrap.
1045782	1049123	It's $10 if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1049623	1054085	But there's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.
1054265	1056926	Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.
1057166	1060047	Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight.
1060607	1061308	on Xbox Live.
1061629	1062930	I am so curious to see.
1063030	1072181	Speaking of a game that feels very, you know, one way on the PC, I'm really curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller because apparently they changed quite a bit.
1072642	1074264	So I'll definitely be checking that out.
1074284	1075886	I think that's the 15th that that comes out.
1075986	1077528	So I'll be looking at that.
1079491	1103322	And that does it for my gaming week So let's move on And go over some housekeeping real quick Not a whole lot I just want to mention of course our Twitter Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio And of course you can follow Orange Lounge Radio on Facebook as well And if you like Orange Lounge Radio And you like all this craziness and zaniness That we bring you every week That's sometimes very random as it was tonight I just found out something Rob What's that?
1103342	1107844	You mentioning PopCap made me want to check for Peggle on Steam Peggle Extreme is free
1109724	1110585	DarkSakura.com
1131485	1134526	We really, really do appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave us a nice review.
1134806	1136267	And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.
1136327	1139228	I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot pole.
1139548	1143590	Wherever it is that you can read about podcasts, if you can leave a nice review for us, that'd be awesome.
1144346	1146928	All right, let's move on to some gaming news.
1146948	1148009	Let's get into the news tonight.
1148029	1150351	We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.
1150811	1152913	The 3DS did launch in Japan.
1153633	1160619	It did make its release date, and I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining up for it.
1161299	1163161	There were extras left over.
1163221	1164782	You didn't have to pre-order it.
1164822	1167484	They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.
1167824	1170306	However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units arrived
1171147	1171687	DarkSakura.com
1190061	1207213	Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the numbers come out, but people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.
1207733	1209754	Did Professor Layton make launch over here?
1209794	1210495	I'm not sure it did.
1210795	1211756	I don't recall.
1211836	1212597	I think it might have been.
1212797	1214939	The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.
1215079	1215279	Yeah.
1215439	1215659	Oh, yeah.
1215680	1216680	They definitely have their audience.
1217181	1219803	But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.
1219863	1223667	And honestly, Nintendogs, I think it's going to be a huge one for Nintendo.
1223707	1229171	Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast, but kids...
1230333	1234357	Between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using the 3DS?
1234397	1240644	Maybe like 6, 7, on up through like 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and Cats.
1240824	1243106	And I think even some adults will be too.
1243146	1246070	And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.
1247271	1248532	Big sucker.
1249053	1249654	So there you go.
1250595	1265737	uh yeah so it's sold out now in Japan so if you didn't already import this thing you might have a hard time you're gonna have to wait for the next shipment but it does sound like it's a successful launch over there now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out but I guess we'll just have to wait until E3
1266573	1274415	Yeah, well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
1275675	1276895	And they're pushing it.
1277615	1278135	So, hey.
1279836	1281936	But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?
1282396	1283556	Yay, I love naughty things.
1284057	1284477	Naughty.
1284577	1285937	Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?
1286177	1287417	Because she's pretty naughty too.
1288457	1289298	A little randy.
1289318	1289878	Oh, okay.
1290318	1290718	Raunchy.
1290738	1291398	A little sassy.
1292455	1292835	We Dare
1314905	1321254	Well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snugging your controller and getting naked.
1321996	1322276	What?
1322597	1323418	Well, at least in your underwear.
1324335	1324715	Okay, wait.
1324815	1325956	Is this the trailer here?
1326076	1326696	Can I watch this?
1326736	1329997	Or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound to Europe?
1330537	1333918	Or is this going to work?
1333938	1338160	Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.
1339040	1340100	This is a really slow site.
1340120	1341421	Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.
1341961	1342761	We're going to go to YouTube.
1343802	1344342	I want to see this.
1344402	1347763	I literally have not... I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.
1348251	1350873	Well, I'm going to pull up the... So it's like truth or dare?
1351513	1354976	Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.
1357037	1360180	Wow, it's $16.99 over there.
1361861	1363722	Okay, wait, here we go, here we go.
1363742	1364262	I got a trailer.
1364322	1364903	Here we go.
1370959	1383239	Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background Well, the cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels Wow, hold on, hold on
1391294	1411286	Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple and the two of them are eating it and somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like... It's a little bit... I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.
1411326	1412526	You see my friend...
1413647	1413827	Wow.
1413847	1423873	So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the back of her pants, and now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.
1435989	1440912	And now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.
1441693	1443273	And of course the chicks get to spank each other.
1443294	1443534	Yeah.
1443614	1444034	Of course.
1444134	1445335	And now there's a pole dancing one.
1445355	1445435	No.
1464659	1465160	Wow.
1465400	1471451	Wow.
1472893	1474255	Okay, I want someone to get that for me.
1475629	1476350	Here's the thing.
1476870	1477671	I'll send you candy.
1478031	1484216	Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that, to be honest, now what's the uproar about this?
1484256	1489239	They're worried that kids would play this because it's a Wii game and, you know, the target audience is usually kids?
1489319	1492162	Because people over here have the big anal stick.
1492322	1493222	Okay, here's the thing.
1493342	1496065	I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.
1496425	1499087	Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.
1499687	1500048	Yeah.
1500168	1502249	Like, remember two minutes in the closet?
1502910	1503750	Spin the bottle.
1504671	1506713	What do you mean when you were 12?
1506913	1509816	I was at a party five years ago where you were playing Spill the Bottle.
1511798	1518985	Well, you kind of diffused the point I was about to make because I was going to say, now you're trying to tell me that a bunch of 20-year-olds are going to play these same games that we played when we were 12?
1519125	1519406	Yes.
1519606	1520427	Look, we were drunk.
1520527	1521307	Okay, that's all I'm saying.
1521828	1523249	I don't need a Wii to help me with that.
1524450	1525011	You know what I mean?
1525031	1526913	I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.
1527651	1528754	It's a fun idea.
1528894	1533145	I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh, the Americans are going to preach at us.
1533606	1535450	They're going to send Jesus on us.
1537003	1537824	Well, no.
1538064	1542487	It's a little silly that the game can't come out here.
1542507	1546229	Gripper01 says it's 16 quid cheap, by the way.
1546289	1552673	Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says, not for kids.
1553393	1557696	And then, honestly, it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.
1557716	1561138	Because people here don't give a shit.
1561799	1563220	They don't read the box.
1563800	1564801	The kids read the box.
1564841	1565942	Their parents don't read the box.
1565962	1569646	They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.
1569986	1570587	And guess what?
1571428	1571588	No.
1572989	1573990	And then they get all mad.
1574791	1579095	Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.
1580176	1583679	Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?
1584660	1585141	Hi.
1585161	1585201	Hi.
1587529	1598581	so I guess it's just do your damn job you could import it I guess if you really want it I will send a bunch of American candy will this come out in Canada?
1599122	1599462	I wonder
1600290	1600770	I do like booze a lot
1627962	1629103	Is there a beer land?
1629203	1631585	Is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?
1632146	1632566	Probably not.
1632886	1635568	Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.
1635609	1643835	There's a brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections in it.
1644236	1645056	This is legitimate.
1645076	1646317	This is not like a trolling thing.
1646337	1648619	There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.
1648679	1650240	By the way, not coming out in Canada.
1650260	1650901	It's not on their list.
1651423	1657148	Joyland, World of Legend, Mole's World, The Island of Mystery, Universe of Starcraft, and Terrain of Warcraft
1668379	1669000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1684298	1685599	This actually looks really cool.
1686439	1700645	It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.
1701446	1709029	Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment, but of course, I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.
1709049	1710750	We wish we thought of this first.
1711090	1713791	Well, that's kind of what I was getting to, is that a lot of people...
1714431	1717132	You've seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.
1717152	1718933	A lot of people think this is a cool idea.
1719373	1726316	So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest in something like this?
1726817	1729038	Like, for real, why don't we have a video game theme park?
1729058	1730798	We've got a Harry Potter park too late.
1731719	1732139	Why not?
1732939	1741083	Do you think that maybe the audience is just not... I mean, for a World of Warcraft-themed land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?
1742401	1742961	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1766246	1766506	Yeah.
1766747	1766827	Yeah.
1785646	1788228	Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.
1788769	1789590	It's actually really cool.
1789610	1791311	It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly.
1791371	1795094	But it's just basically a little disc-oriented roller coaster.
1795114	1796576	It really has nothing to do with the damn show.
1796616	1797997	You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.
1798598	1799318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1822551	1828676	Great America, being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?
1830816	1832277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1852367	1861349	DemandGameNation.com The first experimental video game theme park and resort In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.
1877056	1893247	uh visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet to be told so in the next 12 months they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the park dude I'm telling you just take something existing that needs the help seriously
1895580	1897521	But I'm glad at least some people are already on it.
1897541	1900543	But that's a monumental undertaking.
1900583	1902464	That's going to take a lot of money and investments.
1902784	1904345	And you're right, Jamie.
1904385	1908668	Theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.
1908728	1910629	In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.
1911089	1915552	So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park that's already there.
1915972	1918073	Buy an old one out and do your thing.
1918333	1919254	Reimagine the rides.
1919997	1920537	Exactly.
1920837	1924059	And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.
1924459	1928401	Don't build it in South Dakota.
1928841	1934964	No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but you got what?
1935064	1935905	Mount Rushmore?
1936025	1936825	I'm in Delaware.
1938386	1939066	So you know what I mean.
1939106	1940727	You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.
1942184	1945186	TigerClaw on chat says, you know, we need an Orange Lounge Radio theme park.
1945586	1949028	You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.
1950309	1954432	Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.
1955172	1956933	Maybe we could get a little corner of a room.
1957354	1959095	The Orange Lounge Radio booth.
1959595	1960996	That would probably be the best we could do.
1962777	1964519	Actually, we probably wouldn't even have a booth.
1965019	1967040	We'd probably just be outside the front door.
1967260	1967741	Exactly.
1967981	1968801	It's cold.
1968982	1969922	We're so cold.
1970022	1970723	Let us in.
1972011	1972431	That'll be us.
2000191	2001872	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
2002892	2023500	Yeah, well, how about something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal 2, well, the German PlayStation blog was told that it completely supports the move, but it's not fully integrated yet.
2023720	2025341	Actually, Valve's like, no.
2026121	2028783	No.
2029183	2031845	It was mistranslated from the English to the German.
2032345	2037429	And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.
2038489	2039270	So, nope.
2039690	2044113	They say that for the PC, it will support the Hydra controller.
2046154	2051358	And that it's going to support the regular console controllers, but no move.
2051778	2055801	It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows?
2057042	2058264	We don't know that it'll make the game better.
2059105	2062850	There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.
2066415	2072684	They said, though, for the Hydra that they actually invented puzzles specifically for how the Hydra would work.
2074477	2075457	So, no move.
2076478	2076798	Oops.
2078238	2078578	Nine.
2080239	2084700	I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the move in.
2085160	2095903	Because, you know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the ASPC version.
2096183	2097343	Do Host 9 move?
2097623	2099384	I love our chat room I love our chat room Oh boy
2126002	2128024	All right, let's travel the world and check out some release dates.
2128084	2133988	Things that are actually happening near you at a local game store near you.
2134049	2135370	Coming out this week in the U.S.
2135470	2136711	Since Loki's not here, I'll do the U.S.
2136751	2137311	dates real quick.
2137571	2138532	Do it in the Loki voice.
2138552	2140534	What's the Loki voice?
2140554	2141995	We got some stuff coming out.
2143776	2144617	This game's coming out.
2144657	2145658	It's probably going to suck.
2147159	2148620	And some shit on PlayStation 3.
2148660	2149321	God damn you, Nintendo.
2149341	2150021	God damn you.
2150422	2152403	God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.
2152443	2153244	Who's going to play that?
2156685	2159607	March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.
2159947	2160948	Is that a movie or something?
2161528	2162688	Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.
2162708	2164810	I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.
2164890	2166370	That is coming out on March 1st.
2166751	2168111	I believe some people already have it.
2168131	2170252	If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.
2170272	2172634	The official release date for the game is March 1st.
2172654	2173634	This is a new MMO.
2174375	2177116	Some people are saying it's the WoW killer, but I hate that term.
2177436	2178377	It's not the WoW killer.
2178637	2179977	The only WoW killer is WoW.
2180298	2180978	Like the Remnant Empire.
2181246	2182507	Yep.
2182567	2185650	Disgaea, The Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.
2186690	2189993	More versions of Rango on other systems including Xbox 360, blah, blah, blah.
2190413	2192655	A brand new racing wheel if you're so inclined.
2192775	2194997	You need one for your PC.
2195037	2197139	You can get a $300 racing wheel.
2197199	2197919	Should I show that to Dan?
2199000	2201803	Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.
2202223	2205005	And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.
2205606	2209108	For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.
2211400	2212422	Let's see if there's anything else here.
2212442	2214125	I know people who really, really like Mahjong.
2214145	2215226	Well, it's party time.
2215647	2218632	Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3.
2218672	2220295	Oh, that's a pretty big one there.
2220315	2221416	Sounds like life at my house.
2221436	2224101	Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.
2227170	2228791	That's coming out.
2229451	2231712	And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.
2232032	2234954	Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.
2235434	2235854	Really?
2236835	2238716	What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?
2238796	2240056	Is it dodging bullets?
2241097	2243578	And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?
2244419	2247820	Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters?
2248220	2252122	I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things that happen at Chuck E. Cheese.
2252463	2255284	But let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take my child.
2255695	2256535	No, no.
2257575	2259716	Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.
2259976	2260456	Yes, it was.
2260476	2261816	But now it's a dangerous place.
2262396	2267177	Now it's a frightening place loaded with bad food and unwashed children.
2269878	2273499	Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
2274679	2276779	And let's see if there's anything else here I want to mention.
2277420	2279860	Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.
2279900	2282041	If you're a fan of that crappy game show.
2282321	2283521	I've never heard of that one, Rob.
2283541	2284021	What is that?
2285501	2292585	It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 50 years old and it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.
2292605	2293185	He's such a bro.
2293806	2294146	He is.
2294226	2300510	He's a dude bro and he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw ping pong balls into cups.
2301010	2303091	Like, it's the weirdest... That's bizarre.
2303271	2304152	It's like, you know...
2305152	2314119	The budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.
2315000	2317982	We made this game out of the dollar store.
2318763	2319904	So here's the deal, guys.
2322006	2327410	If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version or...
2329304	2339146	or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.
2339686	2344347	Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.
2347088	2347628	Ah, shitty.
2351229	2353629	I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.
2353669	2355650	People are tarred.
2357680	2359482	and folks in chat room speaking up there.
2359502	2362004	Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's from the Food Network.
2362024	2363025	Yes, that's his name, Guy.
2363325	2364426	I think he owns a joint.
2364506	2367188	Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?
2367429	2368269	I have no idea.
2368410	2369190	It's Guy Fieri.
2369611	2372173	Yeah, I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.
2372193	2373454	There's one of those out in Roseville.
2374135	2374635	Overpriced.
2375436	2375616	Yeah.
2375696	2376196	Overrated.
2378879	2382182	Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.
2384060	2387203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2401095	2401635	and DarkSakura.com.
2431232	2432893	I want the fat British woman to cook my food.
2433733	2434914	Except I think one of them died.
2435354	2436635	Can I do Japanese releases, please?
2436655	2437155	Yeah, I guess.
2437235	2444659	Alright, coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and Hokuto Musou get price reductions because they go into the Platinum Collections.
2445019	2448581	Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.
2448961	2452463	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.
2452563	2452783	Yep.
2453063	2456925	They also get Samurai Dō 4 comes out there from Spike.
2457686	2459748	Thanks for watching!
2474087	2478190	I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can do with them.
2479250	2481212	On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.
2481292	2482292	It's the Nintendo Wii.
2482352	2483573	There's nothing coming out for it.
2484254	2487616	On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.
2488196	2492619	On the 3DS, Shanghai 3D Cube and Super Monkey Ball 3D come out this week.
2492699	2493620	More Mahjong.
2493900	2494620	More Mahjong.
2494660	2495161	That's right.
2495601	2500964	Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.
2501144	2501605	No one care.
2502726	2510332	On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Shroce Wars Red and Blue.
2510712	2511973	Digimon, DarkSakura?
2512013	2513735	You were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.
2514496	2515376	Oh, I liked the anime.
2516197	2517278	And then you don't like the games?
2518010	2545319	I had a Digimon lastly on the PSP this is a huge huge release probably the biggest release of the week Dissida 012 Duodesim Final Fantasy that's right the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP so I'm sure there'll be a lot of folks into that alright how about the UK well for the UK we do have some interesting news this is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom okay actually on the first we have Fable 3 again
2548243	2550145	Fable 3 was kind of crap.
2550746	2551727	We have Two Worlds 2.
2552688	2554810	We have Beyond Good and Evil HD.
2556832	2557953	That one's on the second, by the way.
2558073	2568364	On the fourth, we have Fight Night Champion, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black, Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.
2570481	2571421	It wasn't that bad.
2572222	2573762	Rift was interesting, but I don't know.
2574063	2575683	I can't pay for another MMO right now.
2575703	2577264	I got too many other expenses to worry about.
2577524	2578585	I can't pay for them either.
2578785	2578965	Yeah.
2579465	2580706	So that's it.
2581026	2581386	That's it.
2581526	2581826	All right.
2582206	2584207	Then let's move on to some rapid fire news.
2584227	2586368	We're going to go over some news very quickly here.
2586788	2589209	By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in.
2589229	2590890	We're going to be doing Twitter topics in just a moment.
2591230	2594071	So get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
2594091	2596292	We're going to be doing those in just a minute.
2596593	2599454	But first, I'm going to start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.
2600554	2624211	Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live And it's getting a lot of good reception out there It's also on the PC and so forth Dragon Age 2 is going to be coming out very soon And they have announced that there's going to be a theme song in the game By Florence and the Machine Who's a pretty popular band these days They were really indie for a while And then she did the Dog Days Are Over thing at the MTV Awards And it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere
2624811	2626132	Anyway, she's really awesome, actually.
2626332	2633056	And a song from the album Lungs called I'm Not Calling You a Liar is being reimagined.
2633356	2637838	So it's going to be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.
2638178	2641000	Here's the original if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.
2641040	2645822	There's a ghost in my lungs and it soars in my soul.
2656397	2657378	So you kind of get the idea.
2657418	2658839	They'll rework that song a little bit.
2658879	2661520	It's not going to sound just like that, but that's going to be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.
2662601	2664342	Some websites shut down this week.
2664362	2665783	Some community-based websites.
2666383	2675889	As you probably heard about before on the show before us, Bobby Blackwolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360 and unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.
2676689	2681533	MyGamerCard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this week.
2681613	2684234	So we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.
2684535	2687577	The story behind MyGamerCard.net, though, a little more dramatic.
2689358	2705128	The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site saying, quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community stuff that has been going on has stagnated and even used the term lack of respect.
2705749	2705929	Ouch.
2706329	2707270	She's great
2722350	2723311	Yeah, she's cool.
2723351	2725812	And it's just different over there now.
2725932	2727974	So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.
2728794	2731876	I wonder if this will service a wake-up call to Microsoft.
2731936	2734498	Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.
2734958	2738900	I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this or if they just don't care.
2739641	2741622	It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.
2741822	2745885	Because a lot of people were using that gamer card service, you know, on their websites.
2745925	2747986	And I even had it on my LiveJournal.
2748306	2748546	EveryAir.com
2763465	2764446	DarkSakura.com
2780976	2781857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2796795	2797696	Thanks for watching!
2819439	2846988	gotta be honest this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical but they do show some video of this thing running there's a whole little YouTube there let's see if we can get past the animation there and get to this thing actually working yeah there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone starting it up so I don't know though that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod it doesn't I don't know
2848174	2851918	But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.
2852058	2852699	Why do it?
2852799	2853940	Because we can.
2854260	2854741	Exactly.
2854881	2856583	We do what we must because we can.
2856763	2857343	Absolutely.
2857704	2858144	So there you go.
2860316	2861797	Well, how about some other news, Rob?
2863017	2869060	First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP is going to be having a price drop.
2869100	2871121	It's going to go down to $130.
2872202	2878785	So I wonder if that's preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory for the new thingies coming out.
2878985	2882307	But they've been slashing them, so now it's actually somewhat affordable.
2883508	2884188	Who knows, right?
2886175	2888457	and other happy, happy, happy news.
2888817	2892239	The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.
2893020	2896602	We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time.
2897743	2899284	Older than a lot of our listeners.
2900505	2905108	And of course we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out.
2905469	2907410	Hopefully before too long.
2908411	2910812	And pretty cool stuff.
2911793	2913514	Rob, did you start off with the first one?
2914755	2915176	Which one?
2915316	2915636	I'm sorry.
2916055	2917256	The first Legend of Zelda.
2917456	2918557	Oh yeah, oh gosh yes.
2918957	2920699	Of course, that was my very first Zelda game.
2920739	2922000	I remember playing that in the fourth grade.
2922020	2924421	That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
2924942	2926023	Fantastic game.
2926143	2930466	Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old because that means I'm old.
2931527	2931707	No.
2932768	2937772	And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.
2938392	2942215	Actually it's done by Projector Games and it's called...
2945461	2946942	Well, I just had Fortress Craft.
2947683	2952086	There's a Twitter for it and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.
2952146	2955028	Chapter 1 is Minecraft Creative.
2955488	2956989	Chapter 2 is Crafting.
2957349	2957930	3 is Life.
2958670	2959371	4 is Machinery.
2959831	2960492	5 is Minions.
2960512	2961592	6 is PvP.
2962573	2964074	7 is Fortress Assault Mode.
2964795	2968817	So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.
2969438	2970078	March 4th.
2970098	2972140	80 bucks.
2974001	2975142	Beware the Ides of March.
2976336	2977197	That's not the fourth, is it?
2977737	2978057	Whatever.
2978537	2978917	Not yet.
2979277	2979598	So yeah.
2981058	2985460	Alright, let's go to the Twitter and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent us tonight.
2986821	2987601	Which isn't a lot.
2990442	2991883	The tweets are looking very thin tonight.
2991903	2993724	It must be because everybody's tweeting about the Oscars.
2993784	2994144	I don't know.
2994644	2995565	They're watching Betty White.
2996025	2996425	I guess.
2997546	2997986	Let's see.
2998146	3002648	Going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played pinball yesterday.
3003604	3004145	Oh, that's sweet.
3004165	3005346	What's going on in the football world?
3006047	3008790	Um, Pentegogo's coming up, I think, next month.
3009551	3010593	Pentegogo's that big convention?
3010673	3011574	Is that the one in Dixon?
3011594	3012595	I think it's the one in Dixon.
3012635	3013116	Oh, God.
3013556	3015519	But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.
3015888	3016428	Oh, that's good.
3017149	3017549	That'll be good.
3017589	3019409	Last year was still too hot.
3020090	3022411	Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?
3022631	3023751	Whatever Stern's put out.
3024431	3026852	Oh, yeah, they had a Dark Knight table.
3027012	3029533	Yeah, Stern's the only one doing anything.
3029854	3032575	The last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.
3033395	3033655	Oh, wow.
3033835	3035376	And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.
3038235	3043959	Uh, let's see, uh, FlamingToilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3044059	3046740	It is actually Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3047241	3047701	There you go.
3048662	3051623	Uh, Tigerclaw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.
3051643	3054225	Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.
3054545	3060148	Apparently Take-Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.
3060668	3071454	They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net, and HammersteinFaust.com.
3072835	3077060	People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand Theft Auto.
3077400	3079562	It is Take-Two that actually registered these domains.
3079582	3081284	They're not just like random things out of the blue.
3081724	3089692	So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.
3090292	3090733	We'll see.
3091774	3093415	It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.
3093876	3094757	I'm looking, I'm looking.
3097609	3106842	Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.
3107202	3112730	You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject, but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI.
3113371	3114953	which closed their doors last night.
3115154	3117317	Saturday was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.
3117757	3118839	So there was a bunch of people there.
3119019	3121402	Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?
3121623	3121863	Yeah.
3121883	3122524	Kind of creepster.
3122985	3129794	But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown Fair did actually close.
3130695	3130975	Sad.
3131395	3133436	Supposedly, though, there is some hope.
3133936	3137877	It does sound like they're going to move to an unspecified location in Williamsburg.
3138337	3140878	So perhaps it's not gone forever.
3141418	3142899	It will just be in a new place.
3143399	3145439	I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.
3145459	3145759	Look at that.
3145779	3147760	They have little sit-down Super Street Fighter machines.
3148740	3149601	Last call was at 12.45 a.m.
3152162	3152542	Aw.
3153002	3153563	Bye, guys.
3154063	3154424	Good luck.
3155404	3157166	I'm always sad to see more arcades close.
3158167	3158507	All right.
3159148	3160489	One last tweet for you guys here.
3160529	3161950	This is from Tigerclaw.
3162911	3166094	It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.
3167015	3177544	Yeah, it's some type of... It's called Fabricate Yourself, and it uses 3D models that the Kinect captures to make 3D printed figures.
3178945	3179445	Interesting.
3180466	3184850	They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction Conference.
3185270	3192676	They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect, and then they got turned into big, giant puzzle pieces.
3193376	3200382	So all these people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces, and I can't really explain this on the radio.
3200782	3201182	But I don't know.
3201202	3202683	They looked like little bars of soap.
3202703	3203184	Right.
3203544	3205265	with raised imprints of people.
3205566	3214552	But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to, I guess, you know, do that really cheap, I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline a body real quick with that.
3214712	3216133	So that's pretty cool.
3216173	3216994	Rob, breaking news.
3217334	3217654	What's that?
3218014	3220036	JCPenney has a new logo and it's shitty.
3221357	3221937	Who cares?
3222618	3223138	I care.
3224699	3224999	All right.
3225500	3227301	That's it for the tweets tonight.
3227801	3230523	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.
3231123	3231464	Meanwhile...
3234275	3235077	What were they thinking?
3235579	3236943	Remember it's a video game show.
3237124	3237565	I care.
3237605	3238187	I'm a designer.
3238488	3238749	I care.
3238769	3239009	All right.
3239511	3239992	Moving on.
3240695	3242059	And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.
3245451	3249133	More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.
3249494	3254676	This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed down the franchises, they were done for good.
3254736	3261540	In fact, the official Twitter feeds at one time said there's not going to be any more content, but they have changed course this week.
3261980	3266623	Both series said on their Twitter feeds that continued support...
3267183	3289456	from the communities have announced a change they will be doing more DLC for both franchises now we don't usually see weekly content in these games it's usually more of a monthly thing but it's still kind of exciting that there'll be something else especially because that whole pendulum pack went to DJ Hero last time that was a pretty awesome pack so more information coming
3290131	3290611	Soon.
3291251	3292592	And of course, that's all we know.
3293012	3293412	Soon.
3293432	3293592	Soon.
3293612	3294293	Tempting us.
3294813	3295093	I know.
3295653	3301936	Well, you know, Telltale, they're a company that we're pretty big fans of.
3302836	3306557	Well, they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and were told no.
3307618	3316041	The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley, said, he put it on his Twitter, that they approached him, but he did not want it to be an adventure game.
3316121	3318242	He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was.
3320896	3321577	Pretty sad, though.
3321797	3322777	I think they could have done both.
3324258	3329581	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so hot.
3330262	3341068	So, I mean, maybe, well, I don't want to say a better game, because the game that came out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole 8-bit throwback kind of way, and it's pretty great.
3341448	3345170	But, I mean, another game wouldn't have, I think, hurt things.
3345510	3353173	But maybe, and it's hard to tell from this story, but maybe Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up ultimately happening.
3353193	3356034	I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.
3356074	3357695	I mean, this could have been years ago.
3358035	3360496	We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.
3361317	3370461	So, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about The Walking Dead having its comic book being adapted, even though it happens to be a TV show now.
3370801	3373222	And then there was The Fable, the...
3374844	3375985	The fairy tales and all that.
3376005	3376345	Yeah, fables.
3376665	3377565	The adult ones.
3377725	3377945	Yeah.
3378006	3379406	That's being translated as well.
3379466	3383748	So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.
3383768	3386229	So Scott Pilgrim, of course, was a comic book before it was a movie.
3386530	3386730	Yeah.
3386750	3388010	That would have been great.
3388110	3389051	Yeah, it would have been great.
3389091	3392152	But, I mean, what came out was fine.
3392292	3392492	Yeah.
3392672	3393493	It was better than fine.
3393533	3393973	It was great.
3394233	3394733	Yeah.
3394793	3398955	But it would have been nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably could have been pretty awesome too.
3399115	3399676	Oh, yeah.
3399816	3400076	Who knows?
3402478	3406560	Blockbuster is going to be selling off its assets which are valued at $290 million.
3432494	3459242	so they're going to be fielding offers I guess $290 million is the starting point there and they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago so this isn't really surprising we've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time that was in September of 2010 so what happens from here I'm not sure I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take over from there or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything
3459702	3469337	Which could be, especially if there isn't a buyer They'll probably end up having to do that It's really not surprising They're probably going to go away
3470270	3477072	I think that's what a lot of people are expecting to happen, especially in this day and age of Netflix and Amazon.
3477172	3486495	Well, that's the same thing that happened with Hollywood, is they liquidated to try to keep from going into bankruptcy.
3486935	3489075	But it looks like Blockbuster's already in.
3489135	3490656	Yeah, they're going to go bye-bye.
3491396	3491536	Yep.
3493861	3497564	They went to the mail too late in the game.
3497624	3498065	They're gone.
3499166	3502909	It's kind of weird because I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster.
3502929	3505651	So it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood.
3505711	3507633	Now folding and going away forever.
3509254	3511436	But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?
3511476	3512317	I couldn't even tell you.
3512777	3513738	A long time ago.
3514119	3515059	A very long time ago.
3516060	3517221	Are we ready to get to the email bag?
3517461	3519944	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com Let us do such a thing.
3525523	3526163	We have one email.
3527724	3527784	One.
3555732	3563337	While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band-centric games like and such as The Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.
3563818	3572283	Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band, these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special and less awkward.
3572743	3580228	Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy roommate.
3581209	3587399	While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end it makes you wonder if it really added anything besides being quick publicity.
3587820	3591266	It might be fun once or twice, but after a while you stop caring and start to get annoyed by it.
3591727	3593590	Stay black, and get well soon, Loki.
3593650	3594291	Flaming Toilet.
3596976	3604681	I think the emailer is actually really on to something there with the whole... It did become a bit of a carnival of sorts.
3605962	3606942	Carnival of crap.
3607002	3609284	Rock band never kind of went there, you know?
3609704	3611465	I was always able to take rock band more seriously.
3612506	3613067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3633025	3633606	No, I agree.
3633946	3638709	And the whole, like, Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.
3639069	3639329	Yeah.
3639489	3642130	And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.
3642171	3643231	I mean, maybe they're out there.
3643271	3644012	I just don't know them.
3644392	3647213	But I don't think it's that big a deal.
3649335	3652036	So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.
3652096	3652416	I don't know.
3653277	3653577	I don't know.
3655358	3655658	All right.
3656099	3657419	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
3657459	3660141	It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.
3660161	3660241	Pfft.
3675788	3705202	my FU first goes to my tooth which I think I got something caught under it but okay just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me my canines are still my baby teeth so they don't have long roots so things get caught under them really easily and it hurts so yes another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100% about Betty White and Trent Reznor FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White
3707399	3714401	And, um, F you to, uh, being too busy.
3716542	3716802	Done.
3717642	3721623	Um, my F yous of the week, F you to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.
3722324	3723384	F you to his hernia.
3723664	3725004	That's right, F you to his hernia.
3726025	3729226	Uh, and F you to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.
3729846	3733947	Although, I would want every pill in the world if I had just had surgery too, so I feel you.
3734971	3743756	Uh, seriously though, I would say an F you to, um, F you to expenses and how quickly they add up.
3744296	3744777	F you to money.
3746538	3751701	I mean, money's great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be a, well, money can also be kind of a pain in the ass sometimes.
3751921	3752321	Hey, Rob.
3752461	3752741	What's that?
3752801	3755583	I'm gonna offer an anti-F you to Irene because she's hilarious.
3756623	3757144	Why is that?
3758404	3760886	Uh, she, she called you a shirt.
3761046	3762526	Because she's trolling me on Facebook?
3762566	3762827	Yeah.
3762967	3763367	Whatever.
3765613	3766454	It made me laugh.
3766674	3770857	One more story for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.
3771957	3774799	Oh yeah, thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.
3774939	3779042	F you to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.
3779162	3779943	I know, right?
3780083	3784426	Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft Punk is better.
3784586	3785206	Sorry, said it.
3785687	3786107	Buttholes.
3787388	3787608	Anyhow.
3788413	3806778	They're smelly, stinky, crusty buttholes You might have heard that they really made it harder to get into E3 this year If you are an independent journalist and so forth You need X number of hits on your website in order to be able to get in And so a lot of people are not able to go this year Well, guess who's coming to the rescue?
3806878	3809579	Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?
3809759	3812840	Your mom No, but close Kmart
3813920	3814841	Yes, that's right.
3815321	3820924	The home of things from the 1990s is going to be sending folks to E3.
3820985	3822806	The place with the old lady clothes?
3823046	3823246	Yep.
3823786	3824547	So there you go.
3825708	3834013	Kmart is running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky riders to the event, including airfare and hotel.
3834453	3840237	The riders get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on Kmart Gamer.
3841277	3841377	Um...
3842758	3853182	I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on in the media and so forth, with E3 and the crackdown and all that, this kind of pisses me off, actually.
3853442	3853782	Yeah.
3854182	3860984	Is that it's kind of like poo-pooing what was really insulting to a lot of people, I think, that were working very hard.
3861464	3864985	It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest.
3865366	3866486	But it's only three people.
3868487	3871128	Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?
3871728	3874068	But there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.
3874129	3875689	It's only one person or it's only two people.
3876069	3880990	So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a clamped down show?
3881470	3883991	If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.
3884691	3887612	Like, it's just, I'm sorry, but that's kind of how I feel.
3887632	3888972	They probably got permission from the E3 people.
3889473	3892393	And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of insulting.
3892413	3893634	And then paid them a bunch of money.
3894314	3894834	That's just me.
3895936	3896836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3920251	3920912	Oh, oh, sorry.
3921352	3922113	Did I say that out loud?
3922153	3922493	My bad.
3923414	3925476	Today's game is Pokemon Snap.
3926257	3927579	Yay!
3928620	3933024	It is a first-person rail shooter slash simulation game.
3934105	3940352	It was done by HAL Laboratory with Pax Softnica, and it was published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.
3942113	3947557	Basically, in this game, you go around as this dude with a camera.
3949778	3952099	In Japan, his name is Toru.
3954061	3958183	Over here, he's Todd Snap, who is a Pokemon photographer.
3958403	3969390	Professor Oak, or Okido, I should say, wants him to take pictures around the island so that they can show Pokemon in their natural habitats.
3969790	3976263	So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the Zero-One and you take pictures of the Pokemans!
3976663	3978787	My Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.
3979869	3980431	So, uh...
3981818	3989344	You get different points based for the size and the pose and keeping it in frame.
3989364	3990925	You get double points if it's centered.
3991505	3994588	You have extra points for capturing them in a special pose.
3994668	3996309	For example, a surfing Pikachu.
3996990	4000132	Or if you get multiples of the same Pokemon in the same image.
4001773	4003535	And you basically...
4005606	4009028	Hold on to your photos, you can get better photos as you go, but you've got different levels.
4009089	4013392	You have the beach, the tunnel, volcano, river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud.
4014993	4018535	But some of the items have you play through the levels again.
4018575	4021297	You'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level.
4021717	4027942	So you can get hidden Pokemon, or alternate routes, get different photographs.
4028622	4031743	and then you get pester balls because it's super effective.
4032284	4035505	You use those to knock out Pokemon or to get them out of hiding.
4035925	4041607	You get a Pokeflute which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate or hatch them.
4042367	4047650	And then it can make them dance and they can do certain dances.
4048190	4051411	And then you get a Dash Engine which lets you go faster than usual.
4051991	4056293	And then you also get this thing called an Album Mark where you can mark which ones are your favorite photos.
4057202	4058564	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4072399	4079768	and it came out March 21st, 1999 in Japan and June 30th and September 15th in North America and PAL regions, both in 1999.
4080128	4086736	The Virtual Console, we got it that, well, you couldn't save your...
4087657	4094918	Well, because it's different hardware, you actually would be able to share the photos with your friends on different Wiis.
4095299	4104540	And it came out on December 4th, 10th, and 11th, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively.
4105541	4110061	And it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.
4111082	4111602	And guess what?
4111762	4112182	That's true.
4113311	4121254	I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this that completely sucks and I spent too much money on it and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game.
4121374	4125516	However, it came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase.
4126617	4127217	So that was pretty cool.
4128357	4129318	Back to Pokemon Snap.
4130579	4133542	It was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster.
4134303	4142874	And the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed.
4143795	4146878	And we had the same thing at Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap.
4146918	4147980	I wish we did a few of those.
4148280	4152462	They actually had a contest where you could take your best shot and you win a trip to Australia.
4153183	4154723	I remember that because we tried to do that.
4154823	4155844	I wanted to go to Australia.
4155864	4156584	Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
4156864	4157245	Yeah.
4157845	4163208	And then Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training Tour.
4164188	4168351	So it sold like a bunch in Japan for its first week.
4168431	4170612	It ranked fifth in the United States.
4170773	4174815	It sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release.
4174855	4177157	And it was the misrented game up until October 22, 1999.
4179398	4180639	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4198696	4225056	it's really honestly I think of all of the Pokemon games that came out it was just so fun really it was so different and so unique that it really I don't see how it couldn't have you know have won it was it was a fantastic game and there are certain people that says that this is a game that should have never worked but it just did
4227333	4236103	So, but honestly, like I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well.
4237384	4243250	And, like, remember the Africa taking pictures of animals thing?
4244412	4249257	And Dead Rising even had the snap thing, remember?
4249277	4249357	Yeah.
4249801	4251924	Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead or Rising, the original one.
4252304	4256210	So it's not as if the concept isn't well liked.
4256850	4258653	It's just a matter of execution.
4258733	4260735	And I really think this was executed well.
4261236	4265201	And the other thing too is because of how brilliantly marketed it was.
4265281	4267024	You remember, Rob, don't you?
4267384	4269665	Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever.
4269705	4275889	I mean, I did go there a little bit when I was more in college, but when I was younger, we didn't really go to Blockbuster.
4276089	4281092	We had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't get any of that printer stuff.
4281152	4282573	I didn't own a Nintendo 64 anyway.
4282593	4289576	They were also doing, because at the same time, they also had the Pikachu Genkidichu, which in Japan, that's what it was.
4289616	4291698	In the U.S., it was Hey, you Pikachu.
4292618	4295840	You could talk to Pikachu and remember Seaman basically had that.
4296640	4299822	And Pokemon Stadium, which I thought was a fantastic concept.
4300763	4307647	But this one of the 3D entrances of Pokemon, I think this one to this day is the best.
4308627	4315871	This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing, even though it's a Nintendo 64 title.
4316071	4322335	I mean, when we got referred to Nintendo 64 the first time around, I was pissed off because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?
4322355	4325736	Well, thankfully, there's the Wii Virtual Console one.
4325756	4327337	Well, no, we also got it again.
4327397	4331480	But I remember that was a big deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect.
4331500	4331580	Yeah.
4332000	4335002	One of the few changes they made, I guess.
4335042	4335662	Wonderful.
4335962	4340423	You know, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on your Wii, so you totally could be wrong.
4343160	4344081	And the voice acting.
4345902	4349284	Because it had such limited voice capacity.
4350585	4354488	Nintendo's always done this, though.
4355168	4363414	They've had a couple of lines of dialogue to give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like without recording full-on dialogue.
4363954	4365716	I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself.
4366256	4367817	But I guess we'll have to wait another week for that.
4368517	4368978	Perhaps.
4370427	4378012	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap for the Nintendo 64, a game that I really like, just so you know.
4379713	4385597	All right, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4385617	4387659	We're going to take some calls here to close out the show.
4387959	4391401	Remember, guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight.
4392222	4393963	Loki was recovering from surgery.
4394003	4399807	We didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on.
4400487	4405209	We're doing a minimum day, we call it here at Orange Launch Radio, like the days we used to have in school.
4405789	4407429	So we do have the Skype line open.
4407529	4411731	I would ask if there's last minute stories, but DarkSakura usually doesn't go hunting for those.
4412131	4413691	Pinkberry is our last minute story.
4415192	4418013	The Oscars were won by Pinkberry and Betty White.
4419413	4421234	So we're going to wait for some calls here.
4421714	4424155	I'll try to see if there's anything real quick here that I can pull up.
4426044	4433246	I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.
4434286	4436427	But what we do have... What's that?
4437627	4443369	We have Shermie, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.
4444469	4446290	Why would Shermie be offended by me?
4446310	4447430	She's offended by everybody.
4448951	4453632	She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this morning by accident.
4455408	4457589	Let me get into a couple last-minute stories for you guys.
4458430	4461431	I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.
4461811	4463992	I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.
4464873	4473016	There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Kramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming for free, which I think is awesome.
4473657	4476798	You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you.
4477158	4478679	You can just get this for free.
4479019	4505792	by the way the internets which was the other bonus levels where these two other new levels are going into they're all going to be in the internets section you used to have to get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage which I think is pretty awesome so check that out alright that's pretty cool let's look at some other stories here
4506863	4510687	Oh, apparently breast milk ice cream is sold out at a London store.
4510807	4511688	Disgusting.
4512108	4513029	Sounds so disgusting.
4513049	4515151	It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.
4517173	4518074	I just caught that.
4518154	4519015	It's hilarious.
4519075	4519715	It was on NPR.
4520656	4521057	Gross.
4522028	4523829	Hey, that's what babies drink.
4524329	4526971	But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.
4526991	4528692	You drink breast milk from cows.
4529592	4530853	It's just different.
4531393	4534895	DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii.
4535475	4540458	If you are still following this series, of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games.
4541578	4544060	Ah, gonna be coming out on the 29th of April.
4544240	4546501	New features and innovations, they're saying.
4546581	4547602	All right, well, we'll see.
4548282	4556187	I guess you're supposed to be using now the Wii Remote, the Nunchuck, and the Dance Mat all together to do hot new dance moves.
4556628	4561431	There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore.
4561971	4562351	Oh, Lord.
4563892	4564352	I just want DDR.
4579629	4607510	uh let's see the fate of Freestyle Games the DJ Hero developer still undecided uh and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement that there's still download content coming so Freestyle Games has not had the plug pulled on it yet uh they may be able to make other games maybe even a new DJ Hero game I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that uh 3D DJ Hero thing that they showed at uh E3 would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?
4609740	4611021	You know, I could see it happening.
4611081	4612642	I think it would actually be really cool.
4613883	4620048	There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.
4620368	4621910	I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.
4622290	4633559	It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi.
4634240	4637062	It's on the official website.
4638363	4639643	Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.
4639804	4641524	It definitely is pretty.
4642584	4644005	It'll be out on March 22nd.
4646286	4647326	Alright, let's go to the phones.
4648686	4649587	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4649607	4649927	Who's this?
4651447	4652027	It's PT.
4652247	4653768	Hey, Dark Tattoo, what's on your mind, buddy?
4656569	4657369	Turn down your speakers.
4658009	4662611	Yes, first rule of radio, you've got to mute what you're listening to or you'll hear yourself and it messes with you.
4663171	4663671	What's up, buddy?
4664211	4664771	Yeah, sorry.
4665671	4666732	I wanted to talk about this...
4667864	4668925	Dragon Warrior, Warcraft
4694611	4695931	How exactly does this play?
4695971	4698532	Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?
4699833	4704854	Yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with lots of other people.
4707755	4708835	And what makes this game fun?
4711576	4717538	Well, it's... It's... It's old school.
4717878	4719178	That's why it's awesome.
4720278	4720598	Yeah.
4720658	4722339	It's like playing...
4723539	4726881	It's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.
4727341	4730723	Can you make your own content in this, or is it kind of a linear thing?
4732203	4733724	Oh no, you can create your own character.
4734845	4736365	Choose different colors and all that.
4736886	4737206	Gotcha.
4737326	4738026	Different classes.
4738567	4739867	I'm watching a video of it.
4739947	4745390	It looks interesting, but honestly, I like World of Warcraft.
4747031	4750853	Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?
4750913	4751393	Is it free?
4753400	4753821	Oh, yeah.
4754601	4755362	Oh, that's cool.
4755382	4755762	Free is good.
4755942	4756122	All right.
4756142	4757383	What's the website where we can check it out?
4759705	4760966	Oh, shoot.
4761006	4762428	I'd have to find it.
4762548	4764469	I'll have to Google it to find out.
4766231	4766471	Yeah.
4766591	4766911	All right.
4767232	4768673	DT, I will check that game out.
4768713	4769233	I promise.
4769273	4770695	Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?
4772196	4772856	No, that's it.
4773077	4773417	All right.
4773437	4774097	We'll check it out.
4774197	4774658	Take care, buddy.
4775805	4778027	It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.
4778167	4778627	Oh, there it is.
4778667	4783091	GamerGirl just said in a chat room there it's SilkGames.com is where you can get that.
4784972	4785773	Yeah, I don't think so.
4788535	4788735	Why?
4788755	4789435	Does it look that good?
4790136	4792277	I'm already paying for something so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.
4792317	4792598	This is free.
4792958	4794879	Yeah, but I won't have time.
4795040	4796821	Sometimes a diversion is nice.
4797221	4798262	That's why I have a DS.
4799823	4803446	I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3 and usually that's when I don't want to talk to people.
4805745	4808766	and honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.
4809926	4812167	So, I can play that for free too.
4813247	4814108	And it looks better.
4816648	4818689	Alright, let's try to take some more calls here.
4818709	4819909	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4819929	4820290	Who's this?
4822070	4823170	Dark Chester, how you doing?
4823250	4823711	Hey, good.
4823751	4824471	How are you, buddy?
4825811	4826572	I'm doing okay.
4826732	4827212	What's on your mind?
4828832	4832233	Well, I wanted to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener.
4832533	4832793	Uh-huh.
4833694	4834354	And, um,
4835006	4840148	I've listened to a few of your past ones and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.
4840248	4840468	Yeah.
4841268	4846230	And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.
4846710	4847110	Oh, really?
4847310	4851451	Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.
4852151	4852772	That's cool.
4852832	4858713	I hope it was good stuff and not like the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom wall for a good time.
4858753	4859874	No, no, no, no.
4860054	4860954	It was good stuff.
4861194	4861374	Oh, good.
4861394	4861734	That's cool.
4861754	4863595	So where are you calling from if you don't mind me asking?
4865154	4865554	I'm sorry?
4865654	4866435	Where are you calling from?
4868897	4869697	Louisiana.
4870218	4870658	Cool.
4871939	4873360	Well, I'm an Alabama native.
4875581	4875862	Really?
4876002	4876782	Yeah, I'm from Mobile.
4878844	4882346	Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas.
4882586	4883767	Cool.
4884408	4886129	I've never really been to Mobile either.
4886749	4887210	Well, that's okay.
4887230	4887910	You're not missing much.
4889031	4889651	Just Mardi Gras.
4889832	4894695	So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?
4897112	4898212	It was AllGenGamers.
4898232	4899373	It's fairly new.
4899393	4906798	They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and one of the other hosts on the show said that it's
4919719	4921121	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4934839	4943305	It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it for the right reasons.
4943365	4944886	We know we're not going to be super famous.
4944926	4946207	That's not the reason to be in this.
4946247	4950150	But just the crowd that we have here in the chat room really makes it worth it.
4950270	4952071	And just the positive feedback that we do get.
4952611	4956554	And believe me, we got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to kind of get through to that.
4956654	4962198	But you do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.
4962218	4962398	Yeah.
4962572	4967798	I already approve of them because I had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with the dog Snuggie.
4967818	4970061	That was a great episode.
4970261	4971062	Pretty awesome.
4971362	4974225	Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you.
4974245	4974986	And 370 to go.
4975567	4976027	You can do it.
4978790	4979051	All right.
4979151	4979491	Wow.
4980692	4982775	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?
4984436	5013401	not that I can think of I had a couple of things but they just kind of flew out of my brain I don't really remember them now that tends to happen on live radio happens to me all the time but if you think about it send us an email later on alright I sure can alright welcome to the show and have a good one thanks for calling you're welcome bye bye you know that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before I thought that was one of those like long time listener first time caller types of things but I guess not I'm actually I'm on their Twitter right now giving them a thank you very cool

5048367	5052009	You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.
5052049	5052929	It's always a good thing to do.
5053069	5056151	Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.
5056572	5058273	Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.
5058313	5059073	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5059093	5059413	Who's this?

5062375	5063176	How you guys doing?
5063436	5065597	Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.
5065637	5066938	Anybody else want to plug their show?
5067738	5070600	It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.
5071501	5072001	What's up, buddy?
5072830	5073491	Not too much.
5073531	5078937	I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon17 con report.
5079038	5080219	Yes, KatsuCon17.
5081160	5083943	I went to KatsuCon13, I think.
5085928	5092374	I think it might have been 15, and yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as the Black Mage.
5092554	5093155	Oh, great.
5094336	5094976	Joy and Rapture.
5095016	5098459	All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy D.C.
5098780	5099220	How was it?
5099921	5102303	It was good, but this time we're no longer in D.C.
5102883	5103004	Oh.
5104745	5111131	Yeah, from my understanding, the Omnishorm, the Hoity Toity Hotel, got tired of the con.
5112370	5114652	Acta Contracta told them, get the step in.
5114872	5121737	So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel, Spa and Resort in National Harbor, Maryland.
5122798	5123438	Gaylord.
5124699	5125479	Only you.
5125720	5126000	I know.
5127895	5129055	What was trending in cosplay?
5129115	5129936	Again, it's Hetalia
5155756	5162119	And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since the release of XIII.
5162199	5162659	Of course.
5163880	5168682	Actually, I wanted to cosplay Japan for Hitalia.
5169723	5172664	I've yet to see Hitalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.
5173608	5175270	I've seen some crazy ones.
5176290	5177992	A friend of mine is going to Comiket this year.
5179713	5184156	I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay from Japan.
5184376	5186478	Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stocking?
5186498	5187839	Because that's my favorite new one.
5188459	5188759	Yes.
5189280	5189600	Awesome.
5189980	5192922	You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?
5193282	5193883	Oh, God.
5194603	5195384	You and that show.
5195404	5195924	I fucking love that show.
5195944	5200387	It's like your new... You always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.
5201067	5202048	There's been other ones in the past.
5202068	5204750	But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.
5204930	5205190	I know.
5205230	5205951	Thanks to Becky.
5206211	5207191	It's super strong now.
5207572	5209393	Anyway, what about video game related stuff?
5209453	5213295	Before we get into video games, you mentioned Panty and Stocking.
5213335	5217158	I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.
5217798	5219378	Did you cosplay from Penny and Stocky?
5219959	5230341	Yes, I was Garterbelt That's awesome Very nice What video game content was there at KatsuCon?
5231261	5244044	A massive gaming room and I know I've probably said this once before and I'll most likely say it again Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions Sad face, why is that?
5245643	5246764	They don't get the machines.
5247144	5255569	Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.
5256189	5263974	So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock Band.
5264034	5268637	I was going to say, do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?
5269317	5269678	I have.
5269738	5272219	I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.
5272519	5273500	Oh, nice.
5273520	5273640	Nice.
5275086	5278888	I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.
5279889	5281049	Excuses, excuses.
5281470	5282890	You have to come to Fanime this year.
5283911	5285632	I can't do Fanime this year.
5287733	5288193	I'm broke.
5288213	5290154	Are we even doing Fanime this year?
5290235	5291215	I'm planning on doing Fanime.
5291235	5293676	You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.
5294377	5298139	I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.
5298638	5304023	Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting to do some type of cosplay.
5304103	5304543	But anyway.
5306085	5308947	Well, let me ask one more question then.
5309027	5311189	What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?
5314492	5315393	T-shirts mostly.
5316994	5317815	Any good T-shirts?
5318075	5318816	What kind?
5318976	5320397	What were some funny slogans you saw?
5321318	5322419	All right.
5322459	5325702	They have a female shirt with two boos on it.
5328243	5330464	Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?
5330924	5334965	Yes, and it says along the lines of, don't touch my booze or leave my booze on.
5335946	5336386	Thank you.
5336586	5338046	Please stop looking at my booze.
5338386	5339147	Oh, it's booze.
5339207	5345849	I thought it was like one of those shirts where they draw the tuxedo on it or something, but it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.
5345889	5346809	And I was like, why is that?
5346849	5347470	That's not funny.
5347510	5348090	That's weird.
5348110	5348890	That's redundant.
5349350	5349730	I get it.
5349870	5350411	Booze.
5350491	5351491	Stop looking at my booze.
5351631	5352171	I get it.
5352271	5354412	I like the one that Becky has, though, of the D20s.
5354492	5355392	It says, yes, they're natural.
5355832	5356212	Oh, yeah.
5356333	5357533	I've seen that before at conventions.
5358013	5360056	And don't forget the Cleric shirt.
5361277	5361938	Plus one shirt.
5362178	5362639	Cloth shirt.
5363299	5363680	No, no, no.
5364020	5366763	It's a parody of the Cleric's logo, but it says Cleric.
5366943	5370528	It says they may heal you, but they still hate you.
5371609	5373711	Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
5374112	5374712	Yeah, that's it.
5375093	5376174	Alright, one more question.
5376394	5378076	Thing they most need at Katsukan 18.
5380908	5382910	Chicken Katsu What's that?
5383530	5394680	Febreze Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go Have a good one I'm posting this in the chat The masquerade was great There was a link to a video
5395871	5397212	My friends doing a Super Mario Bros.
5397252	5397932	musical too.
5397972	5399213	What will Brian Boitano do?
5399233	5400394	It was really fun.
5400514	5403175	Okay, wait, I'm looking at this here.
5403195	5404416	I can't see an O. Anniversary.
5405096	5405517	Anniversary.
5422077	5430239	Every time I think I rescued the princess, she's always in another castle.
5430599	5431879	And all I think of is this thing.
5432339	5433420	I'm ready to deal with it.
5433940	5435180	I don't know what to do anymore.
5435720	5437061	Mario, you know this has.
5437081	5438081	You can do it.
5438101	5440361	What you need to do is think about your mental.
5440461	5443122	And what he would do is really think that would work for him.
5444767	5448049	You know, the best part about watching these videos, Ranma, you know what the best part is?
5448749	5449249	That being?
5449470	5456773	It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't the nerdiest thing I could be doing.
5459235	5459815	Yeah.
5460315	5461596	I've seen a wedding at AX.
5462436	5462857	Just saying.
5462897	5466218	I've seen wedding proposals at Masquerades.
5467199	5467519	All right.
5467699	5468820	I'm really letting you in now, buddy.
5468860	5469340	Have a good one.
5469820	5470161	All right.
5470221	5470881	Thanks for the call.
5474455	5475638	Alright, what the hell, one more call.
5475678	5476982	Hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio, who's this?
5477984	5478967	Hi, can you hear me now?
5479087	5480029	Yes, we can, what's up?
5480751	5481954	Hey, it's DDR Dollar Bill here.
5481994	5483358	DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
5484861	5514516	I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in so I figured well then it all flooded it always works that way I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between when we do things here in studio and when you guys hear it it used to be like 15 seconds and then all games change some things around I think we bounce I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you now but whatever hey you know what at least we have a place to do our show what's on your mind buddy
5516341	5517422	and nothing much.
5518083	5520945	Just calling on pass if I say hi.
5522006	5525529	Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.
5526550	5527351	Gaming laptop?
5527371	5528872	What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?
5529693	5530474	Let's put it this way.
5532903	5545627	This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.
5545687	5547587	So you can't do a little netbook.
5547647	5550048	You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.
5550988	5551268	Right.
5551328	5552589	But here's something funny today, though.
5553629	5556810	I tried a couple over at the Best Buy just for kicks and giggles.
5557270	5557450	Yeah?
5557470	5557550	Yeah.
5559349	5564834	I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.
5565635	5567617	You crashed every laptop at Best Buy?
5567637	5568858	Some people do that on purpose.
5569498	5577145	Some people will go into Fry's and try to crash all the computers before they get caught by the burly-looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.
5577386	5577826	What are you doing?
5578927	5580649	Not that I would know, but I've heard.
5582697	5583938	I did this on accident!
5584358	5585299	All of them!
5585979	5588922	Were you hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by?
5589082	5593325	Actually, that's not a bad thing to do on a computer as it used to be.
5594906	5595566	I did something else.
5596267	5598268	Half of them, I was just checking out some of the specs.
5598809	5606574	Some of them, I was just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run your game.
5607735	5611398	I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one, and
5613205	5622772	I'll get it later on, but I tried a couple of those and they started crashing and then I had to reboot a couple of them and I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
5623533	5625434	Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?
5625774	5627235	A couple of questions in our chat room here.
5627315	5631218	DarkToagak says 60 frames a second is overkill.
5631518	5632339	30's not cutting it for you?
5633581	5633981	Hell.
5634322	5634882	Fucking.
5635302	5635683	No.
5636283	5637124	I saw that coming.
5637144	5637704	Why not?
5638084	5648012	No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest, 30 frames per second actually... It's not accurate.
5648212	5649393	It doesn't feel real.
5650073	5650213	And...
5651554	5657136	No, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's a smooth motion, because then it feels more real to me.
5657156	5661057	30 frames, it's all choppy, and I'm missing shots left and right.
5661657	5663398	No, I need to be that precise.
5663758	5667859	And Brad from PodCulture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?
5667879	5668760	That is a good question.
5668800	5672341	I mean, laptops are not quite as easy to build as the desktops.
5673348	5673868	Oh, I know.
5674129	5676351	You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?
5698567	5699087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5726150	5728351	I know, but I've done it before.
5729471	5729771	All right.
5730031	5731652	Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?
5734192	5737133	I got to rewire my damn pad so I can play DDR again.
5738053	5739514	There's a new one coming out on the Wii.
5740574	5741234	That's the reason.
5741254	5743475	I need a wire so I can play on the Wii.
5745305	5746905	New Lady Gaga and Paramore.
5747226	5748486	And PS3.
5749106	5749386	All right.
5749726	5750186	All right, buddy.
5750346	5751867	Good luck on your quest for new DDR.
5752287	5752707	Have a good one.
5753227	5753707	Thanks, guys.
5753887	5754348	Check you later.
5754508	5754768	Bye.
5755208	5756888	I guess DDR dollar bill is not just a clever name.
5756908	5757709	All right.
5757729	5759129	We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.
5759149	5760569	Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.
5760589	5761490	You can always send us an email.
5761790	5763310	Mail that orange lingerie dot com.
5764490	5766991	I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.
5767491	5773133	Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper, then hide all the icons.
5773913	5774353	Oh yeah.
5774713	5775333	That's evil.
5775373	5780375	Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops.
5781195	5788577	So the manager of our group would actually go in and do, you know those little rotating word screensavers?
5789437	5789617	Oh yeah.
5789637	5797159	He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it on tile and
5797499	5813992	and uh or put up like some sort of really bizarre like this one dude who was like doodly doodly and he put up a picture of like a pink pony hot yeah very hot all right well that's gonna bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lawn Tradio I know it was a short show tonight but hey you know what
5814532	5815814	Sometimes real life gets in the way.
5816234	5818717	So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5818737	5819799	DarkSakura, have you sobered up?
5821120	5822081	Excuse me.
5822121	5824204	Oh, it tasted like ice cream.
5824224	5825926	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
5826106	5828088	Pinkberry!
5828188	5829310	My final thought is...
5832051	5832431	I don't know.
5833692	5834053	Stuff.
5834633	5835234	IDKS.
5835494	5838176	IDK, LOL, WTF, BBQ.
5838196	5838696	You mad?
5839357	5839757	You mad?
5840378	5840638	All right.
5840938	5843140	That's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Launch Radio.
