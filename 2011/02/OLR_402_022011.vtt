WEBVTT

00:09.457 --> 00:12.461
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:14.084 --> 00:15.446
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 20th, 2011.

00:16.488 --> 00:18.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?

00:19.072 --> 00:21.516
[SPEAKER_00]: Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.

00:21.836 --> 00:24.080
[SPEAKER_00]: And is PC piracy really in decline?

00:31.889 --> 00:32.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafel

01:02.984 --> 01:04.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.

01:05.105 --> 01:06.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Falafels are delicious.

01:06.126 --> 01:08.328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go have another.

01:08.428 --> 01:13.471
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that one of the races in it was like a Lollapalooza or something.

01:13.831 --> 01:17.654
[SPEAKER_04]: I just call them falafels because they're adorable and cute like falafels.

01:17.674 --> 01:19.015
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who really likes falafels?

01:19.095 --> 01:21.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight is speaking early.

01:21.957 --> 01:22.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Salacious Pop.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

01:31.055 --> 01:31.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

01:31.515 --> 01:32.316
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:32.656 --> 01:33.356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

01:34.037 --> 01:34.377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:34.537 --> 01:36.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything flaw-fulfilled in your world?

01:36.518 --> 01:36.878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:37.019 --> 01:38.559
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to ask.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.240
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

01:40.260 --> 01:40.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

01:41.261 --> 01:42.682
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the dinner of choice tonight?

01:42.722 --> 01:43.362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask this.

01:43.482 --> 01:44.423
[SPEAKER_12]: I was crapping McDonald's.

01:44.463 --> 01:49.846
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't really that hungry, but I knew if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry later, so I just had a quarter pounder.

01:49.866 --> 01:50.687
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

01:50.987 --> 01:56.070
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't very good, and the fries aren't very good, but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.

01:57.691 --> 02:22.253
[SPEAKER_04]: any McDonald's you go to so it was just I don't know Orange Lounge Foodio you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio but a lot of the times we also talk about food also joining us tonight as you already know is the one and only Salacious Pop here in studio I'm sorry for speaking out of turn please don't beat me you need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak hello what's up

02:23.891 --> 02:24.672
[SPEAKER_04]: How's your week going?

02:24.992 --> 02:25.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

02:25.472 --> 02:25.693
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

02:25.933 --> 02:26.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.914
[SPEAKER_11]: I have PETA, so it's a lot better now.

02:28.415 --> 02:32.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a 65-year-old man.

02:32.558 --> 02:33.379
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't move today.

02:33.960 --> 02:39.504
[SPEAKER_11]: We ran around doing a local version of The Amazing Race scavenger hunt.

02:39.644 --> 02:44.288
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just between about 15 or 16 friends, all within Sacramento downtown.

02:44.929 --> 02:49.513
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, no charity, no organization, just because we can.

02:49.873 --> 02:50.313
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bored.

02:50.453 --> 02:53.014
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, when people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.

02:54.234 --> 02:57.955
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams.

02:58.355 --> 03:00.455
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't let them win over you.

03:00.855 --> 03:02.616
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.

03:02.756 --> 03:08.757
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.997
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of running back and forth.

03:11.077 --> 03:19.179
[SPEAKER_11]: And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling and can't sit up without help.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm a gamer.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do physical activity.

03:22.387 --> 03:24.032
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is too much.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get for not playing any more DDR.

03:26.341 --> 03:29.764
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have half a Vicodin, so I'm feeling a lot better after that.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain.

03:31.925 --> 03:32.926
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes you not care.

03:33.186 --> 03:33.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it is.

03:35.307 --> 03:36.368
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't care anymore.

03:37.509 --> 03:41.011
[SPEAKER_04]: But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.

03:41.151 --> 03:42.192
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on opposing teams.

03:42.732 --> 03:47.475
[SPEAKER_04]: I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was on a few times in the past.

03:47.976 --> 03:49.337
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she filled in for you one time.

03:49.377 --> 03:50.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Her and Irene were on a show.

03:50.838 --> 03:53.219
[SPEAKER_04]: But Victoria and I were a team, and we came in second.

03:53.299 --> 03:53.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

03:54.700 --> 03:55.040
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

03:55.380 --> 04:00.903
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have the winner and the runner up.

04:00.943 --> 04:02.283
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not doing this shit anymore.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.063
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done.

04:03.364 --> 04:04.624
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of you were too far behind.

04:05.925 --> 04:06.265
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.606
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I had a good time.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.386
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say this.

04:09.506 --> 04:11.927
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.

04:12.607 --> 04:15.048
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.

04:15.408 --> 04:19.130
[SPEAKER_04]: But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.

04:20.051 --> 04:29.806
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many of y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or are even old enough to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now, and they're kind of fun, actually.

04:29.846 --> 04:31.208
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Amazing Race slot cars.

04:31.749 --> 04:32.050
Okay.

04:33.652 --> 04:36.114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that's a hobby more of us aren't into is slot car.

04:36.134 --> 04:38.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I always kind of walk by the stores and I go, ooh, that's cool.

04:38.556 --> 04:40.037
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to love those when I was a kid too.

04:40.057 --> 04:46.261
[SPEAKER_07]: The hobby store that, well, Dan's into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.

04:47.082 --> 04:50.284
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.

04:51.244 --> 04:54.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can run it on the slot sets.

04:56.411 --> 05:01.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?

05:01.072 --> 05:03.733
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I want to say there was at least a Micro Machines game.

05:03.773 --> 05:08.595
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the Typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's?

05:09.355 --> 05:11.495
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a pinball table in there.

05:11.695 --> 05:13.816
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a slot car thing in there.

05:14.196 --> 05:14.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

05:15.197 --> 05:16.038
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room.

05:16.438 --> 05:22.583
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

05:22.663 --> 05:29.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.

05:29.468 --> 05:31.770
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.

05:31.810 --> 05:32.290
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Brad.

05:32.871 --> 05:33.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob isn't out of shape.

05:34.432 --> 05:35.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Round is a shape.

05:35.893 --> 05:36.254
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

05:36.274 --> 05:38.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment actually.

05:38.495 --> 05:39.976
[SPEAKER_04]: That was rather rude, don't you think?

05:40.016 --> 05:40.397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

05:41.759 --> 05:52.299
[SPEAKER_04]: and then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing SSJ100Matt says OLR House MD Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with it's not lupus it's a house joke, TV joke

05:54.355 --> 05:58.438
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also you can join us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.580
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.622
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

06:05.842 --> 06:09.645
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you have been playing this week.

06:09.725 --> 06:11.005
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

06:11.126 --> 06:11.786
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

06:12.594 --> 06:15.896
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3

06:41.297 --> 06:41.897
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:00.766 --> 07:05.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since.

07:07.432 --> 07:09.514
[SPEAKER_07]: With its freaky-ass control style.

07:10.094 --> 07:18.542
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man is totally janked in that game.

07:19.443 --> 07:20.223
[SPEAKER_07]: His moves are messed up.

07:20.484 --> 07:22.325
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's all messed up now.

07:22.385 --> 07:23.706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about Deadpool.

07:23.746 --> 07:26.789
[SPEAKER_04]: A movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.

07:26.869 --> 07:27.189
[SPEAKER_04]: What?! !

07:28.752 --> 07:31.513
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they killed Johnny Storm.

07:32.013 --> 07:32.313
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

07:32.433 --> 07:33.873
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the most interesting of all of them?

07:33.913 --> 07:37.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.

07:37.954 --> 07:38.294
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

07:39.994 --> 07:40.294
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

07:40.714 --> 07:44.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?

07:44.335 --> 07:52.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was going to say it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy III, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.

07:53.377 --> 08:00.161
[SPEAKER_04]: What's particularly interesting about that is that 1 and 2 on the iPhone were based off the PSP versions.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.922
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.404
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.

08:07.325 --> 08:10.486
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone.

08:10.827 --> 08:11.867
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is it going to be?

08:12.448 --> 08:13.248
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

08:13.468 --> 08:17.570
[SPEAKER_07]: I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they did 1, 2, and 4.

08:17.610 --> 08:17.710
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

08:22.230 --> 08:22.650
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.691
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're just going to go through and re-sprite them.

08:24.891 --> 08:33.953
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for just one color and might just pull whatever they were working on for that because they had it in the works.

08:34.013 --> 08:34.893
[SPEAKER_07]: It just never came out.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.734
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.

08:38.134 --> 08:41.875
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting, though, if they do one for iPhone, why don't they just release it for PSP as well?

08:42.456 --> 08:45.056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.

08:45.156 --> 08:46.116
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're great.

08:47.037 --> 08:50.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Two is really simple to play because I have two on my iPhone.

08:50.358 --> 08:51.438
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited for four.

08:52.456 --> 08:59.118
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a part of me that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi, but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.

08:59.638 --> 09:05.280
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope they bring 4 and the After Years onto the iOS as well because I don't really play with PSP anymore.

09:05.660 --> 09:10.261
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.

09:11.124 --> 09:13.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, After Years did start as a mobile game.

09:13.565 --> 09:13.725
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

09:14.065 --> 09:17.465
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom.

09:17.485 --> 09:18.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a complaint I hear a lot.

09:19.286 --> 09:20.786
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of curious what DarkSakura thinks about it.

09:20.806 --> 09:22.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.

09:22.366 --> 09:23.247
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, so not cool.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, outside of E3, but that was how long ago and it was early build of the game.

09:27.408 --> 09:31.628
[SPEAKER_04]: But AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.

09:31.768 --> 09:32.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really that fun.

09:33.389 --> 09:33.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Agree?

09:33.709 --> 09:34.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Disagree?

09:35.191 --> 09:38.733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.

09:39.773 --> 09:44.296
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.

09:44.336 --> 09:44.876
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

09:45.276 --> 09:51.519
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter IV, same thing.

09:52.260 --> 10:01.745
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because you can just throw off your super with a push of a button.

10:03.925 --> 10:24.453
[SPEAKER_07]: when you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it then there's you can definitely I'm trying to see how to phrase this right because it's not like you know like in Tekken where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game if you've got skill with it then you can beat a masher I don't know if that makes sense so it can be fun

10:25.427 --> 10:36.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the, I don't know, for basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before to get like a six or seven hit.

10:36.942 --> 10:43.910
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have to practice and know how to do that stuff.

10:44.491 --> 10:45.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.393
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:23.044 --> 11:24.025
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

11:38.702 --> 12:03.310
[SPEAKER_07]: and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off because we could do all of those 44 hit combos and everything too but the the thing though is that with the early versus games versus the late versus game first that's a lot of versus the late versus games is that they the early ones still went on that Street Fighter you know the six button layout style whereas hi whereas we have um

12:05.420 --> 12:33.575
[SPEAKER_04]: a four button with a special so it's just kind of different sorry we're being interrupted with food requests that's why we're distracted so anyhow I wanted to ask to throw this out real quick though speaking of Killer Instinct I realize that everything's up in the air with Rare and they're not really with Nintendo anymore and things aren't like they used to be but like seriously seriously what's got to happen for there to be a Killer Instinct 3

12:34.375 --> 12:34.896
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

12:35.236 --> 12:35.917
[SPEAKER_04]: How bad?

12:35.997 --> 12:37.538
[SPEAKER_04]: Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?

12:37.638 --> 12:38.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, me, me, me, me.

12:38.619 --> 12:39.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's me and Jamie.

12:39.420 --> 12:39.680
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

12:40.061 --> 12:40.541
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

12:40.621 --> 12:41.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Still.

12:41.943 --> 12:46.687
[SPEAKER_11]: I still wanted the public flogging of whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct Complete 64.

12:46.887 --> 12:48.909
[SPEAKER_11]: That piece of crap port.

12:49.090 --> 12:49.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.011
[SPEAKER_11]: Already upset thinking about it.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.093
[SPEAKER_07]: The SNES version was the best home port.

12:53.354 --> 12:53.774
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

12:54.415 --> 12:54.915
[SPEAKER_07]: Or MAME.

12:54.935 --> 12:55.656
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.429
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:14.301 --> 13:24.566
[SPEAKER_07]: is that he actually waited until the... Because the game would start with a random stage and he waited until Orchid Stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV file back in the day.

13:24.826 --> 13:25.286
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.

13:25.567 --> 13:26.347
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so sweet.

13:26.507 --> 13:31.810
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her unrealistic boobies.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.591
[SPEAKER_07]: She was the first one I beat the game with in KI2.

13:33.611 --> 13:33.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

13:35.717 --> 13:36.978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

13:37.219 --> 13:38.400
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how you doing?

13:38.420 --> 13:39.101
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your game of the week?

13:39.261 --> 13:39.762
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was all right.

13:40.142 --> 13:41.403
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't play a lot, though.

13:42.965 --> 13:47.971
[SPEAKER_12]: Just mainly sorting poker, too, and... Ah, I keep forgetting to get that game.

13:48.451 --> 13:49.012
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awesome.

13:49.052 --> 13:50.674
[SPEAKER_04]: You always tell me about it, and I always forget to get it.

13:50.914 --> 13:51.255
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.358
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just Grand Theft Auto, mainly, because...

13:56.155 --> 13:57.796
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, that's about it.

13:58.236 --> 14:03.859
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.

14:04.419 --> 14:08.841
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only like 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.

14:09.361 --> 14:13.704
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.

14:13.784 --> 14:14.144
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

14:14.504 --> 14:15.204
[SPEAKER_12]: Murder Boner.

14:16.925 --> 14:19.406
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty sweet.

14:22.768 --> 14:23.748
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I love that kind of stuff.

14:23.828 --> 14:27.769
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.

14:28.309 --> 14:29.649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bayonetta with a dick.

14:30.210 --> 14:32.470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Murder Boner is what it is.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Bayonetta with a Murder Boner.

14:34.490 --> 14:35.191
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

14:35.911 --> 14:36.711
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

14:37.451 --> 14:40.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.

14:41.772 --> 14:43.152
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played a few games this week.

14:43.192 --> 14:46.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually...

14:47.253 --> 14:49.775
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already reviewed the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself.

14:49.815 --> 14:58.461
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to emphasize, if you are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another.

14:58.741 --> 15:05.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, it was a little bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack where you can only access the first five in the beginning.

15:06.286 --> 15:08.988
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you play, you unlock one more.

15:09.048 --> 15:11.389
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you only ever have five open at a time.

15:11.809 --> 15:16.893
[SPEAKER_04]: But what was frustrating about that is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house.

15:17.153 --> 15:17.714
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:42.355 --> 15:44.857
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

15:58.607 --> 15:59.448
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

16:13.604 --> 16:13.984
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

16:30.180 --> 16:31.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Other games I played this week.

16:31.362 --> 16:45.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the... It's Contra, but it's not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that... Like the same Contra music.

16:45.581 --> 16:46.762
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Contra, people.

16:47.103 --> 16:47.503
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Contra.

16:48.144 --> 17:03.259
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old school gamers wish they had so much more of on Xbox Live It really is just like a souped up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo game now with

17:04.380 --> 17:08.603
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.

17:09.144 --> 17:11.125
[SPEAKER_04]: It just uses, you know... 2.5D?

17:11.425 --> 17:17.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing where, you know, things are coming out of the background and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff.

17:17.169 --> 17:22.072
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, if you like Contra, this is like an... You don't even have to think you're going to want this game.

17:22.212 --> 17:22.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy this game.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.775
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, modernized a bit.

17:28.857 --> 17:31.378
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this full-on anime opening sequence.

17:31.438 --> 17:33.520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like... It kind of just made me think of, like,

17:34.000 --> 17:35.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck yeah.

17:35.301 --> 17:37.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra, fuck yeah.

17:37.402 --> 17:39.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire, burn.

17:39.323 --> 17:40.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicks with guns.

17:40.604 --> 17:41.364
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of awesome.

17:41.704 --> 17:42.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

17:42.765 --> 17:43.585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely worth your time.

17:43.826 --> 17:47.508
[SPEAKER_04]: The only downside, no up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

17:47.548 --> 17:48.028
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't work.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I put it in the wrong place or something.

17:50.009 --> 17:51.290
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to get that code to work.

17:51.330 --> 17:51.930
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it backwards.

17:52.370 --> 17:52.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

17:52.630 --> 17:54.171
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?

17:54.712 --> 17:55.072
[SPEAKER_06]: You die.

17:55.412 --> 17:56.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

17:56.092 --> 17:58.314
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the Gradius games did that too, I think.

17:58.374 --> 18:00.495
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.

18:00.695 --> 18:01.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it Gradius 4?

18:01.735 --> 18:01.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

18:03.036 --> 18:09.579
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used L-R-L-R, then you would get all the power-ups instead of left, right, left, right.

18:09.959 --> 18:11.799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Gradius V only let you do it three times.

18:15.041 --> 18:20.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I played an indie game on the Marketplace called Try Not to Fart.

18:21.423 --> 18:23.824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the set of... Jamie looks disgusted.

18:24.484 --> 18:25.404
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not disgusted.

18:25.464 --> 18:26.365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like a, what?

18:27.365 --> 18:29.146
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually cracked me up.

18:29.186 --> 18:29.906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

18:30.046 --> 18:34.147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically like you actually try to hold down buttons.

18:34.187 --> 18:37.328
[SPEAKER_04]: Buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have to press that right button.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.989
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it flashes, you let go.

18:40.349 --> 18:43.471
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels.

18:43.731 --> 18:50.053
[SPEAKER_04]: But then as you move on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y. So it's like Twister.

18:50.293 --> 18:51.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like Twister.

18:52.013 --> 18:53.274
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you screw up, you fart.

18:53.314 --> 18:53.714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

18:54.094 --> 18:55.935
[SPEAKER_04]: So, do you come here often?

19:14.372 --> 19:16.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I didn't... You know, they're having this conversation.

19:16.915 --> 19:21.882
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like, if you accidentally fart, it'll go... And it's like... It's just like, Ew, that's disgusting.

19:22.302 --> 19:26.187
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... Like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way.

19:26.828 --> 19:28.610
[SPEAKER_04]: But... I like how your shoes are tied.

19:28.670 --> 19:28.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

19:30.032 --> 19:31.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't spend money on it.

19:32.093 --> 19:43.958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I shouldn't say that because this is an indie development place, but I just, you know, I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.

19:44.158 --> 19:47.180
[SPEAKER_12]: The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.381
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I remember that.

19:49.401 --> 19:50.142
[SPEAKER_12]: I do remember that.

19:50.342 --> 19:50.742
[SPEAKER_12]: That was funny.

19:50.902 --> 19:51.283
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

20:17.940 --> 20:18.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

20:18.941 --> 20:20.741
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop brought me food for that.

20:20.781 --> 20:21.982
[SPEAKER_04]: He rocks.

20:24.142 --> 20:32.725
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I turn it over to SalaciousPop for his gaming week, let me talk real quickly about... I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because there was an NDA and everything, but it's an open beta.

20:32.826 --> 20:35.086
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's playing it if they're interested in it.

20:35.166 --> 20:35.627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rift.

20:36.187 --> 20:37.327
[SPEAKER_04]: I played for a little bit this week.

20:38.147 --> 20:39.408
[SPEAKER_04]: I grinded the character up to level 8.

20:41.189 --> 20:42.189
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I explain Rift?

20:42.649 --> 20:51.391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways to the point where I didn't know what button did what and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?

20:51.531 --> 20:55.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well in WoW I hit N and sure enough I hit N and it brought up my talent tree.

20:55.853 --> 20:59.634
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of funny that I kind of like knew the buttons from just having played WoW so much.

21:01.795 --> 21:10.501
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's be honest, Rift in its advertising campaign is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something like that.

21:10.581 --> 21:12.222
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.

21:12.323 --> 21:13.343
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not in Azeroth.

21:13.423 --> 21:14.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

21:14.084 --> 21:15.025
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not in Kansas.

21:15.325 --> 21:15.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

21:17.326 --> 21:20.809
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played the game to like level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know.

21:21.029 --> 21:24.832
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I don't know, I gotta be honest, I wasn't really feeling it.

21:25.372 --> 21:25.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the game...

21:27.042 --> 21:28.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

21:46.788 --> 22:09.563
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels I'm not going to try and review the game I played it, I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels Everybody's telling me you have to really invest time into it But let's be real, the game also kind of has to do something to make me want to get that far Wasn't that everybody's biggest bitch about Final Fantasy XIII?

22:09.944 --> 22:11.525
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get good until you're like 15 hours in

22:12.762 --> 22:14.203
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.

22:15.223 --> 22:16.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, true.

22:16.704 --> 22:24.728
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and redid all the starting areas to make them a little more interesting.

22:25.328 --> 22:26.949
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Rift, it's a new game.

22:27.529 --> 22:28.750
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll iron out some of the kinks.

22:28.850 --> 22:29.650
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

22:31.171 --> 22:32.731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.

22:33.132 --> 22:36.233
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the V-Retail one or not.

22:36.793 --> 22:40.095
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but whatever.

22:40.816 --> 22:42.920
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have something you wanted to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?

22:43.021 --> 22:43.522
[SPEAKER_11]: How does it look?

22:43.562 --> 22:44.023
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it pretty?

22:45.165 --> 22:45.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

22:45.586 --> 22:46.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty pretty?

22:46.227 --> 22:46.788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty.

22:46.928 --> 22:47.349
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

22:47.409 --> 22:48.371
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about...

22:49.668 --> 22:51.529
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about the way the characters look.

22:51.589 --> 22:56.811
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like the cartoony look of WoW that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic.

22:56.871 --> 22:58.792
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have more intense character customization.

22:59.132 --> 23:00.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot more time doing that.

23:00.492 --> 23:01.313
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of cool.

23:01.773 --> 23:03.313
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

23:03.673 --> 23:07.375
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the scenery looked really nice.

23:07.455 --> 23:09.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the environments.

23:09.676 --> 23:12.437
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.597
[SPEAKER_04]: All that's really beautiful.

23:14.237 --> 23:18.039
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't really into the way the characters looked or the monsters.

23:18.539 --> 23:19.840
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know.

23:20.940 --> 23:21.821
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really an opinion.

23:22.281 --> 23:23.261
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

23:23.782 --> 23:25.242
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week.

23:27.163 --> 23:27.743
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll move on.

23:28.184 --> 23:31.385
[SPEAKER_04]: I already mentioned the Twitter and the Facebook and all that as far as housekeeping goes.

23:31.425 --> 23:32.866
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.

23:33.386 --> 23:36.548
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's get into some actual... Falafels.

23:36.968 --> 23:37.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafels.

23:37.848 --> 23:39.409
[SPEAKER_04]: And then game... Oh, yes, Salacious Pop.

23:39.589 --> 23:40.129
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week.

23:40.149 --> 23:40.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

23:40.770 --> 23:42.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what happens when you leave the room.

23:42.450 --> 23:43.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop, how was your Gaming Week?

23:45.601 --> 23:47.983
[SPEAKER_11]: I left the room because I was sent to bring him food.

23:48.003 --> 23:49.165
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

23:49.525 --> 23:50.606
[SPEAKER_04]: You were gone for like an hour.

23:50.767 --> 23:51.628
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

23:52.589 --> 23:55.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp.

23:55.472 --> 23:58.335
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more appropriate for your other podcast.

23:58.896 --> 24:04.623
[SPEAKER_11]: The Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.

24:05.303 --> 24:09.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Then some You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.

24:11.846 --> 24:17.589
[SPEAKER_11]: I played about an hour's worth of the great Gatsby tribute, NES RomHack.

24:18.390 --> 24:18.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.

24:18.970 --> 24:19.290
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

24:19.650 --> 24:21.171
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a book that we had to cover.

24:21.191 --> 24:23.833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was junior or senior year in high school.

24:24.893 --> 24:27.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about how this works as an NES game.

24:27.975 --> 24:28.475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

24:28.675 --> 24:36.639
[SPEAKER_11]: In level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend who is sort of the person that he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.

24:37.420 --> 24:46.084
[SPEAKER_11]: You show up at Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage.

24:46.124 --> 24:47.065
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a platformer.

24:47.145 --> 24:49.766
[SPEAKER_11]: You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at him.

24:52.816 --> 24:54.898
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.

24:56.119 --> 24:56.720
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played that.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.841
[SPEAKER_11]: I hated that book, just so you know.

24:58.962 --> 25:05.067
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have to read in high school, really depends on the teacher.

25:06.328 --> 25:06.949
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.151
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never liked being forced to read books.

25:09.571 --> 25:11.953
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were some truly terrible books I had to read in high school.

25:11.993 --> 25:13.395
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to read a separate piece.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.876
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I hate that book so much.

25:14.916 --> 25:16.357
[SPEAKER_11]: And The Crucible, Arthur Miller.

25:16.377 --> 25:17.698
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read a separate piece.

25:18.139 --> 25:19.240
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a separate piece about?

25:19.660 --> 25:20.061
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

25:44.798 --> 25:46.959
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.

25:47.119 --> 25:48.840
[SPEAKER_04]: But I loved Catcher in the Rye.

25:48.860 --> 25:53.063
[SPEAKER_04]: I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.

25:54.744 --> 25:58.927
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky.

25:59.927 --> 26:01.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you talk about the Holden the Fart game?

26:02.369 --> 26:02.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

26:02.889 --> 26:03.749
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I missed that.

26:06.232 --> 26:13.434
[SPEAKER_11]: So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each number of the question.

26:14.354 --> 26:19.916
[SPEAKER_11]: The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh, number five, girl, you rock my world, girl, cracks me up.

26:20.296 --> 26:22.396
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.

26:23.257 --> 26:24.157
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to play that game.

26:24.897 --> 26:28.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.

26:29.958 --> 26:31.079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's all.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.160
[SPEAKER_04]: What other classic books should they turn into an 8-bit game?

26:38.496 --> 26:39.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Watership Down.

26:40.297 --> 26:40.657
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

26:41.197 --> 26:41.777
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be a good one.

26:42.478 --> 26:45.399
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Brave New World?

26:46.739 --> 26:47.840
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Atlas Shrugged?

26:47.860 --> 26:50.041
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.

26:51.301 --> 26:51.962
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the book?

26:52.382 --> 26:57.004
[SPEAKER_11]: James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages and it's a classic.

26:59.004 --> 27:01.045
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm liking on the name of the book.

27:01.886 --> 27:02.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe somebody in chat will know it.

27:02.946 --> 27:05.167
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've already had The Inferno.

27:06.992 --> 27:07.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's true.

27:08.935 --> 27:11.037
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, DarkToagak in our chatroom, I love this comment.

27:11.518 --> 27:15.343
[SPEAKER_04]: LMAO, we're reading that in English right now and the teacher brought that game up.

27:17.325 --> 27:19.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.

27:19.568 --> 27:19.989
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?

27:20.069 --> 27:24.374
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to get people interested.

27:24.694 --> 27:25.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think, I don't know.

27:26.627 --> 27:31.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.813
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.

27:34.673 --> 27:39.277
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in New York.

27:40.438 --> 27:43.220
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.

27:43.701 --> 27:44.341
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like her.

27:45.202 --> 27:45.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

27:46.263 --> 27:46.823
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games!

27:46.863 --> 27:47.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games!

27:47.364 --> 27:47.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow, wow.

27:48.344 --> 27:51.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about some actual video game news.

27:51.547 --> 27:52.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, help.

27:52.348 --> 27:54.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we're going to turn into the literary podcast.

27:55.775 --> 28:01.877
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar cutscene directors.

28:03.857 --> 28:08.318
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.

28:08.698 --> 28:16.320
[SPEAKER_12]: He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.320
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:34.162 --> 28:45.187
[SPEAKER_12]: Focusing on the takeover of the American Embassy and outline the game saying that they're looking at about 8 to 10 different roles or different perspectives that are going to be in the game, different characters.

28:46.167 --> 28:51.090
[SPEAKER_12]: And initially you'll start the game off as like an Iranian but American-born U.S.

28:51.730 --> 28:58.193
[SPEAKER_12]: State Department translator who is, I guess, coming in with the objective to try to free the U.S.

28:58.273 --> 28:58.893
[SPEAKER_12]: hostages.

29:00.791 --> 29:03.612
[SPEAKER_12]: So, interesting subject, I suppose.

29:05.233 --> 29:14.577
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying that, obviously, it's going to be a social-political title, and there's going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.

29:14.597 --> 29:22.541
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's not a sandbox game.

29:23.101 --> 29:34.190
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting subject.

29:34.310 --> 29:42.096
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, before I was born, so I'm not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened.

29:42.717 --> 29:44.078
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're calling us old then, basically?

29:44.538 --> 29:45.639
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I am calling you old.

29:45.839 --> 29:47.200
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:08.954 --> 30:23.140
[SPEAKER_04]: or like you can change history in it I don't know but then again I love civilization so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now but it's different I can't explain it it's different is this a game you're interested in playing Loki?

30:23.300 --> 30:36.865
[SPEAKER_12]: not really it doesn't sound that interesting even with the Grand Theft no because it's a guy who was a cutscene director I mean so what they directed stuff it's not the people actually I don't know it doesn't really count

30:37.421 --> 30:39.003
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

30:53.740 --> 30:55.061
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

31:11.275 --> 31:17.761
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this maybe a way... Because all of us in the room admit we weren't really old enough to understand what was going on at the time.

31:18.501 --> 31:23.285
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened?

31:24.206 --> 31:25.027
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it could be.

31:25.567 --> 31:28.230
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I just don't care.

31:29.491 --> 31:29.931
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

31:30.011 --> 31:32.273
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.

31:32.833 --> 31:35.656
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like I wouldn't want a game based off of...

31:37.563 --> 31:38.684
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, most of history.

31:38.804 --> 31:40.865
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't really give a crap about history.

31:42.205 --> 31:50.810
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.

31:53.111 --> 32:02.036
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could just go and read everything, which I have.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.317
[SPEAKER_07]: I go back and read history books for fun.

32:05.029 --> 32:09.492
[SPEAKER_12]: The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer Red Alert.

32:09.573 --> 32:14.516
[SPEAKER_12]: Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.

32:15.077 --> 32:15.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the funny thing.

32:16.538 --> 32:23.724
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know is stretching it a little bit, but that's going way back.

32:23.744 --> 32:25.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Battle of Olympus on the NES?

32:25.125 --> 32:26.145
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.948
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.

32:29.588 --> 32:37.894
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they were to make a video game on other recent historical things, let's be honest, if they were to make a game on 9-11, that's not a game.

32:38.154 --> 32:40.236
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.

32:40.516 --> 32:43.278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not... Games are... I don't know.

32:43.298 --> 32:44.178
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to be entertaining.

32:44.198 --> 32:45.619
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you even make a game out of that?

32:45.659 --> 32:46.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully there isn't one.

32:48.401 --> 32:52.224
[SPEAKER_04]: But how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?

32:52.284 --> 32:52.985
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

32:53.085 --> 32:53.665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

32:53.745 --> 32:55.726
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let me put this, though, into perspective, okay?

32:56.867 --> 32:57.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Say that...

33:00.390 --> 33:02.992
[SPEAKER_07]: World War II just ended three months ago.

33:03.913 --> 33:06.535
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone wants to put 1942 on the market.

33:09.758 --> 33:10.578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.

33:11.439 --> 33:12.700
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.521
[SPEAKER_11]: That wouldn't fly.

33:13.781 --> 33:14.001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

33:14.982 --> 33:19.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?

33:19.946 --> 33:21.447
[SPEAKER_04]: There's zillions and zillions.

33:21.928 --> 33:25.371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.

33:26.226 --> 33:27.728
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:46.311 --> 33:47.472
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34:08.146 --> 34:13.932
[SPEAKER_12]: If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a stealth game where you investigate where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.

34:32.993 --> 34:35.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Return of Time Pilot, maybe.

34:35.297 --> 34:37.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?

34:38.442 --> 34:39.183
[SPEAKER_04]: Modernize that.

34:39.884 --> 34:42.086
[SPEAKER_12]: Way off topic here, but he brought it up.

34:43.066 --> 34:43.807
[SPEAKER_12]: Melgar Solid.

34:44.107 --> 34:49.071
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Melgar Solid style game set in like a high school or something like that?

34:49.091 --> 34:53.734
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just like a high school kid or something and all very sneaky around and stuff.

34:53.774 --> 34:54.855
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you shooting people?

34:54.875 --> 34:56.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's not going to go over very well.

34:56.436 --> 34:57.296
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not shooting people.

34:57.336 --> 35:00.659
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.

35:00.679 --> 35:01.860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like gossip.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.201
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be the Mean Girls game.

35:04.281 --> 35:07.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this like puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip

35:08.024 --> 35:14.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Biotch of the School, where you like eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.690
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.411
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like way too dramatic.

35:19.591 --> 35:22.052
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just like everything way over-dramatized.

35:22.072 --> 35:28.596
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just ridiculously amount, a ridiculous amount of drama to the game.

35:29.516 --> 35:30.117
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be awesome.

35:31.057 --> 35:32.238
[SPEAKER_12]: No one has that kind of sense of humor.

35:32.479 --> 35:43.788
[SPEAKER_12]: But Konami, I can see that you have that sense of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and... God, what was that crappy high school dating game that they had on the PSP?

35:44.749 --> 35:48.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't even... I remember the game, I don't remember what it was called.

35:50.093 --> 35:55.318
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyways, see, I think all those things can be fixed with a little bit of the middle of your soul thrown in.

35:56.212 --> 36:05.456
[SPEAKER_12]: And hell, if you want to be funny even better, even better if you want to be a little bit more funny, you can have the principal or dean to be actually Old Snake.

36:05.516 --> 36:06.316
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be hilarious.

36:07.697 --> 36:09.538
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know?

36:12.108 --> 36:12.388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

36:13.009 --> 36:17.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon.

36:17.572 --> 36:21.995
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this week.

36:22.435 --> 36:25.337
[SPEAKER_04]: And they announced a lot of new games that are coming out.

36:25.837 --> 36:28.379
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first is the Fables series.

36:28.759 --> 36:30.440
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the comic book series Fables.

36:30.801 --> 36:32.642
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012.

36:33.903 --> 36:36.464
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the games that they are working on right now.

36:36.484 --> 36:39.086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of fairy tales.

36:39.867 --> 36:40.867
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

36:43.008 --> 37:11.654
[SPEAKER_04]: characters from various fairy tales like Snow White, Pinocchio and this stuff they get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City so like if you're thinking like Fables is like oh it's like a Hansel and Gretel no no no no no no it's very different I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic Vertigo which is DC's sort of more I want to say adult but they're more serial like mature imprint they put Fables out I have the two first volumes and it's awesome

37:11.983 --> 37:27.484
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually just, we talked about a new issue that came out which is a Cinderella based one where she's an assassin So it's like Enchanted but Enchanted meets Leon Professional Pretty much How do you think it's going to translate into a game?

37:27.524 --> 37:28.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you that know the books pretty well

37:29.486 --> 37:33.829
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it could do it.

37:34.049 --> 37:34.910
[SPEAKER_11]: They cuss a lot.

37:35.650 --> 37:40.413
[SPEAKER_11]: Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F-bomb in the comic.

37:40.773 --> 37:43.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Beauty and the Beast go see her for marital problems.

37:43.575 --> 37:45.016
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's like, I'm not a caseworker.

37:45.076 --> 37:45.716
[SPEAKER_11]: Leave me alone.

37:46.417 --> 37:49.479
[SPEAKER_11]: If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.

37:49.499 --> 37:50.239
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you asking me?

37:50.319 --> 37:51.880
[SPEAKER_04]: I get banged by seven different dwarves.

37:52.020 --> 37:52.321
[SPEAKER_04]: F off.

37:53.481 --> 37:58.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up in the comic.

37:59.162 --> 38:05.643
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is Dorothy Gale.

38:06.824 --> 38:07.164
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

38:07.224 --> 38:08.824
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's codenamed Silver Slipper.

38:09.684 --> 38:09.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

38:10.424 --> 38:10.504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

38:10.524 --> 38:11.725
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they have the shoe thing going on.

38:11.965 --> 38:12.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be honest?

38:13.405 --> 38:16.766
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm, like, really interested.

38:16.826 --> 38:18.026
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to, like, borrow your books.

38:18.366 --> 38:19.166
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome.

38:20.387 --> 38:23.649
[SPEAKER_04]: I like things from my childhood like Really Really Messed Up.

38:25.229 --> 38:27.971
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.

38:29.031 --> 38:30.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?

38:30.792 --> 38:31.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

38:31.612 --> 38:38.656
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, Tiger Claw, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation of The Great Gatsby in 3, that's gonna make no fucking sense.

38:38.916 --> 38:48.020
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.381
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to say it's bad.

38:50.401 --> 38:51.082
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Moulin Rouge.

38:51.362 --> 38:51.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

38:51.643 --> 38:54.386
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't like this 3D orgy all these movies are having.

38:54.406 --> 38:55.087
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I understand that.

38:55.327 --> 38:57.069
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's, whatever.

38:57.189 --> 39:00.413
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.

39:01.274 --> 39:01.715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

39:01.855 --> 39:02.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

39:02.876 --> 39:03.777
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I love him.

39:04.198 --> 39:05.419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in 40!

39:06.340 --> 39:07.141
[SPEAKER_04]: With the Batman movies.

39:09.281 --> 39:13.184
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale Press event.

39:13.464 --> 39:15.385
[SPEAKER_04]: Jurassic Park is one of the other games.

39:15.425 --> 39:16.826
[SPEAKER_04]: We've known they've been working on this for a while.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.328
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed off a little more about the game, and it's going to be coming out in April.

39:20.869 --> 39:24.931
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently...

39:26.152 --> 39:31.576
[SPEAKER_04]: The story involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved.

39:31.596 --> 39:32.816
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could say the book too, of course.

39:34.117 --> 39:37.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, not to get off track, but I always found it interesting.

39:37.779 --> 39:40.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever read the sequel to the book?

39:41.142 --> 39:43.143
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jurassic Park, The Lost World, the book?

39:43.663 --> 39:47.305
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?

39:47.546 --> 39:47.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

39:47.946 --> 39:51.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back.

39:51.068 --> 39:51.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

39:51.328 --> 39:52.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have this done in two weeks

40:22.549 --> 40:24.530
[SPEAKER_04]: When he escapes, he gets killed, right?

40:24.570 --> 40:25.991
[SPEAKER_04]: But what was he trying to do?

40:26.051 --> 40:30.595
[SPEAKER_04]: He was trying to get out of there with the shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.

40:30.775 --> 40:31.916
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's never recovered.

40:31.956 --> 40:33.217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always assumed lost.

40:33.797 --> 40:38.620
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?

40:38.661 --> 40:39.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did it go?

40:39.361 --> 40:39.941
[SPEAKER_04]: Who found it?

40:39.961 --> 40:40.582
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they do with it?

40:41.262 --> 40:45.706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie.

40:46.587 --> 40:48.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty excited about this.

40:48.568 --> 40:49.409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be pretty awesome.

40:49.849 --> 40:52.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.

40:52.811 --> 40:54.713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's $5 off the regular price.

40:55.614 --> 40:56.675
[SPEAKER_04]: The Walking Dead.

40:57.135 --> 40:59.897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a show on AMC that a lot of people are really into.

41:00.077 --> 41:00.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a graphic novel.

41:01.218 --> 41:05.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.

41:07.343 --> 41:09.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?

41:10.045 --> 41:12.787
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the show at all, but you know the book and you know the show.

41:13.688 --> 41:16.610
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a book first and then it became the AMC show.

41:16.670 --> 41:20.493
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.

41:23.035 --> 41:25.897
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than I love stuff with zombies.

41:25.917 --> 41:26.978
[SPEAKER_11]: I never get bored of zombies.

41:27.799 --> 41:28.740
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

41:29.901 --> 41:32.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.

41:32.363 --> 41:34.546
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.

41:35.867 --> 41:39.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.

41:40.092 --> 41:44.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Hector Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.

41:45.497 --> 41:50.243
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult-like.

41:50.923 --> 41:59.326
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.

41:59.987 --> 42:10.351
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fanboy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really going to be making it.

42:11.071 --> 42:11.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that explains a lot.

42:11.691 --> 42:11.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

42:33.360 --> 43:00.059
[SPEAKER_04]: and the cool thing is though the silver lining people are still allowed to do their thing and you know they're putting out what the third game or they just put out the third series or third episode in their series so you know it's cool that that's able to coexist because you know what I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe so to speak why not we have all these you know like we were saying earlier World War 2 games we have TV shows we had two Star Trek shows on at the same time you know so why not

43:01.135 --> 43:09.362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and it's cool that one's free and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way, but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.

43:09.462 --> 43:09.922
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

43:10.583 --> 43:14.386
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals because I know they're really passionate about what they do.

43:14.846 --> 43:20.171
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, on one department you have the same group that made Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Telltale has a proven track record.

43:22.353 --> 43:23.113
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the pedigree.

43:23.293 --> 43:23.814
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

43:23.974 --> 43:25.996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.

43:27.056 --> 43:30.517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool that both are going to be coexisting and what have you.

43:30.797 --> 43:33.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited to see what they put out.

43:34.519 --> 43:38.480
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.

43:38.520 --> 43:42.942
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize she's living in a fort in the middle of the woods now and doesn't really do a lot with gaming.

43:42.962 --> 43:44.802
[SPEAKER_04]: They live in Yosemite or something weird.

43:44.962 --> 43:46.763
[SPEAKER_04]: They pretty much removed themselves from society.

43:47.043 --> 43:52.965
[SPEAKER_11]: So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy because I have so many video game memories tied to her and Ken.

43:53.505 --> 44:21.470
[SPEAKER_04]: and they just like I don't even think I have to say this because I think they already know but Telltale if they're going to be rebooting it we've got to have something as awesome as Rosella the fourth game and I think there will be nods they'll be winking nods to the old stuff I believe it so it'll be cool because they didn't say it's a remake it's a reboot more to be revealed at E3 so very cool very very cool so lots of news out of Telltale this week

44:22.955 --> 44:23.936
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44:44.953 --> 44:53.319
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off discs and then downloading a crack file so that they could play the discs.

44:54.180 --> 45:05.368
[SPEAKER_07]: And that now, because there are so many things that are included in the games now that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game goodies...

45:06.249 --> 45:23.151
[SPEAKER_07]: that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not going to get any of the bragging rights that go along with having the game and a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple systems who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it

45:23.972 --> 45:36.064
[SPEAKER_07]: and the other thing too is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost effective to run your own server for a lot of these games.

45:36.144 --> 45:43.351
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're playing Ragnarok Online.

45:43.471 --> 45:45.854
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.

45:46.374 --> 45:46.794
[SPEAKER_07]: I digress.

45:49.055 --> 45:50.636
[SPEAKER_04]: But the WoW ones are really jank.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.

45:53.457 --> 46:03.401
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters over.

46:04.178 --> 46:07.799
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?

46:08.100 --> 46:08.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they did.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.841
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that was really cool.

46:11.261 --> 46:17.023
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that you can't pirate a free game.

46:18.684 --> 46:19.324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you just...

46:20.791 --> 46:22.252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free anyway, so why not?

46:23.392 --> 46:28.935
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like, you know, if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server, then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself.

46:29.555 --> 46:33.777
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to, you know, getting the community content like how they did with Second Life, you know.

46:34.497 --> 46:44.302
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.

46:46.027 --> 46:49.750
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting the same experience that a person who pays for it does Unless it's Ragnarok Online

47:13.689 --> 47:34.888
[SPEAKER_07]: I like with your first person shooters that you've got servers set up for online play and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled if you've got a pirated version because I've noticed a few of those running about

47:36.297 --> 47:48.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've noticed a lot for more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever, Modern Warfare 2, StarCraft 2, even without the cinematics, these games are huge.

47:48.145 --> 47:52.608
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that at home, broadband connections are faster than they've ever been.

47:52.928 --> 47:56.971
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like 100 bucks.

47:57.411 --> 48:01.934
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70 gigs.

48:01.974 --> 48:02.134
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

48:03.175 --> 48:07.546
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's like, yeah, alright, leave it running overnight but it's like, that's just too much.

48:07.606 --> 48:08.529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather just buy it.

48:08.789 --> 48:09.411
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.

48:09.892 --> 48:11.637
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.

48:14.255 --> 48:14.595
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

48:14.635 --> 48:17.996
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what everyone would like to hear to think is that it's really slow.

48:18.016 --> 48:21.217
[SPEAKER_12]: But honestly, it doesn't take much.

48:21.517 --> 48:24.038
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.

48:24.078 --> 48:31.239
[SPEAKER_12]: They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.

48:31.659 --> 48:33.220
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have programs like JDownloader.

48:33.740 --> 48:39.002
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

48:58.567 --> 49:01.668
[SPEAKER_04]: This question is going to sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.

49:01.728 --> 49:03.788
[SPEAKER_04]: What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?

49:03.828 --> 49:11.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before they call your house and threaten you.

49:11.810 --> 49:15.651
[SPEAKER_04]: And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.

49:15.931 --> 49:20.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.

49:20.253 --> 49:25.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I want to say StarCraft II is at least 20.

49:26.566 --> 49:30.670
[SPEAKER_11]: Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's a big game.

49:31.070 --> 49:32.431
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but everything's compressed.

49:33.092 --> 49:39.517
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking like the most you're going to probably have two DVD 9 disc images or whatever.

49:39.857 --> 49:41.919
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at 18 gigs or something like that.

49:42.460 --> 49:48.024
[SPEAKER_12]: Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's going to be very difficult to hit your cap of 250 gigs.

49:49.445 --> 49:50.306
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you this now.

49:50.326 --> 49:55.748
[SPEAKER_07]: I download my episode of Supernatural every week because I'm at Temple on Friday night and so I miss it.

49:56.228 --> 50:11.033
[SPEAKER_07]: So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural and I've just downloaded the first four episodes of Being Human Season 3 and the first two of the American version of it like last night while I was playing World of Warcraft and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.

50:11.854 --> 50:12.774
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really not that hard.

50:13.996 --> 50:16.362
[SPEAKER_04]: TV shows are kind of a different thing though.

50:16.382 --> 50:20.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you not able to watch Supernatural online like on the official website or anything like that?

50:21.604 --> 50:32.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.

50:32.508 --> 50:42.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's Drag Race, every week.

50:43.571 --> 50:45.533
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on and watch that on LOGO's website.

50:45.854 --> 50:48.276
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch the Colbert Report.

50:48.636 --> 50:49.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.

50:49.738 --> 50:50.258
[SPEAKER_04]: The Daily Show.

50:50.298 --> 50:51.719
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even have to be like Hulu or whatever.

50:51.740 --> 50:52.460
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on the website.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Survivor, every week is there.

50:55.083 --> 51:02.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.

51:02.501 --> 51:04.242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way.

51:04.442 --> 51:05.162
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.

51:06.323 --> 51:11.765
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television is absolutely stupid.

51:12.325 --> 51:15.566
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being talked down to.

51:16.447 --> 51:20.589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it.

51:20.669 --> 51:27.331
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm in the middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish watching the episode.

51:27.451 --> 51:31.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I can go mining or something.

51:32.394 --> 51:34.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.

51:34.875 --> 51:37.576
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.

51:38.176 --> 51:39.217
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about King's Quest.

51:40.217 --> 51:44.538
[SPEAKER_04]: Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com saying, Reboot Space Quest.

51:45.219 --> 51:45.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

51:46.039 --> 51:54.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?

51:55.982 --> 51:57.323
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the Heroes games?

51:57.343 --> 52:02.146
[SPEAKER_11]: The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember anymore.

52:02.586 --> 52:04.207
[SPEAKER_11]: If they sign off on it, then hell yeah.

52:04.827 --> 52:06.908
[SPEAKER_11]: Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.

52:07.289 --> 52:09.690
[SPEAKER_04]: But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?

52:09.770 --> 52:13.292
[SPEAKER_04]: So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.

52:14.152 --> 52:14.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

52:14.452 --> 52:18.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably better left in the past.

52:20.066 --> 52:20.688
[SPEAKER_04]: But I digress.

52:20.768 --> 52:21.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

52:21.469 --> 52:22.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you have for us?

52:22.492 --> 52:30.110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great or good or worth playing.

52:30.780 --> 52:32.281
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

52:50.694 --> 52:54.617
[SPEAKER_12]: Plain Theft of Actual Games

53:13.150 --> 53:23.012
[SPEAKER_12]: Stole the game and the assets and everything else and put it up on the Apple App Store and were selling it for quite a long time.

53:23.152 --> 53:23.712
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.

53:23.752 --> 53:26.392
[SPEAKER_04]: This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.

53:26.952 --> 53:40.215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and it was just like they were trying to get people trying to get Apple's attention to get it taken down because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99 cent app and

53:42.075 --> 53:50.823
[SPEAKER_12]: It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy section of the App Store.

53:50.903 --> 53:55.807
[SPEAKER_12]: So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.

53:55.867 --> 53:57.648
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's finally back.

53:58.749 --> 54:01.511
[SPEAKER_12]: The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.

54:01.892 --> 54:02.092
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

54:03.553 --> 54:08.619
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.

54:08.659 --> 54:12.564
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, a lot of damage has been done and people already have the old version of the game.

54:12.764 --> 54:14.126
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it kind of sucks.

54:14.677 --> 54:15.737
[SPEAKER_04]: What can be done about this though?

54:15.757 --> 54:20.518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to screen for copyrighted stuff.

54:20.798 --> 54:24.739
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace, they'd kind of get that.

54:25.159 --> 54:29.840
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest, I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game either.

54:30.100 --> 54:30.320
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

54:30.760 --> 54:32.860
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have time to play everything.

54:33.240 --> 54:33.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.801
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you stop theft like that?

54:36.521 --> 54:40.322
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace does a peer review.

54:40.982 --> 54:41.802
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the answer?

54:42.042 --> 54:42.382
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

54:43.995 --> 54:46.277
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be the answer, I don't know.

54:46.577 --> 54:49.219
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not the only game they have that happened to it.

54:49.279 --> 54:54.042
[SPEAKER_12]: There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with fighting animals.

54:54.082 --> 54:55.463
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like a 3D fighter game.

54:56.203 --> 55:01.927
[SPEAKER_12]: And that actually had a version of it ripped off and put on there.

55:02.167 --> 55:11.954
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit different situation, that is people that they claimed they were sold the rights to the game and stuff like that, but the developer said, no, you only have the rights to this,

55:14.395 --> 55:15.736
[SPEAKER_12]: Flash Game, or something like that.

55:15.796 --> 55:16.916
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the rights to do this.

55:17.116 --> 55:18.936
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a big ol' thing about that.

55:18.996 --> 55:21.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not so much a blatant rip-off.

55:21.477 --> 55:23.758
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other.

55:26.098 --> 55:31.100
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.

55:31.620 --> 55:32.420
[SPEAKER_12]: Smurfs Village.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.301
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously a game that's out there.

55:34.361 --> 55:35.241
[SPEAKER_12]: It's free to play.

55:36.221 --> 55:37.181
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

55:54.406 --> 55:55.486
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

56:19.454 --> 56:19.754
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

56:35.100 --> 56:38.422
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you want to say, SalaciousBob?

56:38.682 --> 56:40.664
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even have kids in my household.

56:40.764 --> 56:42.585
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm usually very protective of my stuff.

56:42.905 --> 56:45.527
[SPEAKER_11]: For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.

56:45.587 --> 56:49.049
[SPEAKER_11]: I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.411
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be asked for my password every single time.

56:54.043 --> 57:15.050
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's also ways if you have kids and this is something that you're afraid that might happen there's a way you can also disable first off you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well you can also disable in app purchases and it's opt out though it's not opt in which is the problem it's opt out so you need to make sure you do that

57:15.330 --> 57:16.170
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

57:34.657 --> 57:35.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom's fault.

57:36.078 --> 57:39.659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down.

57:39.739 --> 57:45.741
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I haven't had to... Nobody uses my phone but me, so I haven't had to explore those options.

57:45.781 --> 57:46.722
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

57:46.762 --> 57:49.943
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree that they should lock it down, but they're also making it seem that it seems like...

57:50.723 --> 57:53.165
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids aren't even aware that it's costing money.

57:53.225 --> 57:54.185
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's my other thought.

57:54.445 --> 58:00.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that somewhat?

58:01.030 --> 58:03.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this?

58:03.631 --> 58:05.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess maybe some parents don't know.

58:05.433 --> 58:07.254
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not know it's a free Smurfs game.

58:09.238 --> 58:12.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think some onus is on the parents.

58:12.179 --> 58:14.600
[SPEAKER_04]: It is negligence on the parents' part for sure.

58:15.181 --> 58:16.781
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right.

58:16.901 --> 58:19.482
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.

58:19.542 --> 58:31.007
[SPEAKER_12]: They're making it as easy as possible for it to happen so that maybe, say, a kid racks up $30 worth of purchases or something like that.

58:31.347 --> 58:32.428
[SPEAKER_12]: The parent might go, shit.

58:33.388 --> 58:36.531
[SPEAKER_12]: but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded.

58:37.511 --> 58:42.956
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all of a sudden Capcom's giving them their money back.

58:42.996 --> 58:49.061
[SPEAKER_12]: But how many times is this happening that they're not getting their money back or not even trying to get their money back?

58:50.504 --> 59:01.772
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is, it doesn't say, this costs you $5.

59:02.812 --> 59:06.295
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, this costs you 20 fairy dust points.

59:06.655 --> 59:08.016
[SPEAKER_11]: So the kid's like, oh, okay.

59:08.216 --> 59:09.237
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they refill their...

59:10.037 --> 59:10.957
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

59:26.042 --> 59:27.502
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always a layer of... Party points?

59:27.542 --> 59:29.283
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't even... They didn't do Gil?

59:29.723 --> 59:32.944
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think... It's not really... I think they're just Squeenix coins or something like that.

59:33.064 --> 59:42.706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it doesn't actually talk about this is money, $4, because a kid might recognize that, but there's that sort of... I don't know.

59:42.726 --> 59:45.627
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a very... Some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.

59:46.127 --> 59:54.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod Touch, you can log off your account before giving it to a kid to play.

59:54.632 --> 59:55.592
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a suggestion.

59:56.293 --> 01:00:01.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store to keep their kids occupied.

01:00:01.676 --> 01:00:03.697
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them watching videos and playing games.

01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:06.258
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Link says, parents are being stupid.

01:00:06.338 --> 01:00:08.880
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two kids and I know about what these games do.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.021
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a clue.

01:00:10.201 --> 01:00:12.282
[SPEAKER_04]: If something is free, there's a catch.

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:15.943
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying, this is a problem.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:33.409
[SPEAKER_12]: So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has told Capcom in no uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:38.371
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your game.

01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:39.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Fix it.

01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:44.016
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what that means.

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.638
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.

01:00:46.658 --> 01:00:49.301
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, basically from Apple and credit card companies.

01:00:49.961 --> 01:00:53.885
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't authorize this charge.

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:57.208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's do a chargeback and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.

01:00:57.508 --> 01:00:58.409
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

01:01:00.279 --> 01:01:00.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:04.405
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think, though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.

01:01:04.505 --> 01:01:05.766
[SPEAKER_04]: They enabled this feature.

01:01:05.867 --> 01:01:07.529
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so easy to do.

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:10.172
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to kind of educate people.

01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:11.614
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're making money off of it.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:12.455
[SPEAKER_04]: They are making money.

01:01:13.176 --> 01:01:14.919
[SPEAKER_04]: And they approved Capcom's game.

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:17.642
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.

01:01:18.223 --> 01:01:21.166
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff.

01:01:21.246 --> 01:01:22.627
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Apple needs to own some of that.

01:01:22.647 --> 01:01:26.531
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not that difficult to patch this shit.

01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:27.232
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, fuck.

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:30.034
[SPEAKER_12]: There's games that patch themselves once a week.

01:01:30.114 --> 01:01:30.735
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on.

01:01:31.095 --> 01:01:32.797
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do it.

01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:33.738
[SPEAKER_12]: Just fix it.

01:01:34.904 --> 01:01:35.204
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:36.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what develops with that.

01:01:36.606 --> 01:01:41.130
[SPEAKER_12]: And there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention to what's going on with your kids.

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.650
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.252
[SPEAKER_04]: That still wouldn't stop it.

01:01:43.652 --> 01:01:43.952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:01:44.293 --> 01:01:46.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:52.120
[SPEAKER_04]: And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else is buying this game.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.305
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on all the big gaming blogs.

01:01:57.745 --> 01:01:58.126
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes...

01:01:58.846 --> 01:02:03.389
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true, they are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition.

01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:05.511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a Final Shipment.

01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:08.212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised they didn't call it like an Encore Shipment or something like that.

01:02:08.653 --> 01:02:19.000
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on a Wii disc.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.001
[SPEAKER_04]: No extra frills.

01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.342
[SPEAKER_04]: No nothing.

01:02:22.362 --> 01:02:24.443
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.

01:02:24.603 --> 01:02:25.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

01:02:25.964 --> 01:02:26.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:27.505
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare I?

01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:49.813
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but basically here's the thing.

01:02:49.953 --> 01:02:51.194
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not in large quantities.

01:02:51.374 --> 01:02:53.336
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be just as limited as it was before.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.238
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just releasing a few more.

01:02:55.298 --> 01:02:58.562
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.

01:02:58.822 --> 01:03:03.247
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack shit, basically.

01:03:03.707 --> 01:03:11.249
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited, but hey, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.

01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:19.731
[SPEAKER_12]: But honestly, just tell yourself, it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to port it over to the Wii.

01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:20.771
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all it is.

01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:24.032
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want that soundtrack and you want that book...

01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.592
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, I guess, but I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:31.594
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:39.279
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.

01:03:39.379 --> 01:03:46.823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.

01:03:48.044 --> 01:03:51.045
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they want more for it, talk them down.

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:58.788
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that this game is going for that much money online and the fact that they're like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.

01:03:59.288 --> 01:03:59.888
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what that means?

01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:02.569
[SPEAKER_12]: More of this shit is going to happen coming soon.

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:06.850
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you bet your ass that they're going to fucking reprint that goddamn.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:11.392
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember the Legend of Zelda bonus that they had for preordering Wind Waker and shit?

01:04:11.612 --> 01:04:12.112
[SPEAKER_12]: How much you want?

01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:14.513
[SPEAKER_12]: But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.

01:04:14.633 --> 01:04:20.958
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.

01:04:21.878 --> 01:04:23.680
[SPEAKER_04]: But they could always do more GameCube games.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:29.204
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS or Mario Kart or whatever.

01:04:29.964 --> 01:04:32.526
[SPEAKER_12]: They could easily do it for another system.

01:04:32.806 --> 01:04:39.291
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them and people are dumb enough to purchase them.

01:04:40.092 --> 01:04:40.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's also be real.

01:04:40.812 --> 01:04:41.873
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is coming out on the Wii?

01:04:43.888 --> 01:04:47.169
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that awesome looking roleplaying game in Japan that's not coming out here.

01:04:47.189 --> 01:04:51.130
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports Mix.

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:52.431
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't announced a new title.

01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:54.892
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.

01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:57.653
[SPEAKER_12]: This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?

01:04:58.233 --> 01:04:58.293
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

01:04:59.508 --> 01:04:59.868
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

01:05:26.616 --> 01:05:26.996
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:05:27.436 --> 01:05:28.277
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't really have a lot.

01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:31.078
[SPEAKER_12]: They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff.

01:05:32.039 --> 01:05:32.399
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

01:05:33.159 --> 01:05:34.820
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, more news.

01:05:35.941 --> 01:05:36.521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.434
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have news.

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:55.427
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this is going to seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.

01:05:55.587 --> 01:05:58.950
[SPEAKER_04]: How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:25.845
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's Psychophysiology Lab and Biofeedback Clinic So it at least has a reputable study that was done about it They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression And they played Bejeweled 2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle And they all experienced a significant reduction in anxiety and better mood

01:06:27.006 --> 01:06:42.729
[SPEAKER_04]: does this explain why sometimes and I don't know how many of y'all do this but like when I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home but I'm just I'm just not feeling you know it's raining out I'm just feeling kind of blah I'll sit there on Facebook and play that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour like is that tie into this

01:06:44.663 --> 01:06:45.564
[SPEAKER_07]: I will admit something.

01:06:46.904 --> 01:06:50.587
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that towards the end of my job period I was very unhappy.

01:06:51.427 --> 01:06:52.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Very unhappy.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.029
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.

01:06:57.370 --> 01:07:01.933
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk and I would always feel better.

01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:06.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.

01:07:08.956 --> 01:07:21.965
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks but it was just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air and I found I could get back to work and do fine.

01:07:23.086 --> 01:07:25.668
[SPEAKER_04]: But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:30.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:31.392
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it for years.

01:07:33.021 --> 01:07:34.142
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not for blowing off stress.

01:07:35.042 --> 01:07:37.264
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes my coworkers more stressful.

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:42.467
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your way to relax?

01:07:42.527 --> 01:07:44.668
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your way to kind of unwind at work, right?

01:07:45.048 --> 01:07:46.169
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit?

01:07:46.189 --> 01:07:48.270
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really matter.

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:51.953
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.213
[SPEAKER_12]: People like games.

01:07:53.233 --> 01:07:54.274
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's lots of things.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:08:00.076
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't sit and do that with Final Fantasy 2, for example, which I was still playing on my phone.

01:08:00.736 --> 01:08:02.658
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.

01:08:03.098 --> 01:08:05.821
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game.

01:08:07.662 --> 01:08:15.830
[SPEAKER_07]: But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back to later, it's easier.

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.573
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.

01:08:20.825 --> 01:08:26.299
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard, and clearly I'm not alone.

01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:56.357
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt in our chatroom says I can attest to this, ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty Rickster in our chatroom says maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax play modes interesting, that is true Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but

01:08:57.097 --> 01:08:57.557
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:08:59.519 --> 01:09:12.166
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really just casual games or if other games are involved in it.

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:14.928
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do see where...

01:09:15.808 --> 01:09:18.189
[SPEAKER_07]: New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.

01:09:43.948 --> 01:09:50.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.

01:09:51.673 --> 01:09:52.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they don't frighten me.

01:09:52.853 --> 01:09:53.814
[SPEAKER_07]: The games don't frighten me.

01:09:54.854 --> 01:09:55.575
[SPEAKER_07]: People frighten me.

01:09:55.695 --> 01:09:56.015
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:58.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:04.280
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.422
[SPEAKER_07]: People freak me out more than the game does.

01:10:08.202 --> 01:10:09.243
[SPEAKER_07]: And fake blood freaks me out.

01:10:09.881 --> 01:10:16.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, video games do help you relax until you start kicking and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.

01:10:16.827 --> 01:10:19.770
[SPEAKER_04]: They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.451
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what stresses me the hell out?

01:10:22.192 --> 01:10:24.213
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing fighting games with Dan.

01:10:24.714 --> 01:10:25.895
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's a dick.

01:10:27.136 --> 01:10:27.757
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

01:10:29.418 --> 01:10:30.679
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's a jerk when he wins.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.300
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a sore winner.

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:40.445
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.

01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:41.345
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start in the U.S.

01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:41.826
[SPEAKER_04]: with Loki.

01:10:42.046 --> 01:10:45.827
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out this week, which is pretty cool.

01:10:47.268 --> 01:10:50.409
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you I was playing.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.

01:10:54.051 --> 01:10:59.656
[SPEAKER_12]: But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox 360.

01:10:59.716 --> 01:11:04.139
[SPEAKER_12]: That includes early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.781
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.

01:11:06.181 --> 01:11:11.165
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also the Limited Edition, which is on PS3 and PC.

01:11:11.285 --> 01:11:13.767
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can check those out.

01:11:14.428 --> 01:11:18.591
[SPEAKER_12]: Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.

01:11:18.631 --> 01:11:20.613
[SPEAKER_12]: That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:11:21.493 --> 01:11:23.534
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let's see here.

01:11:23.554 --> 01:11:27.516
[SPEAKER_12]: Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles with the soundtrack.

01:11:27.596 --> 01:11:29.657
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.

01:11:31.218 --> 01:11:36.820
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice, and Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.922
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlas saying that they're marking some of that stuff down.

01:11:40.642 --> 01:11:41.703
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are coming out this week as well.

01:11:42.043 --> 01:11:51.969
[SPEAKER_12]: The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:52.650
[SPEAKER_12]: All for $30.

01:11:56.172 --> 01:12:17.769
[SPEAKER_12]: Night's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Trackmania, Built to Race Trackmania is an awesome game on PC so you should definitely check it out if you have a Wii that'll be coming out on Wii and I believe also on DS as well it's such a great racing game

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:22.673
[SPEAKER_12]: and then a crappy game called Rec Room.

01:12:22.793 --> 01:12:23.834
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out on DS.

01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:24.874
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a portable Wii game.

01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:26.135
[SPEAKER_12]: Party stuff.

01:12:26.796 --> 01:12:27.016
[SPEAKER_12]: Fun.

01:12:27.796 --> 01:12:32.499
[SPEAKER_12]: Blob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3.

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:36.362
[SPEAKER_12]: No PC on that, I guess.

01:12:36.522 --> 01:12:39.264
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the original Da Blah, but it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.

01:12:39.825 --> 01:12:42.707
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.

01:12:43.607 --> 01:12:46.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people don't remember the first one so well.

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:47.711
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of one of those under the radar.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:51.093
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a PlayStation 3 that doesn't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.

01:12:51.113 --> 01:12:51.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yippee.

01:12:57.805 --> 01:13:00.566
[SPEAKER_12]: Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.

01:13:01.026 --> 01:13:01.706
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

01:13:03.367 --> 01:13:09.950
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius, that's coming out on PC this week.

01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:11.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably is another expansion.

01:13:12.092 --> 01:13:13.252
[SPEAKER_04]: EverQuest loves their expansions.

01:13:13.812 --> 01:13:14.313
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised.

01:13:14.333 --> 01:13:17.254
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of interesting that they're doing that.

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:18.275
[SPEAKER_12]: And then...

01:13:21.141 --> 01:13:21.601
[SPEAKER_12]: What else?

01:13:23.262 --> 01:13:35.869
[SPEAKER_12]: Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life If you like those hidden picture type games, that's coming out on DS this week That's basically it

01:13:37.265 --> 01:13:40.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:47.201
[SPEAKER_04]: This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called Muchi Muchi Pork and Pink Sweets.

01:13:48.002 --> 01:13:49.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's really what it's called.

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Cave, so, uh...

01:13:54.298 --> 01:13:54.818
[SPEAKER_04]: It never came out here.

01:14:20.114 --> 01:14:20.414
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:43.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Lave Once, Mermaid's Tears Makai Senkei Disgaea 4

01:14:59.066 --> 01:15:17.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Rune Factory Oceans comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 Moving on to the Nintendo Wii real quick to see if there's anything coming out in Japan Yeah, they get Rune Factory Oceans there as well And then SD Gundam G Generation World Like we really need another super deformed Gundam

01:15:18.643 --> 01:15:35.212
[SPEAKER_04]: you know you love your Gundam games don't lie also it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan it comes out on February 26th I seriously thought about you know the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing that and I was like no

01:15:36.653 --> 01:15:38.554
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, this is the big week, guys.

01:15:38.694 --> 01:16:05.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Winning 11 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, let's see, Nintendogs Plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle Editions, Leighton Koju to Kisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Leighton, and Combat of Giants Dinosaur 3D.

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:13.685
[SPEAKER_04]: all of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week so that's Saturday, that's the 26th so what games are you going to get on the 3DS when it comes out?

01:16:14.907 --> 01:16:20.076
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats and maybe the Street Fighter game

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:22.378
[SPEAKER_11]: You make bad decisions.

01:16:42.655 --> 01:16:47.238
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Dead or Alive didn't really interest me that much, but Street Fighter, whatever.

01:16:47.418 --> 01:16:49.419
[SPEAKER_12]: But Dead or Alive, not coming out at launch.

01:16:49.799 --> 01:16:50.379
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming out in May.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:56.043
[SPEAKER_12]: Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kind of cool, coming out in May.

01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:58.084
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not coming out right away.

01:16:58.884 --> 01:17:01.245
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?

01:17:01.426 --> 01:17:01.766
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:03.607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to wait until May.

01:17:04.307 --> 01:17:26.660
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks cool, I actually wanna, I don't know, I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it, I can't control it I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like living expenses You know what, if I was in that situation, I would probably do the same thing

01:17:27.091 --> 01:17:28.713
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we've paid off all our bills.

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:31.695
[SPEAKER_12]: I would sell stuff in the house.

01:17:32.095 --> 01:17:36.239
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not even any rational reason.

01:17:36.339 --> 01:17:38.241
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just ridiculous stuff.

01:17:38.261 --> 01:17:40.783
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's talking that he wants the PlayStation phone.

01:17:40.963 --> 01:17:44.506
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pilotwings game looks pretty awesome if it were coming out at launch.

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:45.487
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's not at launch?

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:47.089
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't announced their launch titles.

01:17:47.109 --> 01:17:50.051
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.

01:17:50.351 --> 01:17:52.033
[SPEAKER_12]: Which means they're like, oh, we got nothing.

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob, can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing it?

01:17:58.502 --> 01:18:00.723
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see this, but I'm flipping you off right now.

01:18:01.063 --> 01:18:05.144
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my place.

01:18:06.024 --> 01:18:07.365
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are assholes.

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:10.406
[SPEAKER_04]: What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?

01:18:11.406 --> 01:18:13.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Kid Icarus, because you don't play portable games at all.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:13.807
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not coming out at launch.

01:18:14.007 --> 01:18:15.727
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's, yeah, I can wait though.

01:18:15.767 --> 01:18:16.568
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously you can't.

01:18:16.788 --> 01:18:19.669
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, launch window games as they're going to, they're like...

01:18:20.769 --> 01:18:21.730
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Nintendo.

01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:22.290
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:23.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Launch window games.

01:18:23.651 --> 01:18:26.373
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, from launch to three months after launch.

01:18:26.433 --> 01:18:27.694
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a window.

01:18:27.794 --> 01:18:29.975
[SPEAKER_12]: That is... Launch window is that week.

01:18:30.175 --> 01:18:31.456
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a launch window.

01:18:32.997 --> 01:18:34.598
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't launch for three months.

01:18:35.159 --> 01:18:35.779
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a launch.

01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:36.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, three months is a quarter.

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.941
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the difference between Q2 and Q3.

01:18:38.981 --> 01:18:40.262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, yeah.

01:18:40.562 --> 01:18:45.205
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, but anyways, if we're going to say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool.

01:18:45.306 --> 01:18:45.866
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream Trigger.

01:18:46.106 --> 01:18:49.268
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a shooter music game, which is kind of cool.

01:18:50.209 --> 01:18:50.309
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

01:18:52.156 --> 01:18:59.081
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate even wanting to say this, but the new Spongebob squiggle pants, the one that's like... No, no, no.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like WarioWare.

01:19:01.823 --> 01:19:04.565
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a WarioWare type game.

01:19:05.225 --> 01:19:08.848
[SPEAKER_04]: I got not to get... Oh, what was I going to... Not the Spongebob, but the other one.

01:19:09.228 --> 01:19:12.691
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask about... Oh, music shooter games.

01:19:12.911 --> 01:19:14.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a definitive date for Child of Eden yet?

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:15.893
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say we have.

01:19:15.913 --> 01:19:16.853
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like in June right now.

01:19:16.873 --> 01:19:17.154
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:17.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:19:18.195 --> 01:19:20.657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's got a date on it.

01:19:20.937 --> 01:19:25.101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll get there, but I never did the PSP ones because everybody was bitching at me about winning the 3DS.

01:19:25.482 --> 01:19:27.464
[SPEAKER_04]: So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan.

01:19:27.804 --> 01:19:35.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.

01:19:35.412 --> 01:19:37.314
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now ma'am, we may go to the UK.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:40.096
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 22nd, we have Cities in Motion for PC.

01:19:40.316 --> 01:19:43.578
[SPEAKER_07]: The 23rd, we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled Blitz Live.

01:19:43.698 --> 01:19:46.981
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 24th, Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm.

01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:48.642
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Deblob 2.

01:19:49.622 --> 01:20:06.895
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Grey Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling Together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.

01:20:08.812 --> 01:20:09.672
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm efficient.

01:20:12.033 --> 01:20:14.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.

01:20:14.854 --> 01:20:15.154
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:20:15.714 --> 01:20:20.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see how efficient she is on that.

01:20:20.695 --> 01:20:22.636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

01:20:22.856 --> 01:20:28.718
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of odd, but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's in, so...

01:20:30.256 --> 01:20:32.459
[SPEAKER_12]: What's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?

01:20:32.499 --> 01:20:34.921
[SPEAKER_12]: They're releasing tablets.

01:20:35.002 --> 01:20:39.587
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were first coming around.

01:20:41.112 --> 01:20:41.492
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.

01:21:08.644 --> 01:21:11.727
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, they do have the S1 tablet.

01:21:12.207 --> 01:21:17.972
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a PlayStation Suite certified tablet, which means it's going to be running the Android operating system.

01:21:18.892 --> 01:21:22.435
[SPEAKER_12]: And they haven't really said what it's going to look like.

01:21:22.775 --> 01:21:28.100
[SPEAKER_12]: Although there was a rumored design, it was some sort of tablet that actually folds.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:33.664
[SPEAKER_12]: It has like a screen that actually bends, which is kind of funky, but cool, I guess.

01:21:34.385 --> 01:21:34.545
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:39.048
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:22:03.086
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and PlayStation Network services, delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across the... I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.

01:22:03.647 --> 01:22:03.727
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh...

01:22:05.728 --> 01:22:28.499
[SPEAKER_12]: so yeah they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out in the market and it plays PlayStation 1 games no one I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch to play a PlayStation 1 game on a goddamn tablet it's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of signed agreed

01:22:29.794 --> 01:22:30.835
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's the other thing, too.

01:22:31.055 --> 01:22:36.700
[SPEAKER_12]: Why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what?

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:41.204
[SPEAKER_12]: We may just extend this PlayStation Suite to the Apple iPad or something like that.

01:22:41.584 --> 01:22:46.368
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot more people, I'm sure, have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever, and they can play their games on there.

01:22:46.388 --> 01:22:57.818
[SPEAKER_12]: But I, for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because, one, it would take up a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity.

01:22:58.138 --> 01:23:10.843
[SPEAKER_04]: and two, it would play like shit because touch controls here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be dead when I start using it for the first time right?

01:23:11.884 --> 01:23:12.804
[SPEAKER_12]: that's the real question

01:23:15.069 --> 01:23:15.429
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:37.140
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wait it out.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.962
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, there's no need to rush in to play PlayStation 1 games.

01:23:41.022 --> 01:23:51.328
[SPEAKER_12]: If you really need to play PlayStation 1 games, you can get a PlayStation 1, a PlayStation 2, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer.

01:23:51.528 --> 01:23:53.789
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just wait.

01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:55.931
[SPEAKER_12]: There are plenty of ways to do it.

01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:58.152
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something you shouldn't wait for.

01:23:58.832 --> 01:24:03.493
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should buy it new.

01:24:03.894 --> 01:24:08.215
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.

01:24:08.595 --> 01:24:17.158
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.

01:24:17.238 --> 01:24:19.899
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.

01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:22.382
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.

01:24:23.403 --> 01:24:28.490
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the PlayStation 3 used.

01:24:28.971 --> 01:24:35.320
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, just want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official quote on this, that's why this is news this week, because they did make a comment on it.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:43.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the PSN key has been consumed with a disc, it cannot be resold or replayed with the second user adding a sub.

01:24:43.844 --> 01:24:47.206
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the original consumer can use that account.

01:24:47.546 --> 01:24:51.708
[SPEAKER_04]: They say the retail disc and the PSN code, they are one and the same.

01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:53.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you use it, it is gone.

01:24:53.949 --> 01:24:56.490
[SPEAKER_04]: A second-hand user cannot obtain a new code.

01:24:56.610 --> 01:25:02.880
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only reason this is happening and just because it's an MMO and because it has a 30-day free trial.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:09.230
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, people would just be able to pop it in the different systems or just loan it to friends and have 30-day trials for everybody.

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:09.751
[SPEAKER_12]: Which...

01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:13.243
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, honestly, it's not a bad idea.

01:25:13.303 --> 01:25:14.984
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good way to get people hooked on your game.

01:25:15.064 --> 01:25:20.308
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single game out there.

01:25:20.948 --> 01:25:22.790
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when they do that, people will be pissed.

01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:24.951
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, you know, this is all right.

01:25:25.332 --> 01:25:26.913
[SPEAKER_12]: This is expected with an MMO.

01:25:27.679 --> 01:25:31.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, with an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.

01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:45.909
[SPEAKER_11]: So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really care where you... Like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:50.472
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to go out and buy another disc because that serial number is attached to my subscription.

01:25:50.732 --> 01:25:55.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than buying them through Blizzard, but they still work.

01:25:55.575 --> 01:25:56.395
[SPEAKER_04]: And you shouldn't be such a...

01:26:19.282 --> 01:26:19.882
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

01:26:37.888 --> 01:26:47.622
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, in theory, say your friend has the game also and he lost his disc and you're a kind soul and want to loan him your disc, that is absolutely fine.

01:26:47.642 --> 01:26:48.683
[SPEAKER_12]: It will work just fine.

01:26:48.763 --> 01:26:53.090
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to play it.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:54.692
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no extra code.

01:26:56.696 --> 01:27:03.939
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you cancelled your subscription.

01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:31.001
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360.

01:27:31.962 --> 01:27:37.085
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in the game and get 30 days free.

01:27:37.145 --> 01:27:41.148
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and here's the other thing, too, about the DC Universe thing.

01:27:41.308 --> 01:27:46.091
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just say it's not as prone as the 360, but let's say your system dies.

01:27:47.992 --> 01:27:48.312
[SPEAKER_12]: Crack.

01:27:49.533 --> 01:27:50.513
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's tied to your system.

01:27:52.955 --> 01:27:54.476
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess you have to call their customer service.

01:27:55.717 --> 01:27:55.977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:56.468 --> 01:27:57.789
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, I got one more.

01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:59.111
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, I lied.

01:27:59.151 --> 01:27:59.471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

01:27:59.511 --> 01:28:00.492
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my last story.

01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:03.475
[SPEAKER_04]: So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.

01:28:04.416 --> 01:28:12.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online for 30 days for free in serial numbers.

01:28:12.664 --> 01:28:18.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to a day when we had a single player game in front of us on the TV and we liked it.

01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:21.904
[SPEAKER_07]: Psycho Soldier Psycho Soldier

01:28:46.502 --> 01:28:50.206
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just a little girl with power inside, burning bright...

01:29:05.987 --> 01:29:06.628
[SPEAKER_11]: Vocal Soundtrack

01:29:27.147 --> 01:29:37.690
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a sequel to SNK's Athena and this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character Athena Asamiya comes from as well as C. Kenzo.

01:29:38.951 --> 01:29:41.692
[SPEAKER_04]: As that NES game way back in the game, right?

01:29:42.052 --> 01:29:42.272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:29:42.572 --> 01:29:44.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

01:29:44.533 --> 01:29:50.875
[SPEAKER_07]: This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad in 1987.

01:29:53.411 --> 01:29:55.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you just asked for.

01:29:55.752 --> 01:29:58.793
[SPEAKER_11]: There's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.

01:29:59.134 --> 01:30:01.815
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play a little bit of that.

01:30:02.015 --> 01:30:04.456
I'm jamming.

01:30:04.536 --> 01:30:05.496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm jamming.

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:16.785
[SPEAKER_04]: Better singing.

01:30:16.825 --> 01:30:17.926
[SPEAKER_04]: A little less screeching, yeah.

01:30:32.373 --> 01:30:35.777
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, she's running around with psychic abilities.

01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:39.702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to.

01:30:40.123 --> 01:30:42.165
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you could just run into a wall.

01:30:42.746 --> 01:30:46.370
[SPEAKER_07]: Or into a trap or something that would just completely kill you.

01:30:47.452 --> 01:30:47.532
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:30:48.953 --> 01:31:11.166
[SPEAKER_07]: So, her buddy Seikenso is player 2, and it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12 as their default outfits, I believe, or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game anyway.

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:19.643
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of this theme.

01:31:19.823 --> 01:31:21.867
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think I put one in as well.

01:31:23.021 --> 01:31:26.003
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.

01:31:26.264 --> 01:31:27.404
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's a side-scroller.

01:31:27.424 --> 01:31:28.285
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got different levels.

01:31:28.325 --> 01:31:30.587
[SPEAKER_07]: You have rocks and destructible objects.

01:31:31.127 --> 01:31:31.988
[SPEAKER_07]: You can blow them up.

01:31:32.588 --> 01:31:33.829
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got different enemies.

01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:39.213
[SPEAKER_07]: And you basically go horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects.

01:31:39.253 --> 01:31:41.896
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can use your psycho energy to get different attacks.

01:31:42.436 --> 01:31:47.420
[SPEAKER_07]: Either by using a shield of rotating spheres, which was one of her moves in King of Fighters.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.942
[SPEAKER_04]: And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.

01:31:49.962 --> 01:31:50.042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:31:52.203 --> 01:31:52.304
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

01:31:54.326 --> 01:32:02.034
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the special items happen to be different.

01:32:02.754 --> 01:32:08.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.

01:32:09.821 --> 01:32:16.328
[SPEAKER_07]: But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them, or rams them into an enemy.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:24.034
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu.

01:32:26.255 --> 01:32:30.438
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.

01:32:31.839 --> 01:32:34.622
[SPEAKER_07]: The song came out on a cassette.

01:32:35.522 --> 01:32:40.283
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only available for people who purchased the Famicom version of Athena.

01:32:41.243 --> 01:32:46.804
[SPEAKER_07]: So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending theme.

01:32:47.964 --> 01:32:51.845
[SPEAKER_07]: And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.

01:32:52.345 --> 01:32:55.926
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the Psychic Soldier team in 94 and King of Fighters 96.

01:32:56.886 --> 01:33:00.426
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was Athena's theme in King of Fighters 97 and King of Fighters 2002.

01:33:04.547 --> 01:33:13.653
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was an 87 by Imagine Software and it kind of got some decent success.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:20.497
[SPEAKER_07]: It got an 8 out of 10 for one rating and a 6 to 9 and 75% for other places but said it was really slow.

01:33:23.299 --> 01:33:26.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Athena and Kenzo have both been in the King of Fighters series.

01:33:26.581 --> 01:33:29.563
[SPEAKER_07]: They've also, of course, been in SNK vs. Capcom.

01:33:30.283 --> 01:33:30.964
[SPEAKER_07]: They were...

01:33:32.945 --> 01:34:01.558
[SPEAKER_07]: in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit and Kenso was in his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000 as Psycho Soldier Kenso also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystallis on the NES awesome and that's pretty much it it's a fun little waste of time I've got a main ROM of it

01:34:02.828 --> 01:34:04.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:07.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.

01:34:08.418 --> 01:34:09.300
[SPEAKER_07]: You see why it's notable?

01:34:09.961 --> 01:34:10.161
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

01:34:10.201 --> 01:34:12.626
[SPEAKER_07]: First in-game vocal soundtrack.

01:34:13.026 --> 01:34:13.267
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

01:34:13.387 --> 01:34:13.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

01:34:14.246 --> 01:34:20.910
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with Part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics.

01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:24.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to get those in, if you haven't already, at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:34:24.572 --> 01:34:32.496
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to get into some rapid news and including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise download content that showed up, among some other things.

01:34:32.936 --> 01:34:37.819
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, we have some more news development in a lawsuit against Activision.

01:34:38.219 --> 01:34:38.939
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk about that.

01:34:39.019 --> 01:34:42.821
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.

01:34:44.202 --> 01:34:49.649
[SPEAKER_04]: of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week it is all coming up when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:34:55.387 --> 01:34:57.908
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:57.948 --> 01:35:04.572
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this February the 20th of 2011 with the 402nd episode of our show.

01:35:04.972 --> 01:35:17.118
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to tune in live to us sometimes, visit us at www.orangeloungeradio.com and follow the link on over to allgames.com where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

01:35:17.538 --> 01:35:21.102
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics.

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:28.169
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling, playing this game, Bulletstorm.

01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:29.130
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so funny about it?

01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:29.491
[SPEAKER_04]: You like this?

01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:32.314
[SPEAKER_12]: There's just a lot of, like, I like the writing in it, I guess.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:33.575
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:35:56.796 --> 01:36:01.221
[SPEAKER_12]: Pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny.

01:36:01.782 --> 01:36:09.110
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they turn around and they see the corpse of the guy near the window with a sticky mine on the window.

01:36:09.731 --> 01:36:10.172
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's all...

01:36:12.113 --> 01:36:12.653
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn it.

01:36:13.014 --> 01:36:14.434
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the thing just explodes.

01:36:14.554 --> 01:36:15.014
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:36:15.054 --> 01:36:15.755
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty funny.

01:36:16.595 --> 01:36:16.955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:36:17.015 --> 01:36:20.497
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get into some plugs for the sideshows that we do.

01:36:20.577 --> 01:36:24.038
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?

01:36:24.198 --> 01:36:26.979
[SPEAKER_07]: Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.

01:36:30.101 --> 01:36:31.521
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually publish on Tuesdays.

01:36:31.601 --> 01:36:35.123
[SPEAKER_07]: We are at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

01:36:35.143 --> 01:36:40.185
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.

01:36:40.945 --> 01:36:41.726
[SPEAKER_07]: We are awesome!

01:36:42.326 --> 01:36:42.867
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to us.

01:36:43.447 --> 01:36:45.669
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

01:36:47.351 --> 01:36:53.156
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

01:36:53.676 --> 01:36:59.141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.

01:36:59.682 --> 01:37:03.585
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's available on iTunes and there will be a real website coming soon.

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:09.830
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.692
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your Twitter topics will be coming up.

01:37:11.752 --> 01:37:14.794
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is your very last chance to get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.

01:37:15.775 --> 01:37:17.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?

01:37:18.188 --> 01:37:20.470
[SPEAKER_12]: EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.

01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:23.791
[SPEAKER_12]: That's sad.

01:37:24.452 --> 01:37:26.293
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure.

01:37:26.453 --> 01:37:29.955
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a matter of when that time is and what we do with it.

01:37:29.995 --> 01:37:33.417
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a small team on it and I'm excited about what we'll do.

01:37:35.098 --> 01:37:36.959
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.

01:37:37.119 --> 01:37:40.501
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3 so I'm sure that's got a lot of...

01:37:42.322 --> 01:37:45.644
[SPEAKER_12]: Time being utilized on that and resources.

01:37:46.724 --> 01:37:52.368
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there will be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.

01:37:53.849 --> 01:37:57.431
[SPEAKER_12]: EA responded a little bit about it as well.

01:37:57.451 --> 01:38:03.075
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.

01:38:05.256 --> 01:38:07.857
[SPEAKER_12]: DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3.

01:38:08.698 --> 01:38:09.799
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing further to announce.

01:38:10.439 --> 01:38:14.445
[SPEAKER_12]: So, maybe down the line.

01:38:15.927 --> 01:38:17.670
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a pretty fun game, though.

01:38:18.251 --> 01:38:19.252
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully there will be a sequel.

01:38:20.865 --> 01:38:24.467
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out on the PlayStation 1 Classics.

01:38:24.828 --> 01:38:26.148
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.

01:38:27.409 --> 01:38:28.270
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally making its way out.

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:31.231
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, no JogCon support.

01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:32.092
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of sad.

01:38:33.593 --> 01:38:37.775
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be able to play the game, though, very soon, though, on the PSP and the PlayStation 3.

01:38:38.916 --> 01:38:47.060
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge Racer Unbound is coming out.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:47.701
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of neat.

01:38:49.843 --> 01:38:53.507
[SPEAKER_12]: No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.

01:38:55.810 --> 01:38:56.110
[SPEAKER_12]: March.

01:38:56.811 --> 01:39:01.837
[SPEAKER_12]: So probably around the time that the 3D versions come out.

01:39:03.433 --> 01:39:08.036
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pendulum Mixed Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me On Fire, and Salt In The Wounds

01:39:25.968 --> 01:39:29.569
[SPEAKER_12]: That is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:37.832
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft points each.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:44.334
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a little disappointed that they didn't have Hold Your Color or Self vs. Self, my two favorite songs on there.

01:39:44.774 --> 01:39:45.434
[SPEAKER_12]: But, hey, whatever.

01:39:45.514 --> 01:39:46.034
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty cool.

01:39:46.234 --> 01:39:48.455
[SPEAKER_12]: So definitely check that out since.

01:39:49.395 --> 01:40:14.880
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the last content you're getting yeah so since you know last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed is it safe to say the DJ Hero is being yes okay because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release I just sort of it's okay so yeah as of right now it is I mean who knows they could always change their mind just because they say oh we're never gonna do it again doesn't mean anything

01:40:16.294 --> 01:40:17.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelly Summer, CEO of Red Octane

01:40:35.153 --> 01:41:01.492
[SPEAKER_04]: basically says that Activision abused the property quote Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly they abused it there's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue it's a great product my gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero not every game can be a billion dollar franchise but maybe that's what Activision wants I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still a market for this product and then show them up

01:41:02.012 --> 01:41:04.314
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.

01:41:04.594 --> 01:41:06.035
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't thrown products out there.

01:41:06.295 --> 01:41:10.097
[SPEAKER_04]: They've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still a strong franchise.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:14.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.804
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong with just putting out one game every couple or even three or four years.

01:41:20.864 --> 01:41:29.830
[SPEAKER_11]: If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around, I think.

01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.871
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so, too.

01:41:32.652 --> 01:41:37.855
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining, it is now out.

01:41:38.215 --> 01:41:41.076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate.

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:47.179
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is available for you to download on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.881
[SPEAKER_04]: The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what?

01:41:51.341 --> 01:41:51.761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

01:41:52.041 --> 01:41:55.263
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if they need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.

01:41:56.163 --> 01:42:00.645
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes.

01:42:00.945 --> 01:42:04.927
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.

01:42:05.307 --> 01:42:09.990
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:12.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess nothing is really for free, but hey.

01:42:13.791 --> 01:42:17.573
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys, but I have an email address that I sign up for everything with.

01:42:17.653 --> 01:42:18.814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my regular email.

01:42:20.155 --> 01:42:25.259
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretel Bot Pack is now out for LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:27.761
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is out there.

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:35.227
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's this whole full story, cutscenes, voice acting, original score, prizes to get.

01:42:35.668 --> 01:42:37.069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all available out there.

01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:39.611
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way.

01:42:43.394 --> 01:42:43.835
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura Well

01:43:12.674 --> 01:43:18.517
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.

01:43:19.278 --> 01:43:22.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch.

01:43:24.761 --> 01:43:28.203
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes.

01:43:30.644 --> 01:43:31.826
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:43:50.194 --> 01:43:55.738
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dan the other day was talking about needing four more PS3s and monitors, and I said, no.

01:43:56.318 --> 01:44:02.602
[SPEAKER_07]: You spent $150 on your driving rig, plus a little bit extra getting those seats from the pick and pull, no.

01:44:03.583 --> 01:44:06.545
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.

01:44:07.546 --> 01:44:13.750
[SPEAKER_11]: That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the five monitors.

01:44:13.770 --> 01:44:14.751
[SPEAKER_07]: It already had three monitors.

01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:17.292
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's actually a YouTube up of someone playing five monitored.

01:44:17.773 --> 01:44:19.113
[SPEAKER_07]: Five monitored, da, da, da, da, da.

01:44:20.214 --> 01:44:21.094
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty hot, actually.

01:44:21.434 --> 01:44:22.495
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, no, don't need it.

01:44:25.155 --> 01:44:26.896
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Billy Mitchell.

01:44:27.836 --> 01:44:29.136
[SPEAKER_07]: He's such a jerk.

01:44:30.257 --> 01:44:32.097
[SPEAKER_07]: He just needs to go back to selling his damn barbecue sauce.

01:44:33.398 --> 01:44:36.759
[SPEAKER_07]: But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade.

01:44:37.139 --> 01:44:38.899
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at the Orlando International Airport.

01:44:39.839 --> 01:44:43.500
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks very Donkey Kong-ish.

01:44:44.621 --> 01:44:45.981
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's no Donkey Kong machine anywhere.

01:44:46.141 --> 01:44:46.481
[SPEAKER_07]: and there.

01:44:47.982 --> 01:44:51.785
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score because Steve Wiebe was still better.

01:44:51.805 --> 01:44:54.287
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget there's a third guy now.

01:44:54.327 --> 01:44:56.248
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the dentist, Hank Shen.

01:44:57.129 --> 01:44:58.350
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what else is funny too?

01:44:58.390 --> 01:45:00.371
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently that arcade's been there for a while.

01:45:00.411 --> 01:45:02.313
[SPEAKER_12]: They just keep rebranding it as something else.

01:45:02.913 --> 01:45:31.811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Well now we have Step Mania without a pad It's a Kinect hack Yay So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the pad You just play where you are I guess I'd have to see this in motion There's a video of it You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania I guess Good times

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.631
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's it.

01:46:08.825 --> 01:46:11.026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.

01:46:11.226 --> 01:46:19.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR, and we read your tweets here on the show and respond to them as appropriate.

01:46:19.331 --> 01:46:22.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight?

01:46:22.073 --> 01:46:29.297
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off with Blue Swim tonight tweets us, Did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?

01:46:29.838 --> 01:46:31.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?

01:46:32.259 --> 01:46:33.560
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you know where this is going.

01:46:34.251 --> 01:46:35.052
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

01:46:35.452 --> 01:46:38.794
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did watch it today, and I have a word for the race, Rob.

01:46:39.794 --> 01:46:42.296
[SPEAKER_07]: Lusterfuck.

01:46:42.356 --> 01:46:45.157
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, that's what it was?

01:46:45.177 --> 01:46:50.040
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance?

01:46:50.922 --> 01:46:56.727
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it was great, though, because they literally... It was like one of those things, you totally jinxed the race.

01:46:56.927 --> 01:47:02.492
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they're all... Now, we've seen some pretty good driving today, all of a sudden, crash!

01:47:02.592 --> 01:47:05.915
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?

01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:08.857
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was won by the 20-year-old guy.

01:47:09.258 --> 01:47:13.661
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, well, with 50 laps down, there were...

01:47:14.982 --> 01:47:17.124
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:47:45.329 --> 01:47:46.952
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think that's pretty impressive.

01:47:47.733 --> 01:47:52.178
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just because he was being smart and everybody else was like, oh, follow this guy.

01:47:52.198 --> 01:47:52.298
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

01:47:54.651 --> 01:47:55.972
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on to some other tweets.

01:47:56.072 --> 01:47:57.954
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt sends us a couple stories.

01:47:58.014 --> 01:47:59.735
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is some big news out of New York City.

01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:05.780
[SPEAKER_04]: The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.

01:48:06.601 --> 01:48:09.603
[SPEAKER_04]: And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.

01:48:10.624 --> 01:48:11.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:48:11.705 --> 01:48:15.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Several places are reporting this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.

01:48:15.908 --> 01:48:23.893
[SPEAKER_04]: Several places are reporting that Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.

01:48:25.494 --> 01:48:33.039
[SPEAKER_04]: According to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being in business and will be closing on the 23rd.

01:48:33.099 --> 01:48:35.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if that's this month or next month.

01:48:35.661 --> 01:48:59.706
[SPEAKER_04]: so wow that's crazy though because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting down over here so that's really sad that you know you have the west coast and the east coast big arcades just bam bam shutting down I'd heard about that arcade before I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some of the games so sad to hear it that's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too

01:49:00.786 --> 01:49:01.026
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.

01:49:01.647 --> 01:49:03.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sad for arcades in general.

01:49:03.868 --> 01:49:08.411
[SPEAKER_04]: This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.

01:49:08.431 --> 01:49:10.952
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they didn't have enough ticket-spinning machines.

01:49:10.972 --> 01:49:22.299
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just they're not a draw for that shopping center or whatever, so they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center so they go spend money at those stores.

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.881
[SPEAKER_12]: Or so people want to put stores into the shopping center.

01:49:25.901 --> 01:49:26.202
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:49:27.142 --> 01:49:28.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, TigerClaw sends us a tweet.

01:49:28.983 --> 01:49:32.664
[SPEAKER_04]: Can a controller be programmed to speedrun Super Mario Bros.?

01:49:33.445 --> 01:49:34.885
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:49:35.225 --> 01:49:40.588
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey website thingy they got now.

01:49:40.728 --> 01:49:44.069
[SPEAKER_04]: ca.kotaku.com Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?

01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:46.790
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.

01:49:48.451 --> 01:49:49.332
[SPEAKER_12]: so it's the old format.

01:49:49.392 --> 01:49:59.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five minutes.

01:50:00.357 --> 01:50:04.138
[SPEAKER_04]: They are saying that the mod is real even though some people were calling it a fake.

01:50:05.519 --> 01:50:16.725
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could plug this in and say, hey guys, look what I can do, and then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically, and it's actually doing the speedrun for you?

01:50:17.246 --> 01:50:19.267
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?

01:50:19.307 --> 01:50:21.608
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just because, hey, let's see if we can do this.

01:50:22.008 --> 01:50:22.989
[SPEAKER_12]: That's basically it.

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:23.469
[SPEAKER_12]: Or that.

01:50:23.609 --> 01:50:23.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that.

01:50:25.710 --> 01:50:29.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say I've been a member of OLR since 2002.

01:50:29.372 --> 01:50:31.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the awesome show, guys.

01:50:31.653 --> 01:50:32.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's a very long time.

01:50:32.934 --> 01:50:36.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening that long.

01:50:36.115 --> 01:50:39.897
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple people tweeting us about this, so I should read this.

01:50:39.977 --> 01:50:46.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Both Defective Candy and Tigerclaw tweeted us this story, and it's about Mexico State Congress asks for a ban.

01:50:48.461 --> 01:50:49.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Juarez the Cartel

01:51:16.886 --> 01:51:17.407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I kind of agree.

01:51:17.567 --> 01:51:18.828
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that big of a game.

01:51:18.848 --> 01:51:19.008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

01:51:35.174 --> 01:51:38.477
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.

01:51:39.317 --> 01:51:59.834
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and also, we have some listeners that live in Mexico, and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries anyway, because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something that does hit a little close to home.

01:52:00.879 --> 01:52:09.102
[SPEAKER_04]: One more tweet here from DarkTetsuya who tweets us saying, So it's a couple months till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:10.883
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot WonderCon is coming up.

01:52:10.903 --> 01:52:12.824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?

01:52:13.684 --> 01:52:14.684
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1st through the 3rd?

01:52:15.405 --> 01:52:15.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:52:15.665 --> 01:52:16.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was yawning.

01:52:16.585 --> 01:52:17.346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

01:52:17.406 --> 01:52:18.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Second only to Comic-Con, right?

01:52:19.227 --> 01:52:19.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:52:20.107 --> 01:52:25.210
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long after Game Developers Conference before E3.

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:25.951
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

01:52:25.991 --> 01:52:27.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we see some game announcements.

01:52:27.551 --> 01:52:29.733
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.

01:52:30.213 --> 01:52:33.415
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm used to it being usually... You said it was in April?

01:52:34.315 --> 01:52:35.276
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1st through 3rd.

01:52:35.816 --> 01:52:38.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually it's around this time, to be honest.

01:52:38.758 --> 01:52:39.218
[SPEAKER_11]: February.

01:52:39.578 --> 01:52:40.999
[SPEAKER_11]: Moscone Center or nearby.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.160
[SPEAKER_11]: They must have bumped it out a little.

01:52:43.461 --> 01:52:43.621
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:52:44.301 --> 01:52:45.802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for Twitter this week.

01:52:45.882 --> 01:52:49.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.

01:52:50.583 --> 01:52:52.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more news.

01:52:53.645 --> 01:53:02.828
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking the PlayStation 3.

01:53:03.528 --> 01:53:07.850
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak.

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:10.211
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, multiple jailbreaks at this point.

01:53:11.882 --> 01:53:20.708
[SPEAKER_12]: The PlayStation Blog Post warns users, Notice unauthorized circumvention devices for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.

01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:25.012
[SPEAKER_12]: These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.

01:53:25.572 --> 01:53:37.762
[SPEAKER_12]: Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system, software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system, and code of conduct provisions.

01:53:38.882 --> 01:53:46.664
[SPEAKER_12]: Violation of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates the consumer's guarantee for that system.

01:53:46.784 --> 01:53:51.766
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright laws.

01:53:52.526 --> 01:54:07.450
[SPEAKER_12]: Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access to the PlayStation Network and access to Curiosity services through PlayStation 3 system terminated permanently.

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:18.947
[SPEAKER_12]: To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.

01:54:20.732 --> 01:54:34.556
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop using this modified property.

01:54:34.576 --> 01:54:36.177
[SPEAKER_12]: Change your ways or else.

01:54:36.537 --> 01:54:40.198
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.

01:54:40.898 --> 01:54:46.700
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically saying, obviously, that they don't want people doing that.

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:47.880
[SPEAKER_12]: Or they'll ban you.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:56.102
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there.

01:54:56.782 --> 01:55:00.784
[SPEAKER_12]: A new hack that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.

01:55:01.824 --> 01:55:03.964
[SPEAKER_12]: The hack can also be used to ban another console.

01:55:04.025 --> 01:55:14.748
[SPEAKER_12]: All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a refurb warehouse or a second-hand seller or some idiot that's willing to give up that information.

01:55:16.088 --> 01:55:17.969
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of funny.

01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:31.997
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, Geohot, or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony, has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.

01:55:32.438 --> 01:55:35.199
[SPEAKER_04]: And now what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?

01:55:35.219 --> 01:55:37.060
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but this is not for him.

01:55:37.401 --> 01:55:42.684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going strictly to his... He got his lawyers okay for it, so it must be all right.

01:55:43.324 --> 01:55:45.986
[SPEAKER_12]: Donations here are for legal defense only.

01:55:46.186 --> 01:55:48.128
[SPEAKER_12]: I have checked with my lawyers before setting this up.

01:55:48.268 --> 01:55:52.631
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.

01:56:05.881 --> 01:56:17.613
[SPEAKER_12]: They tried to sue a guy for getting his AIBO to run non-Sony approved tricks, making it apparent that they don't really care about privacy, they care about control.

01:56:18.754 --> 01:56:24.140
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also said Sony vs. Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about that.

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.081
[SPEAKER_12]: And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's an advocate against mass piracy.

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:30.901
[SPEAKER_12]: He does not distribute any copyrighted work but his own.

01:56:31.641 --> 01:56:33.762
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says he's not going to take this crap lying down.

01:56:34.302 --> 01:56:38.222
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's even pro-DRM in a sense.

01:56:39.223 --> 01:56:44.843
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, why should I care about your personal legal troubles?

01:56:44.883 --> 01:56:45.384
[SPEAKER_12]: You shouldn't.

01:56:46.044 --> 01:56:52.465
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never ask for donations.

01:56:54.166 --> 01:56:55.853
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what that's a dig at.

01:56:56.456 --> 01:56:57.922
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Nero, um...

01:56:59.878 --> 01:57:00.558
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

01:57:02.119 --> 01:57:04.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there.

01:57:05.699 --> 01:57:07.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to beat this issue to death.

01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:10.260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come up on almost every episode for the past few weeks about this whole issue.

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:17.622
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does seem that this is moving faster in a legal sense than these types of stories usually do.

01:57:17.642 --> 01:57:23.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm about to get into another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year now.

01:57:23.263 --> 01:57:24.183
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you've got enough money.

01:57:24.243 --> 01:57:26.264
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.

01:57:26.624 --> 01:57:27.445
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

01:57:27.765 --> 01:57:29.567
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of the worry.

01:57:30.287 --> 01:57:32.489
[SPEAKER_12]: His thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?

01:57:32.649 --> 01:57:41.037
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology on the PlayStation blog for ever removing it.

01:57:41.297 --> 01:57:43.639
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be good PR for Sony and Lord knows they could use it.

01:57:44.079 --> 01:57:44.920
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want an AIBO.

01:57:46.942 --> 01:57:48.844
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.

01:57:49.064 --> 01:57:50.625
[SPEAKER_12]: Those batteries are fickle as shit.

01:57:52.487 --> 01:57:52.567
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

01:57:55.715 --> 01:57:56.656
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

01:57:57.437 --> 01:57:59.459
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, Donate to help you.

01:57:59.499 --> 01:58:01.641
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.

01:58:02.081 --> 01:58:02.802
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not.

01:58:04.043 --> 01:58:06.545
[SPEAKER_12]: Kakaroto explains this really well.

01:58:06.565 --> 01:58:14.553
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, I have never played the PS3 online ever and frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.

01:58:14.593 --> 01:58:19.137
[SPEAKER_12]: Security 101 is why is the security in the client anyways?

01:58:19.637 --> 01:58:20.978
[SPEAKER_12]: I had no idea this would happen.

01:58:21.278 --> 01:58:25.800
[SPEAKER_12]: I am in full support of the cheaters being permabanned from the PlayStation Network.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:35.243
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, long story short, basically, he needs money, and obviously he feels that he did nothing wrong, and he very well may have done nothing wrong.

01:58:35.323 --> 01:58:46.348
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, Sony owns your system, according to them, and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that you purchased.

01:58:46.828 --> 01:58:48.209
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, the stuff that he did...

01:58:49.429 --> 01:58:49.709
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.

01:59:12.816 --> 01:59:14.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to this comment from chat.

01:59:15.077 --> 01:59:20.738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week.

01:59:20.818 --> 01:59:24.199
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room.

01:59:24.599 --> 01:59:31.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key gen tunes as their only signature?

01:59:31.601 --> 01:59:33.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those tunes were actually pretty good too.

01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:36.911
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff.

01:59:36.931 --> 01:59:38.652
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people want fame.

01:59:40.313 --> 01:59:50.400
[SPEAKER_12]: I think once he hacked the iPod and iOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff, that whole thing became kind of legal now.

01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:52.081
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's gone to his head a little bit.

01:59:52.701 --> 01:59:54.702
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, let's crack the Uncrackable type thing.

01:59:55.603 --> 01:59:56.283
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

01:59:56.924 --> 01:59:57.184
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

01:59:58.968 --> 02:00:01.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.

02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:06.716
[SPEAKER_04]: This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides in this case, I don't know.

02:00:07.416 --> 02:00:11.180
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is about, remember this, No Doubt vs. Guitar Hero.

02:00:12.501 --> 02:00:15.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Or should I say Band Hero specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.

02:00:16.505 --> 02:00:18.627
[SPEAKER_04]: No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.

02:00:19.148 --> 02:00:22.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, according to a recent report in the LA Times,

02:00:23.071 --> 02:00:45.802
[SPEAKER_04]: a panel of judges has agreed with a lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit by no doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from like Taylor Swift and

02:00:46.062 --> 02:00:52.126
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do Flava Flav or whatever.

02:00:52.246 --> 02:01:00.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain why Guitar Hero went really wrong.

02:01:01.172 --> 02:01:02.773
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the lawsuits.

02:01:03.394 --> 02:01:04.394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that.

02:01:04.734 --> 02:01:06.976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that this whole like...

02:01:09.179 --> 02:01:11.800
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of care for the material?

02:01:12.861 --> 02:01:24.526
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the fine print or whatever.

02:01:24.966 --> 02:01:29.848
[SPEAKER_12]: They assumed that something was going to happen with their characters only singing their own songs and stuff like that.

02:01:30.268 --> 02:01:38.037
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists in their games?

02:01:38.218 --> 02:01:42.943
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.

02:01:43.043 --> 02:01:44.645
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your own created characters.

02:01:45.066 --> 02:01:46.728
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you even need these in there?

02:01:47.128 --> 02:01:50.312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more my point, actually, was kind of what I was getting at.

02:01:50.692 --> 02:02:16.128
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time I think the first time we went over this story I probably had said something like you know well they should have probably read the fine print but now looking back on how Guitar Hero has you know essentially failed at this point you kind of go well maybe this really isn't what the game should have been doing in the first place say no doubt and Courtney Love I'm sure are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever their image and their license or their

02:02:17.217 --> 02:02:30.391
[SPEAKER_11]: So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists.

02:02:31.412 --> 02:02:32.013
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.

02:02:34.422 --> 02:02:36.303
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.

02:02:36.823 --> 02:02:37.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps, perhaps.

02:02:38.624 --> 02:02:40.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?

02:02:40.785 --> 02:02:44.027
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.

02:02:44.507 --> 02:02:45.168
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got paternity ones.

02:02:45.208 --> 02:02:46.548
[SPEAKER_04]: She fights with her kid all the time.

02:02:46.568 --> 02:02:49.150
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems.

02:02:49.570 --> 02:02:50.350
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, gosh.

02:02:51.351 --> 02:02:53.532
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.

02:02:54.412 --> 02:02:56.273
[SPEAKER_04]: A lawyer for her Twitter feed.

02:02:56.613 --> 02:03:00.615
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make a Pokemon-style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.

02:03:01.076 --> 02:03:01.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to catch them all.

02:03:03.248 --> 02:03:05.090
[SPEAKER_07]: Real estate attorney, I choose you.

02:03:06.491 --> 02:03:07.472
[SPEAKER_07]: Protect my house.

02:03:09.734 --> 02:03:11.716
[SPEAKER_07]: Contracting lawyer, I choose you.

02:03:11.996 --> 02:03:13.137
[SPEAKER_07]: Fix my air conditioning.

02:03:14.739 --> 02:03:15.179
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

02:03:16.981 --> 02:03:18.662
[SPEAKER_04]: A Pokemon game based around lawyers.

02:03:18.723 --> 02:03:19.723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're on to something.

02:03:20.284 --> 02:03:21.645
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, though, how about another news story?

02:03:21.665 --> 02:03:22.306
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta sue them all.

02:03:24.193 --> 02:03:26.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like Sega.

02:03:26.934 --> 02:03:29.995
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega, or at least something Sega's done.

02:03:30.055 --> 02:03:30.955
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, I hate them.

02:03:31.375 --> 02:03:32.155
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my butt.

02:03:33.656 --> 02:03:38.777
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is going to be, for the PCs, Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.

02:03:39.237 --> 02:03:46.500
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 46 of the Sega Genesis's diseases games, and it will be out on March 15th.

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:49.481
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the list.

02:03:50.281 --> 02:03:53.624
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Volume 1, which has a bunch of stuff, and 2, and 3, and 4.

02:03:55.245 --> 02:03:56.386
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, I'll run through the list.

[SPEAKER_07]: There's Golden Axe, Altered Beast, Comic Zone, Echo the Dolphin, Gang Ground, Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master, Vector Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crackdown, and Space Harrier 2.

02:04:41.863 --> 02:05:00.535
[SPEAKER_12]: Micromachines Seriously, dang Alright I like Micromachines They don't make enough games based on them John Machida's dead That's because he talked too fast He got all the words out that he could possibly say As nice as that collection sounds

02:05:01.525 --> 02:05:07.548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this Genesis nostalgia I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth Aren't you starting to get to that point?

02:05:07.628 --> 02:05:26.618
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever I don't think, you really don't need much more than that As far as Genesis nostalgia goes It's not one of our stories that was for tonight That's okay The PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus, whatever They were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March

02:05:27.538 --> 02:05:35.024
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs for one to three bucks a piece.

02:05:35.424 --> 02:05:36.645
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of them up there now.

02:05:36.685 --> 02:05:39.527
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks.

02:05:39.647 --> 02:05:40.988
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, you got some money to burn.

02:05:41.529 --> 02:05:43.230
[SPEAKER_11]: Pick up a few, you know, a Phantasy Star 2.

02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:45.732
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, all right, how many of these are they going to put out?

02:05:45.812 --> 02:05:49.795
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.

02:05:49.995 --> 02:05:51.496
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got full packs out.

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:53.979
[SPEAKER_07]: You can download different packs of the games.

02:05:54.099 --> 02:05:59.023
[SPEAKER_07]: In my case, it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis.

02:05:59.844 --> 02:06:03.847
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I really want to play it, I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.

02:06:06.469 --> 02:06:09.952
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.

02:06:10.793 --> 02:06:11.754
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I mean...

02:06:14.230 --> 02:06:28.674
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.

02:06:29.554 --> 02:06:32.655
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things.

02:06:33.435 --> 02:06:36.436
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, dozens and dozens and dozens of times.

02:06:36.696 --> 02:06:42.317
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just, I don't feel any remorse for downloading a ROM that's

02:06:44.449 --> 02:06:52.485
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years old alright well let's move on with another story and we'll get to the mailbag pretty soon here

02:06:53.171 --> 02:07:02.618
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but that does not mean that the music genre is dead.

02:07:02.958 --> 02:07:08.682
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no, dance games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.

02:07:08.902 --> 02:07:13.786
[SPEAKER_12]: They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in...

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:19.650
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess $809 million in total software sales, up 21% from 2009.

02:07:20.911 --> 02:07:26.255
[SPEAKER_12]: And 60% of that, of course, was in North America.

02:07:27.076 --> 02:07:41.287
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, during the three-month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience, or Just Dance Michael Jackson.

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:46.092
[SPEAKER_12]: and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway.

02:07:46.953 --> 02:07:47.974
[SPEAKER_12]: All pretty similar titles.

02:07:49.275 --> 02:07:52.278
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that.

02:07:52.378 --> 02:07:56.062
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't believe how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii.

02:07:56.122 --> 02:07:57.323
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of crazy.

02:07:59.346 --> 02:08:04.231
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, next month, Just Dance on... Let's see, I caught myself saying that.

02:08:04.731 --> 02:08:08.893
[SPEAKER_12]: Dance on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with Move support.

02:08:09.934 --> 02:08:13.236
[SPEAKER_12]: Or actually, Move required, I guess.

02:08:13.336 --> 02:08:16.357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?

02:08:17.098 --> 02:08:17.658
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I do not.

02:08:18.979 --> 02:08:22.441
[SPEAKER_12]: There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii.

02:08:23.141 --> 02:08:28.745
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is going to add, I guess, some new duet choreography.

02:08:29.806 --> 02:08:41.194
[SPEAKER_12]: And for 300 Wii Points, you can download YOY by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.

02:08:43.379 --> 02:08:45.360
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Freak by Rick James and Sheiks LeFreak

02:09:13.009 --> 02:09:19.857
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amory, heard them all.

02:09:22.179 --> 02:09:22.680
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are each $3.

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:22.940
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

02:09:28.826 --> 02:09:31.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.

02:09:31.667 --> 02:09:33.547
[SPEAKER_04]: People like to shake their butt.

02:09:33.667 --> 02:09:38.449
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games are dead, and then it's like, oh wait, another news.

02:09:38.509 --> 02:09:52.113
[SPEAKER_12]: I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision, because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping on that bandwagon.

02:09:55.965 --> 02:09:58.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.

02:09:58.886 --> 02:10:10.111
[SPEAKER_04]: There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move, but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal 2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.

02:10:10.912 --> 02:10:17.755
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.

02:10:18.035 --> 02:10:18.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:10:36.664 --> 02:11:05.455
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically at the end of the day they announced Portal 2 is available for pre-order now and I was kind of like well duh I mean like if you want to go into GameStop they'll take your five bucks to pre-order Portal 5 I mean you know seems a little weird that they'd announce that but maybe through the official Valve channels or what have you it's available now I don't really know so there you go Portal 2 coming out soon and I know I'm excited about it I can't wait for that to come out

02:11:06.294 --> 02:11:09.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag, right?

02:11:09.516 --> 02:11:10.537
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to the mailbag.

02:11:10.957 --> 02:11:11.958
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys send us emails.

02:11:12.338 --> 02:11:13.639
[SPEAKER_04]: We answer them here on the show.

02:11:14.259 --> 02:11:18.902
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and find some of her favorite emails to respond to right now.

02:11:21.924 --> 02:11:23.625
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just taking care of some business.

02:11:24.346 --> 02:11:24.766
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:30.655
[SPEAKER_07]: So, first email, we actually got three.

02:11:31.155 --> 02:11:34.478
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one that says, Greetings, OLR.

02:11:34.518 --> 02:11:35.860
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my second email of the week.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.620
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick question.

02:11:37.001 --> 02:11:40.724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.

02:11:41.164 --> 02:11:41.965
[SPEAKER_07]: What is going on here?

02:11:42.005 --> 02:11:45.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their games?

02:11:46.029 --> 02:11:52.634
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.

02:11:53.035 --> 02:11:55.337
[SPEAKER_07]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, SeriousTurtle.

02:11:58.075 --> 02:12:06.680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I missed something about the... With Crysis 2 and Black Ops in those games being $60, why are they raising their prices when more people are going to hold out for sales?

02:12:07.701 --> 02:12:15.705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.

02:12:16.285 --> 02:12:17.766
[SPEAKER_04]: A huge sale on Steam this weekend.

02:12:18.386 --> 02:12:18.546
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

02:12:21.328 --> 02:12:24.110
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say, well, how long have those games been out?

02:12:24.130 --> 02:12:25.270
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Bulletstorm is new, right?

02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:26.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bulletstorm is brand new.

02:12:26.591 --> 02:12:32.655
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.

02:12:32.855 --> 02:12:43.821
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA, Activision, have decided, hey, you know what?

02:12:43.981 --> 02:12:47.263
[SPEAKER_12]: Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it warrants a $60 price point.

02:12:49.469 --> 02:12:54.591
[SPEAKER_12]: Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on the Wii.

02:12:54.791 --> 02:13:04.934
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics and support on the download side, so, eh.

02:13:06.361 --> 02:13:32.815
[SPEAKER_11]: I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers are just going to have their MSRP $59.99 they don't care what platform even on a digital service like Steam where it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved they'll just set their price to whatever they want keep it uniform I can see where the emailer is probably getting a little bit frustrated that you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later but what can you do

02:13:33.703 --> 02:13:37.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go on to the next email.

02:13:37.975 --> 02:13:41.096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next email up is this one.

02:13:41.416 --> 02:13:43.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi LLR, I don't have much to say this week.

02:13:43.396 --> 02:13:45.497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm moving to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic.

02:13:45.857 --> 02:13:48.438
[SPEAKER_07]: But I suppose I should make this at least a bit game related.

02:13:48.478 --> 02:13:50.578
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?

02:13:51.079 --> 02:13:54.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.

02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:57.060
[SPEAKER_07]: On a side note, can I plug my new blog?

02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:57.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

02:13:58.541 --> 02:14:07.063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's moggysmusings.blogspot.com So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.

02:14:07.363 --> 02:14:10.167
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a really good tweet from that.

02:14:10.187 --> 02:14:11.909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really similar name that I liked.

02:14:12.190 --> 02:14:14.453
[SPEAKER_04]: I had retweeted it on OLR.

02:14:15.074 --> 02:14:18.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I kind of already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.

02:14:18.739 --> 02:14:20.802
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be a nice pairing.

02:14:22.464 --> 02:14:24.727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.

02:14:25.356 --> 02:14:28.999
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I want to see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having the license.

02:14:29.219 --> 02:14:32.622
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel-shaded.

02:14:33.322 --> 02:14:35.644
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, thumbs up.

02:14:36.124 --> 02:14:41.088
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the original.

02:14:41.808 --> 02:14:44.791
[SPEAKER_04]: But you kind of go, if anything's going to be good...

02:14:46.337 --> 02:14:48.979
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be this from the professional angle.

02:14:49.139 --> 02:14:50.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand there's still the fan game.

02:14:51.161 --> 02:14:53.443
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the game is going to be in good hands with fans.

02:14:53.923 --> 02:14:56.265
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's different.

02:14:57.086 --> 02:14:59.268
[SPEAKER_04]: So how about the next email?

02:15:00.248 --> 02:15:02.209
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is our last email of the night.

02:15:02.729 --> 02:15:02.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

02:15:03.690 --> 02:15:06.171
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.

02:15:06.511 --> 02:15:08.792
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.

02:15:08.972 --> 02:15:16.015
[SPEAKER_07]: One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7 where the author goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.

02:15:16.855 --> 02:15:18.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen on the podcast every week.

02:15:18.116 --> 02:15:19.336
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats on 400 eps.

02:15:19.396 --> 02:15:19.776
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

02:15:19.856 --> 02:15:20.157
[SPEAKER_07]: Wendy.

02:15:20.497 --> 02:15:21.097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Wendy.

02:15:21.889 --> 02:15:23.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?

02:15:23.832 --> 02:15:24.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a cheap plug?

02:15:24.793 --> 02:15:25.174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:15:25.334 --> 02:15:25.875
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

02:15:26.035 --> 02:15:26.516
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

02:15:26.536 --> 02:15:26.757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:15:27.337 --> 02:15:30.402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would definitely check out the book.

02:15:30.442 --> 02:15:34.368
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse.

02:15:34.989 --> 02:15:35.110
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

02:15:36.519 --> 02:15:37.080
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:16:13.544 --> 02:16:20.367
[SPEAKER_07]: My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.

02:16:21.948 --> 02:16:23.468
[SPEAKER_07]: So, fuck you to my headache.

02:16:24.169 --> 02:16:24.829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really it.

02:16:28.490 --> 02:16:28.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki?

02:16:30.491 --> 02:16:34.473
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, empty McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.

02:16:38.581 --> 02:16:54.972
[SPEAKER_04]: my FU of the week goes to being so sore pain hurts ow my legs just hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting or whatever be careful SalaciousPop do you have any FUs?

[SPEAKER_04]: any angst?

[SPEAKER_11]: FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department alright that does it for the FUs of the week

02:17:09.116 --> 02:17:09.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

02:17:09.699 --> 02:17:11.104
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:17:11.124 --> 02:17:12.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to get to the phone lines.

02:17:12.992 --> 02:17:14.458
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.

02:17:14.619 --> 02:17:14.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:16.261
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, yes.

02:17:17.422 --> 02:17:19.023
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of interesting, I guess.

02:17:19.543 --> 02:17:25.108
[SPEAKER_12]: They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.

02:17:26.009 --> 02:17:28.331
[SPEAKER_12]: It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote.

02:17:28.351 --> 02:17:41.341
[SPEAKER_12]: They were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360-type control and stuff.

02:17:41.361 --> 02:17:41.862
[SPEAKER_12]: For example...

02:17:42.342 --> 02:17:43.784
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:14.644
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls to aim at the player.

02:18:15.024 --> 02:18:19.866
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect and Xbox 360.

02:18:20.166 --> 02:18:22.506
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an interesting idea.

02:18:22.986 --> 02:18:25.147
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they can implement it well.

02:18:28.436 --> 02:18:29.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

02:18:29.417 --> 02:18:30.959
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all I can really say about that.

02:18:30.999 --> 02:18:34.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what have you.

02:18:36.084 --> 02:18:37.245
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be neat.

02:18:37.405 --> 02:18:45.233
[SPEAKER_12]: They could do something even simple like being able to level up the characters or something like that when they're not playing the game.

02:18:47.175 --> 02:18:48.557
[SPEAKER_12]: Toss stuff back and forth, data.

02:18:51.215 --> 02:19:03.046
[SPEAKER_04]: it always kind of reminds me for some reason of the pocket station days I don't know what it is but kind of that whole like you have it on your TV and then you have it in your pocket and whatever else I don't know

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:07.271
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder where my pocket station went.

02:19:07.812 --> 02:19:08.772
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you actually own one of those?

02:19:08.852 --> 02:19:09.473
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I had one.

02:19:09.493 --> 02:19:16.117
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop courses on the fly.

02:19:16.818 --> 02:19:18.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

02:19:18.739 --> 02:19:28.485
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because it got like four songs versus three songs if I paid for the fourth mix stuff.

02:19:28.505 --> 02:19:33.629
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you go.

02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:34.750
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus my edits were on there.

02:19:34.770 --> 02:19:35.290
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's fun.

02:19:37.592 --> 02:19:38.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course there is...

02:20:08.885 --> 02:20:09.605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

02:20:09.645 --> 02:20:11.467
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's still Yuzo Fushiro doing all the music.

02:20:11.507 --> 02:20:12.347
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure sounds like it.

02:20:13.448 --> 02:20:23.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU 2011, but Bandai Namco has unveiled the website for the game.

02:20:24.494 --> 02:20:33.080
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out, and they're saying it will be sometime before you get to play it, but it will be the Wangan Maxi of the future and worth the wait.

02:20:35.821 --> 02:20:36.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever that means.

02:20:37.816 --> 02:20:38.797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just excited for the soundtrack.

02:20:38.817 --> 02:20:40.657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since they had a game, right?

02:20:41.398 --> 02:20:41.578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:20:41.898 --> 02:20:42.398
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been a while.

02:20:44.159 --> 02:20:44.439
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:20:46.761 --> 02:20:48.341
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?

02:20:48.361 --> 02:20:50.482
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.

02:20:50.542 --> 02:20:55.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:20:55.965 --> 02:20:58.566
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.

02:20:59.447 --> 02:21:03.649
[SPEAKER_04]: So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last minute stories tonight?

02:21:03.809 --> 02:21:06.331
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure, we can talk about Pixel Force Head to Head.

02:21:06.872 --> 02:21:17.701
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, the guy that brought us all the 8-bit kind of Left 4 Dead, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.

02:21:18.161 --> 02:21:23.826
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this one, they've got brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting game, including like...

02:21:24.827 --> 02:21:32.793
[SPEAKER_12]: Rio from Street Fighter Wolverine from Marvel Scorpion 30 different characters you can play as Castlevania

02:21:48.783 --> 02:21:50.424
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

02:21:50.764 --> 02:21:51.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:51.765 --> 02:21:52.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:21:52.685 --> 02:21:55.127
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Ranma.

02:21:55.547 --> 02:21:56.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind?

02:21:57.088 --> 02:21:57.648
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

02:21:57.688 --> 02:22:04.172
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got back from Katzikon, but I didn't call to give my con review, but I have a question for all three of you.

02:22:04.392 --> 02:22:04.892
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, what's up?

02:22:05.793 --> 02:22:06.093
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:22:06.573 --> 02:22:14.077
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console is the games for it, correct?

02:22:14.698 --> 02:22:15.018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

02:22:15.038 --> 02:22:15.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

02:22:16.114 --> 02:22:20.795
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy and he's like, you're incorrect.

02:22:20.995 --> 02:22:22.376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the marketing behind it.

02:22:22.876 --> 02:22:31.938
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, even I find it hard to believe because I feel that there have been games that have been marketed out like a cheap whore and it still has failed to get the numbers.

02:22:32.558 --> 02:22:36.179
[SPEAKER_05]: So, do you believe more if it's the games or the marketing?

02:22:36.299 --> 02:22:39.740
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, what games failed on the marketing aspect?

02:22:42.216 --> 02:22:42.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 3

02:23:01.315 --> 02:23:27.803
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want me to go for a bigger title because I don't know we just didn't see Rock Band it wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles and I don't know if that's just because people were over it or what the deal is but yeah I'd have to say that okay I agree with that because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as I was anticipating it and I turned around I'm like it's out but I really didn't see any advertising for it yeah right

02:23:29.747 --> 02:23:37.031
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.

02:23:37.051 --> 02:23:42.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch too, I thought we had a story last week that that game sold like a million copies or something.

02:23:44.235 --> 02:23:44.916
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:24:03.733 --> 02:24:08.998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge was kind of a popular game, at least I always thought.

02:24:09.499 --> 02:24:13.223
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would.

02:24:13.623 --> 02:24:14.924
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of surprising.

02:24:16.546 --> 02:24:17.006
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:24:17.767 --> 02:24:26.916
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console.

02:24:29.770 --> 02:24:31.891
[SPEAKER_04]: I think marketing kind of goes a long way.

02:24:32.151 --> 02:24:35.972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's probably why the Wii did so well.

02:24:37.213 --> 02:24:39.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think was kind of the way it was marketed.

02:24:39.533 --> 02:24:48.216
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either a good product or a bad product.

02:24:48.896 --> 02:24:56.499
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is that you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale.

02:24:56.919 --> 02:24:58.900
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, a turd is still a turd.

02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:00.901
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that plenty of times.

02:25:01.921 --> 02:25:16.689
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business and it just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say it stinks and could cause a possible chain reaction.

02:25:20.284 --> 02:25:20.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

02:25:21.606 --> 02:25:23.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.

02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:32.081
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system's only as good as the games that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch titles.

02:25:32.121 --> 02:25:33.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this make me a giant hypocrite?

02:25:34.594 --> 02:25:35.574
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.

02:25:35.694 --> 02:25:37.275
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you kind of follow along with me.

02:25:37.335 --> 02:25:44.777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you feel your inner child because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?

02:25:45.357 --> 02:25:50.859
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA and I still haven't finished it yet.

02:25:51.219 --> 02:25:54.400
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first got it, I knocked that game on about five weeks.

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:55.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

02:25:56.485 --> 02:25:59.126
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.

02:25:59.446 --> 02:26:05.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and looking at the 3D pictures.

02:26:05.528 --> 02:26:07.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.

02:26:07.889 --> 02:26:09.009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be kind of awesome.

02:26:09.410 --> 02:26:10.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to kind of show it off, too.

02:26:10.650 --> 02:26:12.311
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures.

02:26:12.811 --> 02:26:18.793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping Nintendo does a smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way we can do that.

02:26:20.221 --> 02:26:21.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps, perhaps.

02:26:21.904 --> 02:26:25.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, I also hope that I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.

02:26:26.953 --> 02:26:28.115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:26:28.797 --> 02:26:30.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, anything else on your mind, Ranma?

02:26:31.792 --> 02:26:32.652
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's it.

02:26:33.313 --> 02:26:33.573
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:26:33.593 --> 02:26:34.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, take care, Ranma.

02:26:34.353 --> 02:26:34.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

02:26:34.793 --> 02:26:35.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the call.

02:26:35.314 --> 02:26:35.754
[SPEAKER_04]: You too, Andrew.

02:26:35.934 --> 02:26:36.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Laters.

02:26:36.374 --> 02:26:37.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

02:26:37.675 --> 02:26:41.396
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:26:42.777 --> 02:26:46.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.

02:26:46.839 --> 02:26:47.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll take it.

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.640
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.

02:26:53.462 --> 02:26:53.782
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:26:54.062 --> 02:26:56.083
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last-minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?

02:26:57.027 --> 02:26:57.988
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, one last one here.

02:26:58.548 --> 02:27:03.410
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.

02:27:04.311 --> 02:27:08.493
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a game called Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:11.855
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.

02:27:12.035 --> 02:27:13.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

02:27:13.535 --> 02:27:15.516
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were saying Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

02:27:15.556 --> 02:27:18.238
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's the full name of the game.

02:27:18.278 --> 02:27:19.718
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

02:27:19.779 --> 02:27:20.079
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:27:20.679 --> 02:27:24.561
[SPEAKER_12]: But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Pee's.

02:27:25.341 --> 02:27:36.147
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so it is a game that's played with vocal input and you can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic.

02:27:36.507 --> 02:27:43.792
[SPEAKER_12]: The titles co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises like pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

02:27:48.794 --> 02:27:50.435
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta love the indie marketplace.

02:27:50.915 --> 02:27:53.497
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a trailer for it too which people are playing it.

02:28:00.579 --> 02:28:02.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there video?

02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:02.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like real video?

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:11.846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like... Yeah, we can't hear any of that.

02:28:12.026 --> 02:28:16.128
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to that Technokitten Adventure.

02:28:17.189 --> 02:28:28.236
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks and then you scream into it to cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks.

02:28:30.512 --> 02:28:32.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave of the future, ladies and gentlemen.

02:28:33.136 --> 02:28:33.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave of the future.

02:28:34.578 --> 02:28:35.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call.

02:28:35.479 --> 02:28:36.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:36.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:28:38.122 --> 02:28:39.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Gamer Girl.

02:28:39.504 --> 02:28:40.205
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Gamer Girl.

02:28:40.225 --> 02:28:40.786
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

02:28:41.647 --> 02:28:42.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much.

02:28:42.128 --> 02:28:44.230
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys played the game...

02:28:48.840 --> 02:29:16.768
[SPEAKER_08]: um there's a game called um Assassin's Creed Legacy on Facebook uh no I have not played the Facebook game I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games what's the what's what's the Facebook game all about um it's kind of like Knights of the Clicky it's pretty cool yeah yeah um I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the Clicky it's pretty fun is it one of those games where it's really easy to uh spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff yeah it's pretty cool

02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:20.681
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Facebook games?

02:29:20.701 --> 02:29:22.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it really is the wave of the future?

02:29:24.603 --> 02:29:26.544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of addicting, actually.

02:29:28.205 --> 02:29:32.448
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not careful, you can kind of get addicted to it.

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:39.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was playing that Knights of the Clique game, which is so ridiculous for a while.

02:29:39.821 --> 02:29:41.801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, one day I just kind of stopped.

02:29:41.861 --> 02:29:42.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that kind of what happened with you?

02:29:42.782 --> 02:29:43.942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it ran out of steam with me too.

02:29:44.182 --> 02:29:44.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with you, DarkSakura.

02:29:44.742 --> 02:29:46.943
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't touched it in ages.

02:29:47.243 --> 02:29:48.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

02:29:48.344 --> 02:29:49.524
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finally gave up.

02:29:49.564 --> 02:29:51.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore.

02:29:52.205 --> 02:29:54.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?

02:29:54.807 --> 02:30:02.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy when I was moving around.

02:30:03.753 --> 02:30:05.934
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked in the case and it was actually cracked.

02:30:07.195 --> 02:30:08.916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to re-buy the other one.

02:30:09.076 --> 02:30:11.978
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?

02:30:12.038 --> 02:30:16.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game?

02:30:16.141 --> 02:30:17.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Or does it kind of tie into that story?

02:30:18.123 --> 02:30:23.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed's graphics?

02:30:24.868 --> 02:30:27.250
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of makes you want to play the original game.

02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:32.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it's not really tied into the game itself, the original game.

02:30:33.214 --> 02:30:34.915
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like a standalone.

02:30:35.696 --> 02:30:35.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

02:30:38.155 --> 02:30:42.217
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say somebody I knew was playing that on Facebook.

02:30:42.237 --> 02:30:44.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Has this been open a long time, like about six months or so?

02:30:45.058 --> 02:30:46.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did it just recently open?

02:30:46.799 --> 02:30:47.579
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

02:30:47.859 --> 02:30:49.540
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found out about it yesterday.

02:30:51.101 --> 02:30:53.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?

02:30:53.862 --> 02:30:58.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook.

02:30:59.304 --> 02:30:59.944
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a title.

02:30:59.964 --> 02:31:01.085
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the full title.

02:31:01.465 --> 02:31:20.805
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh because it seems like it's going to buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars that it might actually be the game of civilization it might be simplified a lot but I think that might be a lot of fun um right now I like playing you know um Knights of the Clicky um Chocobo's Crystal Tower oh yeah it's kind of confusing but yeah there's

02:31:25.356 --> 02:31:29.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Gamer Girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?

02:31:30.099 --> 02:31:31.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Do those games make you less depressed?

02:31:31.660 --> 02:31:32.481
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:31:32.681 --> 02:31:33.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the good work, guys.

02:31:33.922 --> 02:31:37.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, Gamer Girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?

02:31:38.951 --> 02:31:46.941
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot-em-up games, like, whatever.

02:31:48.542 --> 02:31:52.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty, or like something with zombies in it.

02:31:54.289 --> 02:31:55.491
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a game with zombies in it.

02:31:56.852 --> 02:31:58.594
[SPEAKER_08]: I like watching their brains spew out.

02:32:00.925 --> 02:32:02.986
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and then, let's see.

02:32:04.607 --> 02:32:06.408
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a game, but I forgot the name of it.

02:32:07.249 --> 02:32:07.649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

02:32:07.669 --> 02:32:08.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Resident Evil.

02:32:08.529 --> 02:32:09.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Resident Evil, there you go.

02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

02:32:10.090 --> 02:32:10.991
[SPEAKER_04]: More zombie killing.

02:32:11.531 --> 02:32:11.831
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:32:12.391 --> 02:32:13.892
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich.

02:32:15.802 --> 02:32:19.763
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Gamer Girl, we're going to let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call.

02:32:20.363 --> 02:32:20.723
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

02:32:20.823 --> 02:32:21.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, have a wonderful night.

02:32:22.363 --> 02:32:23.564
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

02:32:28.144 --> 02:32:29.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last minute stories over there from Loki?

[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

02:32:31.445 --> 02:32:33.085
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how am I supposed to fill time until the next call?

02:32:33.946 --> 02:32:34.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't know.

02:32:35.846 --> 02:32:36.866
[SPEAKER_12]: We can make up news.

02:32:36.906 --> 02:32:38.686
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if there's any new stories.

02:32:39.467 --> 02:32:40.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that recently happened?

02:32:40.927 --> 02:32:41.467
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh,

02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:47.272
[SPEAKER_12]: Nanostray developer working on title for the 3DS.

02:32:47.973 --> 02:32:50.655
[SPEAKER_12]: Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game.

02:32:54.259 --> 02:32:55.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can make some stories up.

02:32:56.361 --> 02:33:02.787
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about there was the little Big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?

02:33:03.368 --> 02:33:04.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was covered.

02:33:04.268 --> 02:33:05.049
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about the patch.

02:33:05.289 --> 02:33:06.549
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a little bit earlier in the show.

02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:07.810
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Ops Zombies.

02:33:08.050 --> 02:33:09.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we're getting another call.

02:33:09.211 --> 02:33:09.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo, saved.

02:33:10.151 --> 02:33:11.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:33:11.071 --> 02:33:11.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:33:12.412 --> 02:33:14.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Amiga777.

02:33:14.453 --> 02:33:15.933
[SPEAKER_04]: Amiga777.

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:16.634
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:33:17.934 --> 02:33:30.240
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering, have you guys heard about that latest Mario Sports Mix game that was supposed to be coming up?

02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:31.000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, like

02:33:31.697 --> 02:33:34.979
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago.

02:33:35.219 --> 02:33:39.821
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game.

02:33:41.521 --> 02:33:43.582
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

02:33:43.822 --> 02:33:45.043
[SPEAKER_09]: What were your thoughts on it?

02:33:47.328 --> 02:33:53.371
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash-in to the whole Wii Sports craze.

02:33:53.771 --> 02:34:00.573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock-offs games, a la, I don't know, Deka Sports or whatever.

02:34:00.954 --> 02:34:04.295
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit.

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:15.079
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games, you know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, or whatever the hell they were calling it.

02:34:15.299 --> 02:34:16.240
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:34:31.059 --> 02:34:38.124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing, which was like a PS1 Mario Kart ripoff with Final Fantasy characters.

02:34:38.544 --> 02:34:45.789
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish that would come out on the store because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got.

02:34:45.889 --> 02:34:47.871
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was awesome.

02:34:48.211 --> 02:34:48.832
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:35:08.770 --> 02:35:13.813
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach.

02:35:14.133 --> 02:35:20.657
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the hardcore game goes, if you're just kind of a solo player, I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.

02:35:21.418 --> 02:35:22.959
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your money might be better spent somewhere else.

02:35:23.879 --> 02:35:24.180
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:32.364
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I mean, I looked at an article online about it some time ago, and...

02:35:33.683 --> 02:35:36.506
[SPEAKER_09]: The critics were just ripping it to shreds.

02:35:54.604 --> 02:36:14.837
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom does tell us though it is Mario curling if you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario you can get that I thought Mario curling was not in that but was in the stupid Sonic vs. Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing I don't think curling is in this new one I'm reading that from chat so you could be right

02:36:15.759 --> 02:36:17.440
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could be wrong.

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:27.006
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis, dodgeball, maybe paintball.

02:36:28.447 --> 02:36:32.069
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it's whatever.

02:36:32.109 --> 02:36:34.491
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're not the target audience.

02:36:35.431 --> 02:36:44.357
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too because of everything you've read?

02:36:46.115 --> 02:36:53.953
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that as I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time.

02:36:54.134 --> 02:36:55.777
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, then it makes the decision pretty easy.

02:36:57.406 --> 02:37:16.641
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article that Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept to, I guess, Square Enix, who was already kind of already in some...

02:37:17.901 --> 02:37:29.728
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotwater, and a number of other things like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV, which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet.

02:37:30.168 --> 02:37:32.430
[SPEAKER_09]: What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?

02:37:35.231 --> 02:37:35.712
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

02:37:38.213 --> 02:37:39.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise games?

02:37:41.148 --> 02:37:41.568
[SPEAKER_09]: The games?

02:37:41.668 --> 02:37:43.389
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, it's fine.

02:37:45.330 --> 02:37:49.692
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need to make a decent income in order to get one at this time.

02:37:49.712 --> 02:37:50.493
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

02:37:50.513 --> 02:37:52.974
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy.

02:37:53.954 --> 02:37:54.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:37:54.655 --> 02:37:55.095
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bummer.

02:37:55.646 --> 02:37:58.269
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show.

02:37:58.549 --> 02:37:59.530
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you so much for the call.

02:38:00.512 --> 02:38:00.852
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

02:38:01.192 --> 02:38:03.315
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there.

02:38:03.555 --> 02:38:05.537
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a whopping four.

02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:10.863
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball.

02:38:11.284 --> 02:38:11.584
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

02:38:12.866 --> 02:38:13.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

02:38:16.507 --> 02:38:18.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't think it was a lot of games.

02:38:18.749 --> 02:38:20.731
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like DECA Sports where there was a whole ton of them.

02:38:20.771 --> 02:38:22.552
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, you know, a few.

02:38:23.032 --> 02:38:24.354
[SPEAKER_04]: But there you go.

02:38:25.274 --> 02:38:27.336
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:38:27.536 --> 02:38:29.137
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

02:38:29.478 --> 02:38:33.801
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you can always send us an email or contact us in other ways.

02:38:35.262 --> 02:38:37.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat Room, Twitter, etc, etc.

02:38:38.623 --> 02:38:40.144
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back to do it again next week.

02:38:40.564 --> 02:38:49.147
[SPEAKER_04]: But since I believe we did all the final thoughts, I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight, it's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show.

02:38:49.528 --> 02:38:52.389
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight.

02:38:52.869 --> 02:38:58.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half, as you always do, so thank you for being here.

02:38:58.331 --> 02:38:58.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:38:59.011 --> 02:39:00.512
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

02:39:00.772 --> 02:39:02.333
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't nap today, and I can feel it.

02:39:03.653 --> 02:39:07.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, no, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show.

02:39:07.416 --> 02:39:08.217
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 minutes is not a nap.

02:39:08.797 --> 02:39:09.278
[SPEAKER_04]: It is for me.

02:39:09.638 --> 02:39:12.060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll go ahead and give my final thought.

02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:17.564
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show.

02:39:17.604 --> 02:39:22.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love the live listeners and everything, but if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close.

02:39:22.448 --> 02:39:23.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, just saying.

02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:25.210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

02:39:25.491 --> 02:39:25.911
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

02:39:26.692 --> 02:39:28.233
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.

02:39:28.513 --> 02:39:29.715
[SPEAKER_07]: My head hurts so bad.

02:39:30.437 --> 02:39:31.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry to hear it.

02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:34.364
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

02:39:34.584 --> 02:39:35.566
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope this mod works.

02:39:36.599 --> 02:39:37.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dear, I wonder what this is.

02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:39.981
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this mod going to do, dare I ask?

02:39:40.722 --> 02:39:53.950
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get a process to it because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online and have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto.

02:39:53.970 --> 02:40:00.413
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about map mods right now because I've done map mods before, but I have a new method of doing them and...

02:40:01.714 --> 02:40:10.423
[SPEAKER_12]: The previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work and I've tried this before and I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work and who knows.

02:40:10.723 --> 02:40:13.186
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn.

02:40:15.114 --> 02:40:15.435
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:40:16.516 --> 02:40:20.080
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going to do it tonight for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:24.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live, however you do it, and checking us out.
