00:00.000 --> 00:19.160
Today, February 20th, 2011, could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?

00:19.160 --> 00:21.920
Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.

00:21.920 --> 00:31.920
Is PC piracy really in decline?

00:31.920 --> 00:35.520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.520 --> 00:39.040
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.400
It is episode number 402 for February 20th, 2011.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.840
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
co-hosts.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.440
Say hello over there to Ms. Ms. Jamie Summers.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
I love pitas.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
How are you?

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
Full of pitas.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.440
Pita filled?

00:55.440 --> 00:58.520
We are having the best pitas tonight.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.280
You know when you say that really fast, it sounds a little dirty.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
Falafel.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.160
Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
Falafels are delicious.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.880
I'm going to go have another.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.280
One of the things, one of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that

01:11.280 --> 01:13.840
one of the races in it was like a lollafel or something they were called.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.520
I just called them falafels cause they're adorable and cute like falafels.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.160
You know who really likes falafels?

01:19.160 --> 01:22.040
Yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight who's speaking early.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
Yes, Salacious Pop.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.720
Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.080
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
Hi.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.440
How are you doing, Loki?

01:32.440 --> 01:33.960
I'm doing good.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.400
Alright, falafel filled in your world?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
I don't know.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.400
I don't know what to ask.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Sure.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
Okay, there you go.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.640
What was the dinner of choice tonight?

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
I'll ask this.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
Ah, just crappy McDonald's.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.340
I wasn't really that hungry but I knew if I didn't eat anything I'd be hungry later

01:47.340 --> 01:52.880
so I just, I had a quarter pounder and it wasn't very good and the fries aren't very

01:52.880 --> 01:57.720
good but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.160
Any McDonald's you go to so it was just, I don't know.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.440
Orange Lounge Foodio, you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio

02:06.440 --> 02:09.360
but a lot of the times we also talk about food.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.520
Also joining us tonight, as you already know, is the one and only Salacious Pop here in

02:13.520 --> 02:14.520
studio.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.520
I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.520
I know.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.520
Please don't beat me.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.560
You need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.960
Hello, what's up?

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
How's your week going?

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
Good.

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
Yeah?

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960
Yeah.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.960
I have pita so it's a lot better now.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.080
Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a

02:31.080 --> 02:32.400
65 year old man.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.960
I can't move today.

02:33.960 --> 02:39.520
We ran around doing a local version of the Amazing Race scavenger hunt.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.400
It was just between about 15 or 16 friends all within Sacramento downtown.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.720
By the way, no charity, no organization.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.720
Just because we can.

02:49.720 --> 02:50.720
We're bored.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.720
Yeah.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.400
When people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.480
Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams, you know.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.920
Can't let them win over you.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.840
So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.

03:02.840 --> 03:09.520
There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.120
Lots of running back and forth.

03:11.120 --> 03:17.360
And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling

03:17.360 --> 03:19.920
and can't sit up without help.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
It's like I'm a gamer.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.760
I don't do physical activity, you know.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.760
This is too much.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.520
That's such a gift for not playing any more DDR.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.040
But I have half a Vicodin so I'm feeling a lot better after that.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.280
Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain, it just makes you not care.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.280
Exactly.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
That's exactly what it is.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.600
I just don't care anymore.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.160
But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.440
We were on opposing teams.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.340
I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was

03:46.340 --> 03:47.840
on a few times in the past.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.360
I think she filled in for you one time.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.920
Her and Irene were on a show.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.400
But Victoria and I were a team and we came in second.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Woo!

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
So it was fun.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Yeah.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.000
And after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
the winner and the runner up.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.360
We're not doing this shit anymore.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.360
We're done.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.940
The rest of you are too far behind.

04:05.940 --> 04:06.940
The end.

04:06.940 --> 04:07.940
Yeah.

04:07.940 --> 04:08.940
I had a good time.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.640
And I will say this, it was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.520
So doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.960
But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.

04:19.960 --> 04:24.640
I don't know how many y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or even old enough

04:24.640 --> 04:29.800
to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now and they're kind of fun, actually.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.600
I want Amazing Race slot cars.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.800
I'm surprised that's a hobby.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
Four of us aren't into a slot car because I always kind of walk by the stores and go,

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
ooh, that's cool.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.000
I used to love those when I was a kid too.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.160
The hobby store that will dance into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.

04:47.160 --> 04:51.320
And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.560
Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can rent it on the slot

04:54.560 --> 04:55.560
sets.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.560
Good tie.

04:56.560 --> 05:01.040
Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?

05:01.040 --> 05:04.320
I think I want to say there was at least like a Micro Machines game.

05:04.320 --> 05:11.600
The typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's that has a pinball table in there.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.080
They have a slot car thing in there.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.080
Oh, fun.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.080
Nice.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
Going to our chat room.

05:17.080 --> 05:21.200
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and AllGames.com

05:21.200 --> 05:22.680
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.380
Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty

05:26.380 --> 05:29.520
insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.820
We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.

05:31.820 --> 05:32.820
We love Brad.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.360
Rob isn't out of shape.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.960
Round is a shape.

05:35.960 --> 05:36.960
You know what?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.560
Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment, actually.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
That was rather rude.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.560
Don't you think?

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
No, I'm kidding.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.720
And then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.720
SSJ100Matt says, OLR house MD, Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with, it's not

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
Lupus.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.360
It's a house joke, TV joke.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.360
Anyhow.

05:54.360 --> 05:58.560
Also, you can join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.840
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.120
All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer

06:05.120 --> 06:06.120
has a voice.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.840
We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
have been playing this week.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.160
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.560
How was your gaming week?

06:12.560 --> 06:14.680
I played well.

06:14.680 --> 06:21.120
And then I played nobi nobi boy today because I have the nobi nobi app on my iPhone and

06:21.120 --> 06:25.720
I every so often get randomly curious to see just how far he's stretched and he's finally

06:25.720 --> 06:28.840
hit Jupiter or that girl has stretched.

06:28.840 --> 06:33.200
So she's at Jupiter now because nobi nobi boy keeps feeding her his love.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.440
And it's just really stupid crack that I use to fill time.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.360
And I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.360
In fact, I'm just going to start it over.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.280
Oh, you start over.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, because I just want to sit and marathon it.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.320
You know what, if I don't play an RPG for a long amount of time, I kind of find I have

06:54.320 --> 06:56.760
to go back and start over as well.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.320
Like, because I feel like I'm so lost in the story.

07:00.320 --> 07:07.480
Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since

07:07.480 --> 07:10.140
with its freaky ass control style.

07:10.140 --> 07:17.440
And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man

07:17.440 --> 07:19.480
is totally janked in that game.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.520
His moves are messed up.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.960
You know, he's all messed up now.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
It's all about Deadpool.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.240
Movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.240
What?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.600
Well, they killed Johnny Storm.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
I know.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.000
Who was the most interesting of all of them?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.040
Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.040
Not really.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.040
All right.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.280
Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?

07:44.280 --> 07:48.440
Oh, I was going to say, it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy

07:48.440 --> 07:53.320
3, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.

07:53.320 --> 07:58.480
And what's particularly interesting about that is that, well, 1 and 2 on the iPhone

07:58.480 --> 08:00.680
were based off the PSP versions.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.360
There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.400
We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.

08:07.400 --> 08:12.500
But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone, so what is it going to be?

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
We don't know.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.080
Well, see, I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they

08:17.080 --> 08:20.200
did 1, 2, and 4.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.720
So I don't know, I think they're just going to go through and resprite them.

08:24.720 --> 08:30.320
In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for Wonderswan Color

08:30.320 --> 08:33.920
and might just pull whatever they were working on for that, because they had it in the works,

08:33.920 --> 08:35.600
it just never came out.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.520
So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.

08:37.520 --> 08:40.780
It would be interesting, though, if they do 1 for iPhone, why don't they just release

08:40.780 --> 08:42.360
it for PSP as well?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.080
I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
I think they're great.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.240
It was actually, 2 is really simple to play on, because I have 2 on my iPhone.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.560
I am so excited for 4.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.000
There's a part of me, though, that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.600
but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.

08:59.600 --> 09:04.880
I hope they bring 4 and the after years onto the iOS as well, because I don't really play

09:04.880 --> 09:05.880
with PSP anymore.

09:05.880 --> 09:10.840
I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.760
Well, after years did start as a mobile game.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.760
Yeah.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.240
Let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom, because this is a complaint

09:18.240 --> 09:20.760
I hear a lot, so I'm kind of curious what Dark Soccer thinks about it.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.320
Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.320
I'm like, so not cool.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.440
Well, outside at E3, but that was how long ago, and it wasn't really built of the game.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.880
But AkumaJP in our chat room says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.160
Not really that fun.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
Agree?

09:34.160 --> 09:35.160
Disagree?

09:35.160 --> 09:39.640
I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.

09:39.640 --> 09:44.440
I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
That's the thing.

09:45.440 --> 09:50.960
It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter

09:50.960 --> 09:52.440
4, same thing.

09:52.440 --> 09:59.480
But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because

09:59.480 --> 10:04.040
you can just throw off your super with the push of a button.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.640
When you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it, then there's...

10:08.640 --> 10:09.640
You can definitely...

10:09.640 --> 10:13.880
I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because it's not like, you know, like in Tekken

10:13.880 --> 10:17.880
where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.000
If you've got skill with it, then you can beat a masher.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't know if that makes sense.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.240
So it can be fun.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.400
Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the...

10:29.400 --> 10:30.560
I don't know.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.820
For basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before

10:34.820 --> 10:37.080
to get like a six or seven hit.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.440
But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have

10:41.440 --> 10:44.680
to practice and know how to do that stuff.

10:44.680 --> 10:49.280
Like I remember in X-Men versus Street Fighter, you'd go jab, jab, medium, medium, fierce,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.360
fierce, and you basically work through the buttons like a zigzag.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.360
That style, that's still in there, and that's not really easy to do.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.480
Wasn't that kind of...

10:57.480 --> 11:01.120
To throw it back, wasn't that kind of killer instincts thing, is it was very easy to combo

11:01.120 --> 11:03.320
if you just kind of knew the layout?

11:03.320 --> 11:04.320
Yeah, that's why...

11:04.320 --> 11:05.680
Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.160
That's why I always kind of liked killer instinct, to be honest, is that you don't really button

11:09.160 --> 11:11.680
mash, but it's not that hard to figure out the...

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
There's a sequence.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.920
If you learn the sequence, it just all comes naturally.

11:14.920 --> 11:19.600
In Killer Instinct, the way it was is light punch was linked to a medium kick, which was

11:19.600 --> 11:23.160
in turn linked to hard kick.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.380
And then the other way, so it was sort of like a crisp, but you could also go from light

11:26.380 --> 11:30.600
to hard, but you'd have to move them back in a certain order, and you could figure out

11:30.600 --> 11:33.600
any combo that way, but the buttons were linked a certain way.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.600
I used to...

11:34.600 --> 11:38.840
Well, we had a killer instinct at my arcade when I went to the University of South Alabama,

11:38.840 --> 11:43.240
and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off, because we could do all of those 44 hit

11:43.240 --> 11:48.480
combos and everything, too, but the thing, though, is that with the early versus games

11:48.480 --> 11:53.840
versus the late versus games, that's a lot of versus, the late versus games is that the

11:53.840 --> 12:00.800
early ones still went on that Street Fighter, you know, the six button layout style, whereas...

12:00.800 --> 12:02.360
Hi.

12:02.360 --> 12:11.920
Because we have a four button with a special, so it's just kind of different.

12:11.920 --> 12:17.880
Sorry, we're being interrupted with food requests, that's why we're distracted, so anyhow.

12:17.880 --> 12:23.560
I wanted to throw this out real quick, though, speaking of Killer Instinct, I realize that

12:23.560 --> 12:27.560
everything's up in the air with Rare, and they're not really with Nintendo anymore,

12:27.560 --> 12:32.400
and things aren't like they used to be, but seriously, seriously, what's gotta happen

12:32.400 --> 12:34.280
for there to be a Killer Instinct 3?

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
I know.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
Like, how bad?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.800
Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
Me, me, me, me, me.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.800
Okay, that's me and Jamie, that's it.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
All right, still...

12:41.800 --> 12:46.260
I still wanted the public flogging of the whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct

12:46.260 --> 12:50.960
Complete 64, that piece of crap port, ugh, already upset thinking about it.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.360
The SNES version was the best home port.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.360
The end.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.360
Yes.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.360
Or MAME.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.360
Mhm.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
And I love the mar-cats.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.360
Ah, I love the CD.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.360
Good times.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
I listened to that so much.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.880
Killer Instinct had awesome music, it really did.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.880
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.400
Actually, Killer Instinct 2, though, did have one really good piece of music, and that was

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
Orchid's theme.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
Mhm.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.320
And I remember, this is when I lived in Alabama, and Dan and I were just friends online, is

13:14.320 --> 13:19.040
that he actually waited until the, cause the game would start with a random stage, and

13:19.040 --> 13:23.640
he waited until Orchid's stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV

13:23.640 --> 13:24.640
file back in the day.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.640
Oh, that's nice.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.640
That was so sweet.

13:26.640 --> 13:32.080
And by the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her, like, unrealistic boobies.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.760
She was the first one I beat the game with in KI 2.

13:34.760 --> 13:35.760
Nice.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.760
All right.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
Let's move on.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.760
Loki!

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
How you doing?

13:39.760 --> 13:40.760
How was your game of the week?

13:40.760 --> 13:41.760
Oh, it was all right.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
Didn't play a lot, though.

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
Um.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.480
Just mainly, Sword and Poker 2, and um.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.480
I keep forgetting to get that game.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
It's awesome.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
You always tell me about it.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
I always forget to get it.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
It's seriously awesome.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
I will.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
And then, um, just Grand Theft Auto, mainly.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.240
I don't know, that's about it.

13:58.240 --> 14:04.480
Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.

14:04.480 --> 14:09.480
It's only, like, 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.880
But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
What's that?

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
Murder Boner.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
So, uh.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
That's pretty sweet.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
Um.

14:18.880 --> 14:23.680
Gotta love that kind of stuff.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.360
I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.960
It's Bayonetta with a dick.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.640
It's Murder Boner, is what it is.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.640
Okay.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.640
Bayonetta with a murder boner.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.640
All right.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
Fair enough.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.640
All right.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.640
Um.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.600
Slice of Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
Um.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.200
I actually played a few games this week.

14:43.200 --> 14:48.020
Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually, you know, and I already reviewed

14:48.020 --> 14:51.320
the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, but I just want to emphasize, if you

14:51.320 --> 14:56.280
are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with

14:56.280 --> 14:59.840
you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another, because I'll tell you, it was a little

14:59.840 --> 15:03.920
bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack, where you can only

15:03.920 --> 15:09.000
access the first five in the beginning, and then as you play, you unlock one more, so

15:09.000 --> 15:13.160
it's like you only ever have five open at a time, but what was frustrating about that

15:13.160 --> 15:17.400
is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house, so

15:17.400 --> 15:21.560
when we let the game just randomly pick an episode, we got the first game over again,

15:21.560 --> 15:25.000
so Alan and I were just sitting there, you know, we knew it was just, who buzzed faster?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Who can buzz faster?

15:26.000 --> 15:30.600
It was really all it came down to, so I was a little bit frustrated that that happened.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.400
I understand they probably designed it that way for Xbox Live mode, so that way there

15:35.400 --> 15:39.120
would always be some episodes at the end, most people haven't got to yet, but I would

15:39.120 --> 15:45.440
say for the next You Don't Know Jack game, it would be even better if the non-Xbox Live

15:45.440 --> 15:50.960
games were one set of games, and then the Xbox Live games were like another set of games,

15:50.960 --> 15:56.440
and what they could even do is that, like, let's say you have 70 offline episodes, and

15:56.440 --> 16:03.320
let's say 50 online episodes, have it so that if you have already played all 50 episodes

16:03.320 --> 16:08.120
online, you only get matched up with other people that have played all 50 episodes online.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.280
That way, all the, like, I don't want to say cheaters, but all the people that already

16:11.280 --> 16:12.280
know-

16:12.280 --> 16:13.280
Have, like, staggered levels.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.280
Exactly.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.280
You know, kind of like-

16:15.280 --> 16:17.080
Like, matching, I guess, sort of way.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.320
That would be my feedback for the You Don't Know Jack folks, otherwise I still think it's

16:20.320 --> 16:26.200
hilarious, it's a great party game, it's fun, it's not a $60 game, which is great, and,

16:26.200 --> 16:30.280
you know, it's worth your time, so do check it out.

16:30.280 --> 16:35.960
Other games I played this week, I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the, it's Contra, but it's

16:35.960 --> 16:44.040
not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,

16:44.040 --> 16:48.020
like the same Contra music, so it's Contra, people, it's just Contra.

16:48.020 --> 16:53.760
I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old-school gamers wish they had so

16:53.760 --> 16:56.160
much more of on Xbox Live.

16:56.160 --> 17:02.080
It really is just, like, a souped-up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo

17:02.080 --> 17:09.160
game, now with 3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
It just uses-

17:10.160 --> 17:11.160
2.5D?

17:11.160 --> 17:15.600
Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing, where, you know, things are coming out of the background

17:15.600 --> 17:19.160
and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff, but, like, if you like Contra, this is like

17:19.160 --> 17:23.440
an, you don't even have to think, you're gonna want this game, buy this game.

17:23.440 --> 17:26.440
It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.

17:26.440 --> 17:31.440
It's, you know, modernized a bit, there's this full-on anime opening sequence, it's

17:31.440 --> 17:38.800
like, it kind of just made me think of, like, yeah, fuck yeah, Contra, fuck yeah, fire burn,

17:38.800 --> 17:42.240
you know, chicks with guns, it was kind of awesome, so.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
Cool.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.240
It's definitely worth your time.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.360
The only downside?

17:45.360 --> 17:47.560
No up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.720
It didn't work, unless I put it in the wrong place or something, I wasn't able to get that

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
code to work.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
Try it backwards.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
Maybe.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
You die.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
Yeah, I know.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
That happened at-

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
But-

17:58.720 --> 17:59.720
One of the Gradius games did that, too, I think.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.

18:00.720 --> 18:07.520
Wasn't it Gradius 4 on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used LRLR, then you would

18:07.520 --> 18:09.960
get all the power-ups, instead of left, right, left, right, the shoulder buttons.

18:09.960 --> 18:14.040
And I think Gradius 5 only let you do it three times.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.040
So.

18:15.040 --> 18:22.080
Also, I played an indie game on the marketplace called Try Not to Fart, and that's the set

18:22.080 --> 18:23.520
of- Jamie looks disgusted.

18:23.520 --> 18:27.360
No, I'm not disgusted, it's just like a what?

18:27.360 --> 18:31.760
It actually cracked me up, like, it's really funny, like, it's just basically like, you

18:31.760 --> 18:35.920
actually try to hold down buttons, like, buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have

18:35.920 --> 18:40.360
to press that right button, and then when it flashes, you let go.

18:40.360 --> 18:44.560
And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels, but then as you move

18:44.560 --> 18:49.600
on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y, now let go of A.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.600
So it's like Twister.

18:50.600 --> 18:53.920
Yeah, yeah, it's like Twister, and then if you screw up, you fart.

18:53.920 --> 19:00.280
But what's great is that it's like you're on a date with a girl or whatever, and so,

19:00.280 --> 19:04.000
like, the best part of the game is the inane conversation that's happening in the background

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
where you're trying not to fart.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
I like fish.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.640
Exactly, they're, like, talking about, and it's all these, like, total douchebag topic

19:10.640 --> 19:13.720
types of things, like, you know, so, do you come here often?

19:13.720 --> 19:17.480
Oh, well, I didn't, you know, they're having this conversation, and then, like, if you

19:17.480 --> 19:22.360
accidentally fart, it'll go pfft, and it's like, it's just like, ew, that's disgusting.

19:22.360 --> 19:27.520
It's just, like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way, but.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.200
I like how your shoes are tied.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.600
Like, don't spend money on it.

19:31.600 --> 19:37.440
No, I shouldn't say that, because it's an indie development place, but I just, you know,

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
it reminds me a lot of-

19:38.440 --> 19:44.160
I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.

19:44.160 --> 19:51.480
The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe, where they had this, like, game

19:51.480 --> 19:54.560
where you're talking, you're hitting on women and stuff, and you have this little sperm

19:54.560 --> 19:59.040
that you have to kind of move up and down through, like, this maze that's coming along

19:59.040 --> 20:06.040
the screen, you have to dodge, like, the, uh, I don't know, just, like, STDs or whatever,

20:06.040 --> 20:10.720
but if you hit that stuff, he starts saying weird things, you know?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.280
Yes, I remember that.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.280
It's kind of funny.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.280
I do remember that.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
That was funny.

20:15.280 --> 20:21.080
So, all right, um, thank you, Salacious Pop brought me food for that.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.080
He rocks.

20:22.080 --> 20:26.560
All right, um, uh, before I turn it over to Salacious Pop for his gaming week, let me

20:26.560 --> 20:29.720
talk real quickly about, and I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because

20:29.720 --> 20:33.040
there was an NDA and everything, but, eh, it's an open beta.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.200
Everybody's playing it, if they're interested in it.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
It's Rift.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.080
I played for a little bit this week.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.720
I grinded a character up to level 8, and, uh, how do I explain Rift?

20:42.720 --> 20:47.920
It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways, to the point where I didn't

20:47.920 --> 20:51.400
know what button did what, and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?

20:51.400 --> 20:55.520
Oh, well, in WoW, I hit N, and sure enough, I hit N, and it brought up my talent tree.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.120
So, it's kind of funny that I kind of, like, knew the buttons from just having played WoW

20:59.120 --> 21:04.960
so much, um, but obviously, Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's, let's be honest,

21:04.960 --> 21:09.600
Rift, in its advertising campaign, is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
like that.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.400
It's trying to say, this isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
You're not in Azeroth.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.400
Yeah, something like that.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.400
Like, not in Kansas.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
Exactly.

21:17.400 --> 21:21.960
Um, so I played the game to, like, level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know, and, um,

21:21.960 --> 21:23.520
I don't know, I gotta be honest.

21:23.520 --> 21:29.040
I wasn't really feeling it, like, the game didn't have anything that just made me jump

21:29.040 --> 21:31.240
out of my seat, go, wow, that's cool.

21:31.240 --> 21:36.560
Now, I do hear the PVP's pretty cool, and there are some, like, questing in the world

21:36.560 --> 21:41.560
events, and that's something that was in Warhammer, that I really liked in Warhammer, um, the

21:41.560 --> 21:46.680
whole public questing idea, and I wish WoW had something like that, and I did like that.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.360
But um, you know, I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels, so it's really, I'm

21:50.360 --> 21:54.160
not going to try and review the game, because, you know, I'm just telling you, I played it,

21:54.160 --> 21:58.800
I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels, everybody's telling me

21:58.800 --> 22:04.200
you have to really invest time into it, but let's be real, you know, the game also kind

22:04.200 --> 22:07.640
of has to do something to make me want to get that far, I mean, wasn't that everybody's

22:07.640 --> 22:09.940
biggest bitch about Final Fantasy 13?

22:09.940 --> 22:12.840
It doesn't get good until you're, like, 15 hours in?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.400
That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.840
Yeah, and, you know, true, some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which

22:18.840 --> 22:22.020
is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and

22:22.020 --> 22:24.960
redid all the starting areas, to make them a little more interesting.

22:24.960 --> 22:30.040
So, you know, Rift, it's a new game, they'll iron out some of the kinks, it'll be interesting,

22:30.040 --> 22:33.040
um, I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.240
I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the Fury Tail one or not, I kind of, I'm

22:37.240 --> 22:40.920
not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but, whatever.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.040
Would you, did you have something you want to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
How does it look, is it pretty?

22:45.040 --> 22:47.520
Yeah, it's pretty, I don't know.

22:47.520 --> 22:52.280
There's something about, something about the way the characters look, I kind of like the

22:52.280 --> 22:57.200
cartoony look of WoW, that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic, it does have

22:57.200 --> 23:00.960
more intense character customization, I spent a lot more time doing that, so that was kind

23:00.960 --> 23:01.960
of cool.

23:01.960 --> 23:08.160
But, um, I don't know, like, I thought the scenery looked really nice, I really liked

23:08.160 --> 23:14.280
the environments, I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects, all that's really beautiful,

23:14.280 --> 23:19.120
but I wasn't, like, really into the way the characters looked, or the monsters, but, you

23:19.120 --> 23:23.840
know, I don't know, I could, that's, that's really an opinion, so, there you go.

23:23.840 --> 23:28.800
So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week, uh, we'll move on, I already mentioned the

23:28.800 --> 23:31.680
Twitter and the Facebook and all that, as far as housekeeping goes, I don't think I

23:31.680 --> 23:35.480
have a whole lot else to add, so, let's get into some actual...

23:35.480 --> 23:36.480
Falafels!

23:36.480 --> 23:37.480
Falafels!

23:37.480 --> 23:39.600
And then Game, oh, yes, Salacious Pop?

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
My Gaming Week.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.280
Oh, I'm sorry, well that's what happens when you leave the room, Salacious Pop, how was

23:43.280 --> 23:44.600
your Gaming Week?

23:44.600 --> 23:48.440
Yeah, I left the room because I was sent to bring him food, so...

23:48.440 --> 23:50.960
I know, you were gone for, like, an hour.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.960
That's right.

23:51.960 --> 23:58.040
Um, well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp, that's more appropriate for your other podcast.

23:58.040 --> 24:02.480
Um, the Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed

24:02.480 --> 24:05.440
it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.

24:05.440 --> 24:10.120
Then some, uh, You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.

24:10.120 --> 24:19.080
Um, I played about an hour's worth of The Great Gatsby Tribute, NES ROM Hack, amazing,

24:19.080 --> 24:20.080
love it.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.760
That was a book that we had to cover, I think it was junior or senior year in high school.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.760
It's an old...

24:24.760 --> 24:27.880
Okay, tell me about how this works as an NES game.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.880
I don't get it.

24:28.880 --> 24:34.600
It's, in level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend, who is sort of the person that

24:34.600 --> 24:37.440
he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.

24:37.440 --> 24:43.920
You show up at, um, Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and

24:43.920 --> 24:47.200
find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage, and it's basically a platformer.

24:47.200 --> 24:52.860
You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at them.

24:52.860 --> 24:55.200
And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.880
Um, so I played that.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.800
I hated that book, just so you know.

24:58.800 --> 25:03.080
That, well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have

25:03.080 --> 25:06.240
to read in high school really depends on the teacher, I feel.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.920
I'll give you that, but I never liked being forced to read books, and there were some

25:09.920 --> 25:11.680
truly terrible books I had to read in high school.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.760
And we had to read a separate piece, oh my god, I hate that book so much, and The Crucible,

25:15.760 --> 25:16.760
Arthur Miller, ugh.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.320
I think I read a separate piece, and I didn't, what's a separate piece about?

25:19.320 --> 25:22.960
I sound so uneducated right now, this is years ago, what's a separate piece about?

25:22.960 --> 25:26.840
It's the best friend, and they're on the branch, and one of them sort of jostles the branch,

25:26.840 --> 25:28.240
and his best friend falls.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.560
I think I really like that book.

25:29.560 --> 25:32.400
And breaks his arm, and he feels guilty about it like his whole life.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.560
Yes, I like, I really like that book.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.560
Awful.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.680
It's my least favorite, I hate this book, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.680
Dandelion Wine.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.280
I've never seen, we haven't covered that one.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.800
Ugh, terrible.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.160
The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.560
But I loved Catcher in the Rye.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
We did a nice advance, but not.

25:49.560 --> 25:54.760
I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.

25:54.760 --> 26:01.360
So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky, did you talk about the hold in the

26:01.360 --> 26:02.360
fart game?

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
Yes I did.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.240
I missed that.

26:06.240 --> 26:12.320
So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each

26:12.320 --> 26:14.280
number of the question.

26:14.280 --> 26:19.240
The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh number five girl, you rock my world girl.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.240
Cracks me up.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.240
I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.960
So you have to play that game.

26:24.960 --> 26:29.480
Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.840
Yeah, but that's all.

26:32.840 --> 26:38.600
What other classic book should they turn into an 8-bit game?

26:38.600 --> 26:39.600
Watership Down.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.460
Oh yeah, that'd be a good one.

26:42.460 --> 26:46.720
How about Brave New World?

26:46.720 --> 26:51.420
How about Atlas Shrugged, and then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.

26:51.420 --> 26:58.840
What's the book, James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages, and it's a classic.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.920
I'm liking on the name of the book.

27:01.920 --> 27:02.920
Maybe somebody in chat will.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.600
Well, we've already had The Inferno.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.000
Oh yeah, it's true.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.780
By the way, Dark Toa Gak in our chat room, I love this comment, LMAO, we're reading that

27:12.780 --> 27:17.280
in English right now, and the teacher brought that game up.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.760
I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.520
You know what, if I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to

27:23.520 --> 27:24.520
get people interested.

27:24.520 --> 27:28.600
Like I think, I don't know, I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if

27:28.600 --> 27:32.280
you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.760
Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.

27:34.760 --> 27:38.920
It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in

27:38.920 --> 27:39.920
New York.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.680
I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.040
I don't like her.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.040
Anyway.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.360
Video games, video games, wow, wow, wow.

27:48.360 --> 27:52.880
All right, let's talk about some actual video game news, Loki, help, or we're going to turn

27:52.880 --> 27:54.960
into the literary podcast.

27:54.960 --> 28:00.520
Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar

28:00.520 --> 28:03.800
cut scene directors.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.840
I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.

28:08.840 --> 28:15.240
He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for

28:15.240 --> 28:17.360
Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.

28:17.360 --> 28:23.760
But anyways, he's working on a game called 1979 The Game, which sounds kind of boring,

28:23.760 --> 28:31.880
you know, a game about a year, but no, actually it's about the Iran revolution, and basically

28:31.880 --> 28:39.840
he says they're focusing on the takeover of the American embassy and outline the game,

28:39.840 --> 28:43.800
saying that they're looking at about eight to 10 different roles or different perspectives

28:43.800 --> 28:47.920
that are going to be in the game, different characters, and initially you'll start the

28:47.920 --> 28:55.320
game off as an Iranian but American born US State Department translator who is, I guess,

28:55.320 --> 29:00.840
coming in with the objective to try to free the US hostages.

29:00.840 --> 29:05.320
So interesting subject, I suppose.

29:05.320 --> 29:09.240
They're saying that obviously it's going to be a social and political title, and there's

29:09.240 --> 29:14.520
going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.

29:14.520 --> 29:21.520
I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's

29:21.520 --> 29:28.240
not a sandbox game, but it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going

29:28.240 --> 29:33.880
to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting

29:33.880 --> 29:34.880
subject.

29:34.880 --> 29:41.280
Honestly, before I was born, so not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened,

29:41.280 --> 29:45.680
but so you're calling us all then, basically, when you make yes, I am calling you.

29:45.680 --> 29:50.120
Well, I was one year old when that all went down, and I'm sure that you were.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
I know, right?

29:51.120 --> 29:55.480
Immediately on top of all the political news, but it is still a little weird.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
I don't know.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.560
These whole like games based off real life are kind of strange to me.

30:00.560 --> 30:05.680
I don't I can't put my finger on it, but like, wouldn't this game kind of encourage you in

30:05.680 --> 30:08.920
some ways to be like changing history?

30:08.920 --> 30:10.600
Or like you can change history in it?

30:10.600 --> 30:11.680
I don't know.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.200
But then again, I love civilization, so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
It's different.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.080
I can't explain it.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.580
It's different.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.320
Is this a game you're interested in playing, Logie?

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
Not really.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
It doesn't sound that interesting.

30:25.320 --> 30:29.920
Even though even with the Grand Theft, no, because it's a guy who was a cutscene director.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.000
I mean, so what they directed stuff.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.600
It's not the people actually.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
I don't know.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.400
It's it doesn't really count.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.440
Do you think that maybe it's kind of funny because I was just mentioning this in our

30:40.440 --> 30:42.080
whole little literary discussion.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.600
It's not like Rockstar Games is saying, OK, we're going to make a game about the Iran

30:45.600 --> 30:46.600
revolution.

30:46.600 --> 30:51.400
Then even then, I'd be kind of like, eh, I don't buy everything Rockstar puts out.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
I mean, come on.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.400
Rockstar Table Tennis?

30:53.400 --> 30:54.400
No, thanks.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.680
I bought Rockstar Table Tennis.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
All right.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.720
Look, I'm sure you're sure you play that game every day.

31:00.720 --> 31:06.240
We were just talking about how, you know, if I were a teacher, I would use the great

31:06.240 --> 31:11.240
Gatsby game to try and relate the book to kids and make it more interesting.

31:11.240 --> 31:15.520
Is this maybe a way because all of us in the room admit we don't we weren't really old

31:15.520 --> 31:18.480
enough to understand what was going on at the time.

31:18.480 --> 31:24.020
So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened.

31:24.020 --> 31:25.360
I guess it could be.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.280
I mean.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.280
I just don't care.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.280
I don't know.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.820
That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.

31:32.820 --> 31:38.680
It's just like I wouldn't want to like a game based off of, I don't know, most of history.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.680
I just don't really give a crap about history.

31:41.680 --> 31:47.480
Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history

31:47.480 --> 31:53.000
unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.320
I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could

31:59.320 --> 32:02.360
just go and read everything, which I have.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.040
I go back and read history books for fun.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.960
The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer

32:08.960 --> 32:09.960
Red Alert.

32:09.960 --> 32:15.120
Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
Here's the funny thing.

32:16.120 --> 32:21.240
Like in Einstein, I, I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know

32:21.240 --> 32:24.160
is stretching it a little bit, but that's like going way back, like I remember Battle

32:24.160 --> 32:25.160
of Olympus on the NES.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.160
That game was awesome.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.680
And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.

32:29.680 --> 32:34.040
But like if they were to make a video game on like other recent historical things, like

32:34.040 --> 32:38.280
let's be honest, if they were to make like a game on 9-11, that's not a game.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.360
That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.

32:40.360 --> 32:44.080
Like that's just not, like games are, I don't know, they're supposed to be like entertaining.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.640
How do you even make a game out of that?

32:45.640 --> 32:46.640
I mean, really.

32:46.640 --> 32:52.200
Well, hopefully there isn't one, but how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.200
I mean, come on.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.200
It's weird.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.200
Okay.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
Let me put this though into perspective.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.200
Okay.

32:57.200 --> 33:06.120
I would say that World War II just ended three months ago and someone wants to put 1942 on

33:06.120 --> 33:09.800
the market.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.480
It's the same thing.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.960
And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
That wouldn't fly.

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
Yeah.

33:14.960 --> 33:20.040
Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?

33:20.040 --> 33:22.040
There's zillions and zillions.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.840
And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.480
Yeah, I know.

33:27.480 --> 33:32.720
So, I mean, hate to say it, if there's a war involved, it sells games.

33:32.720 --> 33:37.440
They're just going to leave out certain things that are too recent for people, but you know,

33:37.440 --> 33:42.760
maybe 15 years from now, we're going to have a, you know, a rewrite history game where

33:42.760 --> 33:46.320
you save the tower or something.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.960
They tried that and unfortunately that game sucked.

33:48.960 --> 33:54.420
It wasn't necessarily saving the tower, but it was, and I'd see, my mind is already blocked

33:54.420 --> 33:56.680
it out because it was such a crappy first-person shooter.

33:56.680 --> 34:01.800
It came out last September of 09.

34:01.800 --> 34:06.320
And basically you went back in time and you had to save specific people from history.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.280
Just like nobody people.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.560
But they had the Civil War and stuff like that and everybody's fighting the muskets

34:12.560 --> 34:17.780
and you have this laser cannon, you know, just like, oh, you have to reload your musket.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.400
Let me blow off your head with this Uzi.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.280
You know, it's just time cop shit.

34:23.280 --> 34:28.160
If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a sneak or a stealth game where

34:28.160 --> 34:33.000
you investigate, where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.400
Return of Time Pilot, maybe, because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.900
Modernize that.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.120
Way off topic here, but he brought it up.

34:43.120 --> 34:47.240
Metal Gear Solid, wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Metal Gear Solid style game set

34:47.240 --> 34:50.480
in like a high school or something like that and you're just like a high school kid or

34:50.480 --> 34:53.400
something and all very sneaky around.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.960
Are you shooting people?

34:54.960 --> 34:56.680
Because that's not going to go over very well.

34:56.680 --> 34:57.680
No, not shooting people.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.240
I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.680
Oh, like gossip.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.360
That should be the Mean Girls game.

35:04.360 --> 35:09.380
Not this puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip biatch of the school where

35:09.380 --> 35:14.160
you eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.800
Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
That should be the Mean Girls game.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.800
Way too dramatic.

35:19.800 --> 35:27.960
You know, just like everything way overdramatized, you know, just a ridiculous amount of drama

35:27.960 --> 35:28.960
to the game.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.040
It'd be awesome.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.600
No one has that kind of sense of humor, but Konami, I can see that you have that sense

35:34.600 --> 35:41.960
of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and, God, what was that crappy high school

35:41.960 --> 35:44.440
dating game that they had on the PSP?

35:44.440 --> 35:47.840
Oh, I don't even, I remember the game.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.920
I don't remember what it was called.

35:49.920 --> 35:54.880
Anyways, see, I think all those things could be fixed with a little bit of Metal Gear Solid

35:54.880 --> 35:59.680
thrown in, and hell, if you want to be funny even better, you know, even better if you

35:59.680 --> 36:04.740
want to be a little bit more funny, you could have the principal or dean to be actually

36:04.740 --> 36:05.740
Old Snake.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.680
It'd be hilarious.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.040
Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know.

36:11.040 --> 36:17.720
Alright, let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon, and

36:17.720 --> 36:21.880
actually a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this

36:21.880 --> 36:22.880
week.

36:22.880 --> 36:28.840
They announced a lot of new games that are coming out, and the first is the Fables series.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.920
This is the comic book series Fables.

36:30.920 --> 36:35.280
That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012, so that's one of the games

36:35.280 --> 36:37.800
that they are working on right now.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.560
You know, kind of fairy tales.

36:39.560 --> 36:45.480
They get, this is interesting, the comic book is based on characters from various fairy

36:45.480 --> 36:48.340
tales like Snow White, Pinocchio, and this stuff.

36:48.340 --> 36:52.720
They get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.640
So like, if you're thinking like, Fables is like, oh, it's like a Hansel and Gretel.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
It's very different.

36:59.160 --> 37:03.400
I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic, Vertigo, which is

37:03.400 --> 37:09.060
DC's sort of more, I don't want to say adult, but their more serial, like, mature imprint.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.800
They put Fables out, I have the two first volumes, and it's awesome.

37:11.800 --> 37:16.320
I actually just, um, we've talked about a new issue that came out, which is the Cinderella

37:16.320 --> 37:18.800
based one, where she's an assassin.

37:18.800 --> 37:23.920
So it's like Enchanted, Enchanted meets Leon Professional.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Pretty much.

37:24.920 --> 37:25.920
Nice.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.520
How do you think it's going to translate into a game, those of you that know the books pretty

37:28.520 --> 37:29.520
well?

37:29.520 --> 37:30.520
I think it could do it.

37:30.520 --> 37:35.520
Yeah, the, it's like, I want to, I mean, they cuss a lot.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.960
Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F bomb in the comic.

37:38.960 --> 37:43.600
She's like, you know, because Beauty and the Beast to go see her for marital problems.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.420
And she's like, I'm not a caseworker, leave me alone.

37:46.420 --> 37:49.520
If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.520
Why are you asking me?

37:50.520 --> 37:52.000
I get banged by seven different dwarves.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
F off.

37:53.000 --> 37:58.360
Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
in the comic.

37:59.360 --> 38:04.920
Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is

38:04.920 --> 38:09.120
Dorothy Gale, who's a codename Silver Slipper.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.120
Nice.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.000
Maybe they have the chew thing going on.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.280
Can I be honest?

38:13.280 --> 38:16.800
I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm like really interested.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.440
I'm gonna have to like borrow your books.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.280
That sounds awesome.

38:20.280 --> 38:25.260
I like things from my childhood, like really, really messed up.

38:25.260 --> 38:29.160
If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.240
Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?

38:31.240 --> 38:32.240
Yeah.

38:32.240 --> 38:37.400
The entire claw, I mean, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation, The Great Gatsby in 3D, that's

38:37.400 --> 38:38.800
gonna make no fucking sense.

38:38.800 --> 38:44.120
I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism

38:44.120 --> 38:49.600
in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.600
Not to say it's bad.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.600
I like Moulin Rouge.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.600
Yeah.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.440
But I just don't like this 3D orgy, all these movies are having.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.440
No, no, I understand that.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.440
Everybody's, whatever.

38:56.440 --> 39:01.460
I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.

39:01.460 --> 39:02.460
Thank you.

39:02.460 --> 39:03.460
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.460
This is why I love him.

39:04.460 --> 39:06.400
It's in 40!

39:06.400 --> 39:07.400
With the Batman movies.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.400
I know.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
I know.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.400
All right.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.840
So anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale press event, Jurassic

39:13.840 --> 39:15.480
Park is one of the other games.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.200
We've known they've been working on this for a while.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.980
They showed off a little more about the game, and it's gonna be coming out in April.

39:20.980 --> 39:27.040
And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently the story

39:27.040 --> 39:31.480
involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved,

39:31.480 --> 39:37.400
and you can say the book too, of course, although not to get off track, but I always found it

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
interesting.

39:38.400 --> 39:43.720
Did you ever read the sequel to the book, the Jurassic Park, the Lost World, the book?

39:43.720 --> 39:47.640
Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?

39:47.640 --> 39:48.640
Yeah.

39:48.640 --> 39:51.520
Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back because

39:51.520 --> 39:52.520
they didn't die in the movie.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.800
I always found that fascinating.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.840
Well, Crichton was like, millions of dollars?

39:55.840 --> 39:58.520
Oh, I'll have this done in two weeks.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
Exactly.

39:59.520 --> 40:02.400
I loved Jurassic Park when I was younger though, and that movie like first came out.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.480
I love that, and I love the book, and I even like the sequel.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.560
I just didn't care for the third one.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.160
But anyway, I'm actually really excited about this.

40:11.160 --> 40:15.280
But the loophole, or whatever you want to say, the place they found in the story, is

40:15.280 --> 40:19.880
that, remember Nedry, who was played by the guy from Seinfeld?

40:19.880 --> 40:20.880
Newman.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.880
Newman, yeah.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.600
When he escapes, he gets killed, right?

40:24.600 --> 40:26.040
But what was he trying to do?

40:26.040 --> 40:27.880
He was trying to get out of there with the...

40:27.880 --> 40:30.800
The shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.000
But it's never recovered.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.800
It's always assumed lost.

40:33.800 --> 40:38.680
So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?

40:38.680 --> 40:39.680
Where did it go?

40:39.680 --> 40:40.680
Who found it?

40:40.680 --> 40:41.680
What did they do with it?

40:41.680 --> 40:48.040
So I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie, so I'm pretty excited

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
about this.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.040
It's going to be pretty awesome.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.900
Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.580
That's a $5 off the regular price.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.160
The Walking Dead.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.180
This is a show on, what, AMC that a lot of people are really into?

41:00.180 --> 41:01.180
Also a graphic novel.

41:01.180 --> 41:05.540
Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.

41:05.540 --> 41:09.920
So are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?

41:09.920 --> 41:13.440
I don't know the show at all, but you know the book, and you know the show.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.560
I know it's a book first, and then it became the AMC show.

41:16.560 --> 41:21.840
I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.

41:21.840 --> 41:29.960
Other than I love stuff with zombies, like I never get bored of zombies.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.400
Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.940
There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.

41:35.940 --> 41:40.240
Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.

41:40.240 --> 41:45.040
Also Hector, Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.

41:45.040 --> 41:51.000
It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.400
And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind

41:54.400 --> 42:00.040
of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.

42:00.040 --> 42:05.180
And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fan

42:05.180 --> 42:09.560
boy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really

42:09.560 --> 42:10.800
going to be making it.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.160
Gosh, shouldn't Telltale make a King's Quest game?

42:13.160 --> 42:14.280
Wouldn't that be a perfect...

42:14.280 --> 42:15.840
And it's like really happening, y'all.

42:15.840 --> 42:19.680
Now we kind of know why Activision sent that cease and desist to that other group, because

42:19.680 --> 42:25.400
this has probably been in the sort of brainstorm for a while, so now Activision looks less

42:25.400 --> 42:28.080
like jerks, and I don't like it when that happens.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.080
Exactly.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
Yeah, I know.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.600
I think a lot of us are going, oh, that explains a lot.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.480
Well, and the cool thing is, though, the silver lining people are still allowed to do their

42:36.480 --> 42:42.480
thing, and they're putting out what, the third game, or they just put out the third episode

42:42.480 --> 42:43.560
in their series.

42:43.560 --> 42:46.600
So it's cool that that's able to coexist, because you know what?

42:46.600 --> 42:51.720
I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe, so to speak.

42:51.720 --> 42:52.720
Why not?

42:52.720 --> 42:55.320
We have all these, like we were saying earlier, World War II games.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.320
We have TV shows.

42:56.320 --> 43:01.480
We had two Star Trek shows on at the same time, so why not?

43:01.480 --> 43:06.360
And it's cool that one's free, and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way,

43:06.360 --> 43:09.520
but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
You know what I mean?

43:10.520 --> 43:13.240
I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals, because I know they're really

43:13.240 --> 43:17.680
passionate about what they do, but on one department, you have the same group that made

43:17.680 --> 43:20.520
Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.480
Telltale has a proven track record.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.080
They have the pedigree to do this.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.800
That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.

43:26.800 --> 43:31.540
And it's really cool that both are gonna be coexisting and what have you, and I am so

43:31.540 --> 43:34.900
excited to see what they put out.

43:34.900 --> 43:38.080
I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.100
I mean, I realize she's, what, living in a fort in the middle of the woods now, and doesn't

43:42.100 --> 43:43.400
really do a lot with gaming.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.980
They live in Yosemite or something weird, I don't know.

43:44.980 --> 43:47.040
They pretty much remove themselves from society, I think.

43:47.040 --> 43:51.240
So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy, because I have so many

43:51.240 --> 43:53.960
video game memories tied to her and Ken Williams.

43:53.960 --> 43:58.320
And they just, like, I don't even think I have to say this, because I think they already

43:58.320 --> 44:02.400
know, but Telltale, if they're gonna be rebooting it, we've gotta have something as awesome

44:02.400 --> 44:04.440
as Rosella, the fourth game.

44:04.440 --> 44:09.440
And I think there will be nods, there'll be winking nods to the old stuff, I believe it.

44:09.440 --> 44:10.440
So it'll be cool.

44:10.440 --> 44:15.520
Because they didn't say it's a remake, they said it's a reboot, more to be revealed at

44:15.520 --> 44:16.520
E3.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.520
So, very cool.

44:18.520 --> 44:19.980
Very, very cool.

44:19.980 --> 44:23.080
So lots of news out of Telltale this week.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.560
Let's move on, though, with some other news.

44:24.560 --> 44:25.560
DarkStakra.

44:25.560 --> 44:31.640
Well, there's a different perspective out on how piracy is going in the PC market.

44:31.640 --> 44:40.320
And they're actually saying that according to this one facility, the PCGA research group,

44:40.320 --> 44:45.080
that actually PC piracy has gone down.

44:45.080 --> 44:51.480
Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off disks and then downloading a crack

44:51.480 --> 44:54.280
file so that they could play the disks.

44:54.280 --> 45:00.160
And that now it's because there are so many things that are included in the games now

45:00.160 --> 45:04.840
that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game

45:04.840 --> 45:10.040
goodies, that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not gonna get any

45:10.040 --> 45:12.700
of the bragging rights that go along with having the game.

45:12.700 --> 45:17.680
And a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple

45:17.680 --> 45:24.160
systems, who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it.

45:24.160 --> 45:28.320
And the other thing, too, is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it

45:28.320 --> 45:34.320
comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost-effective to run your own

45:34.320 --> 45:36.200
server for a lot of these games.

45:36.200 --> 45:42.400
You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400
playing Ragnarok Online.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.200
Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.

45:46.200 --> 45:49.120
I digress.

45:49.120 --> 45:51.420
But the WoW ones are really jank.

45:51.420 --> 45:53.520
It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.

45:53.520 --> 46:00.080
And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to

46:00.080 --> 46:03.240
private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters

46:03.240 --> 46:04.240
over.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.120
Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?

46:08.120 --> 46:09.320
Yeah, they did.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.340
So that was really cool.

46:11.340 --> 46:15.520
And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that

46:15.520 --> 46:20.880
you can't pirate a free game.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.520
It's free anyway, so why not?

46:23.520 --> 46:26.880
And it's not like if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server,

46:26.880 --> 46:31.180
then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself as opposed to getting the

46:31.180 --> 46:34.560
community content like how they did with Second Life.

46:34.560 --> 46:40.280
So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are

46:40.280 --> 46:44.920
distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.

46:44.920 --> 46:45.920
Interesting.

46:45.920 --> 46:50.440
I mean, when I first kind of heard the title of the story, I'm kind of like, really?

46:50.440 --> 46:54.040
It seems like with a lot of the stuff we read about, it's up, especially with Torrance and

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
everything.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.040
But that does make sense.

46:56.040 --> 47:00.740
And a lot of MMOs really dominate, whether you hate them, you can't deny, they really

47:00.740 --> 47:05.680
dominate a lot of the PC gaming market, and you really can't pirate those.

47:05.680 --> 47:09.800
I mean, you can, but it's just not, I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting

47:09.800 --> 47:13.640
the same experience that a person who pays for it does, unless it's Ragnarok Online.

47:13.640 --> 47:21.600
I like with your first person shooters, that you've got servers set up for online play,

47:21.600 --> 47:27.160
and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself.

47:27.160 --> 47:30.480
Or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled.

47:30.480 --> 47:36.400
If you've got a pirated version, because I've noticed a few of those running about.

47:36.400 --> 47:42.000
I've noticed a lot from more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.600
Modern Warfare 2, Starcraft 2.

47:44.600 --> 47:51.320
Even without the cinematics, these games are huge, and I know that at home broadband connections

47:51.320 --> 47:52.960
are faster than they've ever been.

47:52.960 --> 47:57.480
You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like a hundred bucks.

47:57.480 --> 48:02.680
But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70

48:02.680 --> 48:03.680
gigs.

48:03.680 --> 48:07.160
And it's like, yeah, all right, leave it running overnight, but it's like, that's just too

48:07.160 --> 48:08.160
much.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.160
I'd rather just buy it.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.160
I don't know.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.360
Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.

48:14.360 --> 48:15.440
We'll see.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.440
That's what everyone would like to hear.

48:16.440 --> 48:21.580
The thing is that it's really slow, but honestly, it doesn't take much.

48:21.580 --> 48:24.080
And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.

48:24.080 --> 48:31.780
They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or the RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.

48:31.780 --> 48:38.700
And they have programs like JDownloader, which will actually allow you to, if you don't have

48:38.700 --> 48:42.640
a membership or whatever to those sites, it'll automatically wait the 30 seconds or whatever

48:42.640 --> 48:45.960
to download your file, move to the next one, and so on and so forth.

48:45.960 --> 48:50.200
Then it's very automatic overnight, and the download speeds are a lot faster.

48:50.200 --> 48:57.720
Or there's also Usenet, which newsgroups and stuff like that, you can download a DVD in

48:57.720 --> 48:58.720
like an hour.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.800
This question's gonna sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.880
What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?

49:03.880 --> 49:08.920
Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before

49:08.920 --> 49:11.960
they call your house and threaten you.

49:11.960 --> 49:15.920
And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.

49:15.920 --> 49:19.840
Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.880
Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I wanna say

49:23.880 --> 49:25.920
Starcraft 2 is at least 20.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.560
Well, like Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's the big

49:29.560 --> 49:30.560
game.

49:30.560 --> 49:35.640
Yeah, but everything's compressed, I mean, you're talking like the most, you're gonna

49:35.640 --> 49:41.880
probably have two DVD9 disk images or whatever, you're looking at 18 gigs or something like

49:41.880 --> 49:42.880
that.

49:42.880 --> 49:46.860
Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's gonna be very difficult to

49:46.860 --> 49:49.360
hit your cap of 250 gigs.

49:49.360 --> 49:53.040
And I can tell you this now, I download my episode of Supernatural every week, because

49:53.040 --> 49:56.280
I'm at Temple on Friday night, and so I miss it.

49:56.280 --> 50:00.980
So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural, and I've just downloaded the first four episodes

50:00.980 --> 50:06.680
of Being Human, Season 3, and the first two of the American version of it, like, last

50:06.680 --> 50:11.880
night, while I was playing World of Warcraft, and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.240
So it's really not that hard.

50:13.240 --> 50:16.720
Are you not able to, well, TV shows are kind of a different thing, though, are you not

50:16.720 --> 50:21.400
able to watch Supernatural online, like on the official website or anything like that?

50:21.400 --> 50:25.680
Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week

50:25.680 --> 50:31.880
later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.

50:31.880 --> 50:36.480
Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go

50:36.480 --> 50:41.400
on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's

50:41.400 --> 50:42.440
Drag Race.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.440
Every week.

50:43.440 --> 50:47.000
I will go on and watch that on Logo's website.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.160
Well, I don't think you can watch the Colbert Report and The Daily Show.

50:50.160 --> 50:51.160
Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.160
It doesn't even have to be, like, Hulu or whatever.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.160
You can go on the website.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.080
Survivor every week is there.

50:55.080 --> 50:58.720
Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this

50:58.720 --> 51:02.200
show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.840
Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way with...

51:04.840 --> 51:05.840
That's weird.

51:05.840 --> 51:10.600
And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television

51:10.600 --> 51:14.960
is absolutely stupid, and I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being

51:14.960 --> 51:16.520
talked down to.

51:16.520 --> 51:21.880
So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it, and, like, if I'm in the

51:21.880 --> 51:26.280
middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish

51:26.280 --> 51:32.440
watching the episode, or I can, you know, go mining or something.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.940
Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.

51:34.940 --> 51:38.240
This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.

51:38.240 --> 51:42.440
We were talking about King's Quest, Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orangetontrady.com

51:42.440 --> 51:45.000
saying, reboot Space Quest.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
Yes.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.880
Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would

51:50.880 --> 51:55.200
be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?

51:55.200 --> 51:57.000
One of the hero's games?

51:57.000 --> 52:01.800
The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember

52:01.800 --> 52:04.800
anymore, if they sign off on it, then hell yeah.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.280
Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.760
But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?

52:09.760 --> 52:14.000
So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
I don't know.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.720
Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably

52:17.720 --> 52:20.060
better left in the past.

52:20.060 --> 52:21.060
But I digress.

52:21.060 --> 52:22.060
Let's move on.

52:22.060 --> 52:23.060
Loki, what do you have for us?

52:23.060 --> 52:31.880
Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great, or good, or worth playing.

52:31.880 --> 52:36.400
We talked a little bit about some of the stuff before, how there's been, you know, copycats

52:36.400 --> 52:37.400
on the App Store.

52:37.400 --> 52:42.680
In fact, there's even been, you know, I mean, no one's gonna say that there's not knockoffs

52:42.680 --> 52:43.680
on the App Store.

52:43.680 --> 52:49.120
I mean, hell, some companies have made a good business of putting out high-quality knockoffs

52:49.120 --> 52:50.440
at different games.

52:50.440 --> 52:55.200
But plain theft of actual games.

52:55.200 --> 53:03.400
One of the games that's been hit with this is the game The Blocks Cometh by Halfbot.

53:03.400 --> 53:11.640
And it was actually a Flash game at one point, but there's a, you know, group of people that

53:11.640 --> 53:20.200
actually stole the game, and the assets, and everything else, and put it up on the Apple

53:20.200 --> 53:23.040
App Store, and were selling it for quite a long time.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.040
I remember this.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.560
This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.

53:26.560 --> 53:31.920
Yes, and it was just like, you know, they were trying to get, you know, people trying

53:31.920 --> 53:36.600
to get Apple's attention to get it taken down.

53:36.600 --> 53:42.080
Because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99-cent app.

53:42.080 --> 53:49.600
It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy

53:49.600 --> 53:50.880
section of the App Store.

53:50.880 --> 53:55.840
So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.720
And now it's finally back.

53:58.720 --> 54:03.560
The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.

54:03.560 --> 54:08.480
So that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.

54:08.480 --> 54:11.960
But I mean, a lot of damage has been done, and people already have, like, the old version

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
of the game.

54:12.960 --> 54:14.720
So it kind of sucks.

54:14.720 --> 54:15.720
What can be done about this, though?

54:15.720 --> 54:18.680
It's very interesting, because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to

54:18.680 --> 54:20.600
screen for copyrighted stuff.

54:20.600 --> 54:23.760
I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace,

54:23.760 --> 54:24.760
they'd kind of get that.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.320
But, you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest.

54:27.320 --> 54:30.080
I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game, either.

54:30.080 --> 54:31.080
No.

54:31.080 --> 54:32.760
You don't have time to play everything.

54:32.760 --> 54:33.760
Exactly.

54:33.760 --> 54:36.400
So how do you stop theft like that?

54:36.400 --> 54:40.960
I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace, does a peer review.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
Is that the answer?

54:41.960 --> 54:43.960
I don't know.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.640
It might be the answer, I don't know.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.320
But it's not the only game that happened to it.

54:49.320 --> 54:52.640
There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with

54:52.640 --> 54:53.640
fighting animals.

54:53.640 --> 55:01.300
It was like a 3D fighter game, and that actually had a version of it, you know, ripped off

55:01.300 --> 55:02.300
and put on there.

55:02.300 --> 55:05.920
A little bit different situation with that is people that they claimed they were sold

55:05.920 --> 55:10.560
the rights to the game and stuff like that, but, you know, the developer said, no, you

55:10.560 --> 55:15.680
only have the rights to, you know, this, for, you know, the Flash game or something like

55:15.680 --> 55:16.680
that.

55:16.680 --> 55:17.680
We have the rights to do this.

55:17.680 --> 55:19.040
So there's a big ol' thing about that.

55:19.040 --> 55:21.600
Well, that's not so much a blatant ripoff.

55:21.600 --> 55:25.360
That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other by people like companies.

55:25.360 --> 55:26.360
Something like that, yeah.

55:26.360 --> 55:31.640
Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.400
Smurfs Village, obviously a game that's out there.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.000
It's free to play, sort of.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.360
They call it like a freemium game.

55:39.360 --> 55:46.960
Well, there's been a lot of complaints from Capcom, or, you know, to Apple, I guess.

55:46.960 --> 55:54.560
Apparently Capcom, you know, they don't have good luck with the stuff on the iOS, I swear.

55:54.560 --> 56:00.880
Mainly there is a problem that people have been racking up pretty huge bills with this

56:00.880 --> 56:01.880
game.

56:01.880 --> 56:06.920
Mainly do, I guess, Apple's iTunes protocol means that once you've entered your password

56:06.920 --> 56:12.480
or whatever, all subsequent downloads and, you know, paid or free or whatever, don't

56:12.480 --> 56:15.420
require a password to be re-entered for 15 minutes.

56:15.420 --> 56:19.600
So say someone goes and purchases something on there, gives it to their kid to go play,

56:19.600 --> 56:20.880
you know, a game or something like that.

56:20.880 --> 56:24.560
He can go on the Smurfs Village and, oh, I'm going to spend $50 over and over and over

56:24.560 --> 56:26.400
again and just keep racking up.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.560
I'll tell you, it's really easy to buy stuff within a game.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.160
It's just a little pop-up box.

56:31.160 --> 56:33.720
Click OK to purchase dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

56:33.720 --> 56:34.720
It's very easy.

56:34.720 --> 56:35.720
Yes.

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
So, you know.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.720
What do you want to say, Salish?

56:37.720 --> 56:41.920
I was just, I don't even, you know, have kids in my household and I'm usually very protective

56:41.920 --> 56:42.920
of my stuff.

56:42.920 --> 56:45.520
For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.

56:45.520 --> 56:49.200
I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.

56:49.200 --> 56:53.120
I want to be asked for my password every single time.

56:53.120 --> 56:54.120
Yeah.

56:54.120 --> 56:59.040
And there's also ways, I mean, if you have kids and, you know, this is something that

56:59.040 --> 57:02.960
you're afraid that might happen, there is a way you can also disable.

57:02.960 --> 57:06.320
First off, you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.640
You can also disable in-app purchases.

57:08.640 --> 57:09.800
And it's opt-out though.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.040
It's not opt-in, which is the problem.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.040
It's opt-out.

57:13.040 --> 57:15.440
So, you need to, you know, make sure you do that.

57:15.440 --> 57:20.520
But yeah, apparently, you know, there's, I know we've heard there is, you know, kids

57:20.520 --> 57:24.820
racking up thousands of dollars of purchases because they thought, you know, Smurf Berries

57:24.820 --> 57:25.820
were free.

57:25.820 --> 57:30.080
I hate to break it to you, kids, Smurf Berries are never free.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.080
Here's the thing.

57:31.080 --> 57:35.920
Like, I get where there's a problem on, I don't think that's really Capcom's fault.

57:35.920 --> 57:40.840
I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down and to be honest, I haven't

57:40.840 --> 57:43.600
had to, you know, nobody uses my phone but me.

57:43.600 --> 57:44.600
So I haven't had to explore.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.960
Well, they're basically saying, I mean, yeah, I agree that they should lock it down, but

57:47.960 --> 57:52.340
they're also making it seem that it seems like the kids aren't even aware that it's

57:52.340 --> 57:53.340
costing money.

57:53.340 --> 57:54.480
And then there's my other thought.

57:54.480 --> 58:00.680
Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that

58:00.680 --> 58:01.680
somewhat?

58:01.680 --> 58:04.520
Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this, well, I guess maybe some

58:04.520 --> 58:05.520
parents don't know.

58:05.520 --> 58:09.120
They may not know it's a free Smurf game.

58:09.120 --> 58:11.960
I still think some onus is on the parents.

58:11.960 --> 58:15.440
It is negligence on the parents' part for sure, but.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.800
But you're right, you shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.

58:18.800 --> 58:23.000
They're not making it any, I mean, they're making it as easy as possible for it to happen

58:23.000 --> 58:28.920
so that, you know, maybe say, you know, a kid rack up, you know, racks up, you know,

58:28.920 --> 58:31.360
$30 with the purchases or something like that.

58:31.360 --> 58:37.080
The parent might go, shit, but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded,

58:37.080 --> 58:40.640
you know, whereas, you know, thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all

58:40.640 --> 58:43.040
of a sudden, you know, Capcom's giving them the money back.

58:43.040 --> 58:47.400
But how many times, you know, is this happening that they're not getting their money back

58:47.400 --> 58:49.320
or not even trying to get their money back?

58:49.320 --> 58:56.280
Yeah, now a lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with

58:56.280 --> 59:01.440
the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is it doesn't say this costs

59:01.440 --> 59:02.800
you $5.

59:02.800 --> 59:06.680
It says this costs you 20 fairy dust points.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.280
So the kid's like, oh, okay.

59:08.280 --> 59:13.160
And when they refill their bucket of whatever, that's when that real money comes in.

59:13.160 --> 59:15.280
So the currency within the game is...

59:15.280 --> 59:16.920
Oh, like Microsoft points.

59:16.920 --> 59:24.200
Yeah, or even Knight of the Clicky, the Squaresoft, you know, the Square Enix party points or

59:24.200 --> 59:25.200
whatever.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.040
It's not, there's always a layer of...

59:27.040 --> 59:28.040
Party points?

59:28.040 --> 59:29.640
They haven't even, they didn't do Gil?

59:29.640 --> 59:33.080
I don't think, it's not really, I think they're just Gweenix coins or something like that.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.080
Yeah.

59:34.080 --> 59:40.600
They actually talk about this is money for dollars because a kid might recognize that,

59:40.600 --> 59:42.560
but there's that sort of, I don't know.

59:42.560 --> 59:46.160
I think it's a very, some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.520
Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

59:48.520 --> 59:53.000
Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod touch, you can log off your account before giving

59:53.000 --> 59:54.760
it to a kid to play.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.280
There's a suggestion.

59:56.280 --> 59:59.640
Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.560
to keep their kids occupied.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.520
I've seen them watching videos and playing games.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.280
Xlink says, parents are being stupid.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.380
I have two kids and I know about what these games do.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.380
And here's a clue.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.800
If something is free, there's a catch.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.180
So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying that this is a problem.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:22.120
So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has sold Capcom in no

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.920
uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.000
significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.460
amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.320
In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
game.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.940
Fix it.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.680
That's basically what that means.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.280
Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.760
Basically from Apple and credit card companies because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760
authorize this charge.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.560
Yeah, let's do a charge back and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.240
So yeah.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.680
Interesting.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.520
I do think though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.880
They enabled this feature.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.020
They made it so easy to do.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:13.240
They need to kind of educate people and they're making money off of it.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.140
And they approved Capcom's game.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.240
So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.100
And I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff, but I think Apple needs

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.100
to own some of that.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.520
And it's not that difficult to, you know, patch this shit.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.040
I mean, fuck, there's games that patch themselves, you know, once a week.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.040
I mean, come on.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040
Just do it.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
Just fix it.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.040
All right.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
Well, we'll see what develops with that.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.920
Yeah, there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.800
to what's going on with your kids.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.800
Seriously.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800
That still wouldn't stop it.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800
All right.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.560
Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.160
And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.500
is buying this game.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.080
But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.760
all the big gaming blogs.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.740
But yes, it is true.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.440
They are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars limited edition.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.200
It's called a final shipment.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.440
I'm surprised they didn't call it like an encore shipment or something like that.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.840
But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.240
to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240
a Wii disc.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240
That's all it is.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240
No extra frills.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.240
No nothing.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.720
Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.920
Oh, excuse me.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920
Excuse me.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.920
Yeah, but I mean, come on.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.400
That's basically included in the price.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.720
And it's a limited sampler soundtrack.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720
It doesn't have like a full soundtrack.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.840
It's just the Super Nintendo NSF files or whatever they're called.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840
No, no, no.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.160
It's everything from the original Mario Bros all the way up through Galaxy and stuff.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.160
Alright, fine.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.560
But no, it's like one song from each game.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560
So who cares?

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.000
And that stuff's like all on the internet anyways.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.040
No, but basically, here's the thing.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.440
It's not in large quantities.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.000
It's going to be just as limited as it was before.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.280
They're just releasing a few more.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.680
In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.200
Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.760
shit basically.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.520
So yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.360
But hey, you know, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:18.440
But honestly, just tell yourself it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.200
port it over to the Wii.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.200
That's all it is.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.740
If you want that soundtrack and you want that book, great, I guess.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.720
But I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.680
I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.880
There's just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.280
of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.080
I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.160
and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
And on top of all that-

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.360
And if they want more for it, talk them down.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.720
And the fact that this game is going for that much money online, and the fact that they're

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.320
like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320
You know what that means?

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.640
More of this shit is gonna happen coming soon.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.480
I mean, you bet your ass that they're gonna fucking reprint that goddamn- Remember the

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:11.640
Legend of Zelda bonus cysts that they had for pre-ordering Wind Waker and shit?

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
How much you want?

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.680
But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.920
They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out like Mario

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.000
64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.960
But they could always do more GameCube games.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:30.000
Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS, or Mario Kart or whatever.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.240
They could easily do it for another system.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:38.120
And Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them, and people

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.560
are dumb enough to purchase them.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.880
But let's also be real.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:44.040
What else is coming out on the Wii?

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.320
There's that awesome-looking role-playing game in Japan that's not coming out here.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320
We've been doing-

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.200
There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports makes.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.060
They haven't announced a new title- Well, Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.120
This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.120
No.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.800
What, they're just gonna stop doing Wii stuff?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.240
No, it's not that they're stopping doing Wii stuff.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.480
They just haven't announced anything yet.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.560
They haven't announced which games are coming out.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:09.800
They still have stuff in the pipeline.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.240
They have the new Zelda game that's in the pipeline.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.240
Oh yeah.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.360
That's fourth quarter, I can tell you right now.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.080
They have, you know, stuff coming, and then there may be unannounced stuff, and they may

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.440
try to pull the new play control crap again, but those are dumb.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440
I don't know.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.560
They don't really have a lot.

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:32.080
They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff, so who knows?

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.080
We'll see.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.920
In the meantime, more news, Dark Sakura?

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.920
Yes.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920
I have news.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.420
All right.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:46.440
There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.980
is gonna seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:55.600
symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.400
How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.460
But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's psychophysiology lab and bio-feedback

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:10.360
clinic, so it at least has a reputable study that was done about it.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:17.440
They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression, and they played Bejeweled

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.140
2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle, and they all experienced a significant reduction in

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:27.080
anxiety and better mood.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.680
Does this explain why sometimes, and I don't know how many of y'all do this, but like when

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.240
I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home, but I'm just not feeling, you know,

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.060
it's raining out, and I'm just feeling kind of blah, I'll sit there on Facebook and play

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.400
that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.280
Like does that tie into this?

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.980
I will admit something.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.720
You know that towards the end of my job period, I was very unhappy.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720
Right.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720
Very unhappy.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720
Right.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.200
I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.420
I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk, and I would always

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.500
feel better.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:08.640
Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.900
Or I would, you know, I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks, but it was

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:18.820
just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air,

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.160
and I found I could get back to work and do fine.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.760
But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.760
Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.760
Auto IV.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.760
He's been doing it for years.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.360
That's not for blowing off stress.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.440
I'm not, well I'm not saying Loki- That makes my coworkers more stressful actually.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.280
I'm not saying like Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.600
way to relax?

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.600
It's your way to kind of unwind at work.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600
Right?

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600
A little bit?

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.600
It doesn't really matter.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.560
I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560
People like games.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560
I mean there's lots of things.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.340
But I couldn't sit and do that with like Final Fantasy II for example, which I was still

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.760
playing on my phone.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.040
Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.720
I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game, you know?

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:11.160
But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.160
to later, it's easier.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.040
You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.440
That's yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.560
And clearly I'm not alone.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.280
Do you have a comment?

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:30.280
No.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280
Oh sorry, I was looking.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.680
S2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I can attest to this.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:40.040
Ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.320
Rickster in our chatroom says, maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.320
play modes.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.320
Interesting.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320
That is true.

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.440
Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it.

01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.680
Maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.440
I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but interesting.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:07.280
But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.240
just casual games or if other games are involved in it.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.480
But I do see where, just in my own experience, we're going and blowing off a little bit of

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.480
steam on a couple levels of a game, or you know, playing a couple levels of solitaire.

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.360
Or like, you know, my friend, she would do Sudoku puzzles to chill out.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360
That stresses the hell out of me.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.320
Yeah, Sudoku puzzles make me more stressed out.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.200
She's an accounting major now.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.080
You gotta have something special to like those puzzles.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.080
She loves numbers.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.160
New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:51.840
Actually playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.880
Because they don't frighten me.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.040
The games don't frighten me.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040
People frighten me.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.420
Maybe Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:05.920
I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.280
People freak me out more than the game does.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.960
And fake blood freaks me out.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.040
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says video games do help you relax until you start kicking

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.880
and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.880
They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.760
You know what stresses me the hell out?

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760
That'd be awesome.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.040
I'm not fighting games with Dan because he's a dick.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.640
I love you.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.560
He's a jerk when he wins.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.560
He's a sore winner.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560
Yeah.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.080
All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.520
games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.160
We'll start in the US with Loki.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.600
There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out of this week, which is pretty

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600
cool.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.200
You know, starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you is playing.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.160
Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.120
But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120
360.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.480
That includes an early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.240
It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:14.360
And then also the limited edition, which is on PS3 and PC, so you can check those out.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.740
Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.960
That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.680
Let's see here, Ys I and II Chronicles with the soundtrack.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.520
That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.520
Re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice and

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.720
Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.680
Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlus saying that they're marking some of that stuff

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680
down.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:42.080
Those are coming out this week as well.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:49.960
The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:56.160
Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi, all for $30.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:04.200
Knight's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.760
3.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.480
Track Mania, Built to Race.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.320
Track Mania is an awesome game on PC, so you should definitely check it out if you have

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320
a Wii.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:16.840
That'll be coming out on Wii, I believe also on DS as well.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.760
Such a great racing game.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:25.680
And then, a crappy game called Rec Room, it's coming out on DS, it's a portable Wii game.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680
Party stuff.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680
Fun.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:36.440
DeBlob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, no PC on that I guess.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.600
I remember the original DeBlob, it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.680
Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.680
But if, you know, you have a PlayStation 3.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.200
Because people don't remember the first one so well, it was kind of one of those under

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200
the radar.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:56.840
Yeah, the PlayStation 3 don't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:01.180
Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:02.180
That's pretty cool.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:08.680
I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Vilious,

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.080
that's coming out on PC this week.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.120
Yeah, probably is another expansion.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.440
EverQuest loves their expansions.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.920
I'm surprised, that's just, that's kind of interesting that they're doing that.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.280
And then, what else, oh, some no name game.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.800
Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life, if you like those hidden picture type games,

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.280
that's coming out on DS this week.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.280
Um, that's basically it.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.440
Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.600
This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.560
Moochi Moochi Pork and Pink Sweets.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.640
Yes, that's really what it's called.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:57.200
It's from Cave, so, uh, you know what kind of game that is, it's like a cave shooter

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.200
type game.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.480
I think this is like a two-in-one type of thing, so I think that's kind of a cute title

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480
though.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.320
So, you know, if you like your bullet hell games, there you go, some pink sweets for

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320
you.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.120
Also, speaking of like cutesy games, The Idolmaster 2 gets its release this week on the Xbox 360,

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:17.400
and I don't know if you remember the first one, but that was a big game, um, over in

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.400
Japan.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400
It never came out here.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:24.240
It was a very, uh, Japanese kind of game, that I guess some of you folks might just

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.240
have to import.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240
I don't know.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.400
Otherwise, we'll move on to some of the other consoles, uh, moving on to the PlayStation

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.800
3, uh, coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:42.360
Also, uh, Bulletstorm Killzone 3 gets a release in Japan this week, and, uh, I don't know

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:50.880
how to pronounce this game, Lave Once Mermaid's Tears comes out, and Makai Senke Disgaea 4

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.720
comes out this week in Japan, speaking of games people are probably going to import.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.600
That might also explain, um, some of the re-releases that Loki already went over, uh, Rune Factory

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:05.480
Oceans comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3, uh, moving on to the Nintendo Wii real

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.600
quick to see if there's anything coming out in Japan, uh, yeah, they get Rune Factory

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:15.300
Oceans there as well, and then SD Gundam G Generation World, cause you just...

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:18.680
Like we really need another Super Deformed Gundam.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.720
You know you love your Gundam games, don't lie.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:27.920
Uh, also, it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan, it comes

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.960
out on February 26th.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.120
I seriously thought about, you know, the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.680
that, and I was like, no.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:41.680
So uh, yeah, this is the big week guys, Winning Eleven 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:50.680
Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, uh,

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:57.560
let's see, Nintendogs plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle editions, um,

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.400
Layton Kojo Toukisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Layton, and uh, Combat of Giants

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.840
Dinosaur 3D.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:10.480
All of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week, so that's Saturday,

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:11.480
that's the 26th.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.720
So what games are you gonna get on the 3DS when it comes out?

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.880
I'm probably gonna, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.440
Then maybe the Street Fighter game.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.440
You make bad decisions.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.440
What?

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.200
Okay, Mr. Salacious Pop.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:31.320
You know what, and I agree with you that it's a terrible decision that I too will probably

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.540
have to make, because I'll be honest with you, there's a lot of games that are coming

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.700
out on the 3DS, and not a lot of them interest me.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:43.480
And the ones that did interest me, like Dead or Alive, well actually Dead or Alive didn't

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.600
really interest me that much, but you know, Street Fighter and whatever, um, but Dead

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.280
or Alive, not coming out at launch, coming out in May.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.560
Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kinda cool, coming out in May.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.920
It's not coming out right away, but uh.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.280
So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.520
I don't.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.240
I'm just gonna wait until May.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240
I think it looks cool.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.180
I actually wanna, I don't know.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.080
I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.040
I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:21.320
See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.320
living expenses.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:27.200
I, you know what, if I was in that situation I would probably do the same thing.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.240
Even though we've paid off like all our bills.

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:36.360
I would sell stuff in the house, that's what, and it's not even any rational reason, I mean

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.880
it's just like ridiculous stuff.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880
Maybe the pilot wings game.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.080
Dan's talking that he wants the Playstation phone.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.140
Yeah the pilot games, the pilot wings game looks pretty awesome.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.440
If it were coming out at launch.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440
Oh it's not at launch?

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.360
Well they haven't announced their launch titles, Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.280
Which means they're like, oh we got nothing.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.400
Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.520
it?

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.840
You can't see this but I'm flipping you off right now.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.720
I want you to buy Marvel vs Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.080
place.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.480
You guys are assholes.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.400
What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.280
Kid Icarus because you don't play portable games at all.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.280
It's not coming out at launch.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.480
Well that's, yeah, I can wait though, obviously you can.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.720
Launch window games is, they're like, I love Nintendo, that's great.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.960
Launch window games, it's this, from launch to 3 months after launch, that's not a window.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:33.080
Launch window is that week, that is the launch window.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.160
You don't launch for 3 months, that's not a launch.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.880
3 months is a quarter, that's the difference between Q2 and Q3.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:45.400
But anyways, if we're gonna say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool, Dream

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:52.000
Trigger, it's a shooter music game, which is kinda cool.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:58.240
I hate even wanting to say this but the new Spongebob Squigglepants, the one that's like,

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.840
hey no no no, it's like WarioWare.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.760
It's a WarioWare type game.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.000
I got not to get, what was I gonna, not the Spongebob but the other one.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.280
I was gonna ask about, oh, music shooter games, do we have a definitive date for Child of

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.280
Eden yet?

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280
I wanna say we have.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.280
It's like in June right now.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.280
Okay.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.000
I don't think it's got a date on it.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
How about UK release dates?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.200
Yeah we'll get there but I never did the PSP ones cause everybody was bitching at me about

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200
putting in 3DS.

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.200
Sorry.

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:31.200
So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan, Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.400
and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.760
Alright, now ma'am we may go to the UK.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.880
On the 22nd we have Cities in Motion for PC, the 23rd we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:49.600
Blitz Live, on the 24th Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm, we have DeBlob 2,

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.000
we have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Gray Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.360
Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:08.680
Cling together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360 PC and Playstation 3.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.200
I'm efficient.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.680
Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.800
Alright.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.040
Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.680
how efficient she is on that.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.920
Alright, Loki.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:28.080
This is kinda odd but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.560
in so what's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:38.840
They're releasing tablets because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.320
first coming around.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:47.400
Hell, my uncle used to sell them and he's out of the job now so that tells you something.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:54.380
Anyways, yeah, they've come a long way but yes, apparently the Xperia Play is not the

01:20:54.380 --> 01:21:03.000
only device from Sony that's gonna be allowing you to play PSP or I should say, yeah, PSP

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:12.280
Playstation Network apps or Playstation 1 classic games but no, they do have the S1 tablet.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.120
It's a Playstation Suite certified tablet which means it's gonna be running the Android

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:23.480
operating system and they haven't really said what it's gonna look like although there was

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:25.800
a rumored design.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.040
It was some sort of tablet that actually folds, it has like a screen that actually bends which

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:42.020
is kinda funky but cool I guess and that'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:47.140
But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:53.360
building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and Playstation

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.800
Network services, developing or delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.800
the...

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.760
I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.560
So yeah, they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.360
in the market and it plays Playstation 1 games.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:19.200
No one, I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.240
to play a Playstation 1 game on a goddamn tablet.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.480
It's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of...

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.480
Signs.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.480
Agreed.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.240
But, and here's the other thing too, why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:38.360
tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what, we may just extend this Playstation

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.600
suite to, you know, the Apple iPad or something like that.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.800
And a lot more people I'm sure have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever and they can play

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:51.040
their games on there but I for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.080
or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because one, it would take up

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.000
a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity, and two, it would play

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.880
like shit because touch controls.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.000
Here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.960
dead when I start using it for the first time, right?

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.840
That's the real question.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:20.120
I don't know, it's just, I mean seriously, if you're looking to get a tablet, just wait.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:27.000
I mean, because there's so many competing tablets out there now, or there will be, these

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.200
things have got to be dropping in price soon and it's just the longer you wait, the better

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:35.120
technology you're going to get in your tablet, the more you're going to get for your money.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.920
So just wait it out, I mean seriously, there's no need to rush in to play Playstation 1 games.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.560
If you really need to play Playstation 1 games, you can get a Playstation 1, a Playstation

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:53.400
2, a Playstation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer, you can just wait.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.560
I mean, there are plenty ways to do it.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.860
Well here's something you shouldn't wait for.

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:02.600
If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:04.200
buy it new.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:08.780
Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:13.200
Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.320
comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.480
This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.480
But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:27.600
So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the Playstation

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.600
3 used.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:32.640
By the way, just I want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.800
quote on this, that's why this is news this week because they did make a comment on it,

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.460
quote, once the PSN key has been consumed with a disk, it cannot be resold or replayed

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.000
with the second user adding a sub.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.560
Only the original consumer can use that account.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.000
They say the retail disk and the PSN code, they are one and the same.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.840
Once you use it, it is gone.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.680
A second hand user cannot obtain a new code.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.120
And the only reason this is happening, and just because it's an MMO and because it has

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:05.980
a 30 day free trial, otherwise people would just be able to pop it in the different systems

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.680
or just loan it to friends and have 30 day trials for everybody.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:15.240
Which honestly is not a bad idea, it's a good way to get people hooked on your game, but

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.640
no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.880
game out there.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.120
I think when they do that, people will be pissed.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.400
This is alright.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.960
This is expected with an MMO.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.480
With an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.560
So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.520
care where you, like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:45.880
my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.240
I don't have to go out and buy another disk, because that serial number is attached to

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.240
my subscription.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:54.920
Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than mine than Blue Blizzard,

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.920
but they still worked.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.520
But would you be able to do that with DC Universe online if you lost your Blu-ray disk?

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520
Probably not.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.400
But you've already paid for it though.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.480
If you lost your disk, it doesn't matter.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:09.520
It's not linked to the disk, it's linked to the game.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.360
The game has a code on the back of the box.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.120
Yeah, but how would I play DC Universe online without the damn disk?

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120
Exactly.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.520
Well, you would have to get a replacement disk if you lost your disk.

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.920
And you shouldn't be such a, you know, a klutz if you're, you know, oh, where'd my disk go?

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:23.920
I don't know.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.920
I'm just saying.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.920
I'm just saying, it's not tied to a disk.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.120
The disks are all pressed in mass quantities.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.800
It's not actual, each individual disk is tied to a code.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.940
It's just the disk packaging has a code printed on it, and that's what's tied to your system.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:43.560
So you know, in theory, say, your friend has the game also, and he lost his disk, and you're

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.720
a kind soul and wanted to loan him your disk.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.720
That is absolutely fine.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.800
It will work just fine.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.680
It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.840
play it.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.120
There's no extra code.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:04.000
Although, if they were smart, what they would do is they would have it, oh, okay, I don't

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.400
have a code for this game, but I have the disk.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.120
I want to play, you know, online.

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.200
Okay, well, you can pay a small fee, and we'll give you a code, and then you can play the

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.200
game.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.480
Well, actually, they wouldn't want that because they're afraid of piracy.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.720
But yeah, it's, they should still try to make money off of it.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:24.440
Dartatsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.080
canceled your subscription.

01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:31.960
You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360,

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.800
and I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.080
the game and get 30 days free.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:41.400
Well, and here's the other thing, too, about, you know, the DC Universe thing.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.600
Let's just say it's not as prone with, as the 360, but let's say your system dies.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
Crap.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.000
Because it's tied to your system.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.880
I guess you have to call their customer service.

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:55.880
Alright.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:00.800
Well, anyhow, I got one more, uh, no, wait, I lied, that's it, that was my last story.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.880
So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.840
Let's stop, let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.760
for 30 days for free in serial numbers.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:18.800
Let's go back to a day when we had a single-player game in front of us on the TV and we liked

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.800
it.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.760
Well, this wasn't on the TV in America.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.960
A single-player game in the arcade and we liked it.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960
And it was a two-player game.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:26.960
A two-player game in the arcade.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.520
What's the fucking classic game of the week?

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.520
Psycho Soldier!

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.200
I brought it up last week, so I figured I may as well talk about it, because it's a

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.200
notable game.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:41.480
Even if it's not a great game, it's a notable game.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:48.160
Yeah.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.840
And this is why the game is notable.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:55.520
It is the first arcade game that has a vocal soundtrack.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.480
If you want to turn it up a little bit, this is the English one.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:08.320
This reminds me of Lunar on Sega CD.

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320
Yeah.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.600
Actually, I think the Japanese singer is a little bit better.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.480
The other link that I put was the Japanese soundtrack.

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.480
I'll have to call that up real quick.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480
But, um, huh?

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.480
It's not very good.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:18.480
Not great.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.480
Not great.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.960
Um, however, this game, again, like I said, is notable for being the first video game

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:27.320
that had an in-game vocal soundtrack.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:30.680
And it's a sequel to SMK's Athena.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:35.640
And this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character, Athena Asumiya, comes

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.960
from, as well as C. Kento.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.840
As that NES game way back in the game, right?

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.840
Yes.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.840
Wow.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:50.720
This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720
in 1987.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.640
Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you had pressed S for.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.960
Oh, and there's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.960
Yep.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.960
I see that.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.960
Let's play a little bit of that.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960
I'm jamming.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:17.920
A little less screeching in.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.920
Yeah.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:25.000
But at any rate, this game, basically in the first, in Athena, you play as Athena, who's

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.840
bored with hanging out with gods and goes off and runs and all to her adventures.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.920
This is her descendant.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:36.720
So basically, she's, well, running around with psychic abilities, and you have, it's

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.360
a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to, because you

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.160
could just run into a wall or into a trap or something that would just completely kill

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.040
you.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.200
So her buddy, C. Kento, is player two.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.880
And it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:02.920
uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.880
as their default outfits, I believe.

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:11.720
Or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game,

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.720
anyway.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:19.080
And of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.080
this theme.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:23.120
Like, I think I put one in as well.

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:26.320
But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.940
Like I said, it's a side-scroller, you've got different levels, you have rocks and destructible

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:35.720
objects, you can blow them up, and you've got different enemies, and you basically go

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:39.840
horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects, and you can use your

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.920
psycho energy to get different attacks, either by using a shield of rotating spears, which

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:47.520
was one of her moves in King of Fighters.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:54.360
And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:32:00.400
And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.720
special items happen to be different.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:09.880
Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:15.280
But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them,

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.000
or rams them into an enemy.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:26.480
The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu, and I don't

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:30.400
know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:38.480
And the song came out on a cassette that was only available for people who purchased the

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.320
Famicom version of Athena.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:46.400
So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.200
theme.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.360
And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:58.440
It was the Psycho Soldier team in 94, and King of Fighters 96, and it was Athena's theme

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:04.560
in King of Fighters 97, and King of Fighters 2002.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:10.920
As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was in 87 by Imagine Software.

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:16.600
And it kind of got some decent success, it got an 8 out of 10 for one rating, and a 6

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:23.360
out of 10 for 77, and 75% for other places, but said it was really slow.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.400
Well Athena and Kenso have both been in the King of Fighters series, they've also of course

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.280
been in SNK vs. Capcom.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:40.440
They were, in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit, and Kenso was in

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:47.400
his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000, as Psycho Soldier Kenso.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:54.680
Also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystalis on the NES.

01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:03.680
And that's pretty much it, it's a fun little waste of time, I've got a main ROM of it.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:08.440
There it is, your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.440
You see why it's notable.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440
I do.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.920
First in-game vocal soundtrack.

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.920
I do.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.920
Very cool.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.520
Alright well we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.980
we're going to be back with part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics,

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:24.840
be sure to get those in if you haven't already at twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're going

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:29.880
to get into some rapid news, including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:34.400
download content that showed up among some other things, and of course we have some more

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.000
news development in a lawsuit against Activision, and we'll talk about that.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.160
It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.040
Of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week, it is all coming up when we come back with

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:55.480
more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.960
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics,

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.320
but first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling playing

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.240
this game, Bulletstorm.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.240
What's so funny about it?

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.240
You like this?

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.760
Just a lot of like, I like the writing in it, I guess, in the very beginning of the

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:39.800
game, like the tutorial section of the game, they have you, you know, interrogating this

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:46.040
guy or like, you know, he's trying to collect a bounty on you guys and so they kick him

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:50.240
in the face and lock him into an airlock and then get him, see he gets sucked out and then

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.240
there's stuff going on.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.120
They're like, okay, let's raid the ship now and then they're trying to open this door

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.560
which pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny, and then they

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:08.400
turn around and then they see the corpse of the guy near the window with the sticky mine

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:14.440
on the window and he's all, it's all, god damn it, and then the thing just explodes.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.640
I don't know, it's pretty funny.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.520
All right, well, let's get into some plugs for the side shows that we do.

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.440
Dark Soccer, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.000
Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.640
We actually, we publish on Tuesdays.

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.160
We are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:40.960
You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.500
We are awesome.

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:43.500
Listen to us.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.440
It's me, Maren, Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.320
And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Hoard House

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.320
in Azeroth.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.280
It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.760
talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.360
And it's available on iTunes, and there will be a real website coming soon.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:10.260
Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:13.160
And then your Twitter topics will be coming up, so this is your very last chance to get

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.760
those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.640
Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.360
EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.360
That's sad.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:29.240
So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure, it's just a matter of when that time is and

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.240
what we do with it.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.020
We have a small team on it, and I'm excited about what we'll do.

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:37.200
I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:43.840
Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3, so I'm sure that's got a lot of time being

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.600
utilized on that and resources.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:53.760
I'm sure there'll be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.560
And of course EA responded a little bit about it as well.

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:03.640
They're saying that Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:12.800
Of course, DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3, nothing further to announce.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.360
Maybe down the line.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.920
It was a pretty fun game though, so hopefully there'll be a sequel.

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.840
One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out in the PlayStation 1 classics.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.600
My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.600
Finally making its way out.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:33.640
Of course, no JOGCON support, that's kind of sad.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.840
You will be able to play the game though, very soon though, on the PSP and the PlayStation

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.080
3.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:46.020
And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.880
Racer Unbounds is coming out, so that's kind of neat.

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:55.760
No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:05.180
March, so probably around the time that the 3D versions come out, neat.

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.240
And then last but not least, Activision kind of lied a little bit saying that there wasn't

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.720
going to be any more download content for DJ Hero, however, DJ Hero 2 did get one last

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:20.920
little bit of DLC, and it's Pendulum, and it's awesome.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:26.120
So the Pendulum Mix Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me on Fire, and Salt in the Wounds, that

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.560
is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:37.240
And of course the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.240
points each.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.400
I am a little disappointed that they didn't have a whole color or self versus self, my

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.680
two favorite songs on there.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.280
But hey, whatever, it's pretty cool.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:51.360
So definitely check that out, since that's the last content you're getting.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:57.480
So since last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed, is it safe to

01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.000
say that DJ Hero is being...

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yes.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Okay.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.720
Because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release,

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.720
I just sort of...

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:06.720
Okay, so...

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.640
Yeah, as of right now it is.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.500
I mean, who knows, they could always change their mind.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:16.240
Just because they say, oh, we're never going to do it again, doesn't mean anything.

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:19.920
All right, let's do a couple of other stories here.

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.460
One of these is very interesting, speaking of the whole Guitar Hero thing.

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:27.280
The former CEO of Red Octane, who you might remember kind of started the whole Guitar

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.320
Hero thing in the first place before they got bought by Activision.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.080
Kelly Summer is his name, he was the CEO at one time of Red Octane, basically says that

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.160
Activision abused the property.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:41.620
Quote, Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly.

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:42.880
They abused it.

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.240
There's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.460
It's a great product.

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:50.320
My gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:54.840
Not every game can be a billion dollar franchise, but maybe that's what Activision wants.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:59.280
I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.060
a market for this product, and then show them up.

01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:04.600
Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:08.680
They haven't thrown products out there, they've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.080
a strong franchise.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.240
Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:17.760
I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.880
with just putting out one game every couple, or even three or four years.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.560
If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:30.280
SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around I think.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.480
I think so too.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:37.160
I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining,

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.280
it is now out.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:43.460
It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate, and that is available for you to download

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:48.040
on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.360
The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what, it's free, and so if they

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.220
need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.

01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:01.000
You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.360
but if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.320
You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.640
I guess nothing is really for free, but hey, you know, I don't know about you guys, but

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.200
I have an email address that I sign up for everything with that's not my regular email.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.600
We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretelbot pack is now out for Little

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.160
Big Planet 2, so that is out there.

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:34.700
I guess there's this whole full story, cut scenes, voice acting, original score, prizes

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.220
to get, it's all available out there.

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:44.720
There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way, oh I'm sorry, it actually came out last

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:50.080
Monday, oops, but they do have a variety of fixes, it sounds like mostly bug fixes, no

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:58.320
like huge changes, but there is a more, they say a more accessible reset pod option.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.360
If your pod gets broken for whatever reason, you can pause the game, go to the settings

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:09.200
menu and select reset pod decoration, so that's kind of a new feature that is available.

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.760
DarkSakura.

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:19.320
Well, and this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:30.960
Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch, ooh, it is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes, it will

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:38.240
have, you can start to monitor your B-Spec races from a browser, even if you're not home

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:42.840
and use your AI tweaks and do different stuff, because Dan was really getting pissed off

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:50.240
at B-Spec, and there's multi-monitor set up now, you can actually go up to 5 monitors.

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:56.380
So Dan the other day was talking about needing 4 more PS3's and monitors and I said, no,

01:43:56.380 --> 01:44:01.320
you spent $150 on your driving rig plus a little bit extra getting those seats from

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.760
the pick and pull, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.600
That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the 5 monitors.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.800
It already had 3 monitors, well there's actually a YouTube app of someone playing 5 monitor,

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:24.440
5 monitor, duh duh duh duh duh, it was pretty hot actually, but I'm like, no, don't need

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440
it.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:32.960
So, Billy Mitchell, he's such a jerk, he just needs to go back to selling his damn BBQ sauce.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.400
But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade, and it's at the Orlando International

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:48.120
Airport, and it looks very Donkey Kong-ish, but there's no Donkey Kong machine in there.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.560
Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score, because Steve Weeby was still

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:52.560
better.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:57.160
And don't forget there's a third guy now, there's the dentist Hank Shen.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.440
And you know what else is funny too, apparently that arcade's been there for a while, they

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.360
just keep rebranding it as something else.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:04.360
Yeah.

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:09.040
Well, now we have Step Mania without a pad.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.680
It's a Kinect hack, yay.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:19.520
So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.520
pad.

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.520
So you can play where you are, I guess.

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:27.640
I'd have to see this in motion, there's a video of it.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.480
You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:32.480
I guess.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:36.120
Good times.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.120
So yeah, that's it.

01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:43.480
Is, I don't know, is this what people find fun on Kinect hacking, Step Mania?

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:49.520
Step Mania thing though, they really only had it working on like the easy beginner mode

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.080
or whatever, I don't know if it would work for like some more difficult modes where you're

01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:00.440
not just put my, you know, put my leg out this way, put my leg out that way.

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:05.280
It's an interesting concept, they'd really have to do a lot more to make it work in practical

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:07.280
use, right?

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280
Yeah.

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.360
Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.760
Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we read your tweets here

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.600
on the show, and respond to them as appropriate.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:24.600
Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight, we're going to start off with Blue

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.960
Swim tonight tweets us, did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.160
Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:34.080
I think you know where this is going.

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.440
Uh, no.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:39.840
We actually did watch it today and I have a word for the race, Rob.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.840
Lester Fogg.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:43.840
It's just crash after crash.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.200
Seriously, that's what it was, because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.320
the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:55.320
Yeah, but it was great though because they literally, it was like one of those things

01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.040
you totally jinxed the race, you know, they're all, now we've seen some pretty good driving

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.680
today, all of a sudden, crash.

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:07.360
Like right, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.240
And then it was won by the 20 year old guy.

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:17.520
It was like, well with 50 laps down, there were like six cautions already.

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.560
I didn't even know it was on today.

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.640
Dan was watching it because it was the Daytona 500.

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.760
It was on TV when I was visiting my mom's house.

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:26.640
He likes that car stuff anyway, obviously he has a whole set up.

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:33.040
But the thing that got me was that it was won by a guy who turned 25 days ago.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.240
And he must be a very driven young man.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.720
Now, is the Daytona 500, is that Formula One?

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720
That's the stock car.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.720
Stock, okay.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:43.720
It's NASCAR.

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:44.720
NASCAR, okay.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.280
But I still think that's pretty impressive, but it's just because he was being smart and

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.560
everybody else is like, oh, follow this guy, huh?

01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:54.560
So.

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.000
All right, moving on to some other tweets.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
This is Chio 100.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Matt says there's a couple stories.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.480
I guess this is some big news out of New York City.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.760
The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:10.080
And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.920
Let's see.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.120
Several places are reporting, this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.520
Several places are reporting the Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.120
of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:30.200
Let's see, according to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:33.200
in business and will be closing on the 23rd.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.720
Not sure if that's this month or next month.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:40.640
So wow, that's crazy though, because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.640
down over here.

01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.320
So that's really sad that, you know, you have the west coast and the east coast, big arcades,

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.640
just bam, bam, shutting down.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:49.040
I'd heard about that arcade before.

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:53.320
I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:54.320
of the games.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320
So, sad to hear it.

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.600
That's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:01.780
Weird.

01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.960
Just sad for arcades in general.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.360
This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.880
I guess they didn't have enough ticket spinning machines.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:16.120
Well, it's just they, you know, they're not a draw for that, you know, shopping center

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:17.120
or whatever.

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.720
So they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:26.240
so they go spend money at those stores or so people want to put stores in those shopping

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.240
centers.

01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.240
All right.

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.240
Tiger Claw says this is a tweet.

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.080
Can a controller be programmed to speed run Super Mario Brothers?

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:34.080
Interesting.

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.200
Um, it is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:40.200
website thingy.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.200
They gotta know.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.200
CA.Kotaku.com.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.120
Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:48.440
No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:49.440
So it's the old format.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.440
All right.

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.440
Well, apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.560
auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five

01:49:58.560 --> 01:49:59.560
minutes.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.720
Uh, they are saying that the mod is real, even though some people were calling it a

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:04.720
fake.

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.000
I mean, I get, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.920
plug this in and say, Hey guys, look what I can do.

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.760
And then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically and it's actually doing the

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:16.840
speed run for you.

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:19.200
Like is, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:23.600
I think that it's just because, Hey, let's see if we can do this as basically.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600
Or that.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.600
Or that.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.720
Uh, Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say, I've been a member of OLR since

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:30.720
2002.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.720
Thanks for the awesome show guys.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.720
Wow.

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.720
That's a very long time.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.200
Thank you for listening that long.

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:40.120
Uh, we have a couple people tweeting us about this, so, uh, I should read this.

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:44.880
Both Defective Candy and Tiger Claw tweeted us this story and it's about Mexico State

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.340
Congress asks for a ban of a video game.

01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.840
It's Call of Juarez, the cartel.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:54.680
And uh, this is because, you know, there's a lot of violence unfortunately going on in

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:55.720
Mexico right now.

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.680
You've probably heard the stories in the news and so forth.

01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.640
It's especially bad like right around the border.

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:03.360
Well, apparently, uh, federal authorities, uh, in Mexico want to ban the game Call of

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:08.560
Juarez, the cartel, because it is based on drug cartel shootouts in, uh, Ciudad Juarez.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.360
Um, what do you guys think?

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.920
It's just a video game, wham, or yeah, this maybe hits a little too close to home.

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:22.360
I wouldn't even bother with it because Call of Juarez doesn't sell that well, so yeah,

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:28.560
it sucks it's coming out, but not a lot of people are going to take notice.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:33.160
Yeah, I, uh, I kind of agree it's not that big of a game.

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:34.160
Yeah.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:39.360
I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.880
You know, and also, and we hear from some, we have some listeners that live in Mexico

01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:48.360
and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:54.320
anyway because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:58.640
kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.920
that does hit a little close to home.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:04.420
One more tweet here from Dark Tetsuya, who tweets us saying, so it's a couple months

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:09.080
till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:13.560
I forgot WonderCon is coming up, that's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.840
April 1st through the 3rd?

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:16.280
Yes, sorry, I was yawning.

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:19.000
Oh, that's alright, it's second only to Comic-Con, right?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Yeah.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.120
So there might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:26.760
after Game Developers Conference before E3, you never know, sometimes we see some game

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:27.760
announcements.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.140
It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:34.200
I'm used to it being like usually, you said it was in April?

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.560
April 1st through 3rd.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:39.880
Because usually it's like, usually it's around this time, to be honest, February, Moscone

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:44.520
Center are nearby, so they must have bumped it out a little.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.040
That's going to do it for Twitter this week.

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.720
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:53.520
Let's move on with some more news.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:53:02.080
Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:03.520
the PlayStation 3.

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.840
Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak, of course,

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.440
multiple jailbreaks at this point.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:17.280
Of course, the PlayStation blog post warns users, notice unauthorized circumvention devices

01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:21.240
for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.

01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:25.600
These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:31.400
Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system software license

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:39.480
agreement for the PlayStation 3 system and code of conduct provisions.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.120
Contribution of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:46.780
the consumer's guarantee for that system.

01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:51.480
In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.920
laws.

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.640
Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access

01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:06.320
to the PlayStation Network and access to curiosity through services through PlayStation 3 or

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.600
system terminated permanently.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:14.760
To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.760
and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:27.020
Now on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:34.480
emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop, you know, stop using this modified

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:42.240
software, change your ways or else you can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:47.200
You know, that's basically just saying obviously that they don't want people doing that.

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.480
Or they'll ban you.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:57.080
Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there, a new hack

01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:01.820
that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.

01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.600
The hack can also be used to ban another console.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:09.360
All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:19.540
refurb warehouse or secondhand seller or some idiot that is willing to give up that information.

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.540
And it's kind of funny.

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:27.000
And then finally, Geo Hot or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.320
And that what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:37.480
Yeah, but this is not for him.

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.360
It's going strictly to his, he got his lawyers okay for it.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.280
So it must be all right.

01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:46.080
It says donations here are for legal defense only.

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.320
I've checked my lawyers before setting this up.

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.840
If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:01.320
And basically he says Sony is, they're bullies, they don't care what you did was legal, they

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.840
don't like it, so they sue.

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:12.400
And I guess they try to sue a guy for getting his Ivo to run non-Sony approved tricks, making

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.760
it apparent that they don't really care about privacy if they care about control.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:24.160
And they also says Sony versus Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.160
that.

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.400
And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's a navigate against mass piracy, he does

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.880
not distribute any copyrighted work by his own, and he says he's not gonna take this

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:39.520
crap laying down, and he's even pro DRM in a sense.

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:44.960
Then he says, why should I care about personal, or your personal legal troubles?

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:45.960
You shouldn't.

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:51.480
And, you know, he says if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:54.000
ask for donations.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.840
I see what that's a dig at, yeah.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.960
Let's see here.

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:04.920
Well let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there, you

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.680
know, I don't want to beat this issue to death, it's come up on almost every episode for the

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:14.800
past few weeks about this whole issue, but it does seem that this is moving faster in

01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.580
a legal sense than these types of stories usually do, because I'm about to get into

01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:23.160
another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.160
now.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.200
Well you've got enough money, you can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200
You know, that's kind of the worry.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:32.640
And he says, his thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:37.880
It says let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.320
on the Playstation blog for forever removing it.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:44.120
It'd be good PR for Sony and lord knows they could use it.

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:47.000
And I want an eyebo.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.120
Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:56.200
Those batteries are fickle as shit.

01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:57.200
See here.

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.080
It says don't need to help you, you're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080
No I'm not.

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:10.240
Kakaroto explains this really well, it says I have never played the PS3 online ever and

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.920
frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:19.520
Security 101 is why, why is the security in the client anyways?

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.560
I had no idea this would happen, I am in full support of the cheaters being perm-banned

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.600
from the Playstation network.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:32.320
So long story short, basically he needs money and obviously he feels that he did nothing

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:39.540
wrong and he very well may have done nothing wrong, it's just Sony owns your system according

01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:45.360
to them and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that

01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.880
you purchased.

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:52.760
And really the stuff that he did, he didn't enable piracy, he just enabled to run homebrew

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:53.760
code on there.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.600
Other people created apps to create piracy.

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.600
It's nothing he did.

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:03.400
Granted, that's just like saying oh well, if he invented the gun, well he created murder.

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.720
I mean that doesn't really work that way.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:09.480
Yeah he may have created something that could have led to something else but he wasn't that

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:12.880
person that initiated that something else, I guess.

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:17.440
Let me get to this comment from chat, I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's

01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:21.920
get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week, however,

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.160
I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Muster in the chat room, whatever happened

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:29.400
when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:31.680
gen toons as their only signature?

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.360
Some of those toons were actually pretty good too.

01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:40.200
There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff, a lot of people want fame and

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:46.800
I think once he hacked the iPod and IOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff and that whole

01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:52.400
thing became kind of legal now, I think it's gone to his head a little bit.

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.680
Oh well, let's crack the uncrackable type of thing.

01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:59.080
But I don't know, I don't know.

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.560
Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:05.800
This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:07.460
in this case, I don't know.

02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:13.960
But this is about, remember this, No Doubt versus Guitar Hero, or should I say Band Hero

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.480
specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:19.240
No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.

02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:25.000
Well according to a recent report in the LA Times, a panel of judges has agreed with a

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.460
lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:37.160
by No Doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember

02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:42.160
they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because

02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:46.120
Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from Taylor Swift and stuff.

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:50.920
It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do flava

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.300
flave or whatever.

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:58.240
Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain

02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.280
why Guitar Hero went really wrong and it's not the lawsuits.

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.600
I'm not saying that.

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:12.760
I'm saying that this whole lack of care for the material.

02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:17.760
I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they

02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:23.200
created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.600
fine print or whatever.

02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.360
They thought, they assumed that something was going to happen with their characters

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.400
only singing their own songs and stuff like that.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:37.240
But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists

02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:38.240
in their games.

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:43.100
I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.

02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:45.120
It's your own created characters.

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.400
Why do you even need these in there?

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.760
That's more my point actually was kind of what I was getting at.

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:53.960
And it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time.

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.520
I think the first time we went over the story, I probably had said something like, you know,

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.080
well, they should have probably read the fine print, but now looking back on how Guitar

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:06.320
Hero has essentially failed at this point, you kind of go, well, maybe this really isn't

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.040
what the game should have been doing in the first place.

02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.280
No Doubt and Courtney Love, I'm sure, are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.220
their image and their license is involved.

02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:22.120
So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:27.360
same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:31.460
they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists?

02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.520
Like I don't know.

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.840
Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840
Perhaps, perhaps.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.840
Yeah.

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.680
Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:43.280
I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.200
She's got paternity ones.

02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.520
She fights with her kid all the time.

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:51.500
She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems, you know, gosh.

02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:55.320
Even she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.720
The lawyer for her Twitter feed.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:01.160
They should make a Pokemon style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:03.360
Gotta catch them all.

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:06.520
Real estate attorney, I choose you.

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.240
Protect my house.

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.160
Contracting lawyer, I choose you.

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:14.680
Fix my air conditioning.

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:16.880
I love it.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:18.680
A Pokemon game based around lawyers.

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.320
I think we're onto something.

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:21.760
For now though, how about another news story?

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:24.240
Gotta sue them all.

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:26.800
Well, I like Sega.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.880
I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega or at least something Sega's done.

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:30.880
Me.

02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:31.880
I hate them.

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:33.700
Bite my butt.

02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:39.440
So there is going to be for the PCs Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:47.360
That's 46 of the Sega Genesis' games and it will be out on March 15th.

02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:53.680
Sorry, for the list, we have volume one which has a bunch of stuff and two and three and

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.680
four.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.520
No, seriously, I'll run through the list.

02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.160
There's Golden Axe, Ultra Beast, Comic Zone, Echo the Dolphin, Gang Ground, Shinobi 3,

02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:03.880
Return of the Ninja Master, Vector Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crackdown, and Space Harrier

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.880
2.

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:07.880
Volume two, Echo Junior, Fatal Labyrinth, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Bonanza

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.880
Brothers, Super Thunder Blade, Eastwet City Under Siege, Kid Chameleon, Rice Star, Golden

02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:15.640
Axe 2, Galaxy Force 2 columns, Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.080
Volume three, Biohazard Battle Columns 3, Revenge of Columns, Sword of Vermillion, Virtua

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.600
Fighter 2, Echo the Tides of Time, Alien Storm, Decap Attack, Flicky, Sonic 3, and Knuckles,

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:24.600
Sonic Spinball.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.240
And volume four, Landstalker, Shining Force, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair, Dr. Robotnik's

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:32.440
Mean Bean Machine, AKA Puyo Puyo, Streets of Rage, Church of Rage 2, Alien Soldier,

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.920
Light Crusader, Sonic 3D, Blast Gunstar Heroes, whoo hoo, Shining Force 2, Shining in the

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:41.880
Darkness, Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl, and Panic on Funkatron.

02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.880
Micro Machines.

02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:43.880
Seriously.

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:44.880
Dang.

02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880
All right.

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:51.120
I like Micro Machines, they don't make enough games based on them.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:52.520
John Machine is dead.

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.520
Here's the thing though.

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.480
That's because he talked too fast, he got all the words out that you could possibly

02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:58.360
say in his lifetime.

02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:02.040
As nice as that collection sounds, I don't know.

02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:06.000
This Genesis nostalgia, I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.680
Aren't you starting to get to that point?

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:12.480
Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever, I don't think, you really don't

02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.520
need much more than that.

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.520
As far as Genesis nostalgia goes.

02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:22.240
It's not one of our stories that was for tonight, but the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus,

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:27.620
wherever, they were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March.

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:33.280
They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs

02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:37.240
for one to three bucks a piece, and there's a lot of them up there now, and it's like,

02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:41.760
this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks, sure, you got some money to burn, pick up

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.880
a few, you know, Phantasy Star 2, but it's like, alright, how many of these are they

02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:45.880
gonna put out?

02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:49.960
This is gonna run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:54.680
Well they've got full packs out, you can download different packs of the games, but it's like,

02:05:54.680 --> 02:06:01.240
in my case it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis, so if I really wanna play it,

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:06.800
I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:10.840
Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:16.680
And honestly, I mean, technically it's piracy, but I mean, seriously, there's tons of free

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:23.960
ROMs out there, I mean, you can download an emulator and a bunch of ROMs in minutes, and

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:29.520
I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.

02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:35.360
I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things, I mean, dozens and dozens

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:41.920
and dozens of times, and I just, I don't feel any remorse for, you know, downloading a ROM

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:46.120
that's, you know, twenty years old.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:52.040
Alright, well, let's move on with another story, and we'll get to the mailbag pretty

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:53.040
soon here.

02:06:53.040 --> 02:07:00.520
Well, you know, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but

02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:02.840
that does not mean that the music genre is dead.

02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:08.920
Oh no, Dance Games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:16.460
They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in, I guess, 809 million dollars

02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:27.040
in total software sales, up 21% from 2009, and 60% of that, of course, was in North America.

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:34.720
Of course, during the three month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:40.120
dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience,

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:47.280
or Just Dance, Michael Jackson, and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway, all pretty

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:49.440
similar titles.

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:53.320
That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that, and I can't believe

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:59.280
how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii, it's just kind of crazy.

02:07:59.280 --> 02:08:04.880
Of course, next month, Just Dance on, or, let's see, I caught myself saying that, Dance

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:11.400
on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with move support, or actually, move required

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.160
I guess, so, be interesting.

02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:16.280
I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:19.040
No, no I do not.

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:23.320
There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii, and this

02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:33.680
is gonna add, I guess, some new duet choreography, and for 300 Wii points, you can download Y.O.Y.

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:42.000
by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.160
So that's neat.

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:48.200
Didn't realize that the game actually had DLC.

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:52.640
Another game, not necessarily an Ubisoft Dance title, but Dance Central is getting some more

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:59.080
download content, not quite as frequent as Rock Band, but at least they're getting some.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:06.640
The Double Freak DLC came out this week, and with that, of course, Super Freak by Rick

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.160
James, and Sheik's Le Freak, both out this week.

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:22.240
Also of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amaury, Heardemall.

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.240
Those are each $3.

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:26.240
Alright.

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.240
Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.

02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:33.800
People like to shake their butts.

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:36.920
Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.200
are dead, and it's like, oh wait, another dance game.

02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:44.200
I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision,

02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:51.200
because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.320
on that bandwagon.

02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.880
Alright.

02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:58.960
There's some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:03.400
There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move,

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.120
but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.880
2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.

02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:15.880
It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:18.200
blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:21.320
But it should be noted that there was this cute little Valentine's video that came out

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.920
for Portal 2.

02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.920
It's kind of funny, it's out there on YouTube if you check it out, Portal 2, Valentine's,

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:26.920
or something like that.

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.520
It's something as salacious as pop.

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:32.600
It's the Aperture Science Employee Guide on romantic relationships at the workplace.

02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.880
That sounds like, it's fantastic, I have to see that.

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:36.720
It's really funny and it's worth a look.

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:41.120
And basically at the end of the day, they announced, Portal 2 is available for pre-order

02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.120
now.

02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:43.680
And I was kind of like, well duh.

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:47.160
I mean, like if you want to go into GameStop, they'll take your five bucks to pre-order

02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:48.160
Portal 5.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:52.280
I mean, you know, it seems a little weird that they'd announce that, but maybe through

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.160
the official Valve channels or what have you, it's available now.

02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:59.480
I don't really know, so.

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:00.480
There you go.

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:06.400
Portal 2 coming out soon, and I know I'm excited about it, I can't wait for that to come out.

02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:08.680
Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag.

02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:12.920
Alright, we're going to go to the mailbag, you guys send us emails, we answer them here

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.360
on the show.

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:18.360
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emailbag and find some of her favorite emails to respond

02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:21.760
to right now.

02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:24.320
I was just taking care of some business.

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.560
No problem.

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.160
So first email, we actually got three.

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:36.080
We have one, it says, Greetings, OLR, this is my second email of the week.

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:37.080
Quick question.

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:40.800
I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:42.000
What is going on here?

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.080
Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:46.080
games?

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:50.800
I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing

02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:53.080
to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:58.000
Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.620
I'm sorry, I missed something about the...

02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:04.320
With Crysis 2 and Black Ops and those games being $60, why are they raising their prices,

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:07.360
you know, when more people are going to hold out for sales?

02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:12.880
Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about

02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:16.480
a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.080
Huge sale on Steam this weekend.

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:25.240
I was going to say, how long have those games been out, because Bulletstorm is new, right?

02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.160
Yeah, Bulletstorm's brand new, but I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.040
crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:39.840
Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA,

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:46.120
Activision, have decided, hey, you know what, Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.600
warrants a $60 price point.

02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.200
Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on

02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:55.200
the Wii.

02:12:55.200 --> 02:13:00.500
They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics

02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:05.200
and support on the download side, so, eh.

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.480
Yeah, I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers, are just going to have

02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:16.320
their MSRP, $59.99, they don't care what platform, even on a digital service like Steam, where

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:20.080
it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved, they'll just set their

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:24.120
price to whatever they want, keep it uniform.

02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:28.800
Yeah, I can see where the emailer's probably getting a little bit frustrated, though, that

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:32.720
you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later, but, eh, what can you

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:33.720
do?

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:34.720
Alright.

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:37.680
Let's, let's go on to the next email.

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:43.760
Okay, the next email up is this one, hi, LLR, I don't have much to say this week, I'm moving

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:47.920
to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic, but I suppose I should make this at least a bit

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:51.160
game related, so what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?

02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.840
Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.

02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.040
On a side note, can I plug my new blog?

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:05.560
It's Moggy's Musings, M-O-G-G-Y-S-M-U-S-I-N-G-S dot blogspot dot com.

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:06.880
So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:11.720
I think there was a really good tweet from that, or it's a really similar name that I

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:15.200
liked, I had retweeted it on LLR.

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.560
Since I kinda already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add,

02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:25.120
I think it's gonna be a nice pairing, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.

02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.080
Yeah, I wanna see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having a license.

02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:35.160
I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel shaded, but other than that,

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.160
thumbs up.

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.400
You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the

02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:48.640
original, but you kinda go, if anything's gonna be good, it'll be this, from the professional

02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:49.640
angle.

02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:52.840
I understand there's still the fan game, and of course the game is gonna be in good hands

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:55.900
with fans, but, you know.

02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:56.900
That's different.

02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:57.900
So.

02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.000
How about the next email?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.680
Yes, this is our last email of the night.

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:03.680
Alrighty.

02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.560
I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.980
It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.

02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:12.840
One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7, where the author

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:16.840
goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.

02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:20.200
Listen on the podcast every week, congrats on 400 eps, take care, Wendy.

02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.200
Thank you, Wendy.

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.960
Hmm, are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?

02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:24.960
Maybe a cheap plug?

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:25.960
I don't know.

02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:26.960
I'm just kidding.

02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:27.960
I'm kidding.

02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:28.960
Yeah.

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:30.400
Well, I would definitely check out the book.

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.520
I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse, so.

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:40.420
As long as they're not mindlessly bashing on it, I'm curious, sure.

02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:44.080
I think there's definitely a whole little psychological angle to what goes on in World

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:47.480
of Warcraft, so I'd be curious to check it out.

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:51.520
All right, that's it for the mailbag, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send

02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:52.840
in your questions.

02:15:52.840 --> 02:16:13.520
Meantime, we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:22.000
My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:28.720
So fuck you to my headache, that's really it.

02:16:28.720 --> 02:16:29.720
Loki?

02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:38.600
FU to McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.

02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.620
My FU of the week goes to being so sore, pain, hurts, ow.

02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:47.880
My legs just, it hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday.

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:51.320
Just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting

02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:52.320
or whatever.

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:53.320
Careful.

02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.320
Slice just popped.

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.320
Do you have any FUs?

02:16:55.320 --> 02:16:56.320
Any Yanks?

02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:03.080
Uh, FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department.

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.240
All right.

02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:09.200
That does it for the FUs of the week.

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:11.680
Let's move on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to

02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.080
the phone lines and I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:16.080
Loki?

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:17.440
Uh, yes.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.540
This is kind of interesting, I guess.

02:17:19.540 --> 02:17:25.960
They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.900
It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote, they were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:41.320
and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360 type control and stuff.

02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.080
For example, they showed a Kinect demo where someone was playing the, I believe it was

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:52.400
called Rally Ball, that's one of the Kinect Sport or Kinect Adventure games where you're

02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:56.600
bouncing balls off of your body and stuff like that.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.200
Kind of like what they showed at E3 where you're just trying to hit targets.

02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:07.440
Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen

02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:11.920
that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.040
to aim at the player.

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.800
So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.680
and Xbox 360.

02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:22.840
It's an interesting idea.

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:27.000
I mean, if they can implement it, well.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Interesting.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:31.120
I guess that's all I can really say about that.

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.440
Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what

02:18:34.440 --> 02:18:35.440
have you.

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:41.120
It would be neat, like, you know, they could do something even simple, like, you know,

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.760
being able to level up your characters or something like that when you're not playing

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:45.760
the game.

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:51.160
You know, toss stuff back and forth data.

02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:54.240
It always kind of reminds me for some reason of the PocketStation days.

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:59.360
I don't know what it is, but kind of that whole, like, you have it on your TV and then

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:02.640
you have it in your pocket and whatever else.

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:04.640
I don't know.

02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:07.360
I wonder where my PocketStation went.

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:08.760
Did you actually own one of those?

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:09.760
Yeah, I had one.

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:14.520
Remember, I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop

02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:16.200
courses on the fly.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.200
I forgot the PocketStation.

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.640
Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because I got, like, four songs versus

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:28.440
three songs if I paid, you know, for the fourth mix stuff.

02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:33.320
So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:34.320
go.

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:35.320
And plus my edits were on there.

02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:36.320
So that's fun.

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:37.320
All right.

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:41.080
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line tonight.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:44.640
And that is about a new announcement for a new coin-op game.

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:45.640
This actually makes me very happy.

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:49.320
I probably won't play a lot of the game, but I know I'm going to get that soundtrack right

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:50.320
away.

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.920
This is NAMCO NAMGAN Midnight Maximum Tune 4.

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:56.360
NAMCO has unveiled a trailer and a website for this.

02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:00.160
And let's see if there's any cool little, like, techno-y music in the trailer.

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:04.200
Of course there is.

02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:09.640
It's going to be awesome.

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:14.640
I hope it's still used over the show and doing all the music.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:15.640
I'm sure it sounds like it.

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:20.160
Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:21.160
in 2011.

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:26.400
But Bandai Namco has unveiled a website for the game and it's coming out and they're saying

02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:31.480
it will be some time before you get to play it, but it will be the Wanggan Maxi of the

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:35.880
future and worth the wait.

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:36.880
Whatever that means.

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.840
I'm just excited for the soundtrack.

02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:40.760
It's been a while since they had a game, right?

02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:41.760
Yeah.

02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:43.760
It has been a while.

02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:44.760
So.

02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.880
All right.

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.440
Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.560
We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:56.040
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:20:56.040 --> 02:20:59.480
So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:02.880
So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last

02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:03.880
minute stories tonight?

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:04.880
Yeah, sure.

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.880
We can talk about Pixel 4's Head to Head.

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.840
It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, a guy that brought us all the 8-bit

02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:18.200
kind of, you know, Left 4 Deads, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.

02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:22.840
Well this one, they've got, you know, brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:29.480
game, including like, you know, I believe Ryu from, you know, Street Fighter's on there.

02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:36.880
They've got, you know, Wolverine from the Marvel games.

02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:42.680
They've also got Scorpion, I believe, is in there, and 30 different characters you can

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:43.680
play as.

02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.320
So that's kind of cool.

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:48.440
I want to see if there's someone from like, Castlevania in there as well.

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:50.520
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:52.560
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:55.160
Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Rama.

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:57.200
Hey Rama, what's on your mind?

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.960
Not too much, I just got back from Cats of Con, but I didn't call to get my con review,

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:04.480
but I have a question for all three of you.

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:05.480
Sure, what's up?

02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:06.480
Okay.

02:22:06.480 --> 02:22:12.560
Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:15.000
is the games for it, correct?

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Yes.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.720
Alright, now I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy, and he's like, you're

02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.080
incorrect.

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:22.880
It's the marketing behind it.

02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:27.000
Now, even I find it hard to believe, because I feel that there have been games that have

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.640
been marketed out like a cheap whore, and it still has failed to get the numbers.

02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:38.680
So, do you believe more of it's the games or the marketing, and if so, what games failed

02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:43.160
on the marketing aspect?

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:46.320
Where's that, what is that Namco game that came out just at the end of last year, that

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:49.800
you brought up on the show like last month, and I was like, where was this game?

02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:50.800
This game was-

02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:51.800
Modun and the Forsaken Kingdom.

02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:54.200
Yes, that would be a good one, because that game looked kind of cool.

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:58.760
I had no idea a game like that even existed.

02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:03.440
To some extent, maybe Rock Band 3, if you want me to go for a bigger title, because

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:05.680
I don't know, we just didn't see Rock Band.

02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:09.300
It wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles, and I don't know if that's just because

02:23:09.300 --> 02:23:15.200
people were over it, or what the deal is, but yeah, I'd have to say that.

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:20.680
Okay, I agree with that, because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as

02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:25.200
I was anticipating it, and I turned around and I'm like, it's out?

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.800
I really didn't see any advertising for it.

02:23:27.800 --> 02:23:29.840
Yeah, right?

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:33.380
And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was

02:23:33.380 --> 02:23:36.280
heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.

02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:40.760
Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch 2, I thought we had a story

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.000
last week, that game sold like a million copies or something.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.960
Might have been a second, because I thought the first one, there was a lot of advertising

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:50.440
behind it, but I don't think, I'm not sure if it really did good or not.

02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:51.440
Yeah.

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.040
It's kind of nice when game companies will take a second chance, though, on a game that,

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:59.120
you know, doesn't maybe do so hot, but it still kind of deserves a sequel, so it gets

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:00.120
one.

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:02.800
For some reason, I can't think of anything right away, but I know there's been some in

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:03.800
the past.

02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:08.280
It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge, you know, was kind of a popular game, at least

02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:14.440
I always thought, and it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would, so just kind of

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:15.440
surprising.

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:22.360
All right, but, so, I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good

02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:29.660
as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console?

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:32.040
I think marketing kind of goes a long way.

02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:39.600
I think that's probably why the Wii did so well, I think was kind of the way it was marketed,

02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:46.360
but I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either

02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:48.980
a good product or a bad product.

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:54.040
And what I mean by that is that, you know, you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:58.360
bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale, but at the end of the day, a turd is still

02:24:58.360 --> 02:24:59.360
a turd.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.760
I've heard that plenty of times.

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:07.960
I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business, and it

02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:15.200
just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say, it stinks, and could cause

02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:17.880
a possible chain reaction?

02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:21.600
Um, perhaps.

02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.640
Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.

02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:28.040
The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system is only as good as the games

02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:31.620
that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch

02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:32.620
titles.

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:33.620
Does this make me a giant hypocrite?

02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:35.620
No, not necessarily.

02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:38.120
I think you kind of fall in love with me.

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:45.280
You feel your inner child, because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?

02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:50.960
I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA, and I still haven't finished it yet.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:56.400
When I first got it, I knocked that game out in about five weeks.

02:25:56.400 --> 02:25:59.160
I gotta tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:03.800
I actually, actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and

02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:05.600
looking at the 3D pictures.

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:07.840
Like I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:09.520
I think that's going to be kind of awesome.

02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.040
Just to kind of show it off, too, you know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures, and I'm

02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:18.040
hoping Nintendo does the smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way

02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:19.440
we can do that.

02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:20.440
Perhaps.

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:21.440
Perhaps.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.880
Plus, also, I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.880
Yeah.

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880
So.

02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:29.880
All right.

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.880
Well, anything else on your mind, Rama?

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:31.880
No, that's it.

02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:32.880
All right.

02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:33.880
Well, take care, Rama.

02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:34.880
Have a good one.

02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:35.880
Thanks for the call.

02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:36.880
You, too.

02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:37.880
Enjoy.

02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:38.880
Later.

02:26:38.880 --> 02:26:39.880
Bye.

02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:40.880
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio, if you want to give us

02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:42.880
a call.

02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:46.880
Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:49.240
Yeah, I'll take it.

02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:52.240
It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:53.240
So.

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.240
All right.

02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:56.600
Any other last minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?

02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:58.680
Yeah, one last one here.

02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:04.320
There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.

02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:08.080
It is a game called PPPPPPPPPPP.

02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:11.920
Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.

02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:13.480
Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:15.080
I thought you were saying PPPPPP.

02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:16.080
No.

02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:17.080
I was like...

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:19.280
That's the full name of the game, yes.

02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:20.760
Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.080
But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Peace.

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:30.860
Anyways, so it is a game that's played with a vocal input and

02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:36.020
You can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:41.820
The title is co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises

02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:44.020
like pew pew pew pew pew pew

02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:53.560
And they have got to love the indie marketplace they have a trailer for it too, which people are playing it

02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:03.780
Is it is it is there video is that like real video yeah, it looks like

02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:10.780
It looks we can't hear any of that I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to the technokitten adventure

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:19.780
I mean basically there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks

02:28:19.780 --> 02:28:26.780
And then you scream into it to like cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:30.780
Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future

02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:33.780
Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future

02:28:33.780 --> 02:28:37.780
Let's go to another call higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:28:37.780 --> 02:28:40.780
Hi, this is gamer girl. Hi gamer girl. What's on your mind?

02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:44.780
Um nothing much. Have you guys um played the game?

02:28:48.780 --> 02:28:53.780
There's a game called Assassin's Creed like legacy on Facebook

02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:57.780
No, I have not played the Facebook game. I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games

02:28:57.780 --> 02:29:03.780
What's the what's what's the Facebook game all about? Um, it's kind of like Knights of the clicky. It's pretty cool

02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:10.780
Yeah, yeah. Um, I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the clicky. It's pretty fun

02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:16.780
Is it one of those games where it's really easy to spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff? Yeah, it's pretty cool

02:29:16.780 --> 02:29:22.780
Yeah, yeah. Do you what do you what do you think of Facebook games? Do you think it really is the wave of the future or?

02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:28.780
Um, it's kind of addicting actually. Yeah, if you if you're not careful

02:29:28.780 --> 02:29:32.780
You can kind of get like addicted to it. Mm-hmm

02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:38.780
Yeah, I I was playing that Knights of the clicky game, which is so ridiculous for a while

02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:43.780
And I don't know one day I just kind of stopped is now kind of ran out of steam with me to see with you

02:29:43.780 --> 02:29:48.780
I haven't touched it in ages. I haven't touched it in like two weeks. I just I just finally gave up

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:53.780
I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore. Do you find do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?

02:29:53.780 --> 02:30:00.780
Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy

02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:05.780
Um when I was moving around I looked in the case and it was actually cracked

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:11.780
So so so how did I have to rebuy the other one? How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?

02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:17.780
Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game or does it kind of tie into that story?

02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:22.780
Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed 2 graphics?

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:31.780
Um, it kind of makes you want to play the original game even though it's a it's not really tied into the game itself

02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.780
The original game it's more like a standalone

02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:37.780
Right

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:41.780
Okay, well I get I want to say somebody I knew is playing that on Facebook

02:30:41.780 --> 02:30:46.780
Is this been open a long time like about six months or so or did like just recently open?

02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:50.780
Probably I just found out about it yesterday so

02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.780
Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?

02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:58.780
Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook

02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:00.780
And it had a title I can't remember the full title

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:05.780
But I because it seems like it's gonna buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars

02:31:05.780 --> 02:31:07.780
That it might actually be the game of civilization

02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:10.780
It might be simplified a lot, but I think that might be a lot of fun

02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:18.780
Um, right now I like playing, you know, um, Knights of the Clicky, um, Chocobos Crystal Tower

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:19.780
Oh, yeah

02:31:19.780 --> 02:31:21.780
The game's kind of confusing, but it's pretty fun

02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:22.780
Yeah

02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:23.780
Yeah

02:31:23.780 --> 02:31:25.780
So, all right

02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:29.780
Well, gamer girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:31.780
Do those games make you less depressed?

02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:33.780
Keep up the good work guys

02:31:33.780 --> 02:31:37.780
Wait, gamer girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:46.780
Actually, um, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot em up games like, whatever

02:31:46.780 --> 02:31:52.780
Um, Call of Duty, um, or like something with zombies in it

02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:55.780
I made a game with zombies in it

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:58.780
I like watching their brains spew out

02:31:58.780 --> 02:32:06.780
Oh, and then, let's see, I had a game, but I forgot the name of it

02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:07.780
It's all good

02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:08.780
Oh, Resident Evil

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:09.780
Oh, Resident Evil, there you go

02:32:09.780 --> 02:32:10.780
Yeah

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:11.780
More zombie killing

02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:12.780
All right

02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:13.780
Yeah

02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:14.780
You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich

02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:15.780
All right

02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:19.780
Gamer girl, we're gonna let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call

02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:20.780
You're welcome

02:32:20.780 --> 02:32:21.780
Take care, have a wonderful night

02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:22.780
You too

02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:27.780
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to call us, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:29.780
Uh, any other last minute stories over there from Loki?

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:30.780
Nope

02:32:30.780 --> 02:32:32.780
Oh, how am I supposed to fill time till the next call?

02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:38.780
Uh, I don't know, we can make up news, let's see if there's any new stories, yay

02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:40.780
Anything that recently happened

02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:47.780
Uh, Nanostray, developer working on the title for the 3DS

02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:50.780
Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game, I guess that's neat

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:53.780
Uh, I don't know

02:32:53.780 --> 02:32:55.780
Maybe we can make some stories up?

02:32:55.780 --> 02:33:02.780
Well, how about, um, there was the little big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?

02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:06.780
Yeah, I was covered, I talked about the patch, it's a little bit earlier in the show

02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:07.780
Um, Black Ops Zombies

02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:09.780
Hold on, we're getting another call, woo, saved

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:11.780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:13.780
Hey, this is Amiga777

02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:16.780
Amiga777, what's on your mind buddy?

02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:23.780
Hey, um, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering if you guys heard about that latest

02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:30.780
Mario sports mix game that was supposed to be coming out, I don't know, like

02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:34.780
From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago

02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:39.780
I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game

02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:44.780
Okay, I don't know, like, um, what were your thoughts on it?

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:52.780
Um, to me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash in to the whole Wii Sports craze

02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:58.780
It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock offs games

02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:00.780
A la, I don't know, Deca Sports or whatever

02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.780
The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit

02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:09.780
Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:14.780
You know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, whatever the hell they were calling it

02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:16.780
Wasn't it a Squeenix game too?

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:19.780
Yeah, I was about to ask you that same question

02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:23.780
Yeah, you know Squeenix doesn't just do role playing games, once in a while they do have the other side

02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:27.780
Well, especially now that they have the Eidos arm, they definitely aren't just about role playing games

02:34:27.780 --> 02:34:30.780
But, you know, they always would do kind of these weird one off games

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:34.780
I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing

02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:38.780
Which was like a PS1 Mario Kart rip off with Final Fantasy characters

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:41.780
I really wish that would come out on the store

02:34:41.780 --> 02:34:45.780
Because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.780
So, yeah, that was awesome

02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:51.780
But anyway, kind of going back to your original question, you know, I think, yeah, I get what Loki's saying

02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:55.780
As far as the game itself, it's very Wii Sports-esque

02:34:55.780 --> 02:35:01.780
So if you like that fun, casual, and I emphasize casual sports game

02:35:01.780 --> 02:35:05.780
Then yeah, it's cool, especially if you have siblings that you play a lot of video games with

02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:07.780
Or you have parties where you have people over a lot

02:35:07.780 --> 02:35:10.780
You know, this would be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties

02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:13.780
Because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach

02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:17.780
But as far as like the hardcore game goes, like if you're just kind of a solo player

02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:20.780
I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you

02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.780
I think your money might be better spent somewhere else

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.780
Right

02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:29.780
Okay, I mean like, I looked at an article online about it

02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:31.780
I don't know, some time ago

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.780
And the critics were just ripping it to shreds

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:37.780
Yeah, not surprised

02:35:37.780 --> 02:35:42.780
And let me guess, they were probably just saying it's, you know, yet another sports game on the Wii

02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:44.780
You know, with a Mario knockoff title

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.780
It's just very insignificant

02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:49.780
Doesn't bring anything new to the table

02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:50.780
I bet all the, I haven't even played the game

02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:52.780
And I bet that those are what the reviews are saying basically

02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:53.780
So

02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:55.780
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room does tell us though

02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:57.780
It is Mario curling

02:35:57.780 --> 02:35:59.780
If you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:00.780
You can get that

02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:03.780
I thought Mario curling was not in that

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.780
But was in the stupid Sonic vs, Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing

02:36:08.780 --> 02:36:09.780
Oh, you might be right

02:36:09.780 --> 02:36:11.780
I don't think curling is in this new one

02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:14.780
I'm reading that from chat, so you could be right

02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:16.780
I mean, I could be wrong

02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:21.780
I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis

02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:26.780
Dodgeball, maybe paintball

02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:31.780
But, you know, it's, whatever

02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.780
I mean, we're not the target audience

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:38.780
So, I gotta ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up

02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:42.780
Or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too

02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.780
Because of everything you've read

02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:50.780
Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that

02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:53.780
As I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time

02:36:53.780 --> 02:36:55.780
Oh well, then it makes the decision pretty easy

02:36:55.780 --> 02:37:01.780
But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article

02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:09.780
That Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept

02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:12.780
To, I guess, Square Enix

02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:18.780
It was already in some hot water

02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:22.780
And a number of other things

02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:26.780
Like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV

02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:29.780
Which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet

02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:33.780
What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?

02:37:33.780 --> 02:37:37.780
Um, I don't know

02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.780
Price games?

02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:44.780
The games? Oh no, it's fine

02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:49.780
I just need to, you know, make some decent income in order to get one at this time

02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:53.780
I gotcha, yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy

02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:54.780
Alright

02:37:54.780 --> 02:37:55.780
It's a bummer

02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:59.780
Well buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for the call

02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:00.780
Bye bye

02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:03.780
Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there

02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:06.780
It's a whopping four

02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:10.780
Hockey, baseball, or I'm sorry, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball

02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:12.780
That's it

02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:18.780
Yeah, I remember, I didn't think it was a lot of games

02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:20.780
It wasn't like deca sports, so there was a whole ton of them

02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:22.780
It was just, you know, a few

02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:24.780
There you go

02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:26.780
Alright, well that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:28.780
So sorry to those folks that didn't get through

02:38:28.780 --> 02:38:33.780
But, you know, you can always send us an email or, you know, contact us in other ways

02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:37.780
Chat room, Twitter, etc, etc

02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:39.780
We'll be back to do it again next week

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:42.780
But since I believe we did all the final thoughts

02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:45.780
I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight

02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:48.780
It's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show

02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:51.780
So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight

02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:55.780
I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half

02:38:55.780 --> 02:38:57.780
As you always do, so thank you for being here

02:38:57.780 --> 02:38:58.780
Thank you

02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.780
And do you have a final thought for listeners tonight?

02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:02.780
We didn't nap today and I can feel it

02:39:02.780 --> 02:39:06.780
Wait a minute, no, I took like a, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show

02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:07.780
20 minutes is not a nap

02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:08.780
Ah, it is for me

02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:11.780
Alright, I'll go ahead and give my final thought

02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:16.780
My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:18.780
I mean, I love the live listeners and everything

02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:21.780
But if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close

02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:23.780
I'm just saying, just saying

02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:24.780
There's Pasco Robbins around the corner

02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:25.780
That's true

02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:27.780
Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?

02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:29.780
My head hurts so bad

02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:31.780
Aw, sorry to hear it

02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:33.780
And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:35.780
I hope this mod works

02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:37.780
Oh dear, I wonder what this is

02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:39.780
What is this mod gonna do, dare I ask?

02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:45.780
Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get like a process to it

02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:48.780
Because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online

02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:53.780
And have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto

02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:55.780
I'm talking about map mods right now

02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:57.780
Because I've done map mods before

02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.780
But I have a new method of doing them

02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:03.780
And the previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work

02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:05.780
And I've tried this before

02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:07.780
And I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work

02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:10.780
And who knows?

02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:13.780
Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn

02:40:13.780 --> 02:40:15.780
Alright

02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:17.780
Well, that's gonna do it tonight

02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:19.780
For another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:21.780

02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:35.780
By leaving us a 5 star review

02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:37.780
Or wherever you download podcasts

02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:39.780
I know there are many other places besides just iTunes

02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:41.780
Or of course, tell a friend about the show

02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:44.780
That is how we appreciate you spreading the word about Orange Lounge Radio

02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:46.780
We are not a giant magazine

02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:51.780
We are not some big corporation with millions of advertising dollars behind us

02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:54.780
We're just three friends who got together to do this show some time ago

02:40:54.780 --> 02:40:56.780
We kept it going all this time

02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:58.780
And thank you guys for showing up and supporting us

02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:00.780
And making it work every week

02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:01.780
Have a good night everybody

02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:03.780
