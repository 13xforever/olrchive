00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,160
Today, February 20th, 2011, could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,920
Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Is PC piracy really in decline?

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,040
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,400
It is episode number 402 for February 20th, 2011.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,840
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
co-hosts.

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
Say hello over there to Ms. Ms. Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
I love pitas.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
How are you?

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Full of pitas.

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Pita filled?

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,520
We are having the best pitas tonight.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,280
You know when you say that really fast, it sounds a little dirty.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Falafel.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,160
Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Falafels are delicious.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm going to go have another.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,280
One of the things, one of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
one of the races in it was like a lollafel or something they were called.

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
I just called them falafels cause they're adorable and cute like falafels.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,160
You know who really likes falafels?

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,040
Yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight who's speaking early.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Yes, Salacious Pop.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,720
Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,080
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Hi.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,440
How are you doing, Loki?

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm doing good.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,400
Alright, falafel filled in your world?

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I don't know.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I don't know what to ask.

34
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Sure.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Okay, there you go.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,640
What was the dinner of choice tonight?

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
I'll ask this.

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Ah, just crappy McDonald's.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,340
I wasn't really that hungry but I knew if I didn't eat anything I'd be hungry later

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,880
so I just, I had a quarter pounder and it wasn't very good and the fries aren't very

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,720
good but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,160
Any McDonald's you go to so it was just, I don't know.

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,440
Orange Lounge Foodio, you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,360
but a lot of the times we also talk about food.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
Also joining us tonight, as you already know, is the one and only Salacious Pop here in

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
studio.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I know.

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Please don't beat me.

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
You need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak.

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,960
Hello, what's up?

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
How's your week going?

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Good.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Yeah?

55
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Yeah.

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I have pita so it's a lot better now.

57
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,400
65 year old man.

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,960
I can't move today.

60
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,520
We ran around doing a local version of the Amazing Race scavenger hunt.

61
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,400
It was just between about 15 or 16 friends all within Sacramento downtown.

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
By the way, no charity, no organization.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Just because we can.

64
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
We're bored.

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Yeah.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,400
When people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams, you know.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Can't let them win over you.

69
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,840
So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,520
There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Lots of running back and forth.

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,360
And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
and can't sit up without help.

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
It's like I'm a gamer.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,760
I don't do physical activity, you know.

76
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
This is too much.

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,520
That's such a gift for not playing any more DDR.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,040
But I have half a Vicodin so I'm feeling a lot better after that.

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain, it just makes you not care.

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
Exactly.

81
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
That's exactly what it is.

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,600
I just don't care anymore.

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,160
But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.

84
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,440
We were on opposing teams.

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,340
I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was

86
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,840
on a few times in the past.

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
I think she filled in for you one time.

88
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,920
Her and Irene were on a show.

89
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,400
But Victoria and I were a team and we came in second.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Woo!

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
So it was fun.

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Yeah.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
And after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the winner and the runner up.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
We're not doing this shit anymore.

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
We're done.

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,940
The rest of you are too far behind.

98
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
The end.

99
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
Yeah.

100
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
I had a good time.

101
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,640
And I will say this, it was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,520
So doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.

103
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,960
But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.

104
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,640
I don't know how many y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or even old enough

105
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,800
to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now and they're kind of fun, actually.

106
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,600
I want Amazing Race slot cars.

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm surprised that's a hobby.

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Four of us aren't into a slot car because I always kind of walk by the stores and go,

109
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
ooh, that's cool.

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
I used to love those when I was a kid too.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,160
The hobby store that will dance into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.

112
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,320
And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.

113
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,560
Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can rent it on the slot

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
sets.

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Good tie.

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,040
Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?

117
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,320
I think I want to say there was at least like a Micro Machines game.

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,600
The typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's that has a pinball table in there.

119
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,080
They have a slot car thing in there.

120
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
Oh, fun.

121
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Nice.

122
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Going to our chat room.

123
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,200
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and AllGames.com

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,680
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

125
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,380
Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty

126
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,520
insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.

127
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,820
We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.

128
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
We love Brad.

129
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,360
Rob isn't out of shape.

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,960
Round is a shape.

131
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
You know what?

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment, actually.

133
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
That was rather rude.

134
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Don't you think?

135
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
No, I'm kidding.

136
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,720
And then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing.

137
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,720
SSJ100Matt says, OLR house MD, Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with, it's not

138
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Lupus.

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
It's a house joke, TV joke.

140
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Anyhow.

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,560
Also, you can join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

143
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,120
All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer

144
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
has a voice.

145
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,840
We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you

146
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
have been playing this week.

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,160
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
How was your gaming week?

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,680
I played well.

150
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,120
And then I played nobi nobi boy today because I have the nobi nobi app on my iPhone and

151
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,720
I every so often get randomly curious to see just how far he's stretched and he's finally

152
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,840
hit Jupiter or that girl has stretched.

153
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,200
So she's at Jupiter now because nobi nobi boy keeps feeding her his love.

154
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,440
And it's just really stupid crack that I use to fill time.

155
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
And I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3.

156
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
In fact, I'm just going to start it over.

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,280
Oh, you start over.

158
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, because I just want to sit and marathon it.

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,320
You know what, if I don't play an RPG for a long amount of time, I kind of find I have

160
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,760
to go back and start over as well.

161
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Like, because I feel like I'm so lost in the story.

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,480
Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since

163
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,140
with its freaky ass control style.

164
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:17,440
And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man

165
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,480
is totally janked in that game.

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
His moves are messed up.

167
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,960
You know, he's all messed up now.

168
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
It's all about Deadpool.

169
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,240
Movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
What?

171
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, they killed Johnny Storm.

172
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I know.

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Who was the most interesting of all of them?

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,040
Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.

175
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Not really.

176
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
All right.

177
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,280
Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?

178
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,440
Oh, I was going to say, it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy

179
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,320
3, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.

180
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,480
And what's particularly interesting about that is that, well, 1 and 2 on the iPhone

181
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
were based off the PSP versions.

182
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,360
There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,400
We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,500
But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone, so what is it going to be?

185
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We don't know.

186
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,080
Well, see, I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they

187
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,200
did 1, 2, and 4.

188
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,720
So I don't know, I think they're just going to go through and resprite them.

189
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,320
In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for Wonderswan Color

190
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,920
and might just pull whatever they were working on for that, because they had it in the works,

191
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,600
it just never came out.

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.

193
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,780
It would be interesting, though, if they do 1 for iPhone, why don't they just release

194
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,360
it for PSP as well?

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,080
I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.

196
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
I think they're great.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
It was actually, 2 is really simple to play on, because I have 2 on my iPhone.

198
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
I am so excited for 4.

199
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
There's a part of me, though, that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi,

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,600
but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.

201
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,880
I hope they bring 4 and the after years onto the iOS as well, because I don't really play

202
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
with PSP anymore.

203
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,840
I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.

204
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,760
Well, after years did start as a mobile game.

205
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Yeah.

206
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,240
Let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom, because this is a complaint

207
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,760
I hear a lot, so I'm kind of curious what Dark Soccer thinks about it.

208
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.

209
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm like, so not cool.

210
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, outside at E3, but that was how long ago, and it wasn't really built of the game.

211
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,880
But AkumaJP in our chat room says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.

212
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,160
Not really that fun.

213
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Agree?

214
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Disagree?

215
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,640
I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.

216
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,440
I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.

217
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
That's the thing.

218
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,960
It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter

219
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
4, same thing.

220
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,480
But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because

221
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,040
you can just throw off your super with the push of a button.

222
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,640
When you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it, then there's...

223
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
You can definitely...

224
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,880
I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because it's not like, you know, like in Tekken

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game.

226
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,000
If you've got skill with it, then you can beat a masher.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know if that makes sense.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,240
So it can be fun.

229
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,400
Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the...

230
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,560
I don't know.

231
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,820
For basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before

232
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,080
to get like a six or seven hit.

233
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,440
But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have

234
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,680
to practice and know how to do that stuff.

235
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,280
Like I remember in X-Men versus Street Fighter, you'd go jab, jab, medium, medium, fierce,

236
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,360
fierce, and you basically work through the buttons like a zigzag.

237
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
That style, that's still in there, and that's not really easy to do.

238
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,480
Wasn't that kind of...

239
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,120
To throw it back, wasn't that kind of killer instincts thing, is it was very easy to combo

240
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,320
if you just kind of knew the layout?

241
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Yeah, that's why...

242
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,160
That's why I always kind of liked killer instinct, to be honest, is that you don't really button

244
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,680
mash, but it's not that hard to figure out the...

245
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
There's a sequence.

246
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,920
If you learn the sequence, it just all comes naturally.

247
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,600
In Killer Instinct, the way it was is light punch was linked to a medium kick, which was

248
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,160
in turn linked to hard kick.

249
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,380
And then the other way, so it was sort of like a crisp, but you could also go from light

250
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,600
to hard, but you'd have to move them back in a certain order, and you could figure out

251
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
any combo that way, but the buttons were linked a certain way.

252
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
I used to...

253
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,840
Well, we had a killer instinct at my arcade when I went to the University of South Alabama,

254
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,240
and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off, because we could do all of those 44 hit

255
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,480
combos and everything, too, but the thing, though, is that with the early versus games

256
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,840
versus the late versus games, that's a lot of versus, the late versus games is that the

257
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,800
early ones still went on that Street Fighter, you know, the six button layout style, whereas...

258
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,360
Hi.

259
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:11,920
Because we have a four button with a special, so it's just kind of different.

260
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,880
Sorry, we're being interrupted with food requests, that's why we're distracted, so anyhow.

261
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,560
I wanted to throw this out real quick, though, speaking of Killer Instinct, I realize that

262
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,560
everything's up in the air with Rare, and they're not really with Nintendo anymore,

263
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,400
and things aren't like they used to be, but seriously, seriously, what's gotta happen

264
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,280
for there to be a Killer Instinct 3?

265
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I know.

266
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Like, how bad?

267
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,800
Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?

268
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Me, me, me, me, me.

269
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Okay, that's me and Jamie, that's it.

270
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
All right, still...

271
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,260
I still wanted the public flogging of the whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct

272
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,960
Complete 64, that piece of crap port, ugh, already upset thinking about it.

273
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,360
The SNES version was the best home port.

274
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
The end.

275
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Yes.

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Or MAME.

277
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Mhm.

278
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
And I love the mar-cats.

279
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Ah, I love the CD.

280
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
Good times.

281
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I listened to that so much.

282
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,880
Killer Instinct had awesome music, it really did.

283
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
All right, anyhow, let's move on.

284
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,400
Actually, Killer Instinct 2, though, did have one really good piece of music, and that was

285
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Orchid's theme.

286
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Mhm.

287
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,320
And I remember, this is when I lived in Alabama, and Dan and I were just friends online, is

288
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,040
that he actually waited until the, cause the game would start with a random stage, and

289
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,640
he waited until Orchid's stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV

290
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
file back in the day.

291
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Oh, that's nice.

292
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
That was so sweet.

293
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,080
And by the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her, like, unrealistic boobies.

294
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,760
She was the first one I beat the game with in KI 2.

295
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Nice.

296
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
All right.

297
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Let's move on.

298
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Loki!

299
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
How you doing?

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
How was your game of the week?

301
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Oh, it was all right.

302
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Didn't play a lot, though.

303
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Um.

304
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Just mainly, Sword and Poker 2, and um.

305
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I keep forgetting to get that game.

306
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
It's awesome.

307
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
You always tell me about it.

308
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I always forget to get it.

309
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
It's seriously awesome.

310
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I will.

311
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
And then, um, just Grand Theft Auto, mainly.

312
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
I don't know, that's about it.

313
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,480
Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.

314
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,480
It's only, like, 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.

315
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,880
But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.

316
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
What's that?

317
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Murder Boner.

318
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
So, uh.

319
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
That's pretty sweet.

320
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Um.

321
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,680
Gotta love that kind of stuff.

322
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,360
I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.

323
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
It's Bayonetta with a dick.

324
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,640
It's Murder Boner, is what it is.

325
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Okay.

326
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Bayonetta with a murder boner.

327
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
All right.

328
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Fair enough.

329
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
All right.

330
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Um.

331
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,600
Slice of Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.

332
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Um.

333
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,200
I actually played a few games this week.

334
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,020
Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually, you know, and I already reviewed

335
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,320
the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, but I just want to emphasize, if you

336
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,280
are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with

337
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,840
you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another, because I'll tell you, it was a little

338
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,920
bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack, where you can only

339
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,000
access the first five in the beginning, and then as you play, you unlock one more, so

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,160
it's like you only ever have five open at a time, but what was frustrating about that

341
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,400
is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house, so

342
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,560
when we let the game just randomly pick an episode, we got the first game over again,

343
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,000
so Alan and I were just sitting there, you know, we knew it was just, who buzzed faster?

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Who can buzz faster?

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,600
It was really all it came down to, so I was a little bit frustrated that that happened.

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,400
I understand they probably designed it that way for Xbox Live mode, so that way there

347
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,120
would always be some episodes at the end, most people haven't got to yet, but I would

348
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,440
say for the next You Don't Know Jack game, it would be even better if the non-Xbox Live

349
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,960
games were one set of games, and then the Xbox Live games were like another set of games,

350
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,440
and what they could even do is that, like, let's say you have 70 offline episodes, and

351
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,320
let's say 50 online episodes, have it so that if you have already played all 50 episodes

352
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,120
online, you only get matched up with other people that have played all 50 episodes online.

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,280
That way, all the, like, I don't want to say cheaters, but all the people that already

354
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
know-

355
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Have, like, staggered levels.

356
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Exactly.

357
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
You know, kind of like-

358
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Like, matching, I guess, sort of way.

359
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,320
That would be my feedback for the You Don't Know Jack folks, otherwise I still think it's

360
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,200
hilarious, it's a great party game, it's fun, it's not a $60 game, which is great, and,

361
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,280
you know, it's worth your time, so do check it out.

362
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,960
Other games I played this week, I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the, it's Contra, but it's

363
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:44,040
not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,020
like the same Contra music, so it's Contra, people, it's just Contra.

365
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,760
I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old-school gamers wish they had so

366
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,160
much more of on Xbox Live.

367
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,080
It really is just, like, a souped-up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo

368
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:09,160
game, now with 3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.

369
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
It just uses-

370
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
2.5D?

371
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,600
Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing, where, you know, things are coming out of the background

372
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,160
and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff, but, like, if you like Contra, this is like

373
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,440
an, you don't even have to think, you're gonna want this game, buy this game.

374
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,440
It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.

375
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,440
It's, you know, modernized a bit, there's this full-on anime opening sequence, it's

376
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,800
like, it kind of just made me think of, like, yeah, fuck yeah, Contra, fuck yeah, fire burn,

377
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,240
you know, chicks with guns, it was kind of awesome, so.

378
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Cool.

379
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
It's definitely worth your time.

380
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
The only downside?

381
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,560
No up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.

382
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,720
It didn't work, unless I put it in the wrong place or something, I wasn't able to get that

383
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
code to work.

384
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Try it backwards.

385
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Maybe.

386
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?

387
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
You die.

388
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah, I know.

389
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
That happened at-

390
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
But-

391
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
One of the Gradius games did that, too, I think.

392
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.

393
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,520
Wasn't it Gradius 4 on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used LRLR, then you would

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,960
get all the power-ups, instead of left, right, left, right, the shoulder buttons.

395
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,040
And I think Gradius 5 only let you do it three times.

396
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
So.

397
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,080
Also, I played an indie game on the marketplace called Try Not to Fart, and that's the set

398
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
of- Jamie looks disgusted.

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,360
No, I'm not disgusted, it's just like a what?

400
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,760
It actually cracked me up, like, it's really funny, like, it's just basically like, you

401
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,920
actually try to hold down buttons, like, buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have

402
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,360
to press that right button, and then when it flashes, you let go.

403
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,560
And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels, but then as you move

404
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,600
on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y, now let go of A.

405
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
So it's like Twister.

406
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,920
Yeah, yeah, it's like Twister, and then if you screw up, you fart.

407
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,280
But what's great is that it's like you're on a date with a girl or whatever, and so,

408
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,000
like, the best part of the game is the inane conversation that's happening in the background

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
where you're trying not to fart.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I like fish.

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
Exactly, they're, like, talking about, and it's all these, like, total douchebag topic

412
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,720
types of things, like, you know, so, do you come here often?

413
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,480
Oh, well, I didn't, you know, they're having this conversation, and then, like, if you

414
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,360
accidentally fart, it'll go pfft, and it's like, it's just like, ew, that's disgusting.

415
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,520
It's just, like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way, but.

416
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,200
I like how your shoes are tied.

417
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,600
Like, don't spend money on it.

418
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,440
No, I shouldn't say that, because it's an indie development place, but I just, you know,

419
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
it reminds me a lot of-

420
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,160
I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.

421
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,480
The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe, where they had this, like, game

422
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,560
where you're talking, you're hitting on women and stuff, and you have this little sperm

423
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,040
that you have to kind of move up and down through, like, this maze that's coming along

424
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:06,040
the screen, you have to dodge, like, the, uh, I don't know, just, like, STDs or whatever,

425
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,720
but if you hit that stuff, he starts saying weird things, you know?

426
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,280
Yes, I remember that.

427
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
It's kind of funny.

428
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
I do remember that.

429
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
That was funny.

430
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,080
So, all right, um, thank you, Salacious Pop brought me food for that.

431
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
He rocks.

432
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,560
All right, um, uh, before I turn it over to Salacious Pop for his gaming week, let me

433
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,720
talk real quickly about, and I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because

434
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,040
there was an NDA and everything, but, eh, it's an open beta.

435
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,200
Everybody's playing it, if they're interested in it.

436
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
It's Rift.

437
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,080
I played for a little bit this week.

438
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,720
I grinded a character up to level 8, and, uh, how do I explain Rift?

439
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,920
It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways, to the point where I didn't

440
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,400
know what button did what, and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?

441
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, well, in WoW, I hit N, and sure enough, I hit N, and it brought up my talent tree.

442
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,120
So, it's kind of funny that I kind of, like, knew the buttons from just having played WoW

443
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,960
so much, um, but obviously, Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's, let's be honest,

444
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,600
Rift, in its advertising campaign, is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something

445
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
like that.

446
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
It's trying to say, this isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.

447
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
You're not in Azeroth.

448
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah, something like that.

449
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Like, not in Kansas.

450
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Exactly.

451
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,960
Um, so I played the game to, like, level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know, and, um,

452
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,520
I don't know, I gotta be honest.

453
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,040
I wasn't really feeling it, like, the game didn't have anything that just made me jump

454
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,240
out of my seat, go, wow, that's cool.

455
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,560
Now, I do hear the PVP's pretty cool, and there are some, like, questing in the world

456
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,560
events, and that's something that was in Warhammer, that I really liked in Warhammer, um, the

457
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,680
whole public questing idea, and I wish WoW had something like that, and I did like that.

458
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,360
But um, you know, I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels, so it's really, I'm

459
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,160
not going to try and review the game, because, you know, I'm just telling you, I played it,

460
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,800
I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels, everybody's telling me

461
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,200
you have to really invest time into it, but let's be real, you know, the game also kind

462
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,640
of has to do something to make me want to get that far, I mean, wasn't that everybody's

463
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,940
biggest bitch about Final Fantasy 13?

464
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,840
It doesn't get good until you're, like, 15 hours in?

465
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.

466
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,840
Yeah, and, you know, true, some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which

467
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,020
is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and

468
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,960
redid all the starting areas, to make them a little more interesting.

469
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,040
So, you know, Rift, it's a new game, they'll iron out some of the kinks, it'll be interesting,

470
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,040
um, I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.

471
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,240
I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the Fury Tail one or not, I kind of, I'm

472
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,920
not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but, whatever.

473
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,040
Would you, did you have something you want to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?

474
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
How does it look, is it pretty?

475
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah, it's pretty, I don't know.

476
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,280
There's something about, something about the way the characters look, I kind of like the

477
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,200
cartoony look of WoW, that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic, it does have

478
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,960
more intense character customization, I spent a lot more time doing that, so that was kind

479
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
of cool.

480
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,160
But, um, I don't know, like, I thought the scenery looked really nice, I really liked

481
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,280
the environments, I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects, all that's really beautiful,

482
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,120
but I wasn't, like, really into the way the characters looked, or the monsters, but, you

483
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
know, I don't know, I could, that's, that's really an opinion, so, there you go.

484
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,800
So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week, uh, we'll move on, I already mentioned the

485
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,680
Twitter and the Facebook and all that, as far as housekeeping goes, I don't think I

486
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,480
have a whole lot else to add, so, let's get into some actual...

487
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Falafels!

488
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
Falafels!

489
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,600
And then Game, oh, yes, Salacious Pop?

490
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
My Gaming Week.

491
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
Oh, I'm sorry, well that's what happens when you leave the room, Salacious Pop, how was

492
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,600
your Gaming Week?

493
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Yeah, I left the room because I was sent to bring him food, so...

494
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,960
I know, you were gone for, like, an hour.

495
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
That's right.

496
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,040
Um, well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp, that's more appropriate for your other podcast.

497
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,480
Um, the Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed

498
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.

499
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,120
Then some, uh, You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.

500
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:19,080
Um, I played about an hour's worth of The Great Gatsby Tribute, NES ROM Hack, amazing,

501
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
love it.

502
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,760
That was a book that we had to cover, I think it was junior or senior year in high school.

503
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
It's an old...

504
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,880
Okay, tell me about how this works as an NES game.

505
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
I don't get it.

506
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,600
It's, in level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend, who is sort of the person that

507
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,440
he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.

508
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,920
You show up at, um, Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and

509
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,200
find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage, and it's basically a platformer.

510
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,860
You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at them.

511
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,200
And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.

512
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
Um, so I played that.

513
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,800
I hated that book, just so you know.

514
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,080
That, well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have

515
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,240
to read in high school really depends on the teacher, I feel.

516
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,920
I'll give you that, but I never liked being forced to read books, and there were some

517
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,680
truly terrible books I had to read in high school.

518
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,760
And we had to read a separate piece, oh my god, I hate that book so much, and The Crucible,

519
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Arthur Miller, ugh.

520
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,320
I think I read a separate piece, and I didn't, what's a separate piece about?

521
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,960
I sound so uneducated right now, this is years ago, what's a separate piece about?

522
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,840
It's the best friend, and they're on the branch, and one of them sort of jostles the branch,

523
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,240
and his best friend falls.

524
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
I think I really like that book.

525
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,400
And breaks his arm, and he feels guilty about it like his whole life.

526
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,560
Yes, I like, I really like that book.

527
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Awful.

528
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,680
It's my least favorite, I hate this book, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

529
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Dandelion Wine.

530
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,280
I've never seen, we haven't covered that one.

531
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,800
Ugh, terrible.

532
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,160
The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.

533
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,560
But I loved Catcher in the Rye.

534
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
We did a nice advance, but not.

535
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,760
I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.

536
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:01,360
So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky, did you talk about the hold in the

537
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
fart game?

538
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Yes I did.

539
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
I missed that.

540
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,320
So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each

541
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,280
number of the question.

542
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,240
The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh number five girl, you rock my world girl.

543
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Cracks me up.

544
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.

545
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,960
So you have to play that game.

546
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,480
Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.

547
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,840
Yeah, but that's all.

548
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,600
What other classic book should they turn into an 8-bit game?

549
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
Watership Down.

550
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,460
Oh yeah, that'd be a good one.

551
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,720
How about Brave New World?

552
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,420
How about Atlas Shrugged, and then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.

553
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:58,840
What's the book, James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages, and it's a classic.

554
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,920
I'm liking on the name of the book.

555
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Maybe somebody in chat will.

556
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,600
Well, we've already had The Inferno.

557
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh yeah, it's true.

558
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,780
By the way, Dark Toa Gak in our chat room, I love this comment, LMAO, we're reading that

559
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,280
in English right now, and the teacher brought that game up.

560
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,760
I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.

561
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,520
You know what, if I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to

562
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
get people interested.

563
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,600
Like I think, I don't know, I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if

564
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,280
you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.

565
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,760
Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.

566
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,920
It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in

567
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
New York.

568
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,680
I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.

569
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,040
I don't like her.

570
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Anyway.

571
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,360
Video games, video games, wow, wow, wow.

572
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,880
All right, let's talk about some actual video game news, Loki, help, or we're going to turn

573
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,960
into the literary podcast.

574
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,520
Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar

575
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,800
cut scene directors.

576
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,840
I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.

577
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,240
He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for

578
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,360
Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.

579
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,760
But anyways, he's working on a game called 1979 The Game, which sounds kind of boring,

580
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,880
you know, a game about a year, but no, actually it's about the Iran revolution, and basically

581
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:39,840
he says they're focusing on the takeover of the American embassy and outline the game,

582
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,800
saying that they're looking at about eight to 10 different roles or different perspectives

583
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,920
that are going to be in the game, different characters, and initially you'll start the

584
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:55,320
game off as an Iranian but American born US State Department translator who is, I guess,

585
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,840
coming in with the objective to try to free the US hostages.

586
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,320
So interesting subject, I suppose.

587
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,240
They're saying that obviously it's going to be a social and political title, and there's

588
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,520
going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.

589
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:21,520
I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's

590
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,240
not a sandbox game, but it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going

591
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,880
to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting

592
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
subject.

593
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Honestly, before I was born, so not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened,

594
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,680
but so you're calling us all then, basically, when you make yes, I am calling you.

595
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,120
Well, I was one year old when that all went down, and I'm sure that you were.

596
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
I know, right?

597
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,480
Immediately on top of all the political news, but it is still a little weird.

598
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I don't know.

599
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,560
These whole like games based off real life are kind of strange to me.

600
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,680
I don't I can't put my finger on it, but like, wouldn't this game kind of encourage you in

601
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,920
some ways to be like changing history?

602
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Or like you can change history in it?

603
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,680
I don't know.

604
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,200
But then again, I love civilization, so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now.

605
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
It's different.

606
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,080
I can't explain it.

607
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,580
It's different.

608
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,320
Is this a game you're interested in playing, Logie?

609
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
Not really.

610
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
It doesn't sound that interesting.

611
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,920
Even though even with the Grand Theft, no, because it's a guy who was a cutscene director.

612
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,000
I mean, so what they directed stuff.

613
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,600
It's not the people actually.

614
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I don't know.

615
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,400
It's it doesn't really count.

616
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Do you think that maybe it's kind of funny because I was just mentioning this in our

617
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,080
whole little literary discussion.

618
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
It's not like Rockstar Games is saying, OK, we're going to make a game about the Iran

619
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
revolution.

620
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Then even then, I'd be kind of like, eh, I don't buy everything Rockstar puts out.

621
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
I mean, come on.

622
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Rockstar Table Tennis?

623
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
No, thanks.

624
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,680
I bought Rockstar Table Tennis.

625
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
All right.

626
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,720
Look, I'm sure you're sure you play that game every day.

627
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,240
We were just talking about how, you know, if I were a teacher, I would use the great

628
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Gatsby game to try and relate the book to kids and make it more interesting.

629
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,520
Is this maybe a way because all of us in the room admit we don't we weren't really old

630
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,480
enough to understand what was going on at the time.

631
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,020
So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened.

632
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,360
I guess it could be.

633
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,280
I mean.

634
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
I just don't care.

635
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
I don't know.

636
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,820
That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.

637
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,680
It's just like I wouldn't want to like a game based off of, I don't know, most of history.

638
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,680
I just don't really give a crap about history.

639
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,480
Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history

640
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,000
unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.

641
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,320
I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could

642
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,360
just go and read everything, which I have.

643
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,040
I go back and read history books for fun.

644
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,960
The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer

645
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Red Alert.

646
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,120
Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.

647
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Here's the funny thing.

648
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,240
Like in Einstein, I, I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know

649
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,160
is stretching it a little bit, but that's like going way back, like I remember Battle

650
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
of Olympus on the NES.

651
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
That game was awesome.

652
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,680
And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.

653
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,040
But like if they were to make a video game on like other recent historical things, like

654
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,280
let's be honest, if they were to make like a game on 9-11, that's not a game.

655
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,360
That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.

656
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,080
Like that's just not, like games are, I don't know, they're supposed to be like entertaining.

657
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,640
How do you even make a game out of that?

658
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
I mean, really.

659
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,200
Well, hopefully there isn't one, but how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?

660
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I mean, come on.

661
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
It's weird.

662
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Okay.

663
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Let me put this though into perspective.

664
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Okay.

665
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:06,120
I would say that World War II just ended three months ago and someone wants to put 1942 on

666
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,800
the market.

667
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,480
It's the same thing.

668
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,960
And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.

669
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
That wouldn't fly.

670
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Yeah.

671
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,040
Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?

672
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
There's zillions and zillions.

673
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,840
And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.

674
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,480
Yeah, I know.

675
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,720
So, I mean, hate to say it, if there's a war involved, it sells games.

676
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,440
They're just going to leave out certain things that are too recent for people, but you know,

677
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,760
maybe 15 years from now, we're going to have a, you know, a rewrite history game where

678
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,320
you save the tower or something.

679
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,960
They tried that and unfortunately that game sucked.

680
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,420
It wasn't necessarily saving the tower, but it was, and I'd see, my mind is already blocked

681
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,680
it out because it was such a crappy first-person shooter.

682
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:01,800
It came out last September of 09.

683
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,320
And basically you went back in time and you had to save specific people from history.

684
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,280
Just like nobody people.

685
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,560
But they had the Civil War and stuff like that and everybody's fighting the muskets

686
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,780
and you have this laser cannon, you know, just like, oh, you have to reload your musket.

687
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,400
Let me blow off your head with this Uzi.

688
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,280
You know, it's just time cop shit.

689
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,160
If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a sneak or a stealth game where

690
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,000
you investigate, where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.

691
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,400
Return of Time Pilot, maybe, because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?

692
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,900
Modernize that.

693
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,120
Way off topic here, but he brought it up.

694
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,240
Metal Gear Solid, wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Metal Gear Solid style game set

695
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,480
in like a high school or something like that and you're just like a high school kid or

696
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,400
something and all very sneaky around.

697
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,960
Are you shooting people?

698
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,680
Because that's not going to go over very well.

699
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
No, not shooting people.

700
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.

701
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,680
Oh, like gossip.

702
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,360
That should be the Mean Girls game.

703
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,380
Not this puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip biatch of the school where

704
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,160
you eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.

705
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,800
Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.

706
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
That should be the Mean Girls game.

707
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Way too dramatic.

708
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,960
You know, just like everything way overdramatized, you know, just a ridiculous amount of drama

709
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
to the game.

710
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
It'd be awesome.

711
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,600
No one has that kind of sense of humor, but Konami, I can see that you have that sense

712
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,960
of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and, God, what was that crappy high school

713
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,440
dating game that they had on the PSP?

714
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,840
Oh, I don't even, I remember the game.

715
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,920
I don't remember what it was called.

716
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,880
Anyways, see, I think all those things could be fixed with a little bit of Metal Gear Solid

717
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,680
thrown in, and hell, if you want to be funny even better, you know, even better if you

718
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,740
want to be a little bit more funny, you could have the principal or dean to be actually

719
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
Old Snake.

720
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,680
It'd be hilarious.

721
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know.

722
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,720
Alright, let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon, and

723
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,880
actually a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this

724
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,880
week.

725
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,840
They announced a lot of new games that are coming out, and the first is the Fables series.

726
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,920
This is the comic book series Fables.

727
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,280
That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012, so that's one of the games

728
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
that they are working on right now.

729
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,560
You know, kind of fairy tales.

730
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,480
They get, this is interesting, the comic book is based on characters from various fairy

731
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,340
tales like Snow White, Pinocchio, and this stuff.

732
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,720
They get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City.

733
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,640
So like, if you're thinking like, Fables is like, oh, it's like a Hansel and Gretel.

734
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

735
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
It's very different.

736
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,400
I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic, Vertigo, which is

737
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,060
DC's sort of more, I don't want to say adult, but their more serial, like, mature imprint.

738
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,800
They put Fables out, I have the two first volumes, and it's awesome.

739
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,320
I actually just, um, we've talked about a new issue that came out, which is the Cinderella

740
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
based one, where she's an assassin.

741
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,920
So it's like Enchanted, Enchanted meets Leon Professional.

742
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Pretty much.

743
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Nice.

744
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,520
How do you think it's going to translate into a game, those of you that know the books pretty

745
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
well?

746
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
I think it could do it.

747
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Yeah, the, it's like, I want to, I mean, they cuss a lot.

748
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,960
Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F bomb in the comic.

749
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,600
She's like, you know, because Beauty and the Beast to go see her for marital problems.

750
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,420
And she's like, I'm not a caseworker, leave me alone.

751
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,520
If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.

752
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Why are you asking me?

753
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,000
I get banged by seven different dwarves.

754
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
F off.

755
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,360
Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up

756
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
in the comic.

757
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:04,920
Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is

758
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,120
Dorothy Gale, who's a codename Silver Slipper.

759
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Nice.

760
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe they have the chew thing going on.

761
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,280
Can I be honest?

762
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,800
I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm like really interested.

763
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
I'm gonna have to like borrow your books.

764
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,280
That sounds awesome.

765
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,260
I like things from my childhood, like really, really messed up.

766
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,160
If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.

767
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,240
Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?

768
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Yeah.

769
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,400
The entire claw, I mean, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation, The Great Gatsby in 3D, that's

770
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,800
gonna make no fucking sense.

771
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,120
I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism

772
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,600
in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

773
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Not to say it's bad.

774
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I like Moulin Rouge.

775
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Yeah.

776
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,440
But I just don't like this 3D orgy, all these movies are having.

777
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
No, no, I understand that.

778
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
Everybody's, whatever.

779
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,460
I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.

780
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
Thank you.

781
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

782
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
This is why I love him.

783
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,400
It's in 40!

784
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
With the Batman movies.

785
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
I know.

786
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I know.

787
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
All right.

788
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,840
So anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale press event, Jurassic

789
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,480
Park is one of the other games.

790
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,200
We've known they've been working on this for a while.

791
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,980
They showed off a little more about the game, and it's gonna be coming out in April.

792
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,040
And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently the story

793
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,480
involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved,

794
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,400
and you can say the book too, of course, although not to get off track, but I always found it

795
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
interesting.

796
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,720
Did you ever read the sequel to the book, the Jurassic Park, the Lost World, the book?

797
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,640
Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?

798
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Yeah.

799
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,520
Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back because

800
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
they didn't die in the movie.

801
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,800
I always found that fascinating.

802
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,840
Well, Crichton was like, millions of dollars?

803
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,520
Oh, I'll have this done in two weeks.

804
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
Exactly.

805
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,400
I loved Jurassic Park when I was younger though, and that movie like first came out.

806
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,480
I love that, and I love the book, and I even like the sequel.

807
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,560
I just didn't care for the third one.

808
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,160
But anyway, I'm actually really excited about this.

809
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,280
But the loophole, or whatever you want to say, the place they found in the story, is

810
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,880
that, remember Nedry, who was played by the guy from Seinfeld?

811
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Newman.

812
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Newman, yeah.

813
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,600
When he escapes, he gets killed, right?

814
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,040
But what was he trying to do?

815
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,880
He was trying to get out of there with the...

816
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,800
The shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.

817
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
But it's never recovered.

818
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
It's always assumed lost.

819
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,680
So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?

820
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Where did it go?

821
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
Who found it?

822
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
What did they do with it?

823
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,040
So I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie, so I'm pretty excited

824
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
about this.

825
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
It's going to be pretty awesome.

826
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,900
Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.

827
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,580
That's a $5 off the regular price.

828
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,160
The Walking Dead.

829
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,180
This is a show on, what, AMC that a lot of people are really into?

830
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
Also a graphic novel.

831
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,540
Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.

832
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,920
So are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?

833
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,440
I don't know the show at all, but you know the book, and you know the show.

834
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,560
I know it's a book first, and then it became the AMC show.

835
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,840
I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.

836
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:29,960
Other than I love stuff with zombies, like I never get bored of zombies.

837
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,400
Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.

838
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,940
There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.

839
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,240
Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.

840
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,040
Also Hector, Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.

841
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,000
It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult.

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,400
And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind

843
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,040
of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.

844
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,180
And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fan

845
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,560
boy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really

846
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,800
going to be making it.

847
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,160
Gosh, shouldn't Telltale make a King's Quest game?

848
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,280
Wouldn't that be a perfect...

849
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,840
And it's like really happening, y'all.

850
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,680
Now we kind of know why Activision sent that cease and desist to that other group, because

851
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,400
this has probably been in the sort of brainstorm for a while, so now Activision looks less

852
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,080
like jerks, and I don't like it when that happens.

853
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Exactly.

854
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Yeah, I know.

855
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,600
I think a lot of us are going, oh, that explains a lot.

856
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,480
Well, and the cool thing is, though, the silver lining people are still allowed to do their

857
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,480
thing, and they're putting out what, the third game, or they just put out the third episode

858
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,560
in their series.

859
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,600
So it's cool that that's able to coexist, because you know what?

860
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,720
I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe, so to speak.

861
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,720
Why not?

862
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,320
We have all these, like we were saying earlier, World War II games.

863
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
We have TV shows.

864
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,480
We had two Star Trek shows on at the same time, so why not?

865
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,360
And it's cool that one's free, and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way,

866
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,520
but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.

867
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
You know what I mean?

868
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,240
I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals, because I know they're really

869
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,680
passionate about what they do, but on one department, you have the same group that made

870
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,520
Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.

871
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,480
Telltale has a proven track record.

872
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,080
They have the pedigree to do this.

873
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,800
That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.

874
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,540
And it's really cool that both are gonna be coexisting and what have you, and I am so

875
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,900
excited to see what they put out.

876
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,080
I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.

877
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,100
I mean, I realize she's, what, living in a fort in the middle of the woods now, and doesn't

878
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,400
really do a lot with gaming.

879
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,980
They live in Yosemite or something weird, I don't know.

880
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,040
They pretty much remove themselves from society, I think.

881
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,240
So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy, because I have so many

882
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,960
video game memories tied to her and Ken Williams.

883
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,320
And they just, like, I don't even think I have to say this, because I think they already

884
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,400
know, but Telltale, if they're gonna be rebooting it, we've gotta have something as awesome

885
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,440
as Rosella, the fourth game.

886
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,440
And I think there will be nods, there'll be winking nods to the old stuff, I believe it.

887
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
So it'll be cool.

888
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,520
Because they didn't say it's a remake, they said it's a reboot, more to be revealed at

889
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,520
E3.

890
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
So, very cool.

891
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,980
Very, very cool.

892
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,080
So lots of news out of Telltale this week.

893
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,560
Let's move on, though, with some other news.

894
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
DarkStakra.

895
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,640
Well, there's a different perspective out on how piracy is going in the PC market.

896
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:40,320
And they're actually saying that according to this one facility, the PCGA research group,

897
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:45,080
that actually PC piracy has gone down.

898
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,480
Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off disks and then downloading a crack

899
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,280
file so that they could play the disks.

900
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:00,160
And that now it's because there are so many things that are included in the games now

901
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,840
that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game

902
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,040
goodies, that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not gonna get any

903
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,700
of the bragging rights that go along with having the game.

904
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:17,680
And a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple

905
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,160
systems, who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it.

906
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,320
And the other thing, too, is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it

907
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,320
comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost-effective to run your own

908
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,200
server for a lot of these games.

909
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,400
You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're

910
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
playing Ragnarok Online.

911
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,200
Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.

912
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,120
I digress.

913
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,420
But the WoW ones are really jank.

914
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,520
It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.

915
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,080
And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to

916
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,240
private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters

917
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
over.

918
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,120
Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?

919
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,320
Yeah, they did.

920
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,340
So that was really cool.

921
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,520
And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that

922
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,880
you can't pirate a free game.

923
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,520
It's free anyway, so why not?

924
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,880
And it's not like if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server,

925
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,180
then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself as opposed to getting the

926
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,560
community content like how they did with Second Life.

927
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,280
So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are

928
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,920
distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.

929
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Interesting.

930
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,440
I mean, when I first kind of heard the title of the story, I'm kind of like, really?

931
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,040
It seems like with a lot of the stuff we read about, it's up, especially with Torrance and

932
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
everything.

933
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,040
But that does make sense.

934
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,740
And a lot of MMOs really dominate, whether you hate them, you can't deny, they really

935
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,680
dominate a lot of the PC gaming market, and you really can't pirate those.

936
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,800
I mean, you can, but it's just not, I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting

937
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,640
the same experience that a person who pays for it does, unless it's Ragnarok Online.

938
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:21,600
I like with your first person shooters, that you've got servers set up for online play,

939
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,160
and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself.

940
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,480
Or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled.

941
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,400
If you've got a pirated version, because I've noticed a few of those running about.

942
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,000
I've noticed a lot from more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever,

943
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,600
Modern Warfare 2, Starcraft 2.

944
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:51,320
Even without the cinematics, these games are huge, and I know that at home broadband connections

945
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,960
are faster than they've ever been.

946
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,480
You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like a hundred bucks.

947
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,680
But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70

948
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
gigs.

949
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,160
And it's like, yeah, all right, leave it running overnight, but it's like, that's just too

950
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
much.

951
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
I'd rather just buy it.

952
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,160
I don't know.

953
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,360
Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.

954
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,440
We'll see.

955
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
That's what everyone would like to hear.

956
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,580
The thing is that it's really slow, but honestly, it doesn't take much.

957
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,080
And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.

958
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:31,780
They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or the RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.

959
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:38,700
And they have programs like JDownloader, which will actually allow you to, if you don't have

960
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,640
a membership or whatever to those sites, it'll automatically wait the 30 seconds or whatever

961
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,960
to download your file, move to the next one, and so on and so forth.

962
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,200
Then it's very automatic overnight, and the download speeds are a lot faster.

963
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,720
Or there's also Usenet, which newsgroups and stuff like that, you can download a DVD in

964
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,720
like an hour.

965
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,800
This question's gonna sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.

966
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,880
What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?

967
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,920
Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before

968
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,960
they call your house and threaten you.

969
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,920
And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.

970
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,840
Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.

971
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,880
Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I wanna say

972
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,920
Starcraft 2 is at least 20.

973
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,560
Well, like Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's the big

974
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,560
game.

975
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,640
Yeah, but everything's compressed, I mean, you're talking like the most, you're gonna

976
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:41,880
probably have two DVD9 disk images or whatever, you're looking at 18 gigs or something like

977
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
that.

978
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,860
Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's gonna be very difficult to

979
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,360
hit your cap of 250 gigs.

980
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,040
And I can tell you this now, I download my episode of Supernatural every week, because

981
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,280
I'm at Temple on Friday night, and so I miss it.

982
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,980
So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural, and I've just downloaded the first four episodes

983
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:06,680
of Being Human, Season 3, and the first two of the American version of it, like, last

984
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,880
night, while I was playing World of Warcraft, and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.

985
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,240
So it's really not that hard.

986
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,720
Are you not able to, well, TV shows are kind of a different thing, though, are you not

987
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,400
able to watch Supernatural online, like on the official website or anything like that?

988
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,680
Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week

989
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,880
later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.

990
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,480
Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go

991
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,400
on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's

992
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,440
Drag Race.

993
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
Every week.

994
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,000
I will go on and watch that on Logo's website.

995
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,160
Well, I don't think you can watch the Colbert Report and The Daily Show.

996
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,160
Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.

997
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,160
It doesn't even have to be, like, Hulu or whatever.

998
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,160
You can go on the website.

999
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,080
Survivor every week is there.

1000
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,720
Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this

1001
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,200
show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.

1002
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way with...

1003
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
That's weird.

1004
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,600
And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television

1005
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,960
is absolutely stupid, and I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being

1006
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,520
talked down to.

1007
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,880
So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it, and, like, if I'm in the

1008
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,280
middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish

1009
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,440
watching the episode, or I can, you know, go mining or something.

1010
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,940
Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.

1011
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,240
This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.

1012
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,440
We were talking about King's Quest, Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orangetontrady.com

1013
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,000
saying, reboot Space Quest.

1014
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yes.

1015
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,880
Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would

1016
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,200
be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?

1017
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,000
One of the hero's games?

1018
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,800
The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember

1019
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,800
anymore, if they sign off on it, then hell yeah.

1020
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,280
Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.

1021
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,760
But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?

1022
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,000
So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.

1023
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I don't know.

1024
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,720
Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably

1025
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,060
better left in the past.

1026
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,060
But I digress.

1027
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,060
Let's move on.

1028
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,060
Loki, what do you have for us?

1029
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:31,880
Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great, or good, or worth playing.

1030
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,400
We talked a little bit about some of the stuff before, how there's been, you know, copycats

1031
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
on the App Store.

1032
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,680
In fact, there's even been, you know, I mean, no one's gonna say that there's not knockoffs

1033
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
on the App Store.

1034
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,120
I mean, hell, some companies have made a good business of putting out high-quality knockoffs

1035
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,440
at different games.

1036
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,200
But plain theft of actual games.

1037
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:03,400
One of the games that's been hit with this is the game The Blocks Cometh by Halfbot.

1038
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:11,640
And it was actually a Flash game at one point, but there's a, you know, group of people that

1039
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:20,200
actually stole the game, and the assets, and everything else, and put it up on the Apple

1040
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,040
App Store, and were selling it for quite a long time.

1041
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,040
I remember this.

1042
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,560
This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.

1043
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,920
Yes, and it was just like, you know, they were trying to get, you know, people trying

1044
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,600
to get Apple's attention to get it taken down.

1045
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:42,080
Because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99-cent app.

1046
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:49,600
It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy

1047
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,880
section of the App Store.

1048
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,840
So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.

1049
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,720
And now it's finally back.

1050
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,560
The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.

1051
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,480
So that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.

1052
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,960
But I mean, a lot of damage has been done, and people already have, like, the old version

1053
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
of the game.

1054
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,720
So it kind of sucks.

1055
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,720
What can be done about this, though?

1056
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,680
It's very interesting, because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to

1057
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,600
screen for copyrighted stuff.

1058
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,760
I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace,

1059
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
they'd kind of get that.

1060
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,320
But, you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest.

1061
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,080
I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game, either.

1062
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,080
No.

1063
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,760
You don't have time to play everything.

1064
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
Exactly.

1065
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,400
So how do you stop theft like that?

1066
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,960
I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace, does a peer review.

1067
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Is that the answer?

1068
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,960
I don't know.

1069
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,640
It might be the answer, I don't know.

1070
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,320
But it's not the only game that happened to it.

1071
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,640
There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with

1072
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,640
fighting animals.

1073
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:01,300
It was like a 3D fighter game, and that actually had a version of it, you know, ripped off

1074
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,300
and put on there.

1075
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,920
A little bit different situation with that is people that they claimed they were sold

1076
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,560
the rights to the game and stuff like that, but, you know, the developer said, no, you

1077
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,680
only have the rights to, you know, this, for, you know, the Flash game or something like

1078
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,680
that.

1079
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,680
We have the rights to do this.

1080
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,040
So there's a big ol' thing about that.

1081
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,600
Well, that's not so much a blatant ripoff.

1082
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,360
That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other by people like companies.

1083
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Something like that, yeah.

1084
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:31,640
Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.

1085
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,400
Smurfs Village, obviously a game that's out there.

1086
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,000
It's free to play, sort of.

1087
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,360
They call it like a freemium game.

1088
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:46,960
Well, there's been a lot of complaints from Capcom, or, you know, to Apple, I guess.

1089
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:54,560
Apparently Capcom, you know, they don't have good luck with the stuff on the iOS, I swear.

1090
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,880
Mainly there is a problem that people have been racking up pretty huge bills with this

1091
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,880
game.

1092
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,920
Mainly do, I guess, Apple's iTunes protocol means that once you've entered your password

1093
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,480
or whatever, all subsequent downloads and, you know, paid or free or whatever, don't

1094
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,420
require a password to be re-entered for 15 minutes.

1095
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,600
So say someone goes and purchases something on there, gives it to their kid to go play,

1096
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,880
you know, a game or something like that.

1097
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,560
He can go on the Smurfs Village and, oh, I'm going to spend $50 over and over and over

1098
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,400
again and just keep racking up.

1099
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,560
I'll tell you, it's really easy to buy stuff within a game.

1100
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,160
It's just a little pop-up box.

1101
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,720
Click OK to purchase dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

1102
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
It's very easy.

1103
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,720
Yes.

1104
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
So, you know.

1105
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
What do you want to say, Salish?

1106
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,920
I was just, I don't even, you know, have kids in my household and I'm usually very protective

1107
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,920
of my stuff.

1108
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,520
For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.

1109
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,200
I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.

1110
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,120
I want to be asked for my password every single time.

1111
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,120
Yeah.

1112
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:59,040
And there's also ways, I mean, if you have kids and, you know, this is something that

1113
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,960
you're afraid that might happen, there is a way you can also disable.

1114
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,320
First off, you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well.

1115
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,640
You can also disable in-app purchases.

1116
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,800
And it's opt-out though.

1117
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,040
It's not opt-in, which is the problem.

1118
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
It's opt-out.

1119
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,440
So, you need to, you know, make sure you do that.

1120
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,520
But yeah, apparently, you know, there's, I know we've heard there is, you know, kids

1121
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,820
racking up thousands of dollars of purchases because they thought, you know, Smurf Berries

1122
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,820
were free.

1123
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,080
I hate to break it to you, kids, Smurf Berries are never free.

1124
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
Here's the thing.

1125
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,920
Like, I get where there's a problem on, I don't think that's really Capcom's fault.

1126
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,840
I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down and to be honest, I haven't

1127
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,600
had to, you know, nobody uses my phone but me.

1128
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
So I haven't had to explore.

1129
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,960
Well, they're basically saying, I mean, yeah, I agree that they should lock it down, but

1130
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,340
they're also making it seem that it seems like the kids aren't even aware that it's

1131
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,340
costing money.

1132
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,480
And then there's my other thought.

1133
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,680
Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that

1134
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,680
somewhat?

1135
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,520
Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this, well, I guess maybe some

1136
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,520
parents don't know.

1137
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,120
They may not know it's a free Smurf game.

1138
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,960
I still think some onus is on the parents.

1139
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,440
It is negligence on the parents' part for sure, but.

1140
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,800
But you're right, you shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.

1141
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,000
They're not making it any, I mean, they're making it as easy as possible for it to happen

1142
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,920
so that, you know, maybe say, you know, a kid rack up, you know, racks up, you know,

1143
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,360
$30 with the purchases or something like that.

1144
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,080
The parent might go, shit, but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded,

1145
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,640
you know, whereas, you know, thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all

1146
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,040
of a sudden, you know, Capcom's giving them the money back.

1147
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,400
But how many times, you know, is this happening that they're not getting their money back

1148
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,320
or not even trying to get their money back?

1149
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:56,280
Yeah, now a lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with

1150
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,440
the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is it doesn't say this costs

1151
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,800
you $5.

1152
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,680
It says this costs you 20 fairy dust points.

1153
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,280
So the kid's like, oh, okay.

1154
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:13,160
And when they refill their bucket of whatever, that's when that real money comes in.

1155
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,280
So the currency within the game is...

1156
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,920
Oh, like Microsoft points.

1157
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:24,200
Yeah, or even Knight of the Clicky, the Squaresoft, you know, the Square Enix party points or

1158
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,200
whatever.

1159
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,040
It's not, there's always a layer of...

1160
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Party points?

1161
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,640
They haven't even, they didn't do Gil?

1162
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,080
I don't think, it's not really, I think they're just Gweenix coins or something like that.

1163
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,080
Yeah.

1164
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:40,600
They actually talk about this is money for dollars because a kid might recognize that,

1165
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,560
but there's that sort of, I don't know.

1166
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,160
I think it's a very, some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.

1167
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,520
Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com.

1168
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,000
Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod touch, you can log off your account before giving

1169
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,760
it to a kid to play.

1170
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,280
There's a suggestion.

1171
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,640
Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store

1172
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,560
to keep their kids occupied.

1173
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,520
I've seen them watching videos and playing games.

1174
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,280
Xlink says, parents are being stupid.

1175
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,380
I have two kids and I know about what these games do.

1176
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,380
And here's a clue.

1177
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,800
If something is free, there's a catch.

1178
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,180
So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying that this is a problem.

1179
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:22,120
So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has sold Capcom in no

1180
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,920
uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly

1181
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,000
significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large

1182
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,460
amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.

1183
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:38,320
In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your

1184
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,320
game.

1185
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,940
Fix it.

1186
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,680
That's basically what that means.

1187
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,280
Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.

1188
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,760
Basically from Apple and credit card companies because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't

1189
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
authorize this charge.

1190
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,560
Yeah, let's do a charge back and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.

1191
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,240
So yeah.

1192
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,680
Interesting.

1193
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,520
I do think though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.

1194
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,880
They enabled this feature.

1195
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,020
They made it so easy to do.

1196
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:13,240
They need to kind of educate people and they're making money off of it.

1197
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,140
And they approved Capcom's game.

1198
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,240
So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.

1199
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,100
And I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff, but I think Apple needs

1200
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,100
to own some of that.

1201
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,520
And it's not that difficult to, you know, patch this shit.

1202
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,040
I mean, fuck, there's games that patch themselves, you know, once a week.

1203
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
I mean, come on.

1204
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Just do it.

1205
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
Just fix it.

1206
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
All right.

1207
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
Well, we'll see what develops with that.

1208
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,920
Yeah, there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention

1209
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,800
to what's going on with your kids.

1210
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,800
Seriously.

1211
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,800
That still wouldn't stop it.

1212
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
All right.

1213
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,560
Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.

1214
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,160
And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else

1215
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,500
is buying this game.

1216
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,080
But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on

1217
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,760
all the big gaming blogs.

1218
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,740
But yes, it is true.

1219
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:03,440
They are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars limited edition.

1220
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,200
It's called a final shipment.

1221
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,440
I'm surprised they didn't call it like an encore shipment or something like that.

1222
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,840
But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want

1223
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:18,240
to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on

1224
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
a Wii disc.

1225
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,240
That's all it is.

1226
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,240
No extra frills.

1227
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,240
No nothing.

1228
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,720
Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.

1229
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:25,920
Oh, excuse me.

1230
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
Excuse me.

1231
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,920
Yeah, but I mean, come on.

1232
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,400
That's basically included in the price.

1233
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,720
And it's a limited sampler soundtrack.

1234
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:34,720
It doesn't have like a full soundtrack.

1235
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,840
It's just the Super Nintendo NSF files or whatever they're called.

1236
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
No, no, no.

1237
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,160
It's everything from the original Mario Bros all the way up through Galaxy and stuff.

1238
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,160
Alright, fine.

1239
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,560
But no, it's like one song from each game.

1240
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,560
So who cares?

1241
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,000
And that stuff's like all on the internet anyways.

1242
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,040
No, but basically, here's the thing.

1243
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,440
It's not in large quantities.

1244
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,000
It's going to be just as limited as it was before.

1245
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,280
They're just releasing a few more.

1246
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,680
In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.

1247
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,200
Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack

1248
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,760
shit basically.

1249
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,520
So yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited.

1250
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:11,360
But hey, you know, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.

1251
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:18,440
But honestly, just tell yourself it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to

1252
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,200
port it over to the Wii.

1253
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,200
That's all it is.

1254
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,740
If you want that soundtrack and you want that book, great, I guess.

1255
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,720
But I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.

1256
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,680
I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.

1257
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,880
There's just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot

1258
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,280
of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.

1259
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:45,080
I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo

1260
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,160
and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.

1261
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
And on top of all that-

1262
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,360
And if they want more for it, talk them down.

1263
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:55,720
And the fact that this game is going for that much money online, and the fact that they're

1264
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,320
like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.

1265
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,320
You know what that means?

1266
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,640
More of this shit is gonna happen coming soon.

1267
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,480
I mean, you bet your ass that they're gonna fucking reprint that goddamn- Remember the

1268
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,640
Legend of Zelda bonus cysts that they had for pre-ordering Wind Waker and shit?

1269
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
How much you want?

1270
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,680
But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.

1271
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,920
They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out like Mario

1272
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,000
64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.

1273
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,960
But they could always do more GameCube games.

1274
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:30,000
Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS, or Mario Kart or whatever.

1275
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,240
They could easily do it for another system.

1276
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:38,120
And Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them, and people

1277
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,560
are dumb enough to purchase them.

1278
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,880
But let's also be real.

1279
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,040
What else is coming out on the Wii?

1280
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,320
There's that awesome-looking role-playing game in Japan that's not coming out here.

1281
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
We've been doing-

1282
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,200
There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports makes.

1283
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,060
They haven't announced a new title- Well, Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.

1284
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,120
This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?

1285
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,120
No.

1286
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,800
What, they're just gonna stop doing Wii stuff?

1287
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,240
No, it's not that they're stopping doing Wii stuff.

1288
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,480
They just haven't announced anything yet.

1289
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,560
They haven't announced which games are coming out.

1290
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,800
They still have stuff in the pipeline.

1291
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,240
They have the new Zelda game that's in the pipeline.

1292
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,240
Oh yeah.

1293
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,360
That's fourth quarter, I can tell you right now.

1294
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,080
They have, you know, stuff coming, and then there may be unannounced stuff, and they may

1295
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:26,440
try to pull the new play control crap again, but those are dumb.

1296
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,440
I don't know.

1297
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,560
They don't really have a lot.

1298
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,080
They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff, so who knows?

1299
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,080
We'll see.

1300
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,920
In the meantime, more news, Dark Sakura?

1301
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,920
Yes.

1302
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,920
I have news.

1303
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,420
All right.

1304
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:46,440
There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this

1305
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,980
is gonna seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve

1306
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,600
symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.

1307
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,400
How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.

1308
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,460
But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's psychophysiology lab and bio-feedback

1309
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:10,360
clinic, so it at least has a reputable study that was done about it.

1310
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:17,440
They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression, and they played Bejeweled

1311
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,140
2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle, and they all experienced a significant reduction in

1312
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,080
anxiety and better mood.

1313
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,680
Does this explain why sometimes, and I don't know how many of y'all do this, but like when

1314
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:35,240
I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home, but I'm just not feeling, you know,

1315
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,060
it's raining out, and I'm just feeling kind of blah, I'll sit there on Facebook and play

1316
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,400
that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour.

1317
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,280
Like does that tie into this?

1318
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,980
I will admit something.

1319
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,720
You know that towards the end of my job period, I was very unhappy.

1320
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,720
Right.

1321
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,720
Very unhappy.

1322
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,720
Right.

1323
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,200
I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.

1324
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,420
I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk, and I would always

1325
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,500
feel better.

1326
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:08,640
Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.

1327
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,900
Or I would, you know, I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks, but it was

1328
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:18,820
just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air,

1329
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,160
and I found I could get back to work and do fine.

1330
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,760
But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?

1331
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft

1332
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
Auto IV.

1333
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:31,760
He's been doing it for years.

1334
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,360
That's not for blowing off stress.

1335
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,440
I'm not, well I'm not saying Loki- That makes my coworkers more stressful actually.

1336
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,280
I'm not saying like Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your

1337
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,600
way to relax?

1338
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,600
It's your way to kind of unwind at work.

1339
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Right?

1340
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
A little bit?

1341
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
It doesn't really matter.

1342
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:52,560
I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.

1343
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,560
People like games.

1344
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,560
I mean there's lots of things.

1345
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,340
But I couldn't sit and do that with like Final Fantasy II for example, which I was still

1346
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,760
playing on my phone.

1347
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,040
Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.

1348
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,720
I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game, you know?

1349
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,160
But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back

1350
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,160
to later, it's easier.

1351
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:21,040
You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.

1352
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,440
That's yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard.

1353
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,560
And clearly I'm not alone.

1354
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,280
Do you have a comment?

1355
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
No.

1356
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
Oh sorry, I was looking.

1357
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,680
S2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I can attest to this.

1358
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,040
Ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty.

1359
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,320
Rickster in our chatroom says, maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax

1360
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,320
play modes.

1361
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,320
Interesting.

1362
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,320
That is true.

1363
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,440
Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it.

1364
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,680
Maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy.

1365
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,440
I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but interesting.

1366
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:07,280
But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really

1367
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:13,240
just casual games or if other games are involved in it.

1368
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:18,480
But I do see where, just in my own experience, we're going and blowing off a little bit of

1369
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,480
steam on a couple levels of a game, or you know, playing a couple levels of solitaire.

1370
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:28,360
Or like, you know, my friend, she would do Sudoku puzzles to chill out.

1371
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,360
That stresses the hell out of me.

1372
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,320
Yeah, Sudoku puzzles make me more stressed out.

1373
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,200
She's an accounting major now.

1374
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,080
You gotta have something special to like those puzzles.

1375
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,080
She loves numbers.

1376
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:44,160
New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.

1377
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:51,840
Actually playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.

1378
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,880
Because they don't frighten me.

1379
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,040
The games don't frighten me.

1380
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,040
People frighten me.

1381
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,420
Maybe Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.

1382
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:05,920
I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.

1383
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,280
People freak me out more than the game does.

1384
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,960
And fake blood freaks me out.

1385
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,040
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says video games do help you relax until you start kicking

1386
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,880
and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.

1387
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,880
They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.

1388
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,760
You know what stresses me the hell out?

1389
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,760
That'd be awesome.

1390
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,040
I'm not fighting games with Dan because he's a dick.

1391
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,640
I love you.

1392
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,560
He's a jerk when he wins.

1393
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,560
He's a sore winner.

1394
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Yeah.

1395
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,080
All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what

1396
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,520
games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.

1397
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,160
We'll start in the US with Loki.

1398
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,600
There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out of this week, which is pretty

1399
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
cool.

1400
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,200
You know, starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you is playing.

1401
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,160
Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.

1402
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:59,120
But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox

1403
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,120
360.

1404
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,480
That includes an early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.

1405
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,240
It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.

1406
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:14,360
And then also the limited edition, which is on PS3 and PC, so you can check those out.

1407
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:18,740
Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.

1408
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:22,960
That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

1409
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,680
Let's see here, Ys I and II Chronicles with the soundtrack.

1410
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,520
That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.

1411
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,520
Re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice and

1412
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,720
Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.

1413
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,680
Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlus saying that they're marking some of that stuff

1414
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,680
down.

1415
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,080
Those are coming out this week as well.

1416
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:49,960
The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space

1417
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:56,160
Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi, all for $30.

1418
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:04,200
Knight's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

1419
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,760
3.

1420
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,480
Track Mania, Built to Race.

1421
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,320
Track Mania is an awesome game on PC, so you should definitely check it out if you have

1422
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,320
a Wii.

1423
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,840
That'll be coming out on Wii, I believe also on DS as well.

1424
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,760
Such a great racing game.

1425
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:25,680
And then, a crappy game called Rec Room, it's coming out on DS, it's a portable Wii game.

1426
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,680
Party stuff.

1427
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,680
Fun.

1428
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:36,440
DeBlob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, no PC on that I guess.

1429
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,600
I remember the original DeBlob, it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.

1430
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,680
Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.

1431
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,680
But if, you know, you have a PlayStation 3.

1432
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,200
Because people don't remember the first one so well, it was kind of one of those under

1433
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,200
the radar.

1434
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:56,840
Yeah, the PlayStation 3 don't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.

1435
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:01,180
Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.

1436
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,180
That's pretty cool.

1437
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:08,680
I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Vilious,

1438
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,080
that's coming out on PC this week.

1439
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,120
Yeah, probably is another expansion.

1440
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,440
EverQuest loves their expansions.

1441
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,920
I'm surprised, that's just, that's kind of interesting that they're doing that.

1442
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,280
And then, what else, oh, some no name game.

1443
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,800
Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life, if you like those hidden picture type games,

1444
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,280
that's coming out on DS this week.

1445
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,280
Um, that's basically it.

1446
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,440
Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.

1447
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:44,600
This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called

1448
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,560
Moochi Moochi Pork and Pink Sweets.

1449
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,640
Yes, that's really what it's called.

1450
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:57,200
It's from Cave, so, uh, you know what kind of game that is, it's like a cave shooter

1451
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,200
type game.

1452
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,480
I think this is like a two-in-one type of thing, so I think that's kind of a cute title

1453
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,480
though.

1454
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,320
So, you know, if you like your bullet hell games, there you go, some pink sweets for

1455
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
you.

1456
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:14,120
Also, speaking of like cutesy games, The Idolmaster 2 gets its release this week on the Xbox 360,

1457
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,400
and I don't know if you remember the first one, but that was a big game, um, over in

1458
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,400
Japan.

1459
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,400
It never came out here.

1460
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,240
It was a very, uh, Japanese kind of game, that I guess some of you folks might just

1461
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,240
have to import.

1462
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,240
I don't know.

1463
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:30,400
Otherwise, we'll move on to some of the other consoles, uh, moving on to the PlayStation

1464
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,800
3, uh, coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1465
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:42,360
Also, uh, Bulletstorm Killzone 3 gets a release in Japan this week, and, uh, I don't know

1466
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:50,880
how to pronounce this game, Lave Once Mermaid's Tears comes out, and Makai Senke Disgaea 4

1467
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,720
comes out this week in Japan, speaking of games people are probably going to import.

1468
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:59,600
That might also explain, um, some of the re-releases that Loki already went over, uh, Rune Factory

1469
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:05,480
Oceans comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3, uh, moving on to the Nintendo Wii real

1470
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:09,600
quick to see if there's anything coming out in Japan, uh, yeah, they get Rune Factory

1471
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,300
Oceans there as well, and then SD Gundam G Generation World, cause you just...

1472
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,680
Like we really need another Super Deformed Gundam.

1473
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,720
You know you love your Gundam games, don't lie.

1474
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:27,920
Uh, also, it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan, it comes

1475
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,960
out on February 26th.

1476
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:34,120
I seriously thought about, you know, the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing

1477
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,680
that, and I was like, no.

1478
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:41,680
So uh, yeah, this is the big week guys, Winning Eleven 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle

1479
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:50,680
Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, uh,

1480
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:57,560
let's see, Nintendogs plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle editions, um,

1481
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:04,400
Layton Kojo Toukisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Layton, and uh, Combat of Giants

1482
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,840
Dinosaur 3D.

1483
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,480
All of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week, so that's Saturday,

1484
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,480
that's the 26th.

1485
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,720
So what games are you gonna get on the 3DS when it comes out?

1486
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:18,880
I'm probably gonna, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats.

1487
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,440
Then maybe the Street Fighter game.

1488
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,440
You make bad decisions.

1489
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,440
What?

1490
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,200
Okay, Mr. Salacious Pop.

1491
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:31,320
You know what, and I agree with you that it's a terrible decision that I too will probably

1492
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,540
have to make, because I'll be honest with you, there's a lot of games that are coming

1493
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,700
out on the 3DS, and not a lot of them interest me.

1494
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:43,480
And the ones that did interest me, like Dead or Alive, well actually Dead or Alive didn't

1495
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:47,600
really interest me that much, but you know, Street Fighter and whatever, um, but Dead

1496
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,280
or Alive, not coming out at launch, coming out in May.

1497
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,560
Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kinda cool, coming out in May.

1498
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,920
It's not coming out right away, but uh.

1499
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,280
So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?

1500
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,520
I don't.

1501
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,240
I'm just gonna wait until May.

1502
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,240
I think it looks cool.

1503
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,180
I actually wanna, I don't know.

1504
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:10,080
I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it.

1505
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,040
I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one.

1506
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:21,320
See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like

1507
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,320
living expenses.

1508
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:27,200
I, you know what, if I was in that situation I would probably do the same thing.

1509
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,240
Even though we've paid off like all our bills.

1510
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,360
I would sell stuff in the house, that's what, and it's not even any rational reason, I mean

1511
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,880
it's just like ridiculous stuff.

1512
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,880
Maybe the pilot wings game.

1513
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,080
Dan's talking that he wants the Playstation phone.

1514
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,140
Yeah the pilot games, the pilot wings game looks pretty awesome.

1515
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,440
If it were coming out at launch.

1516
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,440
Oh it's not at launch?

1517
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:50,360
Well they haven't announced their launch titles, Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.

1518
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,280
Which means they're like, oh we got nothing.

1519
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,400
Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing

1520
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,520
it?

1521
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,840
You can't see this but I'm flipping you off right now.

1522
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,720
I want you to buy Marvel vs Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my

1523
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,080
place.

1524
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,480
You guys are assholes.

1525
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:11,400
What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?

1526
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,280
Kid Icarus because you don't play portable games at all.

1527
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
It's not coming out at launch.

1528
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,480
Well that's, yeah, I can wait though, obviously you can.

1529
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:22,720
Launch window games is, they're like, I love Nintendo, that's great.

1530
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:28,960
Launch window games, it's this, from launch to 3 months after launch, that's not a window.

1531
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,080
Launch window is that week, that is the launch window.

1532
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,160
You don't launch for 3 months, that's not a launch.

1533
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,880
3 months is a quarter, that's the difference between Q2 and Q3.

1534
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:45,400
But anyways, if we're gonna say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool, Dream

1535
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:52,000
Trigger, it's a shooter music game, which is kinda cool.

1536
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:58,240
I hate even wanting to say this but the new Spongebob Squigglepants, the one that's like,

1537
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,840
hey no no no, it's like WarioWare.

1538
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,760
It's a WarioWare type game.

1539
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:09,000
I got not to get, what was I gonna, not the Spongebob but the other one.

1540
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,280
I was gonna ask about, oh, music shooter games, do we have a definitive date for Child of

1541
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,280
Eden yet?

1542
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,280
I wanna say we have.

1543
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,280
It's like in June right now.

1544
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,280
Okay.

1545
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,000
I don't think it's got a date on it.

1546
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
How about UK release dates?

1547
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,200
Yeah we'll get there but I never did the PSP ones cause everybody was bitching at me about

1548
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,200
putting in 3DS.

1549
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Sorry.

1550
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:31,200
So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan, Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th

1551
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,400
and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.

1552
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,760
Alright, now ma'am we may go to the UK.

1553
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,880
On the 22nd we have Cities in Motion for PC, the 23rd we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled

1554
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:49,600
Blitz Live, on the 24th Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm, we have DeBlob 2,

1555
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,000
we have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Gray Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic

1556
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,360
Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us

1557
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:08,680
Cling together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360 PC and Playstation 3.

1558
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,200
I'm efficient.

1559
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,680
Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.

1560
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,800
Alright.

1561
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,040
Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see

1562
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,680
how efficient she is on that.

1563
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,920
Alright, Loki.

1564
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,080
This is kinda odd but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's

1565
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,560
in so what's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?

1566
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,840
They're releasing tablets because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were

1567
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,320
first coming around.

1568
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:47,400
Hell, my uncle used to sell them and he's out of the job now so that tells you something.

1569
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:54,380
Anyways, yeah, they've come a long way but yes, apparently the Xperia Play is not the

1570
01:20:54,380 --> 01:21:03,000
only device from Sony that's gonna be allowing you to play PSP or I should say, yeah, PSP

1571
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:12,280
Playstation Network apps or Playstation 1 classic games but no, they do have the S1 tablet.

1572
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,120
It's a Playstation Suite certified tablet which means it's gonna be running the Android

1573
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:23,480
operating system and they haven't really said what it's gonna look like although there was

1574
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,800
a rumored design.

1575
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:31,040
It was some sort of tablet that actually folds, it has like a screen that actually bends which

1576
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:42,020
is kinda funky but cool I guess and that'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.

1577
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:47,140
But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets

1578
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:53,360
building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and Playstation

1579
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:58,800
Network services, developing or delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across

1580
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,800
the...

1581
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,760
I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.

1582
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,560
So yeah, they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out

1583
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,360
in the market and it plays Playstation 1 games.

1584
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:19,200
No one, I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch

1585
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,240
to play a Playstation 1 game on a goddamn tablet.

1586
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,480
It's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of...

1587
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,480
Signs.

1588
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,480
Agreed.

1589
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,240
But, and here's the other thing too, why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid

1590
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:38,360
tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what, we may just extend this Playstation

1591
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:41,600
suite to, you know, the Apple iPad or something like that.

1592
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,800
And a lot more people I'm sure have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever and they can play

1593
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:51,040
their games on there but I for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone

1594
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,080
or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because one, it would take up

1595
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,000
a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity, and two, it would play

1596
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,880
like shit because touch controls.

1597
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,000
Here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be

1598
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,960
dead when I start using it for the first time, right?

1599
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:14,840
That's the real question.

1600
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:20,120
I don't know, it's just, I mean seriously, if you're looking to get a tablet, just wait.

1601
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:27,000
I mean, because there's so many competing tablets out there now, or there will be, these

1602
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,200
things have got to be dropping in price soon and it's just the longer you wait, the better

1603
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,120
technology you're going to get in your tablet, the more you're going to get for your money.

1604
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:40,920
So just wait it out, I mean seriously, there's no need to rush in to play Playstation 1 games.

1605
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,560
If you really need to play Playstation 1 games, you can get a Playstation 1, a Playstation

1606
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:53,400
2, a Playstation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer, you can just wait.

1607
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,560
I mean, there are plenty ways to do it.

1608
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,860
Well here's something you shouldn't wait for.

1609
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:02,600
If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should

1610
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,200
buy it new.

1611
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,780
Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.

1612
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:13,200
Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game

1613
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,320
comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.

1614
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,480
This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.

1615
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,480
But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.

1616
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,600
So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the Playstation

1617
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,600
3 used.

1618
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,640
By the way, just I want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official

1619
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,800
quote on this, that's why this is news this week because they did make a comment on it,

1620
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,460
quote, once the PSN key has been consumed with a disk, it cannot be resold or replayed

1621
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,000
with the second user adding a sub.

1622
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,560
Only the original consumer can use that account.

1623
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,000
They say the retail disk and the PSN code, they are one and the same.

1624
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,840
Once you use it, it is gone.

1625
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:56,680
A second hand user cannot obtain a new code.

1626
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:01,120
And the only reason this is happening, and just because it's an MMO and because it has

1627
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,980
a 30 day free trial, otherwise people would just be able to pop it in the different systems

1628
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,680
or just loan it to friends and have 30 day trials for everybody.

1629
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:15,240
Which honestly is not a bad idea, it's a good way to get people hooked on your game, but

1630
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:19,640
no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single

1631
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,880
game out there.

1632
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,120
I think when they do that, people will be pissed.

1633
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,400
This is alright.

1634
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,960
This is expected with an MMO.

1635
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,480
With an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.

1636
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,560
So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really

1637
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,520
care where you, like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if

1638
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,880
my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.

1639
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:49,240
I don't have to go out and buy another disk, because that serial number is attached to

1640
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,240
my subscription.

1641
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,920
Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than mine than Blue Blizzard,

1642
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:55,920
but they still worked.

1643
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,520
But would you be able to do that with DC Universe online if you lost your Blu-ray disk?

1644
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,520
Probably not.

1645
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,400
But you've already paid for it though.

1646
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,480
If you lost your disk, it doesn't matter.

1647
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,520
It's not linked to the disk, it's linked to the game.

1648
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,360
The game has a code on the back of the box.

1649
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,120
Yeah, but how would I play DC Universe online without the damn disk?

1650
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,120
Exactly.

1651
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,520
Well, you would have to get a replacement disk if you lost your disk.

1652
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,920
And you shouldn't be such a, you know, a klutz if you're, you know, oh, where'd my disk go?

1653
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,920
I don't know.

1654
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,920
I'm just saying.

1655
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,920
I'm just saying, it's not tied to a disk.

1656
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,120
The disks are all pressed in mass quantities.

1657
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,800
It's not actual, each individual disk is tied to a code.

1658
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:37,940
It's just the disk packaging has a code printed on it, and that's what's tied to your system.

1659
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:43,560
So you know, in theory, say, your friend has the game also, and he lost his disk, and you're

1660
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:46,720
a kind soul and wanted to loan him your disk.

1661
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,720
That is absolutely fine.

1662
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:48,800
It will work just fine.

1663
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,680
It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to

1664
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,840
play it.

1665
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,120
There's no extra code.

1666
01:26:56,120 --> 01:27:04,000
Although, if they were smart, what they would do is they would have it, oh, okay, I don't

1667
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,400
have a code for this game, but I have the disk.

1668
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,120
I want to play, you know, online.

1669
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,200
Okay, well, you can pay a small fee, and we'll give you a code, and then you can play the

1670
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,200
game.

1671
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,480
Well, actually, they wouldn't want that because they're afraid of piracy.

1672
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,720
But yeah, it's, they should still try to make money off of it.

1673
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:24,440
Dartatsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you

1674
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,080
canceled your subscription.

1675
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,960
You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360,

1676
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,800
and I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in

1677
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,080
the game and get 30 days free.

1678
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,400
Well, and here's the other thing, too, about, you know, the DC Universe thing.

1679
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,600
Let's just say it's not as prone with, as the 360, but let's say your system dies.

1680
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
Crap.

1681
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,000
Because it's tied to your system.

1682
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,880
I guess you have to call their customer service.

1683
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,880
Alright.

1684
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:00,800
Well, anyhow, I got one more, uh, no, wait, I lied, that's it, that was my last story.

1685
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,880
So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.

1686
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:09,840
Let's stop, let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online

1687
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,760
for 30 days for free in serial numbers.

1688
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:18,800
Let's go back to a day when we had a single-player game in front of us on the TV and we liked

1689
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
it.

1690
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,760
Well, this wasn't on the TV in America.

1691
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,960
A single-player game in the arcade and we liked it.

1692
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,960
And it was a two-player game.

1693
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,960
A two-player game in the arcade.

1694
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,520
What's the fucking classic game of the week?

1695
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,520
Psycho Soldier!

1696
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,200
I brought it up last week, so I figured I may as well talk about it, because it's a

1697
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,200
notable game.

1698
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:41,480
Even if it's not a great game, it's a notable game.

1699
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:48,160
Yeah.

1700
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,840
And this is why the game is notable.

1701
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:55,520
It is the first arcade game that has a vocal soundtrack.

1702
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,480
If you want to turn it up a little bit, this is the English one.

1703
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:08,320
This reminds me of Lunar on Sega CD.

1704
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,320
Yeah.

1705
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,600
Actually, I think the Japanese singer is a little bit better.

1706
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,480
The other link that I put was the Japanese soundtrack.

1707
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,480
I'll have to call that up real quick.

1708
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,480
But, um, huh?

1709
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,480
It's not very good.

1710
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:18,480
Not great.

1711
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,480
Not great.

1712
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,960
Um, however, this game, again, like I said, is notable for being the first video game

1713
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:27,320
that had an in-game vocal soundtrack.

1714
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,680
And it's a sequel to SMK's Athena.

1715
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:35,640
And this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character, Athena Asumiya, comes

1716
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,960
from, as well as C. Kento.

1717
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,840
As that NES game way back in the game, right?

1718
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,840
Yes.

1719
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,840
Wow.

1720
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:50,720
This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad

1721
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:51,720
in 1987.

1722
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,640
Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you had pressed S for.

1723
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,960
Oh, and there's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.

1724
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,960
Yep.

1725
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:00,960
I see that.

1726
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,960
Let's play a little bit of that.

1727
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,960
I'm jamming.

1728
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:17,920
A little less screeching in.

1729
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,920
Yeah.

1730
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:25,000
But at any rate, this game, basically in the first, in Athena, you play as Athena, who's

1731
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,840
bored with hanging out with gods and goes off and runs and all to her adventures.

1732
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,920
This is her descendant.

1733
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:36,720
So basically, she's, well, running around with psychic abilities, and you have, it's

1734
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,360
a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to, because you

1735
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:46,160
could just run into a wall or into a trap or something that would just completely kill

1736
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,040
you.

1737
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:53,200
So her buddy, C. Kento, is player two.

1738
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,880
And it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor

1739
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,920
uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12

1740
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,880
as their default outfits, I believe.

1741
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:11,720
Or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game,

1742
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:12,720
anyway.

1743
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:19,080
And of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of

1744
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,080
this theme.

1745
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,120
Like, I think I put one in as well.

1746
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:26,320
But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.

1747
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,940
Like I said, it's a side-scroller, you've got different levels, you have rocks and destructible

1748
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:35,720
objects, you can blow them up, and you've got different enemies, and you basically go

1749
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:39,840
horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects, and you can use your

1750
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,920
psycho energy to get different attacks, either by using a shield of rotating spears, which

1751
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,520
was one of her moves in King of Fighters.

1752
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:54,360
And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.

1753
01:31:54,360 --> 01:32:00,400
And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the

1754
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,720
special items happen to be different.

1755
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:09,880
Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.

1756
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:15,280
But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them,

1757
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:19,000
or rams them into an enemy.

1758
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:26,480
The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu, and I don't

1759
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,400
know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.

1760
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:38,480
And the song came out on a cassette that was only available for people who purchased the

1761
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,320
Famicom version of Athena.

1762
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:46,400
So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending

1763
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,200
theme.

1764
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,360
And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.

1765
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:58,440
It was the Psycho Soldier team in 94, and King of Fighters 96, and it was Athena's theme

1766
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:04,560
in King of Fighters 97, and King of Fighters 2002.

1767
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,920
As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was in 87 by Imagine Software.

1768
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:16,600
And it kind of got some decent success, it got an 8 out of 10 for one rating, and a 6

1769
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:23,360
out of 10 for 77, and 75% for other places, but said it was really slow.

1770
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:27,400
Well Athena and Kenso have both been in the King of Fighters series, they've also of course

1771
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,280
been in SNK vs. Capcom.

1772
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:40,440
They were, in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit, and Kenso was in

1773
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:47,400
his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000, as Psycho Soldier Kenso.

1774
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:54,680
Also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystalis on the NES.

1775
01:33:54,680 --> 01:34:03,680
And that's pretty much it, it's a fun little waste of time, I've got a main ROM of it.

1776
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:08,440
There it is, your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.

1777
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,440
You see why it's notable.

1778
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,440
I do.

1779
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,920
First in-game vocal soundtrack.

1780
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:13,920
I do.

1781
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:14,920
Very cool.

1782
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,520
Alright well we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because

1783
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,980
we're going to be back with part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics,

1784
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:24,840
be sure to get those in if you haven't already at twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're going

1785
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:29,880
to get into some rapid news, including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise

1786
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,400
download content that showed up among some other things, and of course we have some more

1787
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,000
news development in a lawsuit against Activision, and we'll talk about that.

1788
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,160
It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.

1789
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:48,040
Of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week, it is all coming up when we come back with

1790
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:55,480
more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1791
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,960
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1792
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:04,960
We are live on this February the 20th of 2011 with the 402nd episode of our show.

1793
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,180

1795
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,960
Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1796
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,520
We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics,

1797
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:26,320
but first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling playing

1798
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,240
this game, Bulletstorm.

1799
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,240
What's so funny about it?

1800
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,240
You like this?

1801
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:33,760
Just a lot of like, I like the writing in it, I guess, in the very beginning of the

1802
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:39,800
game, like the tutorial section of the game, they have you, you know, interrogating this

1803
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,040
guy or like, you know, he's trying to collect a bounty on you guys and so they kick him

1804
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:50,240
in the face and lock him into an airlock and then get him, see he gets sucked out and then

1805
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,240
there's stuff going on.

1806
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,120
They're like, okay, let's raid the ship now and then they're trying to open this door

1807
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:02,560
which pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny, and then they

1808
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:08,400
turn around and then they see the corpse of the guy near the window with the sticky mine

1809
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:14,440
on the window and he's all, it's all, god damn it, and then the thing just explodes.

1810
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,640
I don't know, it's pretty funny.

1811
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:20,520
All right, well, let's get into some plugs for the side shows that we do.

1812
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,440
Dark Soccer, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?

1813
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,000
Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.

1814
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,640
We actually, we publish on Tuesdays.

1815
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:35,160
We are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

1816
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:40,960
You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.

1817
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,500
We are awesome.

1818
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Listen to us.

1819
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,440
It's me, Maren, Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

1820
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:52,320
And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Hoard House

1821
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,320
in Azeroth.

1822
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:57,280
It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we

1823
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,760
talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.

1824
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,360
And it's available on iTunes, and there will be a real website coming soon.

1825
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:10,260
Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.

1826
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:13,160
And then your Twitter topics will be coming up, so this is your very last chance to get

1827
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,760
those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1828
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,640
Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?

1829
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,360
EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.

1830
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,360
That's sad.

1831
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:29,240
So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure, it's just a matter of when that time is and

1832
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,240
what we do with it.

1833
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:35,020
We have a small team on it, and I'm excited about what we'll do.

1834
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:37,200
I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.

1835
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:43,840
Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3, so I'm sure that's got a lot of time being

1836
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,600
utilized on that and resources.

1837
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:53,760
I'm sure there'll be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.

1838
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,560
And of course EA responded a little bit about it as well.

1839
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,640
They're saying that Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.

1840
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:12,800
Of course, DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3, nothing further to announce.

1841
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,360
Maybe down the line.

1842
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,920
It was a pretty fun game though, so hopefully there'll be a sequel.

1843
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,840
One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out in the PlayStation 1 classics.

1844
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:27,600
My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.

1845
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,600
Finally making its way out.

1846
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:33,640
Of course, no JOGCON support, that's kind of sad.

1847
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,840
You will be able to play the game though, very soon though, on the PSP and the PlayStation

1848
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,080
3.

1849
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:46,020
And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge

1850
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,880
Racer Unbounds is coming out, so that's kind of neat.

1851
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:55,760
No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.

1852
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:05,180
March, so probably around the time that the 3D versions come out, neat.

1853
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:09,240
And then last but not least, Activision kind of lied a little bit saying that there wasn't

1854
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:16,720
going to be any more download content for DJ Hero, however, DJ Hero 2 did get one last

1855
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,920
little bit of DLC, and it's Pendulum, and it's awesome.

1856
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:26,120
So the Pendulum Mix Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me on Fire, and Salt in the Wounds, that

1857
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:31,560
is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.

1858
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:37,240
And of course the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft

1859
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,240
points each.

1860
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:43,400
I am a little disappointed that they didn't have a whole color or self versus self, my

1861
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,680
two favorite songs on there.

1862
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:46,280
But hey, whatever, it's pretty cool.

1863
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:51,360
So definitely check that out, since that's the last content you're getting.

1864
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:57,480
So since last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed, is it safe to

1865
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,000
say that DJ Hero is being...

1866
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yes.

1867
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Okay.

1868
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:04,720
Because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release,

1869
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,720
I just sort of...

1870
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,720
Okay, so...

1871
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,640
Yeah, as of right now it is.

1872
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,500
I mean, who knows, they could always change their mind.

1873
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:16,240
Just because they say, oh, we're never going to do it again, doesn't mean anything.

1874
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:19,920
All right, let's do a couple of other stories here.

1875
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,460
One of these is very interesting, speaking of the whole Guitar Hero thing.

1876
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:27,280
The former CEO of Red Octane, who you might remember kind of started the whole Guitar

1877
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,320
Hero thing in the first place before they got bought by Activision.

1878
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:36,080
Kelly Summer is his name, he was the CEO at one time of Red Octane, basically says that

1879
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,160
Activision abused the property.

1880
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:41,620
Quote, Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly.

1881
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,880
They abused it.

1882
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,240
There's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue.

1883
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:46,460
It's a great product.

1884
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:50,320
My gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero.

1885
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,840
Not every game can be a billion dollar franchise, but maybe that's what Activision wants.

1886
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,280
I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still

1887
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,060
a market for this product, and then show them up.

1888
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:04,600
Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.

1889
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,680
They haven't thrown products out there, they've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still

1890
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,080
a strong franchise.

1891
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,240
Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.

1892
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:17,760
I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong

1893
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,880
with just putting out one game every couple, or even three or four years.

1894
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,560
If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual

1895
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:30,280
SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around I think.

1896
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,480
I think so too.

1897
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:37,160
I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining,

1898
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:38,280
it is now out.

1899
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:43,460
It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate, and that is available for you to download

1900
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:48,040
on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.

1901
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:52,360
The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what, it's free, and so if they

1902
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,220
need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.

1903
01:41:56,220 --> 01:42:01,000
You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes,

1904
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,360
but if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.

1905
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:10,320
You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.

1906
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:14,640
I guess nothing is really for free, but hey, you know, I don't know about you guys, but

1907
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:20,200
I have an email address that I sign up for everything with that's not my regular email.

1908
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,600
We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretelbot pack is now out for Little

1909
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,160
Big Planet 2, so that is out there.

1910
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:34,700
I guess there's this whole full story, cut scenes, voice acting, original score, prizes

1911
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:37,220
to get, it's all available out there.

1912
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:44,720
There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way, oh I'm sorry, it actually came out last

1913
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:50,080
Monday, oops, but they do have a variety of fixes, it sounds like mostly bug fixes, no

1914
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:58,320
like huge changes, but there is a more, they say a more accessible reset pod option.

1915
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:02,360
If your pod gets broken for whatever reason, you can pause the game, go to the settings

1916
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:09,200
menu and select reset pod decoration, so that's kind of a new feature that is available.

1917
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,760
DarkSakura.

1918
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:19,320
Well, and this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.

1919
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:30,960
Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch, ooh, it is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes, it will

1920
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:38,240
have, you can start to monitor your B-Spec races from a browser, even if you're not home

1921
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,840
and use your AI tweaks and do different stuff, because Dan was really getting pissed off

1922
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:50,240
at B-Spec, and there's multi-monitor set up now, you can actually go up to 5 monitors.

1923
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:56,380
So Dan the other day was talking about needing 4 more PS3's and monitors and I said, no,

1924
01:43:56,380 --> 01:44:01,320
you spent $150 on your driving rig plus a little bit extra getting those seats from

1925
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:07,760
the pick and pull, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.

1926
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:13,600
That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the 5 monitors.

1927
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,800
It already had 3 monitors, well there's actually a YouTube app of someone playing 5 monitor,

1928
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:24,440
5 monitor, duh duh duh duh duh, it was pretty hot actually, but I'm like, no, don't need

1929
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,440
it.

1930
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:32,960
So, Billy Mitchell, he's such a jerk, he just needs to go back to selling his damn BBQ sauce.

1931
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,400
But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade, and it's at the Orlando International

1932
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:48,120
Airport, and it looks very Donkey Kong-ish, but there's no Donkey Kong machine in there.

1933
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:51,560
Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score, because Steve Weeby was still

1934
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:52,560
better.

1935
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,160
And don't forget there's a third guy now, there's the dentist Hank Shen.

1936
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,440
And you know what else is funny too, apparently that arcade's been there for a while, they

1937
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,360
just keep rebranding it as something else.

1938
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,360
Yeah.

1939
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:09,040
Well, now we have Step Mania without a pad.

1940
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,680
It's a Kinect hack, yay.

1941
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:19,520
So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the

1942
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,520
pad.

1943
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:24,520
So you can play where you are, I guess.

1944
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:27,640
I'd have to see this in motion, there's a video of it.

1945
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:30,480
You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania.

1946
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,480
I guess.

1947
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,120
Good times.

1948
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,120
So yeah, that's it.

1949
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:43,480
Is, I don't know, is this what people find fun on Kinect hacking, Step Mania?

1950
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:49,520
Step Mania thing though, they really only had it working on like the easy beginner mode

1951
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:55,080
or whatever, I don't know if it would work for like some more difficult modes where you're

1952
01:45:55,080 --> 01:46:00,440
not just put my, you know, put my leg out this way, put my leg out that way.

1953
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:05,280
It's an interesting concept, they'd really have to do a lot more to make it work in practical

1954
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,280
use, right?

1955
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,280
Yeah.

1956
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,360
Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.

1957
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:16,760
Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we read your tweets here

1958
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,600
on the show, and respond to them as appropriate.

1959
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,600
Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight, we're going to start off with Blue

1960
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:29,960
Swim tonight tweets us, did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?

1961
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:32,160
Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?

1962
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,080
I think you know where this is going.

1963
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,440
Uh, no.

1964
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,840
We actually did watch it today and I have a word for the race, Rob.

1965
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:40,840
Lester Fogg.

1966
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:43,840
It's just crash after crash.

1967
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,200
Seriously, that's what it was, because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating

1968
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,320
the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance.

1969
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:55,320
Yeah, but it was great though because they literally, it was like one of those things

1970
01:46:55,320 --> 01:47:00,040
you totally jinxed the race, you know, they're all, now we've seen some pretty good driving

1971
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,680
today, all of a sudden, crash.

1972
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:07,360
Like right, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?

1973
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,240
And then it was won by the 20 year old guy.

1974
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:17,520
It was like, well with 50 laps down, there were like six cautions already.

1975
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,560
I didn't even know it was on today.

1976
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,640
Dan was watching it because it was the Daytona 500.

1977
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,760
It was on TV when I was visiting my mom's house.

1978
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,640
He likes that car stuff anyway, obviously he has a whole set up.

1979
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:33,040
But the thing that got me was that it was won by a guy who turned 25 days ago.

1980
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,240
And he must be a very driven young man.

1981
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:40,720
Now, is the Daytona 500, is that Formula One?

1982
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:41,720
That's the stock car.

1983
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:42,720
Stock, okay.

1984
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,720
It's NASCAR.

1985
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:44,720
NASCAR, okay.

1986
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:50,280
But I still think that's pretty impressive, but it's just because he was being smart and

1987
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,560
everybody else is like, oh, follow this guy, huh?

1988
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:54,560
So.

1989
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,000
All right, moving on to some other tweets.

1990
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
This is Chio 100.

1991
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Matt says there's a couple stories.

1992
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,480
I guess this is some big news out of New York City.

1993
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:05,760
The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.

1994
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,080
And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.

1995
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,920
Let's see.

1996
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,120
Several places are reporting, this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.

1997
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,520
Several places are reporting the Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one

1998
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:24,120
of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.

1999
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:30,200
Let's see, according to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being

2000
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,200
in business and will be closing on the 23rd.

2001
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,720
Not sure if that's this month or next month.

2002
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:40,640
So wow, that's crazy though, because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting

2003
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,640
down over here.

2004
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:46,320
So that's really sad that, you know, you have the west coast and the east coast, big arcades,

2005
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,640
just bam, bam, shutting down.

2006
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,040
I'd heard about that arcade before.

2007
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:53,320
I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some

2008
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,320
of the games.

2009
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,320
So, sad to hear it.

2010
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,600
That's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too.

2011
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,780
Weird.

2012
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:03,960
Just sad for arcades in general.

2013
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,360
This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.

2014
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,880
I guess they didn't have enough ticket spinning machines.

2015
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,120
Well, it's just they, you know, they're not a draw for that, you know, shopping center

2016
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:17,120
or whatever.

2017
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,720
So they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center

2018
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:26,240
so they go spend money at those stores or so people want to put stores in those shopping

2019
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,240
centers.

2020
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:28,240
All right.

2021
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:29,240
Tiger Claw says this is a tweet.

2022
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:33,080
Can a controller be programmed to speed run Super Mario Brothers?

2023
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:34,080
Interesting.

2024
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:39,200
Um, it is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey

2025
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,200
website thingy.

2026
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,200
They gotta know.

2027
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,200
CA.Kotaku.com.

2028
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,120
Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?

2029
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:48,440
No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.

2030
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:49,440
So it's the old format.

2031
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,440
All right.

2032
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,440
Well, apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will

2033
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:58,560
auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five

2034
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,560
minutes.

2035
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:03,720
Uh, they are saying that the mod is real, even though some people were calling it a

2036
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,720
fake.

2037
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:09,000
I mean, I get, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could

2038
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,920
plug this in and say, Hey guys, look what I can do.

2039
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,760
And then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically and it's actually doing the

2040
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:16,840
speed run for you.

2041
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,200
Like is, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?

2042
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:23,600
I think that it's just because, Hey, let's see if we can do this as basically.

2043
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:24,600
Or that.

2044
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,600
Or that.

2045
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,720
Uh, Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say, I've been a member of OLR since

2046
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,720
2002.

2047
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:31,720
Thanks for the awesome show guys.

2048
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,720
Wow.

2049
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:33,720
That's a very long time.

2050
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,200
Thank you for listening that long.

2051
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:40,120
Uh, we have a couple people tweeting us about this, so, uh, I should read this.

2052
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:44,880
Both Defective Candy and Tiger Claw tweeted us this story and it's about Mexico State

2053
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:48,340
Congress asks for a ban of a video game.

2054
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,840
It's Call of Juarez, the cartel.

2055
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,680
And uh, this is because, you know, there's a lot of violence unfortunately going on in

2056
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:55,720
Mexico right now.

2057
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:57,680
You've probably heard the stories in the news and so forth.

2058
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,640
It's especially bad like right around the border.

2059
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:03,360
Well, apparently, uh, federal authorities, uh, in Mexico want to ban the game Call of

2060
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:08,560
Juarez, the cartel, because it is based on drug cartel shootouts in, uh, Ciudad Juarez.

2061
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,360
Um, what do you guys think?

2062
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:16,920
It's just a video game, wham, or yeah, this maybe hits a little too close to home.

2063
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:22,360
I wouldn't even bother with it because Call of Juarez doesn't sell that well, so yeah,

2064
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:28,560
it sucks it's coming out, but not a lot of people are going to take notice.

2065
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,160
Yeah, I, uh, I kind of agree it's not that big of a game.

2066
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,160
Yeah.

2067
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:39,360
I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.

2068
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,880
You know, and also, and we hear from some, we have some listeners that live in Mexico

2069
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:48,360
and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries

2070
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:54,320
anyway because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always

2071
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:58,640
kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something

2072
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,920
that does hit a little close to home.

2073
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,420
One more tweet here from Dark Tetsuya, who tweets us saying, so it's a couple months

2074
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:09,080
till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.

2075
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:13,560
I forgot WonderCon is coming up, that's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?

2076
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:14,840
April 1st through the 3rd?

2077
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,280
Yes, sorry, I was yawning.

2078
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh, that's alright, it's second only to Comic-Con, right?

2079
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Yeah.

2080
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,120
So there might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long

2081
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:26,760
after Game Developers Conference before E3, you never know, sometimes we see some game

2082
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:27,760
announcements.

2083
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,140
It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.

2084
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:34,200
I'm used to it being like usually, you said it was in April?

2085
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,560
April 1st through 3rd.

2086
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:39,880
Because usually it's like, usually it's around this time, to be honest, February, Moscone

2087
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,520
Center are nearby, so they must have bumped it out a little.

2088
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,040
That's going to do it for Twitter this week.

2089
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:50,720
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.

2090
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:53,520
Let's move on with some more news.

2091
01:52:53,520 --> 01:53:02,080
Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking

2092
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,520
the PlayStation 3.

2093
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,840
Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak, of course,

2094
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:10,440
multiple jailbreaks at this point.

2095
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:17,280
Of course, the PlayStation blog post warns users, notice unauthorized circumvention devices

2096
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,240
for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.

2097
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:25,600
These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.

2098
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:31,400
Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system software license

2099
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:39,480
agreement for the PlayStation 3 system and code of conduct provisions.

2100
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,120
Contribution of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates

2101
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:46,780
the consumer's guarantee for that system.

2102
01:53:46,780 --> 01:53:51,480
In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright

2103
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,920
laws.

2104
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:57,640
Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access

2105
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:06,320
to the PlayStation Network and access to curiosity through services through PlayStation 3 or

2106
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,600
system terminated permanently.

2107
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:14,760
To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices

2108
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:20,760
and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.

2109
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:27,020
Now on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent

2110
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:34,480
emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop, you know, stop using this modified

2111
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:42,240
software, change your ways or else you can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.

2112
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:47,200
You know, that's basically just saying obviously that they don't want people doing that.

2113
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,480
Or they'll ban you.

2114
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:57,080
Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there, a new hack

2115
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:01,820
that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.

2116
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:04,600
The hack can also be used to ban another console.

2117
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:09,360
All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a

2118
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:19,540
refurb warehouse or secondhand seller or some idiot that is willing to give up that information.

2119
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:20,540
And it's kind of funny.

2120
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:27,000
And then finally, Geo Hot or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony,

2121
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.

2122
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,320
And that what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?

2123
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,480
Yeah, but this is not for him.

2124
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:41,360
It's going strictly to his, he got his lawyers okay for it.

2125
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,280
So it must be all right.

2126
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:46,080
It says donations here are for legal defense only.

2127
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,320
I've checked my lawyers before setting this up.

2128
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:53,840
If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.

2129
01:55:53,840 --> 01:56:01,320
And basically he says Sony is, they're bullies, they don't care what you did was legal, they

2130
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,840
don't like it, so they sue.

2131
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:12,400
And I guess they try to sue a guy for getting his Ivo to run non-Sony approved tricks, making

2132
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:17,760
it apparent that they don't really care about privacy if they care about control.

2133
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:24,160
And they also says Sony versus Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about

2134
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:25,160
that.

2135
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:28,400
And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's a navigate against mass piracy, he does

2136
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:32,880
not distribute any copyrighted work by his own, and he says he's not gonna take this

2137
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:39,520
crap laying down, and he's even pro DRM in a sense.

2138
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:44,960
Then he says, why should I care about personal, or your personal legal troubles?

2139
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:45,960
You shouldn't.

2140
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:51,480
And, you know, he says if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never

2141
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,000
ask for donations.

2142
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,840
I see what that's a dig at, yeah.

2143
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:00,960
Let's see here.

2144
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:04,920
Well let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there, you

2145
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:08,680
know, I don't want to beat this issue to death, it's come up on almost every episode for the

2146
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:14,800
past few weeks about this whole issue, but it does seem that this is moving faster in

2147
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,580
a legal sense than these types of stories usually do, because I'm about to get into

2148
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:23,160
another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year

2149
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,160
now.

2150
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:27,200
Well you've got enough money, you can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.

2151
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,200
You know, that's kind of the worry.

2152
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,640
And he says, his thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?

2153
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:37,880
It says let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology

2154
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:41,320
on the Playstation blog for forever removing it.

2155
01:57:41,320 --> 01:57:44,120
It'd be good PR for Sony and lord knows they could use it.

2156
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:47,000
And I want an eyebo.

2157
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,120
Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.

2158
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:56,200
Those batteries are fickle as shit.

2159
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,200
See here.

2160
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:02,080
It says don't need to help you, you're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.

2161
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,080
No I'm not.

2162
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:10,240
Kakaroto explains this really well, it says I have never played the PS3 online ever and

2163
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:14,920
frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.

2164
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,520
Security 101 is why, why is the security in the client anyways?

2165
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,560
I had no idea this would happen, I am in full support of the cheaters being perm-banned

2166
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,600
from the Playstation network.

2167
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:32,320
So long story short, basically he needs money and obviously he feels that he did nothing

2168
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:39,540
wrong and he very well may have done nothing wrong, it's just Sony owns your system according

2169
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:45,360
to them and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that

2170
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:46,880
you purchased.

2171
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:52,760
And really the stuff that he did, he didn't enable piracy, he just enabled to run homebrew

2172
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:53,760
code on there.

2173
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,600
Other people created apps to create piracy.

2174
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:57,600
It's nothing he did.

2175
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:03,400
Granted, that's just like saying oh well, if he invented the gun, well he created murder.

2176
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,720
I mean that doesn't really work that way.

2177
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:09,480
Yeah he may have created something that could have led to something else but he wasn't that

2178
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:12,880
person that initiated that something else, I guess.

2179
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:17,440
Let me get to this comment from chat, I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's

2180
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:21,920
get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week, however,

2181
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,160
I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Muster in the chat room, whatever happened

2182
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:29,400
when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key

2183
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,680
gen toons as their only signature?

2184
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:35,360
Some of those toons were actually pretty good too.

2185
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:40,200
There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff, a lot of people want fame and

2186
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:46,800
I think once he hacked the iPod and IOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff and that whole

2187
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:52,400
thing became kind of legal now, I think it's gone to his head a little bit.

2188
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,680
Oh well, let's crack the uncrackable type of thing.

2189
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:59,080
But I don't know, I don't know.

2190
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:02,560
Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.

2191
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,800
This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides

2192
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,460
in this case, I don't know.

2193
02:00:07,460 --> 02:00:13,960
But this is about, remember this, No Doubt versus Guitar Hero, or should I say Band Hero

2194
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:16,480
specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.

2195
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:19,240
No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.

2196
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:25,000
Well according to a recent report in the LA Times, a panel of judges has agreed with a

2197
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,460
lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit

2198
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:37,160
by No Doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember

2199
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:42,160
they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because

2200
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:46,120
Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from Taylor Swift and stuff.

2201
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:50,920
It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do flava

2202
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:52,300
flave or whatever.

2203
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:58,240
Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain

2204
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:03,280
why Guitar Hero went really wrong and it's not the lawsuits.

2205
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,600
I'm not saying that.

2206
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:12,760
I'm saying that this whole lack of care for the material.

2207
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:17,760
I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they

2208
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,200
created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the

2209
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,600
fine print or whatever.

2210
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:28,360
They thought, they assumed that something was going to happen with their characters

2211
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,400
only singing their own songs and stuff like that.

2212
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:37,240
But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists

2213
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,240
in their games.

2214
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:43,100
I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.

2215
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,120
It's your own created characters.

2216
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:47,400
Why do you even need these in there?

2217
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,760
That's more my point actually was kind of what I was getting at.

2218
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:53,960
And it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time.

2219
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,520
I think the first time we went over the story, I probably had said something like, you know,

2220
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,080
well, they should have probably read the fine print, but now looking back on how Guitar

2221
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:06,320
Hero has essentially failed at this point, you kind of go, well, maybe this really isn't

2222
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:10,040
what the game should have been doing in the first place.

2223
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:14,280
No Doubt and Courtney Love, I'm sure, are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever

2224
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:18,220
their image and their license is involved.

2225
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:22,120
So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the

2226
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:27,360
same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when

2227
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,460
they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists?

2228
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:34,520
Like I don't know.

2229
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,840
Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.

2230
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,840
Perhaps, perhaps.

2231
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:38,840
Yeah.

2232
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,680
Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?

2233
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:43,280
I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.

2234
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,200
She's got paternity ones.

2235
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:46,520
She fights with her kid all the time.

2236
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:51,500
She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems, you know, gosh.

2237
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:55,320
Even she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.

2238
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,720
The lawyer for her Twitter feed.

2239
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:01,160
They should make a Pokemon style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.

2240
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,360
Gotta catch them all.

2241
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,520
Real estate attorney, I choose you.

2242
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:10,240
Protect my house.

2243
02:03:10,240 --> 02:03:12,160
Contracting lawyer, I choose you.

2244
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:14,680
Fix my air conditioning.

2245
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:16,880
I love it.

2246
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:18,680
A Pokemon game based around lawyers.

2247
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,320
I think we're onto something.

2248
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,760
For now though, how about another news story?

2249
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:24,240
Gotta sue them all.

2250
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:26,800
Well, I like Sega.

2251
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,880
I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega or at least something Sega's done.

2252
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:30,880
Me.

2253
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:31,880
I hate them.

2254
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,700
Bite my butt.

2255
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:39,440
So there is going to be for the PCs Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.

2256
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:47,360
That's 46 of the Sega Genesis' games and it will be out on March 15th.

2257
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:53,680
Sorry, for the list, we have volume one which has a bunch of stuff and two and three and

2258
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,680
four.

2259
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:56,520
No, seriously, I'll run through the list.

2260
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:00,160
There's Golden Axe, Ultra Beast, Comic Zone, Echo the Dolphin, Gang Ground, Shinobi 3,

2261
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:03,880
Return of the Ninja Master, Vector Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crackdown, and Space Harrier

2262
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,880
2.

2263
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:07,880
Volume two, Echo Junior, Fatal Labyrinth, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Bonanza

2264
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:12,880
Brothers, Super Thunder Blade, Eastwet City Under Siege, Kid Chameleon, Rice Star, Golden

2265
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:15,640
Axe 2, Galaxy Force 2 columns, Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

2266
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:19,080
Volume three, Biohazard Battle Columns 3, Revenge of Columns, Sword of Vermillion, Virtua

2267
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:23,600

2268
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:24,600

2269
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:28,240
And volume four, Landstalker, Shining Force, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair, Dr. Robotnik's

2270
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:32,440

2271
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:36,920
Light Crusader, Sonic 3D, Blast Gunstar Heroes, whoo hoo, Shining Force 2, Shining in the

2272
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:41,880
Darkness, Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl, and Panic on Funkatron.

2273
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,880
Micro Machines.

2274
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,880
Seriously.

2275
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:44,880
Dang.

2276
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:45,880
All right.

2277
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:51,120
I like Micro Machines, they don't make enough games based on them.

2278
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:52,520
John Machine is dead.

2279
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,520
Here's the thing though.

2280
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,480
That's because he talked too fast, he got all the words out that you could possibly

2281
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,360
say in his lifetime.

2282
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:02,040
As nice as that collection sounds, I don't know.

2283
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:06,000
This Genesis nostalgia, I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth.

2284
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,680
Aren't you starting to get to that point?

2285
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:12,480
Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever, I don't think, you really don't

2286
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,520
need much more than that.

2287
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:15,520
As far as Genesis nostalgia goes.

2288
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:22,240
It's not one of our stories that was for tonight, but the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus,

2289
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:27,620
wherever, they were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March.

2290
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:33,280
They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs

2291
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:37,240
for one to three bucks a piece, and there's a lot of them up there now, and it's like,

2292
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:41,760
this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks, sure, you got some money to burn, pick up

2293
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,880
a few, you know, Phantasy Star 2, but it's like, alright, how many of these are they

2294
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:45,880
gonna put out?

2295
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:49,960
This is gonna run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.

2296
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:54,680
Well they've got full packs out, you can download different packs of the games, but it's like,

2297
02:05:54,680 --> 02:06:01,240
in my case it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis, so if I really wanna play it,

2298
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:06,800
I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.

2299
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,840
Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.

2300
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:16,680
And honestly, I mean, technically it's piracy, but I mean, seriously, there's tons of free

2301
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:23,960
ROMs out there, I mean, you can download an emulator and a bunch of ROMs in minutes, and

2302
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:29,520
I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.

2303
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:35,360
I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things, I mean, dozens and dozens

2304
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:41,920
and dozens of times, and I just, I don't feel any remorse for, you know, downloading a ROM

2305
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:46,120
that's, you know, twenty years old.

2306
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:52,040
Alright, well, let's move on with another story, and we'll get to the mailbag pretty

2307
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:53,040
soon here.

2308
02:06:53,040 --> 02:07:00,520
Well, you know, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but

2309
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:02,840
that does not mean that the music genre is dead.

2310
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:08,920
Oh no, Dance Games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.

2311
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:16,460
They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in, I guess, 809 million dollars

2312
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:27,040
in total software sales, up 21% from 2009, and 60% of that, of course, was in North America.

2313
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:34,720
Of course, during the three month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their

2314
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:40,120
dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience,

2315
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:47,280
or Just Dance, Michael Jackson, and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway, all pretty

2316
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:49,440
similar titles.

2317
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:53,320
That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that, and I can't believe

2318
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:59,280
how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii, it's just kind of crazy.

2319
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:04,880
Of course, next month, Just Dance on, or, let's see, I caught myself saying that, Dance

2320
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:11,400
on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with move support, or actually, move required

2321
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,160
I guess, so, be interesting.

2322
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:16,280
I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?

2323
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:19,040
No, no I do not.

2324
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:23,320
There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii, and this

2325
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:33,680
is gonna add, I guess, some new duet choreography, and for 300 Wii points, you can download Y.O.Y.

2326
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:42,000
by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.

2327
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,160
So that's neat.

2328
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:48,200
Didn't realize that the game actually had DLC.

2329
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:52,640
Another game, not necessarily an Ubisoft Dance title, but Dance Central is getting some more

2330
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:59,080
download content, not quite as frequent as Rock Band, but at least they're getting some.

2331
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:06,640
The Double Freak DLC came out this week, and with that, of course, Super Freak by Rick

2332
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:13,160
James, and Sheik's Le Freak, both out this week.

2333
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:22,240
Also of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amaury, Heardemall.

2334
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:24,240
Those are each $3.

2335
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:26,240
Alright.

2336
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:31,240
Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.

2337
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,800
People like to shake their butts.

2338
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:36,920
Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games

2339
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:38,200
are dead, and it's like, oh wait, another dance game.

2340
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:44,200
I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision,

2341
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:51,200
because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping

2342
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:53,320
on that bandwagon.

2343
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,880
Alright.

2344
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:58,960
There's some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.

2345
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,400
There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move,

2346
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:07,120
but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal

2347
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:10,880
2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.

2348
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:15,880
It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation

2349
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:18,200
blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.

2350
02:10:18,200 --> 02:10:21,320
But it should be noted that there was this cute little Valentine's video that came out

2351
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:22,920
for Portal 2.

2352
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,920
It's kind of funny, it's out there on YouTube if you check it out, Portal 2, Valentine's,

2353
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,920
or something like that.

2354
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,520
It's something as salacious as pop.

2355
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,600
It's the Aperture Science Employee Guide on romantic relationships at the workplace.

2356
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:34,880
That sounds like, it's fantastic, I have to see that.

2357
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,720
It's really funny and it's worth a look.

2358
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:41,120
And basically at the end of the day, they announced, Portal 2 is available for pre-order

2359
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:42,120
now.

2360
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,680
And I was kind of like, well duh.

2361
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:47,160
I mean, like if you want to go into GameStop, they'll take your five bucks to pre-order

2362
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,160
Portal 5.

2363
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:52,280
I mean, you know, it seems a little weird that they'd announce that, but maybe through

2364
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:56,160
the official Valve channels or what have you, it's available now.

2365
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:59,480
I don't really know, so.

2366
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,480
There you go.

2367
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:06,400
Portal 2 coming out soon, and I know I'm excited about it, I can't wait for that to come out.

2368
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,680
Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag.

2369
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:12,920
Alright, we're going to go to the mailbag, you guys send us emails, we answer them here

2370
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,360
on the show.

2371
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:18,360
Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emailbag and find some of her favorite emails to respond

2372
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:21,760
to right now.

2373
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,320
I was just taking care of some business.

2374
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:28,560
No problem.

2375
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:31,160
So first email, we actually got three.

2376
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:36,080
We have one, it says, Greetings, OLR, this is my second email of the week.

2377
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:37,080
Quick question.

2378
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:40,800
I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.

2379
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:42,000
What is going on here?

2380
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,080
Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their

2381
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:46,080
games?

2382
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:50,800
I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing

2383
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:53,080
to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.

2384
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:58,000
Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.

2385
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,620
I'm sorry, I missed something about the...

2386
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:04,320
With Crysis 2 and Black Ops and those games being $60, why are they raising their prices,

2387
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:07,360
you know, when more people are going to hold out for sales?

2388
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:12,880
Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about

2389
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,480
a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.

2390
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,080
Huge sale on Steam this weekend.

2391
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:25,240
I was going to say, how long have those games been out, because Bulletstorm is new, right?

2392
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:30,160
Yeah, Bulletstorm's brand new, but I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have

2393
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:33,040
crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.

2394
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:39,840
Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA,

2395
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:46,120
Activision, have decided, hey, you know what, Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it

2396
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:49,600
warrants a $60 price point.

2397
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:54,200
Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on

2398
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,200
the Wii.

2399
02:12:55,200 --> 02:13:00,500
They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics

2400
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:05,200
and support on the download side, so, eh.

2401
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:09,480
Yeah, I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers, are just going to have

2402
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:16,320
their MSRP, $59.99, they don't care what platform, even on a digital service like Steam, where

2403
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:20,080
it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved, they'll just set their

2404
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:24,120
price to whatever they want, keep it uniform.

2405
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:28,800
Yeah, I can see where the emailer's probably getting a little bit frustrated, though, that

2406
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,720
you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later, but, eh, what can you

2407
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,720
do?

2408
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:34,720
Alright.

2409
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:37,680
Let's, let's go on to the next email.

2410
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:43,760
Okay, the next email up is this one, hi, LLR, I don't have much to say this week, I'm moving

2411
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:47,920
to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic, but I suppose I should make this at least a bit

2412
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:51,160
game related, so what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?

2413
02:13:51,160 --> 02:13:54,840
Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.

2414
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,040
On a side note, can I plug my new blog?

2415
02:13:58,040 --> 02:14:05,560
It's Moggy's Musings, M-O-G-G-Y-S-M-U-S-I-N-G-S dot blogspot dot com.

2416
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,880
So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.

2417
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:11,720
I think there was a really good tweet from that, or it's a really similar name that I

2418
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:15,200
liked, I had retweeted it on LLR.

2419
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,560
Since I kinda already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add,

2420
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:25,120
I think it's gonna be a nice pairing, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.

2421
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:29,080
Yeah, I wanna see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having a license.

2422
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:35,160
I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel shaded, but other than that,

2423
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,160
thumbs up.

2424
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:40,400
You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the

2425
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:48,640
original, but you kinda go, if anything's gonna be good, it'll be this, from the professional

2426
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:49,640
angle.

2427
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:52,840
I understand there's still the fan game, and of course the game is gonna be in good hands

2428
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:55,900
with fans, but, you know.

2429
02:14:55,900 --> 02:14:56,900
That's different.

2430
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:57,900
So.

2431
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:00,000
How about the next email?

2432
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,680
Yes, this is our last email of the night.

2433
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:03,680
Alrighty.

2434
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,560
I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.

2435
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,980
It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.

2436
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:12,840
One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7, where the author

2437
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:16,840
goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.

2438
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:20,200
Listen on the podcast every week, congrats on 400 eps, take care, Wendy.

2439
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:21,200
Thank you, Wendy.

2440
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,960
Hmm, are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?

2441
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:24,960
Maybe a cheap plug?

2442
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:25,960
I don't know.

2443
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:26,960
I'm just kidding.

2444
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:27,960
I'm kidding.

2445
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:28,960
Yeah.

2446
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:30,400
Well, I would definitely check out the book.

2447
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:36,520
I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse, so.

2448
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:40,420
As long as they're not mindlessly bashing on it, I'm curious, sure.

2449
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:44,080
I think there's definitely a whole little psychological angle to what goes on in World

2450
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:47,480
of Warcraft, so I'd be curious to check it out.

2451
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:51,520
All right, that's it for the mailbag, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send

2452
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,840
in your questions.

2453
02:15:52,840 --> 02:16:13,520
Meantime, we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

2454
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:22,000
My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.

2455
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:28,720
So fuck you to my headache, that's really it.

2456
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,720
Loki?

2457
02:16:29,720 --> 02:16:38,600
FU to McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.

2458
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:43,620
My FU of the week goes to being so sore, pain, hurts, ow.

2459
02:16:43,620 --> 02:16:47,880
My legs just, it hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday.

2460
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:51,320
Just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting

2461
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:52,320
or whatever.

2462
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,320
Careful.

2463
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:54,320
Slice just popped.

2464
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:55,320
Do you have any FUs?

2465
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:56,320
Any Yanks?

2466
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:03,080
Uh, FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department.

2467
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:05,240
All right.

2468
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,200
That does it for the FUs of the week.

2469
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:11,680
Let's move on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to

2470
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:15,080
the phone lines and I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.

2471
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:16,080
Loki?

2472
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,440
Uh, yes.

2473
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:19,540
This is kind of interesting, I guess.

2474
02:17:19,540 --> 02:17:25,960
They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.

2475
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:30,900
It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote, they were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices

2476
02:17:30,900 --> 02:17:41,320
and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360 type control and stuff.

2477
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:47,080
For example, they showed a Kinect demo where someone was playing the, I believe it was

2478
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:52,400
called Rally Ball, that's one of the Kinect Sport or Kinect Adventure games where you're

2479
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:56,600
bouncing balls off of your body and stuff like that.

2480
02:17:56,600 --> 02:18:00,200
Kind of like what they showed at E3 where you're just trying to hit targets.

2481
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:07,440
Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen

2482
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:11,920
that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls

2483
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,040
to aim at the player.

2484
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:18,800
So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect

2485
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,680
and Xbox 360.

2486
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:22,840
It's an interesting idea.

2487
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:27,000
I mean, if they can implement it, well.

2488
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Interesting.

2489
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,120
I guess that's all I can really say about that.

2490
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,440
Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what

2491
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:35,440
have you.

2492
02:18:35,440 --> 02:18:41,120
It would be neat, like, you know, they could do something even simple, like, you know,

2493
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:44,760
being able to level up your characters or something like that when you're not playing

2494
02:18:44,760 --> 02:18:45,760
the game.

2495
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:51,160
You know, toss stuff back and forth data.

2496
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:54,240
It always kind of reminds me for some reason of the PocketStation days.

2497
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:59,360
I don't know what it is, but kind of that whole, like, you have it on your TV and then

2498
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:02,640
you have it in your pocket and whatever else.

2499
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:04,640
I don't know.

2500
02:19:04,640 --> 02:19:07,360
I wonder where my PocketStation went.

2501
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:08,760
Did you actually own one of those?

2502
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:09,760
Yeah, I had one.

2503
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,520
Remember, I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop

2504
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,200
courses on the fly.

2505
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2506
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,200
I forgot the PocketStation.

2507
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,640
Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because I got, like, four songs versus

2508
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:28,440
three songs if I paid, you know, for the fourth mix stuff.

2509
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:33,320
So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you

2510
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:34,320
go.

2511
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:35,320
And plus my edits were on there.

2512
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:36,320
So that's fun.

2513
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,320
All right.

2514
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:41,080
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line tonight.

2515
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:44,640
And that is about a new announcement for a new coin-op game.

2516
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:45,640
This actually makes me very happy.

2517
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:49,320
I probably won't play a lot of the game, but I know I'm going to get that soundtrack right

2518
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:50,320
away.

2519
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,920
This is NAMCO NAMGAN Midnight Maximum Tune 4.

2520
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:56,360
NAMCO has unveiled a trailer and a website for this.

2521
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:00,160
And let's see if there's any cool little, like, techno-y music in the trailer.

2522
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:04,200
Of course there is.

2523
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:09,640
It's going to be awesome.

2524
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:14,640
I hope it's still used over the show and doing all the music.

2525
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:15,640
I'm sure it sounds like it.

2526
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:20,160
Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU

2527
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,160
in 2011.

2528
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:26,400
But Bandai Namco has unveiled a website for the game and it's coming out and they're saying

2529
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:31,480
it will be some time before you get to play it, but it will be the Wanggan Maxi of the

2530
02:20:31,480 --> 02:20:35,880
future and worth the wait.

2531
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:36,880
Whatever that means.

2532
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,840
I'm just excited for the soundtrack.

2533
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:40,760
It's been a while since they had a game, right?

2534
02:20:40,760 --> 02:20:41,760
Yeah.

2535
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:43,760
It has been a while.

2536
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:44,760
So.

2537
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:46,880
All right.

2538
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,440
Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?

2539
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:50,560
We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.

2540
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:56,040
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2541
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:59,480
So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.

2542
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:02,880
So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last

2543
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:03,880
minute stories tonight?

2544
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:04,880
Yeah, sure.

2545
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,880
We can talk about Pixel 4's Head to Head.

2546
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:12,840
It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, a guy that brought us all the 8-bit

2547
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:18,200
kind of, you know, Left 4 Deads, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.

2548
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:22,840
Well this one, they've got, you know, brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting

2549
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:29,480
game, including like, you know, I believe Ryu from, you know, Street Fighter's on there.

2550
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:36,880
They've got, you know, Wolverine from the Marvel games.

2551
02:21:36,880 --> 02:21:42,680
They've also got Scorpion, I believe, is in there, and 30 different characters you can

2552
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:43,680
play as.

2553
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,320
So that's kind of cool.

2554
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:48,440
I want to see if there's someone from like, Castlevania in there as well.

2555
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:50,520
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

2556
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:52,560
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?

2557
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:55,160
Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Rama.

2558
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:57,200
Hey Rama, what's on your mind?

2559
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:01,960
Not too much, I just got back from Cats of Con, but I didn't call to get my con review,

2560
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:04,480
but I have a question for all three of you.

2561
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:05,480
Sure, what's up?

2562
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:06,480
Okay.

2563
02:22:06,480 --> 02:22:12,560
Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console

2564
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:15,000
is the games for it, correct?

2565
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Yes.

2566
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,720
Alright, now I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy, and he's like, you're

2567
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:21,080
incorrect.

2568
02:22:21,080 --> 02:22:22,880
It's the marketing behind it.

2569
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:27,000
Now, even I find it hard to believe, because I feel that there have been games that have

2570
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,640
been marketed out like a cheap whore, and it still has failed to get the numbers.

2571
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:38,680
So, do you believe more of it's the games or the marketing, and if so, what games failed

2572
02:22:38,680 --> 02:22:43,160
on the marketing aspect?

2573
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:46,320
Where's that, what is that Namco game that came out just at the end of last year, that

2574
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:49,800
you brought up on the show like last month, and I was like, where was this game?

2575
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:50,800
This game was-

2576
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:51,800
Modun and the Forsaken Kingdom.

2577
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:54,200
Yes, that would be a good one, because that game looked kind of cool.

2578
02:22:54,200 --> 02:22:58,760
I had no idea a game like that even existed.

2579
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:03,440
To some extent, maybe Rock Band 3, if you want me to go for a bigger title, because

2580
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:05,680
I don't know, we just didn't see Rock Band.

2581
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:09,300
It wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles, and I don't know if that's just because

2582
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:15,200
people were over it, or what the deal is, but yeah, I'd have to say that.

2583
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:20,680
Okay, I agree with that, because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as

2584
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:25,200
I was anticipating it, and I turned around and I'm like, it's out?

2585
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,800
I really didn't see any advertising for it.

2586
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,840
Yeah, right?

2587
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:33,380
And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was

2588
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:36,280
heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.

2589
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:40,760
Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch 2, I thought we had a story

2590
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:43,000
last week, that game sold like a million copies or something.

2591
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,960
Might have been a second, because I thought the first one, there was a lot of advertising

2592
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:50,440
behind it, but I don't think, I'm not sure if it really did good or not.

2593
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:51,440
Yeah.

2594
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:55,040
It's kind of nice when game companies will take a second chance, though, on a game that,

2595
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:59,120
you know, doesn't maybe do so hot, but it still kind of deserves a sequel, so it gets

2596
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:00,120
one.

2597
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,800
For some reason, I can't think of anything right away, but I know there's been some in

2598
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:03,800
the past.

2599
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:08,280
It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge, you know, was kind of a popular game, at least

2600
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:14,440
I always thought, and it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would, so just kind of

2601
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:15,440
surprising.

2602
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:22,360
All right, but, so, I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good

2603
02:24:22,360 --> 02:24:29,660
as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console?

2604
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:32,040
I think marketing kind of goes a long way.

2605
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:39,600
I think that's probably why the Wii did so well, I think was kind of the way it was marketed,

2606
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:46,360
but I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either

2607
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:48,980
a good product or a bad product.

2608
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:54,040
And what I mean by that is that, you know, you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty

2609
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:58,360
bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale, but at the end of the day, a turd is still

2610
02:24:58,360 --> 02:24:59,360
a turd.

2611
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:01,760
I've heard that plenty of times.

2612
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:07,960
I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business, and it

2613
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:15,200
just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say, it stinks, and could cause

2614
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,880
a possible chain reaction?

2615
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:21,600
Um, perhaps.

2616
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:23,640
Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.

2617
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:28,040
The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system is only as good as the games

2618
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:31,620
that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch

2619
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:32,620
titles.

2620
02:25:32,620 --> 02:25:33,620
Does this make me a giant hypocrite?

2621
02:25:33,620 --> 02:25:35,620
No, not necessarily.

2622
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:38,120
I think you kind of fall in love with me.

2623
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:45,280
You feel your inner child, because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?

2624
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:50,960
I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA, and I still haven't finished it yet.

2625
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:56,400
When I first got it, I knocked that game out in about five weeks.

2626
02:25:56,400 --> 02:25:59,160
I gotta tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.

2627
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:03,800
I actually, actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and

2628
02:26:03,800 --> 02:26:05,600
looking at the 3D pictures.

2629
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:07,840
Like I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.

2630
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,520
I think that's going to be kind of awesome.

2631
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:13,040
Just to kind of show it off, too, you know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures, and I'm

2632
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:18,040
hoping Nintendo does the smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way

2633
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:19,440
we can do that.

2634
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,440
Perhaps.

2635
02:26:20,440 --> 02:26:21,440
Perhaps.

2636
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:26,880
Plus, also, I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.

2637
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:27,880
Yeah.

2638
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:28,880
So.

2639
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:29,880
All right.

2640
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:30,880
Well, anything else on your mind, Rama?

2641
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:31,880
No, that's it.

2642
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:32,880
All right.

2643
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:33,880
Well, take care, Rama.

2644
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:34,880
Have a good one.

2645
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,880
Thanks for the call.

2646
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:36,880
You, too.

2647
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:37,880
Enjoy.

2648
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:38,880
Later.

2649
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:39,880
Bye.

2650
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:40,880
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio, if you want to give us

2651
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,880
a call.

2652
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:46,880
Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.

2653
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,240
Yeah, I'll take it.

2654
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:52,240
It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.

2655
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:53,240
So.

2656
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:54,240
All right.

2657
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:56,600
Any other last minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?

2658
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:58,680
Yeah, one last one here.

2659
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:04,320
There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.

2660
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:08,080
It is a game called PPPPPPPPPPP.

2661
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:11,920
Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.

2662
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,480
Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

2663
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:15,080
I thought you were saying PPPPPP.

2664
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:16,080
No.

2665
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:17,080
I was like...

2666
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,280
That's the full name of the game, yes.

2667
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:20,760
Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

2668
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:25,080
But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Peace.

2669
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:30,860
Anyways, so it is a game that's played with a vocal input and

2670
02:27:31,700 --> 02:27:36,020
You can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic

2671
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:41,820
The title is co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises

2672
02:27:42,020 --> 02:27:44,020
like pew pew pew pew pew pew

2673
02:27:44,020 --> 02:27:53,560
And they have got to love the indie marketplace they have a trailer for it too, which people are playing it

2674
02:27:59,540 --> 02:28:03,780
Is it is it is there video is that like real video yeah, it looks like

2675
02:28:03,780 --> 02:28:10,780
It looks we can't hear any of that I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to the technokitten adventure

2676
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:19,780
I mean basically there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks

2677
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:26,780
And then you scream into it to like cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks

2678
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:30,780
Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future

2679
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:33,780
Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future

2680
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:37,780
Let's go to another call higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2681
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:40,780
Hi, this is gamer girl. Hi gamer girl. What's on your mind?

2682
02:28:40,780 --> 02:28:44,780
Um nothing much. Have you guys um played the game?

2683
02:28:48,780 --> 02:28:53,780
There's a game called Assassin's Creed like legacy on Facebook

2684
02:28:53,780 --> 02:28:57,780
No, I have not played the Facebook game. I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games

2685
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:03,780
What's the what's what's the Facebook game all about? Um, it's kind of like Knights of the clicky. It's pretty cool

2686
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:10,780
Yeah, yeah. Um, I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the clicky. It's pretty fun

2687
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:16,780
Is it one of those games where it's really easy to spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff? Yeah, it's pretty cool

2688
02:29:16,780 --> 02:29:22,780
Yeah, yeah. Do you what do you what do you think of Facebook games? Do you think it really is the wave of the future or?

2689
02:29:22,780 --> 02:29:28,780
Um, it's kind of addicting actually. Yeah, if you if you're not careful

2690
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:32,780
You can kind of get like addicted to it. Mm-hmm

2691
02:29:32,780 --> 02:29:38,780
Yeah, I I was playing that Knights of the clicky game, which is so ridiculous for a while

2692
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:43,780
And I don't know one day I just kind of stopped is now kind of ran out of steam with me to see with you

2693
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:48,780
I haven't touched it in ages. I haven't touched it in like two weeks. I just I just finally gave up

2694
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:53,780
I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore. Do you find do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?

2695
02:29:53,780 --> 02:30:00,780
Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy

2696
02:30:00,780 --> 02:30:05,780
Um when I was moving around I looked in the case and it was actually cracked

2697
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:11,780
So so so how did I have to rebuy the other one? How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?

2698
02:30:11,780 --> 02:30:17,780
Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game or does it kind of tie into that story?

2699
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:22,780
Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed 2 graphics?

2700
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:31,780
Um, it kind of makes you want to play the original game even though it's a it's not really tied into the game itself

2701
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:34,780
The original game it's more like a standalone

2702
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:37,780
Right

2703
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:41,780
Okay, well I get I want to say somebody I knew is playing that on Facebook

2704
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:46,780
Is this been open a long time like about six months or so or did like just recently open?

2705
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:50,780
Probably I just found out about it yesterday so

2706
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,780
Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?

2707
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:58,780
Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook

2708
02:30:58,780 --> 02:31:00,780
And it had a title I can't remember the full title

2709
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:05,780
But I because it seems like it's gonna buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars

2710
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:07,780
That it might actually be the game of civilization

2711
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:10,780
It might be simplified a lot, but I think that might be a lot of fun

2712
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:18,780
Um, right now I like playing, you know, um, Knights of the Clicky, um, Chocobos Crystal Tower

2713
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:19,780
Oh, yeah

2714
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:21,780
The game's kind of confusing, but it's pretty fun

2715
02:31:21,780 --> 02:31:22,780
Yeah

2716
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:23,780
Yeah

2717
02:31:23,780 --> 02:31:25,780
So, all right

2718
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:29,780
Well, gamer girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?

2719
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:31,780
Do those games make you less depressed?

2720
02:31:31,780 --> 02:31:33,780
Keep up the good work guys

2721
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:37,780
Wait, gamer girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?

2722
02:31:37,780 --> 02:31:46,780
Actually, um, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot em up games like, whatever

2723
02:31:46,780 --> 02:31:52,780
Um, Call of Duty, um, or like something with zombies in it

2724
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:55,780
I made a game with zombies in it

2725
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:58,780
I like watching their brains spew out

2726
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:06,780
Oh, and then, let's see, I had a game, but I forgot the name of it

2727
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:07,780
It's all good

2728
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:08,780
Oh, Resident Evil

2729
02:32:08,780 --> 02:32:09,780
Oh, Resident Evil, there you go

2730
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:10,780
Yeah

2731
02:32:10,780 --> 02:32:11,780
More zombie killing

2732
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:12,780
All right

2733
02:32:12,780 --> 02:32:13,780
Yeah

2734
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:14,780
You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich

2735
02:32:14,780 --> 02:32:15,780
All right

2736
02:32:15,780 --> 02:32:19,780
Gamer girl, we're gonna let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call

2737
02:32:19,780 --> 02:32:20,780
You're welcome

2738
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:21,780
Take care, have a wonderful night

2739
02:32:21,780 --> 02:32:22,780
You too

2740
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:27,780
1-877-GAME-OLR, if you want to call us, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

2741
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:29,780
Uh, any other last minute stories over there from Loki?

2742
02:32:29,780 --> 02:32:30,780
Nope

2743
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:32,780
Oh, how am I supposed to fill time till the next call?

2744
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:38,780
Uh, I don't know, we can make up news, let's see if there's any new stories, yay

2745
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:40,780
Anything that recently happened

2746
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:47,780
Uh, Nanostray, developer working on the title for the 3DS

2747
02:32:47,780 --> 02:32:50,780
Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game, I guess that's neat

2748
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:53,780
Uh, I don't know

2749
02:32:53,780 --> 02:32:55,780
Maybe we can make some stories up?

2750
02:32:55,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Well, how about, um, there was the little big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?

2751
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:06,780
Yeah, I was covered, I talked about the patch, it's a little bit earlier in the show

2752
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,780
Um, Black Ops Zombies

2753
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:09,780
Hold on, we're getting another call, woo, saved

2754
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2755
02:33:11,780 --> 02:33:13,780
Hey, this is Amiga777

2756
02:33:13,780 --> 02:33:16,780
Amiga777, what's on your mind buddy?

2757
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:23,780
Hey, um, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering if you guys heard about that latest

2758
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:30,780
Mario sports mix game that was supposed to be coming out, I don't know, like

2759
02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:34,780
From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago

2760
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:39,780
I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game

2761
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:44,780
Okay, I don't know, like, um, what were your thoughts on it?

2762
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:52,780
Um, to me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash in to the whole Wii Sports craze

2763
02:33:52,780 --> 02:33:58,780
It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock offs games

2764
02:33:58,780 --> 02:34:00,780
A la, I don't know, Deca Sports or whatever

2765
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:03,780
The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit

2766
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:09,780
Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games

2767
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:14,780
You know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, whatever the hell they were calling it

2768
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:16,780
Wasn't it a Squeenix game too?

2769
02:34:16,780 --> 02:34:19,780
Yeah, I was about to ask you that same question

2770
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:23,780
Yeah, you know Squeenix doesn't just do role playing games, once in a while they do have the other side

2771
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:27,780
Well, especially now that they have the Eidos arm, they definitely aren't just about role playing games

2772
02:34:27,780 --> 02:34:30,780
But, you know, they always would do kind of these weird one off games

2773
02:34:30,780 --> 02:34:34,780
I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing

2774
02:34:34,780 --> 02:34:38,780
Which was like a PS1 Mario Kart rip off with Final Fantasy characters

2775
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:41,780
I really wish that would come out on the store

2776
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:45,780
Because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got

2777
02:34:45,780 --> 02:34:47,780
So, yeah, that was awesome

2778
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:51,780
But anyway, kind of going back to your original question, you know, I think, yeah, I get what Loki's saying

2779
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:55,780
As far as the game itself, it's very Wii Sports-esque

2780
02:34:55,780 --> 02:35:01,780
So if you like that fun, casual, and I emphasize casual sports game

2781
02:35:01,780 --> 02:35:05,780
Then yeah, it's cool, especially if you have siblings that you play a lot of video games with

2782
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:07,780
Or you have parties where you have people over a lot

2783
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:10,780
You know, this would be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties

2784
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:13,780
Because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach

2785
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:17,780
But as far as like the hardcore game goes, like if you're just kind of a solo player

2786
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:20,780
I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you

2787
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:22,780
I think your money might be better spent somewhere else

2788
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:24,780
Right

2789
02:35:24,780 --> 02:35:29,780
Okay, I mean like, I looked at an article online about it

2790
02:35:29,780 --> 02:35:31,780
I don't know, some time ago

2791
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:36,780
And the critics were just ripping it to shreds

2792
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:37,780
Yeah, not surprised

2793
02:35:37,780 --> 02:35:42,780
And let me guess, they were probably just saying it's, you know, yet another sports game on the Wii

2794
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:44,780
You know, with a Mario knockoff title

2795
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:47,780
It's just very insignificant

2796
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:49,780
Doesn't bring anything new to the table

2797
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:50,780
I bet all the, I haven't even played the game

2798
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:52,780
And I bet that those are what the reviews are saying basically

2799
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:53,780
So

2800
02:35:53,780 --> 02:35:55,780
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room does tell us though

2801
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:57,780
It is Mario curling

2802
02:35:57,780 --> 02:35:59,780
If you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario

2803
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:00,780
You can get that

2804
02:36:00,780 --> 02:36:03,780
I thought Mario curling was not in that

2805
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:08,780
But was in the stupid Sonic vs, Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing

2806
02:36:08,780 --> 02:36:09,780
Oh, you might be right

2807
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:11,780
I don't think curling is in this new one

2808
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:14,780
I'm reading that from chat, so you could be right

2809
02:36:14,780 --> 02:36:16,780
I mean, I could be wrong

2810
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:21,780
I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis

2811
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:26,780
Dodgeball, maybe paintball

2812
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:31,780
But, you know, it's, whatever

2813
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:34,780
I mean, we're not the target audience

2814
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:38,780
So, I gotta ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up

2815
02:36:38,780 --> 02:36:42,780
Or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too

2816
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:44,780
Because of everything you've read

2817
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:50,780
Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that

2818
02:36:50,780 --> 02:36:53,780
As I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time

2819
02:36:53,780 --> 02:36:55,780
Oh well, then it makes the decision pretty easy

2820
02:36:55,780 --> 02:37:01,780
But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article

2821
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:09,780
That Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept

2822
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:12,780
To, I guess, Square Enix

2823
02:37:12,780 --> 02:37:18,780
It was already in some hot water

2824
02:37:18,780 --> 02:37:22,780
And a number of other things

2825
02:37:22,780 --> 02:37:26,780
Like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV

2826
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:29,780
Which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet

2827
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:33,780
What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?

2828
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:37,780
Um, I don't know

2829
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:40,780
Price games?

2830
02:37:40,780 --> 02:37:44,780
The games? Oh no, it's fine

2831
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:49,780
I just need to, you know, make some decent income in order to get one at this time

2832
02:37:49,780 --> 02:37:53,780
I gotcha, yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy

2833
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,780
Alright

2834
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,780
It's a bummer

2835
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:59,780
Well buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for the call

2836
02:37:59,780 --> 02:38:00,780
Bye bye

2837
02:38:00,780 --> 02:38:03,780
Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there

2838
02:38:03,780 --> 02:38:06,780
It's a whopping four

2839
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:10,780
Hockey, baseball, or I'm sorry, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball

2840
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:12,780
That's it

2841
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:18,780
Yeah, I remember, I didn't think it was a lot of games

2842
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:20,780
It wasn't like deca sports, so there was a whole ton of them

2843
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,780
It was just, you know, a few

2844
02:38:22,780 --> 02:38:24,780
There you go

2845
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:26,780
Alright, well that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

2846
02:38:26,780 --> 02:38:28,780
So sorry to those folks that didn't get through

2847
02:38:28,780 --> 02:38:33,780
But, you know, you can always send us an email or, you know, contact us in other ways

2848
02:38:33,780 --> 02:38:37,780
Chat room, Twitter, etc, etc

2849
02:38:37,780 --> 02:38:39,780
We'll be back to do it again next week

2850
02:38:39,780 --> 02:38:42,780
But since I believe we did all the final thoughts

2851
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:45,780
I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight

2852
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:48,780
It's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show

2853
02:38:48,780 --> 02:38:51,780
So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight

2854
02:38:51,780 --> 02:38:55,780
I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half

2855
02:38:55,780 --> 02:38:57,780
As you always do, so thank you for being here

2856
02:38:57,780 --> 02:38:58,780
Thank you

2857
02:38:58,780 --> 02:39:00,780
And do you have a final thought for listeners tonight?

2858
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:02,780
We didn't nap today and I can feel it

2859
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:06,780
Wait a minute, no, I took like a, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show

2860
02:39:06,780 --> 02:39:07,780
20 minutes is not a nap

2861
02:39:07,780 --> 02:39:08,780
Ah, it is for me

2862
02:39:08,780 --> 02:39:11,780
Alright, I'll go ahead and give my final thought

2863
02:39:11,780 --> 02:39:16,780
My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show

2864
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:18,780
I mean, I love the live listeners and everything

2865
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:21,780
But if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close

2866
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:23,780
I'm just saying, just saying

2867
02:39:23,780 --> 02:39:24,780
There's Pasco Robbins around the corner

2868
02:39:24,780 --> 02:39:25,780
That's true

2869
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:27,780
Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?

2870
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:29,780
My head hurts so bad

2871
02:39:29,780 --> 02:39:31,780
Aw, sorry to hear it

2872
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:33,780
And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

2873
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,780
I hope this mod works

2874
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:37,780
Oh dear, I wonder what this is

2875
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:39,780
What is this mod gonna do, dare I ask?

2876
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:45,780
Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get like a process to it

2877
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:48,780
Because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online

2878
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:53,780
And have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto

2879
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:55,780
I'm talking about map mods right now

2880
02:39:55,780 --> 02:39:57,780
Because I've done map mods before

2881
02:39:57,780 --> 02:39:59,780
But I have a new method of doing them

2882
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:03,780
And the previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work

2883
02:40:03,780 --> 02:40:05,780
And I've tried this before

2884
02:40:05,780 --> 02:40:07,780
And I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work

2885
02:40:07,780 --> 02:40:10,780
And who knows?

2886
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:13,780
Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn

2887
02:40:13,780 --> 02:40:15,780
Alright

2888
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:17,780
Well, that's gonna do it tonight

2889
02:40:17,780 --> 02:40:19,780
For another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2890
02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:21,780
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show

If you like what you hear at Orange Lounge Radio

2895
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:31,780
All we ask is to leave us some nice feedback

2896
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:33,780
Whether it be on the iTunes store

2897
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:35,780
By leaving us a 5 star review

2898
02:40:35,780 --> 02:40:37,780
Or wherever you download podcasts

2899
02:40:37,780 --> 02:40:39,780
I know there are many other places besides just iTunes

2900
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:41,780
Or of course, tell a friend about the show

2901
02:40:41,780 --> 02:40:44,780
That is how we appreciate you spreading the word about Orange Lounge Radio

2902
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:46,780
We are not a giant magazine

2903
02:40:46,780 --> 02:40:51,780
We are not some big corporation with millions of advertising dollars behind us

2904
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:54,780
We're just three friends who got together to do this show some time ago

2905
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:56,780
We kept it going all this time

2906
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:58,780
And thank you guys for showing up and supporting us

2907
02:40:58,780 --> 02:41:00,780
And making it work every week

2908
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:01,780
Have a good night everybody

2909
02:41:01,780 --> 02:41:03,780
