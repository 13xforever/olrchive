1
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:12,461
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, February 20th, 2011.

3
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:18,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?

4
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.

5
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:24,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And is PC piracy really in decline?

6
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:32,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafel

7
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.

8
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:06,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Falafels are delicious.

9
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go have another.

10
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:13,471
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that one of the races in it was like a Lollapalooza or something.

11
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I just call them falafels because they're adorable and cute like falafels.

12
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who really likes falafels?

13
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:21,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight is speaking early.

14
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:22,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Salacious Pop.

15
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:26,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

17
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:31,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

18
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Loki?

19
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:33,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

20
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

21
00:01:34,537 --> 00:01:36,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything flaw-fulfilled in your world?

22
00:01:36,518 --> 00:01:36,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

23
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to ask.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

26
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:42,682
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the dinner of choice tonight?

27
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:43,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask this.

28
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:44,423
[SPEAKER_12]: I was crapping McDonald's.

29
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:49,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't really that hungry, but I knew if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry later, so I just had a quarter pounder.

30
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,687
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

31
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:56,070
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't very good, and the fries aren't very good, but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.

32
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:22,253
[SPEAKER_04]: any McDonald's you go to so it was just I don't know Orange Lounge Foodio you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio but a lot of the times we also talk about food also joining us tonight as you already know is the one and only Salacious Pop here in studio I'm sorry for speaking out of turn please don't beat me you need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak hello what's up

33
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:24,672
[SPEAKER_04]: How's your week going?

34
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:25,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

35
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:25,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?

36
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

37
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I have PETA, so it's a lot better now.

38
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a 65-year-old man.

39
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:33,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't move today.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,504
[SPEAKER_11]: We ran around doing a local version of The Amazing Race scavenger hunt.

41
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:44,288
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just between about 15 or 16 friends, all within Sacramento downtown.

42
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:49,513
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, no charity, no organization, just because we can.

43
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:50,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We're bored.

44
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, when people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.

45
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:57,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams.

46
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't let them win over you.

47
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:02,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.

48
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:08,757
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.

49
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Lots of running back and forth.

50
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:19,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling and can't sit up without help.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm a gamer.

52
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do physical activity.

53
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:24,032
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is too much.

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you get for not playing any more DDR.

55
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have half a Vicodin, so I'm feeling a lot better after that.

56
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:31,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain.

57
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:32,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes you not care.

58
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:33,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

59
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it is.

60
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't care anymore.

61
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:41,011
[SPEAKER_04]: But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.

62
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,192
[SPEAKER_04]: We were on opposing teams.

63
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:47,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was on a few times in the past.

64
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:49,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she filled in for you one time.

65
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:50,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Her and Irene were on a show.

66
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: But Victoria and I were a team, and we came in second.

67
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:53,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

69
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have the winner and the runner up.

70
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,283
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not doing this shit anymore.

71
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We're done.

72
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:04,624
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of you were too far behind.

73
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:06,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

74
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I had a good time.

75
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say this.

76
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.

77
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.

78
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:19,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.

79
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:29,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many of y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or are even old enough to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now, and they're kind of fun, actually.

80
00:04:29,846 --> 00:04:31,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Amazing Race slot cars.

81
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:32,050
Okay.

82
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that's a hobby more of us aren't into is slot car.

83
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:38,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I always kind of walk by the stores and I go, ooh, that's cool.

84
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:40,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to love those when I was a kid too.

85
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:46,261
[SPEAKER_07]: The hobby store that, well, Dan's into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.

86
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:50,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.

87
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:54,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can run it on the slot sets.

88
00:04:56,411 --> 00:05:01,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?

89
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I want to say there was at least a Micro Machines game.

90
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,595
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the Typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's?

91
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,495
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a pinball table in there.

92
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,816
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a slot car thing in there.

93
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:14,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

94
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:16,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chat room.

95
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:22,583
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

96
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:29,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.

97
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.

98
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,290
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Brad.

99
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob isn't out of shape.

100
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:35,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Round is a shape.

101
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

102
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment actually.

103
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:39,976
[SPEAKER_04]: That was rather rude, don't you think?

104
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:40,397
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

105
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:52,299
[SPEAKER_04]: and then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing SSJ100Matt says OLR House MD Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with it's not lupus it's a house joke, TV joke

106
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:58,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also you can join us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

107
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

108
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,622
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

109
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:09,645
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you have been playing this week.

110
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,005
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

111
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

112
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:15,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3

113
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:41,897
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:05,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since.

115
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:09,514
[SPEAKER_07]: With its freaky-ass control style.

116
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man is totally janked in that game.

117
00:07:19,443 --> 00:07:20,223
[SPEAKER_07]: His moves are messed up.

118
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,325
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's all messed up now.

119
00:07:22,385 --> 00:07:23,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about Deadpool.

120
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:26,789
[SPEAKER_04]: A movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.

121
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:27,189
[SPEAKER_04]: What?! !

122
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they killed Johnny Storm.

123
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:32,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

124
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:33,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was the most interesting of all of them?

125
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.

126
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:38,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

127
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:40,294
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

128
00:07:40,714 --> 00:07:44,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?

129
00:07:44,335 --> 00:07:52,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was going to say it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy III, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.

130
00:07:53,377 --> 00:08:00,161
[SPEAKER_04]: What's particularly interesting about that is that 1 and 2 on the iPhone were based off the PSP versions.

131
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.

132
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:06,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.

133
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone.

134
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:11,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is it going to be?

135
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:13,248
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.

136
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:17,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they did 1, 2, and 4.

137
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:17,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

138
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

139
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're just going to go through and re-sprite them.

140
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:33,953
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for just one color and might just pull whatever they were working on for that because they had it in the works.

141
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It just never came out.

142
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.

143
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:41,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be interesting, though, if they do one for iPhone, why don't they just release it for PSP as well?

144
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.

145
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're great.

146
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:50,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Two is really simple to play because I have two on my iPhone.

147
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited for four.

148
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:59,118
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a part of me that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi, but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.

149
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:05,280
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope they bring 4 and the After Years onto the iOS as well because I don't really play with PSP anymore.

150
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.

151
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, After Years did start as a mobile game.

152
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:13,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

153
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:17,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom.

154
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:18,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a complaint I hear a lot.

155
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:20,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of curious what DarkSakura thinks about it.

156
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.

157
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, so not cool.

158
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:26,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, outside of E3, but that was how long ago and it was early build of the game.

159
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:31,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.

160
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:32,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really that fun.

161
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:33,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Agree?

162
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:34,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Disagree?

163
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.

164
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:44,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.

165
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:44,876
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

166
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:51,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter IV, same thing.

167
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:01,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because you can just throw off your super with a push of a button.

168
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:24,453
[SPEAKER_07]: when you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it then there's you can definitely I'm trying to see how to phrase this right because it's not like you know like in Tekken where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game if you've got skill with it then you can beat a masher I don't know if that makes sense so it can be fun

169
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:36,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the, I don't know, for basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before to get like a six or seven hit.

170
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:43,910
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have to practice and know how to do that stuff.

171
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:45,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.

172
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:06,393
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

173
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:24,025
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

174
00:11:38,702 --> 00:12:03,310
[SPEAKER_07]: and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off because we could do all of those 44 hit combos and everything too but the the thing though is that with the early versus games versus the late versus game first that's a lot of versus the late versus games is that they the early ones still went on that Street Fighter you know the six button layout style whereas hi whereas we have um

175
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: a four button with a special so it's just kind of different sorry we're being interrupted with food requests that's why we're distracted so anyhow I wanted to ask to throw this out real quick though speaking of Killer Instinct I realize that everything's up in the air with Rare and they're not really with Nintendo anymore and things aren't like they used to be but like seriously seriously what's got to happen for there to be a Killer Instinct 3

176
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:34,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

177
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:35,917
[SPEAKER_04]: How bad?

178
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?

179
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:38,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, me, me, me, me.

180
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's me and Jamie.

181
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

182
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:40,541
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

183
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Still.

184
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:46,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I still wanted the public flogging of whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct Complete 64.

185
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,909
[SPEAKER_11]: That piece of crap port.

186
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh.

187
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Already upset thinking about it.

188
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,093
[SPEAKER_07]: The SNES version was the best home port.

189
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:53,774
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

190
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:54,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Or MAME.

191
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:55,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,429
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:24,566
[SPEAKER_07]: is that he actually waited until the... Because the game would start with a random stage and he waited until Orchid Stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV file back in the day.

194
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:25,286
[SPEAKER_07]: That's nice.

195
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:26,347
[SPEAKER_07]: That was so sweet.

196
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:31,810
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her unrealistic boobies.

197
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,591
[SPEAKER_07]: She was the first one I beat the game with in KI2.

198
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:33,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

199
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:36,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

200
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how you doing?

201
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,101
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your game of the week?

202
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:39,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was all right.

203
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:41,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't play a lot, though.

204
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:47,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Just mainly sorting poker, too, and... Ah, I keep forgetting to get that game.

205
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:49,012
[SPEAKER_12]: It's awesome.

206
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,674
[SPEAKER_04]: You always tell me about it, and I always forget to get it.

207
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

208
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And then just Grand Theft Auto, mainly, because...

209
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, that's about it.

210
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:03,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.

211
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:08,841
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only like 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.

212
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:13,704
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.

213
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:14,144
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

214
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:15,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Murder Boner.

215
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,406
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty sweet.

216
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:23,748
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I love that kind of stuff.

217
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:27,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.

218
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bayonetta with a dick.

219
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Murder Boner is what it is.

220
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Bayonetta with a Murder Boner.

221
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,191
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair enough.

222
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:36,711
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

223
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.

224
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played a few games this week.

225
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually...

226
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And I already reviewed the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself.

227
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:58,461
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to emphasize, if you are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another.

228
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:05,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you, it was a little bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack where you can only access the first five in the beginning.

229
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:08,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as you play, you unlock one more.

230
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you only ever have five open at a time.

231
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:16,893
[SPEAKER_04]: But what was frustrating about that is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house.

232
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:17,714
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:44,857
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

234
00:15:58,607 --> 00:15:59,448
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

235
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:13,984
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

236
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Other games I played this week.

237
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:45,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the... It's Contra, but it's not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that... Like the same Contra music.

238
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Contra, people.

239
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just Contra.

240
00:16:48,144 --> 00:17:03,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old school gamers wish they had so much more of on Xbox Live It really is just like a souped up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo game now with

241
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,603
[SPEAKER_04]: 3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.

242
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It just uses, you know... 2.5D?

243
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:17,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing where, you know, things are coming out of the background and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff.

244
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, if you like Contra, this is like an... You don't even have to think you're going to want this game.

245
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:22,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy this game.

246
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,775
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.

247
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, modernized a bit.

248
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:31,378
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this full-on anime opening sequence.

249
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like... It kind of just made me think of, like,

250
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fuck yeah.

251
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Contra, fuck yeah.

252
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:39,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire, burn.

253
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:40,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Chicks with guns.

254
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of awesome.

255
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:42,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

256
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:43,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely worth your time.

257
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: The only downside, no up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

258
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't work.

259
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I put it in the wrong place or something.

260
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to get that code to work.

261
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:51,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it backwards.

262
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

263
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?

264
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:55,072
[SPEAKER_06]: You die.

265
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:56,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

266
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:58,314
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the Gradius games did that too, I think.

267
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:00,495
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.

268
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it Gradius 4?

269
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

270
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used L-R-L-R, then you would get all the power-ups instead of left, right, left, right.

271
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Gradius V only let you do it three times.

272
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:20,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I played an indie game on the Marketplace called Try Not to Fart.

273
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:23,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the set of... Jamie looks disgusted.

274
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:25,404
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not disgusted.

275
00:18:25,464 --> 00:18:26,365
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like a, what?

276
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:29,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually cracked me up.

277
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

278
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:34,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically like you actually try to hold down buttons.

279
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:37,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have to press that right button.

280
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it flashes, you let go.

281
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:43,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels.

282
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:50,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But then as you move on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y. So it's like Twister.

283
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like Twister.

284
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:53,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you screw up, you fart.

285
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:53,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

286
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:55,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So, do you come here often?

287
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I didn't... You know, they're having this conversation.

288
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:21,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, like, if you accidentally fart, it'll go... And it's like... It's just like, Ew, that's disgusting.

289
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:26,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... Like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way.

290
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:28,610
[SPEAKER_04]: But... I like how your shoes are tied.

291
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:28,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

292
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't spend money on it.

293
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:43,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I shouldn't say that because this is an indie development place, but I just, you know, I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.

294
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:47,180
[SPEAKER_12]: The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe.

295
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I remember that.

296
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:50,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I do remember that.

297
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:50,742
[SPEAKER_12]: That was funny.

298
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:51,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

299
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

300
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,741
[SPEAKER_04]: SalaciousPop brought me food for that.

301
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: He rocks.

302
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:32,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I turn it over to SalaciousPop for his gaming week, let me talk real quickly about... I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because there was an NDA and everything, but it's an open beta.

303
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's playing it if they're interested in it.

304
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:35,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Rift.

305
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I played for a little bit this week.

306
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:39,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I grinded the character up to level 8.

307
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,189
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I explain Rift?

308
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:51,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways to the point where I didn't know what button did what and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?

309
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:55,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well in WoW I hit N and sure enough I hit N and it brought up my talent tree.

310
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of funny that I kind of like knew the buttons from just having played WoW so much.

311
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:10,501
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's be honest, Rift in its advertising campaign is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something like that.

312
00:21:10,581 --> 00:21:12,222
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.

313
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:13,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not in Azeroth.

314
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:14,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something like that.

315
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:15,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not in Kansas.

316
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:15,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

317
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played the game to like level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know.

318
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I don't know, I gotta be honest, I wasn't really feeling it.

319
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:25,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the game...

320
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

321
00:21:46,788 --> 00:22:09,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels I'm not going to try and review the game I played it, I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels Everybody's telling me you have to really invest time into it But let's be real, the game also kind of has to do something to make me want to get that far Wasn't that everybody's biggest bitch about Final Fantasy XIII?

322
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,525
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't get good until you're like 15 hours in

323
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:14,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.

324
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:16,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, true.

325
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:24,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and redid all the starting areas to make them a little more interesting.

326
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:26,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Rift, it's a new game.

327
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:28,750
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll iron out some of the kinks.

328
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting.

329
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:32,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.

330
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:36,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the V-Retail one or not.

331
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:40,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but whatever.

332
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have something you wanted to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?

333
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:43,522
[SPEAKER_11]: How does it look?

334
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it pretty?

335
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:45,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

336
00:22:45,586 --> 00:22:46,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty pretty?

337
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:46,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty.

338
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:47,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

339
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,371
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about...

340
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Something about the way the characters look.

341
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:56,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like the cartoony look of WoW that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic.

342
00:22:56,871 --> 00:22:58,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It does have more intense character customization.

343
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:00,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot more time doing that.

344
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of cool.

345
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:03,313
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

346
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:07,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the scenery looked really nice.

347
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:09,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like the environments.

348
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:12,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects.

349
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,597
[SPEAKER_04]: All that's really beautiful.

350
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:18,039
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't really into the way the characters looked or the monsters.

351
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I don't know.

352
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really an opinion.

353
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

354
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:25,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week.

355
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll move on.

356
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:31,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I already mentioned the Twitter and the Facebook and all that as far as housekeeping goes.

357
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.

358
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's get into some actual... Falafels.

359
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:37,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Falafels.

360
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And then game... Oh, yes, Salacious Pop.

361
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:40,129
[SPEAKER_04]: My Gaming Week.

362
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:40,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what happens when you leave the room.

364
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Salacious Pop, how was your Gaming Week?

365
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I left the room because I was sent to bring him food.

366
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

367
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:50,606
[SPEAKER_04]: You were gone for like an hour.

368
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,628
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

369
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:55,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp.

370
00:23:55,472 --> 00:23:58,335
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more appropriate for your other podcast.

371
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:04,623
[SPEAKER_11]: The Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.

372
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:09,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Then some You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.

373
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:17,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I played about an hour's worth of the great Gatsby tribute, NES RomHack.

374
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.

375
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

376
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,171
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a book that we had to cover.

377
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:23,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was junior or senior year in high school.

378
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:27,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about how this works as an NES game.

379
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:28,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

380
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:36,639
[SPEAKER_11]: In level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend who is sort of the person that he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.

381
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:46,084
[SPEAKER_11]: You show up at Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage.

382
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:47,065
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a platformer.

383
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:49,766
[SPEAKER_11]: You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at him.

384
00:24:52,816 --> 00:24:54,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.

385
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,720
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played that.

386
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I hated that book, just so you know.

387
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:05,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have to read in high school, really depends on the teacher.

388
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:06,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

389
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But I never liked being forced to read books.

390
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were some truly terrible books I had to read in high school.

391
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,395
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to read a separate piece.

392
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I hate that book so much.

393
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And The Crucible, Arthur Miller.

394
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:17,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read a separate piece.

395
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a separate piece about?

396
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,061
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

397
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:46,959
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.

398
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But I loved Catcher in the Rye.

399
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.

400
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:58,927
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky.

401
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you talk about the Holden the Fart game?

402
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:02,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

403
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:03,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I missed that.

404
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:13,434
[SPEAKER_11]: So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each number of the question.

405
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:19,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh, number five, girl, you rock my world, girl, cracks me up.

406
00:26:20,296 --> 00:26:22,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.

407
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:24,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to play that game.

408
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:28,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.

409
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but that's all.

410
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,160
[SPEAKER_04]: What other classic books should they turn into an 8-bit game?

411
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Watership Down.

412
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:40,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

413
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:41,777
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be a good one.

414
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:45,399
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Brave New World?

415
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:47,840
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Atlas Shrugged?

416
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.

417
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:51,962
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the book?

418
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:57,004
[SPEAKER_11]: James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages and it's a classic.

419
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:01,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm liking on the name of the book.

420
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:02,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe somebody in chat will know it.

421
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we've already had The Inferno.

422
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:07,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's true.

423
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,037
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, DarkToagak in our chatroom, I love this comment.

424
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:15,343
[SPEAKER_04]: LMAO, we're reading that in English right now and the teacher brought that game up.

425
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:19,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.

426
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:19,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what?

427
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:24,374
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to get people interested.

428
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:25,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think, I don't know.

429
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:31,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.

430
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.

431
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:39,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in New York.

432
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:43,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.

433
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:44,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like her.

434
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:45,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

435
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:46,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games!

436
00:27:46,863 --> 00:27:47,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Video games!

437
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:47,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow, wow.

438
00:27:48,344 --> 00:27:51,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about some actual video game news.

439
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, help.

440
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:54,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we're going to turn into the literary podcast.

441
00:27:55,775 --> 00:28:01,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar cutscene directors.

442
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:08,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.

443
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:16,320
[SPEAKER_12]: He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.

444
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,320
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

445
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:45,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Focusing on the takeover of the American Embassy and outline the game saying that they're looking at about 8 to 10 different roles or different perspectives that are going to be in the game, different characters.

446
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:51,090
[SPEAKER_12]: And initially you'll start the game off as like an Iranian but American-born U.S.

447
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:58,193
[SPEAKER_12]: State Department translator who is, I guess, coming in with the objective to try to free the U.S.

448
00:28:58,273 --> 00:28:58,893
[SPEAKER_12]: hostages.

449
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:03,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So, interesting subject, I suppose.

450
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:14,577
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying that, obviously, it's going to be a social-political title, and there's going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.

451
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:22,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's not a sandbox game.

452
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:34,190
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting subject.

453
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:42,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, before I was born, so I'm not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened.

454
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:44,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're calling us old then, basically?

455
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:45,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I am calling you old.

456
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,200
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

457
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:23,140
[SPEAKER_04]: or like you can change history in it I don't know but then again I love civilization so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now but it's different I can't explain it it's different is this a game you're interested in playing Loki?

458
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:36,865
[SPEAKER_12]: not really it doesn't sound that interesting even with the Grand Theft no because it's a guy who was a cutscene director I mean so what they directed stuff it's not the people actually I don't know it doesn't really count

459
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:39,003
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

460
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,061
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

461
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:17,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this maybe a way... Because all of us in the room admit we weren't really old enough to understand what was going on at the time.

462
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:23,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened?

463
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:25,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it could be.

464
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I just don't care.

465
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:29,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

466
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:32,273
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.

467
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,656
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like I wouldn't want a game based off of...

468
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, most of history.

469
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't really give a crap about history.

470
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:50,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.

471
00:31:53,111 --> 00:32:02,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could just go and read everything, which I have.

472
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I go back and read history books for fun.

473
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:09,492
[SPEAKER_12]: The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer Red Alert.

474
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:14,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.

475
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:15,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the funny thing.

476
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:23,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know is stretching it a little bit, but that's going way back.

477
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:25,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Battle of Olympus on the NES?

478
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

479
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.

480
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:37,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they were to make a video game on other recent historical things, let's be honest, if they were to make a game on 9-11, that's not a game.

481
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.

482
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:43,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not... Games are... I don't know.

483
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:44,178
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to be entertaining.

484
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,619
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you even make a game out of that?

485
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really.

486
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully there isn't one.

487
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:52,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?

488
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:52,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

489
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:53,665
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

490
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:55,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let me put this, though, into perspective, okay?

491
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:57,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Say that...

492
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,992
[SPEAKER_07]: World War II just ended three months ago.

493
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:06,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone wants to put 1942 on the market.

494
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.

495
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,700
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.

496
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,521
[SPEAKER_11]: That wouldn't fly.

497
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:14,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

498
00:33:14,982 --> 00:33:19,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?

499
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: There's zillions and zillions.

500
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:25,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.

501
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:27,728
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:47,472
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

503
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:13,932
[SPEAKER_12]: If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a stealth game where you investigate where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.

504
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:35,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Return of Time Pilot, maybe.

505
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:37,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?

506
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:39,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Modernize that.

507
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:42,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Way off topic here, but he brought it up.

508
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:43,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Melgar Solid.

509
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:49,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Melgar Solid style game set in like a high school or something like that?

510
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:53,734
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just like a high school kid or something and all very sneaky around and stuff.

511
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:54,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you shooting people?

512
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's not going to go over very well.

513
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:57,296
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not shooting people.

514
00:34:57,336 --> 00:35:00,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.

515
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like gossip.

516
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,201
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be the Mean Girls game.

517
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:07,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this like puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip

518
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:14,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Biotch of the School, where you like eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.

519
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.

520
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like way too dramatic.

521
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:22,052
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just like everything way over-dramatized.

522
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:28,596
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just ridiculously amount, a ridiculous amount of drama to the game.

523
00:35:29,516 --> 00:35:30,117
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be awesome.

524
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:32,238
[SPEAKER_12]: No one has that kind of sense of humor.

525
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:43,788
[SPEAKER_12]: But Konami, I can see that you have that sense of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and... God, what was that crappy high school dating game that they had on the PSP?

526
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:48,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't even... I remember the game, I don't remember what it was called.

527
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:55,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyways, see, I think all those things can be fixed with a little bit of the middle of your soul thrown in.

528
00:35:56,212 --> 00:36:05,456
[SPEAKER_12]: And hell, if you want to be funny even better, even better if you want to be a little bit more funny, you can have the principal or dean to be actually Old Snake.

529
00:36:05,516 --> 00:36:06,316
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be hilarious.

530
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know?

531
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:12,388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

532
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:17,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon.

533
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:21,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this week.

534
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And they announced a lot of new games that are coming out.

535
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:28,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first is the Fables series.

536
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the comic book series Fables.

537
00:36:30,801 --> 00:36:32,642
[SPEAKER_04]: That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012.

538
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:36,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the games that they are working on right now.

539
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:39,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of fairy tales.

540
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:40,867
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

541
00:36:43,008 --> 00:37:11,654
[SPEAKER_04]: characters from various fairy tales like Snow White, Pinocchio and this stuff they get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City so like if you're thinking like Fables is like oh it's like a Hansel and Gretel no no no no no no it's very different I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic Vertigo which is DC's sort of more I want to say adult but they're more serial like mature imprint they put Fables out I have the two first volumes and it's awesome

542
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:27,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually just, we talked about a new issue that came out which is a Cinderella based one where she's an assassin So it's like Enchanted but Enchanted meets Leon Professional Pretty much How do you think it's going to translate into a game?

543
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:28,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you that know the books pretty well

544
00:37:29,486 --> 00:37:33,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it could do it.

545
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:34,910
[SPEAKER_11]: They cuss a lot.

546
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F-bomb in the comic.

547
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Beauty and the Beast go see her for marital problems.

548
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's like, I'm not a caseworker.

549
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:45,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Leave me alone.

550
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:49,479
[SPEAKER_11]: If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.

551
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:50,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you asking me?

552
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:51,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I get banged by seven different dwarves.

553
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,321
[SPEAKER_04]: F off.

554
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:58,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up in the comic.

555
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:05,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is Dorothy Gale.

556
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:07,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

557
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:08,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's codenamed Silver Slipper.

558
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:09,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

559
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:10,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

560
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they have the shoe thing going on.

561
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:12,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be honest?

562
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:16,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm, like, really interested.

563
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to, like, borrow your books.

564
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:19,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome.

565
00:38:20,387 --> 00:38:23,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I like things from my childhood like Really Really Messed Up.

566
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:27,971
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.

567
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:30,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?

568
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

569
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:38,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, Tiger Claw, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation of The Great Gatsby in 3, that's gonna make no fucking sense.

570
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:48,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

571
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to say it's bad.

572
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Moulin Rouge.

573
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:51,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

574
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:54,386
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't like this 3D orgy all these movies are having.

575
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:55,087
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I understand that.

576
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:57,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's, whatever.

577
00:38:57,189 --> 00:39:00,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.

578
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:01,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

579
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:02,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

580
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I love him.

581
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:05,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in 40!

582
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,141
[SPEAKER_04]: With the Batman movies.

583
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:13,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale Press event.

584
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Jurassic Park is one of the other games.

585
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:16,826
[SPEAKER_04]: We've known they've been working on this for a while.

586
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:20,328
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed off a little more about the game, and it's going to be coming out in April.

587
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently...

588
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:31,576
[SPEAKER_04]: The story involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved.

589
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:32,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could say the book too, of course.

590
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:37,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, not to get off track, but I always found it interesting.

591
00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever read the sequel to the book?

592
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:43,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The Jurassic Park, The Lost World, the book?

593
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:47,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?

594
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:47,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

595
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:51,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back.

596
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:51,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

597
00:39:51,328 --> 00:39:52,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have this done in two weeks

598
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: When he escapes, he gets killed, right?

599
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But what was he trying to do?

600
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:30,595
[SPEAKER_04]: He was trying to get out of there with the shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.

601
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:31,916
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's never recovered.

602
00:40:31,956 --> 00:40:33,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always assumed lost.

603
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:38,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?

604
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:39,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did it go?

605
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:39,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Who found it?

606
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:40,582
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they do with it?

607
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:45,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie.

608
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:48,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty excited about this.

609
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:49,409
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be pretty awesome.

610
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:52,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.

611
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:54,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's $5 off the regular price.

612
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:56,675
[SPEAKER_04]: The Walking Dead.

613
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,897
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a show on AMC that a lot of people are really into.

614
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:00,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Also a graphic novel.

615
00:41:01,218 --> 00:41:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.

616
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?

617
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:12,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the show at all, but you know the book and you know the show.

618
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's a book first and then it became the AMC show.

619
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,493
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.

620
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than I love stuff with zombies.

621
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I never get bored of zombies.

622
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:28,740
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

623
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.

624
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:34,546
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.

625
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:39,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.

626
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:44,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Hector Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.

627
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult-like.

628
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:59,326
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.

629
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:10,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fanboy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really going to be making it.

630
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that explains a lot.

631
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:11,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

632
00:42:33,360 --> 00:43:00,059
[SPEAKER_04]: and the cool thing is though the silver lining people are still allowed to do their thing and you know they're putting out what the third game or they just put out the third series or third episode in their series so you know it's cool that that's able to coexist because you know what I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe so to speak why not we have all these you know like we were saying earlier World War 2 games we have TV shows we had two Star Trek shows on at the same time you know so why not

633
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:09,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and it's cool that one's free and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way, but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.

634
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:09,922
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

635
00:43:10,583 --> 00:43:14,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals because I know they're really passionate about what they do.

636
00:43:14,846 --> 00:43:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, on one department you have the same group that made Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.

637
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Telltale has a proven track record.

638
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:23,113
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the pedigree.

639
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:23,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

640
00:43:23,974 --> 00:43:25,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.

641
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:30,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool that both are going to be coexisting and what have you.

642
00:43:30,797 --> 00:43:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited to see what they put out.

643
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.

644
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize she's living in a fort in the middle of the woods now and doesn't really do a lot with gaming.

645
00:43:42,962 --> 00:43:44,802
[SPEAKER_04]: They live in Yosemite or something weird.

646
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:46,763
[SPEAKER_04]: They pretty much removed themselves from society.

647
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:52,965
[SPEAKER_11]: So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy because I have so many video game memories tied to her and Ken.

648
00:43:53,505 --> 00:44:21,470
[SPEAKER_04]: and they just like I don't even think I have to say this because I think they already know but Telltale if they're going to be rebooting it we've got to have something as awesome as Rosella the fourth game and I think there will be nods they'll be winking nods to the old stuff I believe it so it'll be cool because they didn't say it's a remake it's a reboot more to be revealed at E3 so very cool very very cool so lots of news out of Telltale this week

649
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:23,936
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

650
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:53,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off discs and then downloading a crack file so that they could play the discs.

651
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:05,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And that now, because there are so many things that are included in the games now that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game goodies...

652
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:23,151
[SPEAKER_07]: that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not going to get any of the bragging rights that go along with having the game and a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple systems who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it

653
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:36,064
[SPEAKER_07]: and the other thing too is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost effective to run your own server for a lot of these games.

654
00:45:36,144 --> 00:45:43,351
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're playing Ragnarok Online.

655
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.

656
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:46,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I digress.

657
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:50,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But the WoW ones are really jank.

658
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:53,397
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.

659
00:45:53,457 --> 00:46:03,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters over.

660
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?

661
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they did.

662
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that was really cool.

663
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:17,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that you can't pirate a free game.

664
00:46:18,684 --> 00:46:19,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you just...

665
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free anyway, so why not?

666
00:46:23,392 --> 00:46:28,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not like, you know, if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server, then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself.

667
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:33,777
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to, you know, getting the community content like how they did with Second Life, you know.

668
00:46:34,497 --> 00:46:44,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.

669
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:49,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting the same experience that a person who pays for it does Unless it's Ragnarok Online

670
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:34,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I like with your first person shooters that you've got servers set up for online play and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled if you've got a pirated version because I've noticed a few of those running about

671
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:48,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I've noticed a lot for more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever, Modern Warfare 2, StarCraft 2, even without the cinematics, these games are huge.

672
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:52,608
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that at home, broadband connections are faster than they've ever been.

673
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like 100 bucks.

674
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:01,934
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70 gigs.

675
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:02,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

676
00:48:03,175 --> 00:48:07,546
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's like, yeah, alright, leave it running overnight but it's like, that's just too much.

677
00:48:07,606 --> 00:48:08,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather just buy it.

678
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:09,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.

679
00:48:09,892 --> 00:48:11,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.

680
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:14,595
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

681
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:17,996
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what everyone would like to hear to think is that it's really slow.

682
00:48:18,016 --> 00:48:21,217
[SPEAKER_12]: But honestly, it doesn't take much.

683
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:24,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.

684
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:31,239
[SPEAKER_12]: They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.

685
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have programs like JDownloader.

686
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,002
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

687
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:01,668
[SPEAKER_04]: This question is going to sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.

688
00:49:01,728 --> 00:49:03,788
[SPEAKER_04]: What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?

689
00:49:03,828 --> 00:49:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before they call your house and threaten you.

690
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.

691
00:49:15,931 --> 00:49:20,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.

692
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:25,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I want to say StarCraft II is at least 20.

693
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:30,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's a big game.

694
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but everything's compressed.

695
00:49:33,092 --> 00:49:39,517
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking like the most you're going to probably have two DVD 9 disc images or whatever.

696
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,919
[SPEAKER_12]: You're looking at 18 gigs or something like that.

697
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:48,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's going to be very difficult to hit your cap of 250 gigs.

698
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you this now.

699
00:49:50,326 --> 00:49:55,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I download my episode of Supernatural every week because I'm at Temple on Friday night and so I miss it.

700
00:49:56,228 --> 00:50:11,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural and I've just downloaded the first four episodes of Being Human Season 3 and the first two of the American version of it like last night while I was playing World of Warcraft and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.

701
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:12,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really not that hard.

702
00:50:13,996 --> 00:50:16,362
[SPEAKER_04]: TV shows are kind of a different thing though.

703
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you not able to watch Supernatural online like on the official website or anything like that?

704
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:32,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.

705
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:42,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's Drag Race, every week.

706
00:50:43,571 --> 00:50:45,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on and watch that on LOGO's website.

707
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:48,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch the Colbert Report.

708
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.

709
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: The Daily Show.

710
00:50:50,298 --> 00:50:51,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even have to be like Hulu or whatever.

711
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on the website.

712
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Survivor, every week is there.

713
00:50:55,083 --> 00:51:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.

714
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:04,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way.

715
00:51:04,442 --> 00:51:05,162
[SPEAKER_07]: That's weird.

716
00:51:06,323 --> 00:51:11,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television is absolutely stupid.

717
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being talked down to.

718
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:20,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it.

719
00:51:20,669 --> 00:51:27,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm in the middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish watching the episode.

720
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:31,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I can go mining or something.

721
00:51:32,394 --> 00:51:34,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.

722
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,576
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.

723
00:51:38,176 --> 00:51:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about King's Quest.

724
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com saying, Reboot Space Quest.

725
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:45,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

726
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:54,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?

727
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the Heroes games?

728
00:51:57,343 --> 00:52:02,146
[SPEAKER_11]: The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember anymore.

729
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,207
[SPEAKER_11]: If they sign off on it, then hell yeah.

730
00:52:04,827 --> 00:52:06,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.

731
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?

732
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.

733
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:14,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

734
00:52:14,452 --> 00:52:18,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably better left in the past.

735
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:20,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But I digress.

736
00:52:20,768 --> 00:52:21,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

737
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what do you have for us?

738
00:52:22,492 --> 00:52:30,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great or good or worth playing.

739
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

740
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:54,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Plain Theft of Actual Games

741
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:23,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Stole the game and the assets and everything else and put it up on the Apple App Store and were selling it for quite a long time.

742
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:23,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this.

743
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:26,392
[SPEAKER_04]: This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.

744
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:40,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and it was just like they were trying to get people trying to get Apple's attention to get it taken down because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99 cent app and

745
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:50,823
[SPEAKER_12]: It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy section of the App Store.

746
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:55,807
[SPEAKER_12]: So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.

747
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,648
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's finally back.

748
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:01,511
[SPEAKER_12]: The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.

749
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:02,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

750
00:54:03,553 --> 00:54:08,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.

751
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:12,564
[SPEAKER_12]: But, I mean, a lot of damage has been done and people already have the old version of the game.

752
00:54:12,764 --> 00:54:14,126
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it kind of sucks.

753
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:15,737
[SPEAKER_04]: What can be done about this though?

754
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:20,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to screen for copyrighted stuff.

755
00:54:20,798 --> 00:54:24,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace, they'd kind of get that.

756
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:29,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest, I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game either.

757
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

758
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,860
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have time to play everything.

759
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

760
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you stop theft like that?

761
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:40,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace does a peer review.

762
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the answer?

763
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:42,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

764
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:46,277
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be the answer, I don't know.

765
00:54:46,577 --> 00:54:49,219
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not the only game they have that happened to it.

766
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:54,042
[SPEAKER_12]: There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with fighting animals.

767
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,463
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like a 3D fighter game.

768
00:54:56,203 --> 00:55:01,927
[SPEAKER_12]: And that actually had a version of it ripped off and put on there.

769
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:11,954
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit different situation, that is people that they claimed they were sold the rights to the game and stuff like that, but the developer said, no, you only have the rights to this,

770
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Flash Game, or something like that.

771
00:55:15,796 --> 00:55:16,916
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the rights to do this.

772
00:55:17,116 --> 00:55:18,936
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a big ol' thing about that.

773
00:55:18,996 --> 00:55:21,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not so much a blatant rip-off.

774
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:23,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other.

775
00:55:26,098 --> 00:55:31,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.

776
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Smurfs Village.

777
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously a game that's out there.

778
00:55:34,361 --> 00:55:35,241
[SPEAKER_12]: It's free to play.

779
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:37,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

780
00:55:54,406 --> 00:55:55,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

781
00:56:19,454 --> 00:56:19,754
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

782
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,422
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you want to say, SalaciousBob?

783
00:56:38,682 --> 00:56:40,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even have kids in my household.

784
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm usually very protective of my stuff.

785
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:45,527
[SPEAKER_11]: For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.

786
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:49,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.

787
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be asked for my password every single time.

788
00:56:54,043 --> 00:57:15,050
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's also ways if you have kids and this is something that you're afraid that might happen there's a way you can also disable first off you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well you can also disable in app purchases and it's opt out though it's not opt in which is the problem it's opt out so you need to make sure you do that

789
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,170
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

790
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom's fault.

791
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:39,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down.

792
00:57:39,739 --> 00:57:45,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I haven't had to... Nobody uses my phone but me, so I haven't had to explore those options.

793
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:46,722
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

794
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:49,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree that they should lock it down, but they're also making it seem that it seems like...

795
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:53,165
[SPEAKER_12]: The kids aren't even aware that it's costing money.

796
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:54,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's my other thought.

797
00:57:54,445 --> 00:58:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that somewhat?

798
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this?

799
00:58:03,631 --> 00:58:05,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess maybe some parents don't know.

800
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:07,254
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not know it's a free Smurfs game.

801
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:12,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think some onus is on the parents.

802
00:58:12,179 --> 00:58:14,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It is negligence on the parents' part for sure.

803
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:16,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right.

804
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.

805
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:31,007
[SPEAKER_12]: They're making it as easy as possible for it to happen so that maybe, say, a kid racks up $30 worth of purchases or something like that.

806
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:32,428
[SPEAKER_12]: The parent might go, shit.

807
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:36,531
[SPEAKER_12]: but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded.

808
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:42,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all of a sudden Capcom's giving them their money back.

809
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:49,061
[SPEAKER_12]: But how many times is this happening that they're not getting their money back or not even trying to get their money back?

810
00:58:50,504 --> 00:59:01,772
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is, it doesn't say, this costs you $5.

811
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:06,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, this costs you 20 fairy dust points.

812
00:59:06,655 --> 00:59:08,016
[SPEAKER_11]: So the kid's like, oh, okay.

813
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:09,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they refill their...

814
00:59:10,037 --> 00:59:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

815
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,502
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always a layer of... Party points?

816
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,283
[SPEAKER_11]: They haven't even... They didn't do Gil?

817
00:59:29,723 --> 00:59:32,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think... It's not really... I think they're just Squeenix coins or something like that.

818
00:59:33,064 --> 00:59:42,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it doesn't actually talk about this is money, $4, because a kid might recognize that, but there's that sort of... I don't know.

819
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:45,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a very... Some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.

820
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:54,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod Touch, you can log off your account before giving it to a kid to play.

821
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,592
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a suggestion.

822
00:59:56,293 --> 01:00:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store to keep their kids occupied.

823
01:00:01,676 --> 01:00:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them watching videos and playing games.

824
01:00:04,457 --> 01:00:06,258
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Link says, parents are being stupid.

825
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:08,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two kids and I know about what these games do.

826
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a clue.

827
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:12,282
[SPEAKER_04]: If something is free, there's a catch.

828
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying, this is a problem.

829
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:33,409
[SPEAKER_12]: So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has told Capcom in no uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.

830
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:38,371
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your game.

831
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:39,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Fix it.

832
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,016
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically what that means.

833
01:00:44,536 --> 01:00:46,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.

834
01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:49,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, basically from Apple and credit card companies.

835
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:53,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't authorize this charge.

836
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:57,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, let's do a chargeback and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.

837
01:00:57,508 --> 01:00:58,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

838
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:00,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

839
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think, though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.

840
01:01:04,505 --> 01:01:05,766
[SPEAKER_04]: They enabled this feature.

841
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:07,529
[SPEAKER_04]: They made it so easy to do.

842
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,172
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to kind of educate people.

843
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:11,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're making money off of it.

844
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:12,455
[SPEAKER_04]: They are making money.

845
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And they approved Capcom's game.

846
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,642
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.

847
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:21,166
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff.

848
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:22,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Apple needs to own some of that.

849
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:26,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not that difficult to patch this shit.

850
01:01:26,591 --> 01:01:27,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, fuck.

851
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:30,034
[SPEAKER_12]: There's games that patch themselves once a week.

852
01:01:30,114 --> 01:01:30,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on.

853
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:32,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Just do it.

854
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:33,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Just fix it.

855
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:35,204
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

856
01:01:35,545 --> 01:01:36,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see what develops with that.

857
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:41,130
[SPEAKER_12]: And there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention to what's going on with your kids.

858
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

859
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,252
[SPEAKER_04]: That still wouldn't stop it.

860
01:01:43,652 --> 01:01:43,952
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

861
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:46,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.

862
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:52,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else is buying this game.

863
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,305
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on all the big gaming blogs.

864
01:01:57,745 --> 01:01:58,126
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes...

865
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:03,389
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true, they are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition.

866
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a Final Shipment.

867
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:08,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised they didn't call it like an Encore Shipment or something like that.

868
01:02:08,653 --> 01:02:19,000
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on a Wii disc.

869
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:19,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

870
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,001
[SPEAKER_04]: No extra frills.

871
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,342
[SPEAKER_04]: No nothing.

872
01:02:22,362 --> 01:02:24,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.

873
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:25,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

874
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:26,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

875
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:27,505
[SPEAKER_04]: How dare I?

876
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:49,813
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but basically here's the thing.

877
01:02:49,953 --> 01:02:51,194
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not in large quantities.

878
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:53,336
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be just as limited as it was before.

879
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,238
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just releasing a few more.

880
01:02:55,298 --> 01:02:58,562
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.

881
01:02:58,822 --> 01:03:03,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack shit, basically.

882
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:11,249
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited, but hey, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.

883
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:19,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But honestly, just tell yourself, it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to port it over to the Wii.

884
01:03:20,031 --> 01:03:20,771
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all it is.

885
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:24,032
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want that soundtrack and you want that book...

886
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:28,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, I guess, but I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.

887
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:31,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.

888
01:03:31,834 --> 01:03:39,279
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.

889
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:46,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.

890
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they want more for it, talk them down.

891
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:58,788
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact that this game is going for that much money online and the fact that they're like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.

892
01:03:59,288 --> 01:03:59,888
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what that means?

893
01:04:00,148 --> 01:04:02,569
[SPEAKER_12]: More of this shit is going to happen coming soon.

894
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:06,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you bet your ass that they're going to fucking reprint that goddamn.

895
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:11,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember the Legend of Zelda bonus that they had for preordering Wind Waker and shit?

896
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:12,112
[SPEAKER_12]: How much you want?

897
01:04:12,172 --> 01:04:14,513
[SPEAKER_12]: But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.

898
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:20,958
[SPEAKER_04]: They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.

899
01:04:21,878 --> 01:04:23,680
[SPEAKER_04]: But they could always do more GameCube games.

900
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:29,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS or Mario Kart or whatever.

901
01:04:29,964 --> 01:04:32,526
[SPEAKER_12]: They could easily do it for another system.

902
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:39,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them and people are dumb enough to purchase them.

903
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's also be real.

904
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:41,873
[SPEAKER_04]: What else is coming out on the Wii?

905
01:04:43,888 --> 01:04:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that awesome looking roleplaying game in Japan that's not coming out here.

906
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:51,130
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports Mix.

907
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,431
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't announced a new title.

908
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.

909
01:04:54,952 --> 01:04:57,653
[SPEAKER_12]: This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?

910
01:04:58,233 --> 01:04:58,293
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

911
01:04:59,508 --> 01:04:59,868
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

912
01:05:26,616 --> 01:05:26,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

913
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:28,277
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't really have a lot.

914
01:05:28,537 --> 01:05:31,078
[SPEAKER_12]: They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff.

915
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:32,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

916
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, more news.

917
01:05:35,941 --> 01:05:36,521
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

918
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have news.

919
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:55,427
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this is going to seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.

920
01:05:55,587 --> 01:05:58,950
[SPEAKER_04]: How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.

921
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:25,845
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's Psychophysiology Lab and Biofeedback Clinic So it at least has a reputable study that was done about it They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression And they played Bejeweled 2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle And they all experienced a significant reduction in anxiety and better mood

922
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:42,729
[SPEAKER_04]: does this explain why sometimes and I don't know how many of y'all do this but like when I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home but I'm just I'm just not feeling you know it's raining out I'm just feeling kind of blah I'll sit there on Facebook and play that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour like is that tie into this

923
01:06:44,663 --> 01:06:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I will admit something.

924
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:50,587
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that towards the end of my job period I was very unhappy.

925
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Very unhappy.

926
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.

927
01:06:57,370 --> 01:07:01,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk and I would always feel better.

928
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.

929
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:21,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks but it was just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air and I found I could get back to work and do fine.

930
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?

931
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft Auto 4.

932
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:31,392
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it for years.

933
01:07:33,021 --> 01:07:34,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not for blowing off stress.

934
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:37,264
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes my coworkers more stressful.

935
01:07:37,284 --> 01:07:42,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your way to relax?

936
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:44,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your way to kind of unwind at work, right?

937
01:07:45,048 --> 01:07:46,169
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit?

938
01:07:46,189 --> 01:07:48,270
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't really matter.

939
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.

940
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,213
[SPEAKER_12]: People like games.

941
01:07:53,233 --> 01:07:54,274
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's lots of things.

942
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't sit and do that with Final Fantasy 2, for example, which I was still playing on my phone.

943
01:08:00,736 --> 01:08:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.

944
01:08:03,098 --> 01:08:05,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game.

945
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:15,830
[SPEAKER_07]: But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back to later, it's easier.

946
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,573
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.

947
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:26,299
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard, and clearly I'm not alone.

948
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:56,357
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt in our chatroom says I can attest to this, ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty Rickster in our chatroom says maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax play modes interesting, that is true Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but

949
01:08:57,097 --> 01:08:57,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

950
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:12,166
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really just casual games or if other games are involved in it.

951
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,928
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do see where...

952
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:18,189
[SPEAKER_07]: New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.

953
01:09:43,948 --> 01:09:50,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.

954
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:52,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they don't frighten me.

955
01:09:52,853 --> 01:09:53,814
[SPEAKER_07]: The games don't frighten me.

956
01:09:54,854 --> 01:09:55,575
[SPEAKER_07]: People frighten me.

957
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:56,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

958
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:58,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.

959
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:04,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.

960
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,422
[SPEAKER_07]: People freak me out more than the game does.

961
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:09,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And fake blood freaks me out.

962
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:16,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, video games do help you relax until you start kicking and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.

963
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:19,770
[SPEAKER_04]: They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.

964
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:21,451
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what stresses me the hell out?

965
01:10:22,192 --> 01:10:24,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Playing fighting games with Dan.

966
01:10:24,714 --> 01:10:25,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's a dick.

967
01:10:27,136 --> 01:10:27,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I love you!

968
01:10:29,418 --> 01:10:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's a jerk when he wins.

969
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,300
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a sore winner.

970
01:10:34,962 --> 01:10:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.

971
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:41,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start in the U.S.

972
01:10:41,385 --> 01:10:41,826
[SPEAKER_04]: with Loki.

973
01:10:42,046 --> 01:10:45,827
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out this week, which is pretty cool.

974
01:10:47,268 --> 01:10:50,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you I was playing.

975
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.

976
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:59,656
[SPEAKER_12]: But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox 360.

977
01:10:59,716 --> 01:11:04,139
[SPEAKER_12]: That includes early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.

978
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,781
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.

979
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:11,165
[SPEAKER_12]: And then also the Limited Edition, which is on PS3 and PC.

980
01:11:11,285 --> 01:11:13,767
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can check those out.

981
01:11:14,428 --> 01:11:18,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.

982
01:11:18,631 --> 01:11:20,613
[SPEAKER_12]: That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.

983
01:11:21,493 --> 01:11:23,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let's see here.

984
01:11:23,554 --> 01:11:27,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles with the soundtrack.

985
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:29,657
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.

986
01:11:31,218 --> 01:11:36,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice, and Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.

987
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlas saying that they're marking some of that stuff down.

988
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:41,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are coming out this week as well.

989
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:51,969
[SPEAKER_12]: The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi.

990
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:52,650
[SPEAKER_12]: All for $30.

991
01:11:56,172 --> 01:12:17,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Night's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Trackmania, Built to Race Trackmania is an awesome game on PC so you should definitely check it out if you have a Wii that'll be coming out on Wii and I believe also on DS as well it's such a great racing game

992
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,673
[SPEAKER_12]: and then a crappy game called Rec Room.

993
01:12:22,793 --> 01:12:23,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It's coming out on DS.

994
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:24,874
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a portable Wii game.

995
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:26,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Party stuff.

996
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:27,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Fun.

997
01:12:27,796 --> 01:12:32,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Blob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3.

998
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:36,362
[SPEAKER_12]: No PC on that, I guess.

999
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:39,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the original Da Blah, but it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.

1000
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:42,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.

1001
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:46,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people don't remember the first one so well.

1002
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:47,711
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of one of those under the radar.

1003
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:51,093
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a PlayStation 3 that doesn't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.

1004
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:51,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Yippee.

1005
01:12:57,805 --> 01:13:00,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.

1006
01:13:01,026 --> 01:13:01,706
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

1007
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:09,950
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius, that's coming out on PC this week.

1008
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:11,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, probably is another expansion.

1009
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:13,252
[SPEAKER_04]: EverQuest loves their expansions.

1010
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:14,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm surprised.

1011
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,254
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of interesting that they're doing that.

1012
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:18,275
[SPEAKER_12]: And then...

1013
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:21,601
[SPEAKER_12]: What else?

1014
01:13:23,262 --> 01:13:35,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life If you like those hidden picture type games, that's coming out on DS this week That's basically it

1015
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:40,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.

1016
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:47,201
[SPEAKER_04]: This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called Muchi Muchi Pork and Pink Sweets.

1017
01:13:48,002 --> 01:13:49,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's really what it's called.

1018
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Cave, so, uh...

1019
01:13:54,298 --> 01:13:54,818
[SPEAKER_04]: It never came out here.

1020
01:14:20,114 --> 01:14:20,414

1023
01:15:18,643 --> 01:15:35,212
[SPEAKER_04]: you know you love your Gundam games don't lie also it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan it comes out on February 26th I seriously thought about you know the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing that and I was like no

1024
01:15:36,653 --> 01:15:38,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, this is the big week, guys.

1025
01:15:38,694 --> 01:16:05,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Winning 11 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, let's see, Nintendogs Plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle Editions, Leighton Koju to Kisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Leighton, and Combat of Giants Dinosaur 3D.

1026
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:13,685
[SPEAKER_04]: all of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week so that's Saturday, that's the 26th so what games are you going to get on the 3DS when it comes out?

1027
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:20,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats and maybe the Street Fighter game

1028
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:22,378
[SPEAKER_11]: You make bad decisions.

1029
01:16:42,655 --> 01:16:47,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Dead or Alive didn't really interest me that much, but Street Fighter, whatever.

1030
01:16:47,418 --> 01:16:49,419
[SPEAKER_12]: But Dead or Alive, not coming out at launch.

1031
01:16:49,799 --> 01:16:50,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Coming out in May.

1032
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:56,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kind of cool, coming out in May.

1033
01:16:56,523 --> 01:16:58,084
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not coming out right away.

1034
01:16:58,884 --> 01:17:01,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?

1035
01:17:01,426 --> 01:17:01,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

1036
01:17:02,666 --> 01:17:03,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to wait until May.

1037
01:17:04,307 --> 01:17:26,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks cool, I actually wanna, I don't know, I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it, I can't control it I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like living expenses You know what, if I was in that situation, I would probably do the same thing

1038
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:28,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we've paid off all our bills.

1039
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I would sell stuff in the house.

1040
01:17:32,095 --> 01:17:36,239
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not even any rational reason.

1041
01:17:36,339 --> 01:17:38,241
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just ridiculous stuff.

1042
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:40,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's talking that he wants the PlayStation phone.

1043
01:17:40,963 --> 01:17:44,506
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pilotwings game looks pretty awesome if it were coming out at launch.

1044
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's not at launch?

1045
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,089
[SPEAKER_12]: They haven't announced their launch titles.

1046
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:50,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.

1047
01:17:50,351 --> 01:17:52,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Which means they're like, oh, we got nothing.

1048
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:57,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob, can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing it?

1049
01:17:58,502 --> 01:18:00,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see this, but I'm flipping you off right now.

1050
01:18:01,063 --> 01:18:05,144
[SPEAKER_11]: I want you to buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my place.

1051
01:18:06,024 --> 01:18:07,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are assholes.

1052
01:18:07,465 --> 01:18:10,406
[SPEAKER_04]: What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?

1053
01:18:11,406 --> 01:18:13,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Kid Icarus, because you don't play portable games at all.

1054
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:13,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not coming out at launch.

1055
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:15,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's, yeah, I can wait though.

1056
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:16,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously you can't.

1057
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:19,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, launch window games as they're going to, they're like...

1058
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:21,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I love Nintendo.

1059
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,290
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

1060
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:23,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Launch window games.

1061
01:18:23,651 --> 01:18:26,373
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, from launch to three months after launch.

1062
01:18:26,433 --> 01:18:27,694
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a window.

1063
01:18:27,794 --> 01:18:29,975
[SPEAKER_12]: That is... Launch window is that week.

1064
01:18:30,175 --> 01:18:31,456
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a launch window.

1065
01:18:32,997 --> 01:18:34,598
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't launch for three months.

1066
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:35,779
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a launch.

1067
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:36,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, three months is a quarter.

1068
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,941
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the difference between Q2 and Q3.

1069
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:40,262
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, yeah.

1070
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:45,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, but anyways, if we're going to say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool.

1071
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:45,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Dream Trigger.

1072
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:49,268
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a shooter music game, which is kind of cool.

1073
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:50,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1074
01:18:52,156 --> 01:18:59,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate even wanting to say this, but the new Spongebob squiggle pants, the one that's like... No, no, no.

1075
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:00,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like WarioWare.

1076
01:19:01,823 --> 01:19:04,565
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a WarioWare type game.

1077
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:08,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I got not to get... Oh, what was I going to... Not the Spongebob, but the other one.

1078
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask about... Oh, music shooter games.

1079
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:14,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a definitive date for Child of Eden yet?

1080
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:15,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say we have.

1081
01:19:15,913 --> 01:19:16,853
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like in June right now.

1082
01:19:16,873 --> 01:19:17,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1083
01:19:17,214 --> 01:19:17,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1084
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:20,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's got a date on it.

1085
01:19:20,937 --> 01:19:25,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll get there, but I never did the PSP ones because everybody was bitching at me about winning the 3DS.

1086
01:19:25,482 --> 01:19:27,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan.

1087
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:35,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.

1088
01:19:35,412 --> 01:19:37,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now ma'am, we may go to the UK.

1089
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,096
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 22nd, we have Cities in Motion for PC.

1090
01:19:40,316 --> 01:19:43,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The 23rd, we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled Blitz Live.

1091
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:46,981
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 24th, Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm.

1092
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:48,642
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Deblob 2.

1093
01:19:49,622 --> 01:20:06,895
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Grey Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling Together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.

1094
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:09,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm efficient.

1095
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:14,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.

1096
01:20:14,854 --> 01:20:15,154
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1097
01:20:15,714 --> 01:20:20,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see how efficient she is on that.

1098
01:20:20,695 --> 01:20:22,636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

1099
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:28,718
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of odd, but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's in, so...

1100
01:20:30,256 --> 01:20:32,459
[SPEAKER_12]: What's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?

1101
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,921
[SPEAKER_12]: They're releasing tablets.

1102
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:39,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were first coming around.

1103
01:20:41,112 --> 01:20:41,492
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.

1104
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:11,727
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, they do have the S1 tablet.

1105
01:21:12,207 --> 01:21:17,972
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a PlayStation Suite certified tablet, which means it's going to be running the Android operating system.

1106
01:21:18,892 --> 01:21:22,435
[SPEAKER_12]: And they haven't really said what it's going to look like.

1107
01:21:22,775 --> 01:21:28,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Although there was a rumored design, it was some sort of tablet that actually folds.

1108
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,664
[SPEAKER_12]: It has like a screen that actually bends, which is kind of funky, but cool, I guess.

1109
01:21:34,385 --> 01:21:34,545
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

1110
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:39,048
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.

1111
01:21:41,930 --> 01:22:03,086
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and PlayStation Network services, delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across the... I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.

1112
01:22:03,647 --> 01:22:03,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh...

1113
01:22:05,728 --> 01:22:28,499
[SPEAKER_12]: so yeah they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out in the market and it plays PlayStation 1 games no one I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch to play a PlayStation 1 game on a goddamn tablet it's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of signed agreed

1114
01:22:29,794 --> 01:22:30,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's the other thing, too.

1115
01:22:31,055 --> 01:22:36,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what?

1116
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:41,204
[SPEAKER_12]: We may just extend this PlayStation Suite to the Apple iPad or something like that.

1117
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:46,368
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot more people, I'm sure, have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever, and they can play their games on there.

1118
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:57,818
[SPEAKER_12]: But I, for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because, one, it would take up a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity.

1119
01:22:58,138 --> 01:23:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: and two, it would play like shit because touch controls here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be dead when I start using it for the first time right?

1120
01:23:11,884 --> 01:23:12,804
[SPEAKER_12]: that's the real question

1121
01:23:15,069 --> 01:23:15,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1122
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:37,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wait it out.

1123
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, there's no need to rush in to play PlayStation 1 games.

1124
01:23:41,022 --> 01:23:51,328
[SPEAKER_12]: If you really need to play PlayStation 1 games, you can get a PlayStation 1, a PlayStation 2, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer.

1125
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:53,789
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just wait.

1126
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,931
[SPEAKER_12]: There are plenty of ways to do it.

1127
01:23:56,651 --> 01:23:58,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's something you shouldn't wait for.

1128
01:23:58,832 --> 01:24:03,493
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should buy it new.

1129
01:24:03,894 --> 01:24:08,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.

1130
01:24:08,595 --> 01:24:17,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.

1131
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:19,899
[SPEAKER_04]: This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.

1132
01:24:20,339 --> 01:24:22,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.

1133
01:24:23,403 --> 01:24:28,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the PlayStation 3 used.

1134
01:24:28,971 --> 01:24:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, just want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official quote on this, that's why this is news this week, because they did make a comment on it.

1135
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:43,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the PSN key has been consumed with a disc, it cannot be resold or replayed with the second user adding a sub.

1136
01:24:43,844 --> 01:24:47,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the original consumer can use that account.

1137
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:51,708
[SPEAKER_04]: They say the retail disc and the PSN code, they are one and the same.

1138
01:24:51,948 --> 01:24:53,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you use it, it is gone.

1139
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: A second-hand user cannot obtain a new code.

1140
01:24:56,610 --> 01:25:02,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And the only reason this is happening and just because it's an MMO and because it has a 30-day free trial.

1141
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:09,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, people would just be able to pop it in the different systems or just loan it to friends and have 30-day trials for everybody.

1142
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:09,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Which...

1143
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, honestly, it's not a bad idea.

1144
01:25:13,303 --> 01:25:14,984
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good way to get people hooked on your game.

1145
01:25:15,064 --> 01:25:20,308
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single game out there.

1146
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:22,790
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when they do that, people will be pissed.

1147
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,951
[SPEAKER_12]: This is, you know, this is all right.

1148
01:25:25,332 --> 01:25:26,913
[SPEAKER_12]: This is expected with an MMO.

1149
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, with an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.

1150
01:25:31,461 --> 01:25:45,909
[SPEAKER_11]: So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really care where you... Like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.

1151
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:50,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to go out and buy another disc because that serial number is attached to my subscription.

1152
01:25:50,732 --> 01:25:55,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than buying them through Blizzard, but they still work.

1153
01:25:55,575 --> 01:25:56,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And you shouldn't be such a...

1154
01:26:19,282 --> 01:26:19,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1155
01:26:37,888 --> 01:26:47,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, in theory, say your friend has the game also and he lost his disc and you're a kind soul and want to loan him your disc, that is absolutely fine.

1156
01:26:47,642 --> 01:26:48,683
[SPEAKER_12]: It will work just fine.

1157
01:26:48,763 --> 01:26:53,090
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to play it.

1158
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,692
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no extra code.

1159
01:26:56,696 --> 01:27:03,939
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you cancelled your subscription.

1160
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:31,001
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360.

1161
01:27:31,962 --> 01:27:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in the game and get 30 days free.

1162
01:27:37,145 --> 01:27:41,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and here's the other thing, too, about the DC Universe thing.

1163
01:27:41,308 --> 01:27:46,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just say it's not as prone as the 360, but let's say your system dies.

1164
01:27:47,992 --> 01:27:48,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Crack.

1165
01:27:49,533 --> 01:27:50,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's tied to your system.

1166
01:27:52,955 --> 01:27:54,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess you have to call their customer service.

1167
01:27:55,717 --> 01:27:55,977
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1168
01:27:56,468 --> 01:27:57,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyhow, I got one more.

1169
01:27:58,430 --> 01:27:59,111
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait, I lied.

1170
01:27:59,151 --> 01:27:59,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1171
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:00,492
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my last story.

1172
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.

1173
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:12,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online for 30 days for free in serial numbers.

1174
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to a day when we had a single player game in front of us on the TV and we liked it.

1175
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Psycho Soldier Psycho Soldier

1176
01:28:46,502 --> 01:28:50,206
[SPEAKER_07]: She's just a little girl with power inside, burning bright...

1177
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:06,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Vocal Soundtrack

1178
01:29:27,147 --> 01:29:37,690
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a sequel to SNK's Athena and this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character Athena Asamiya comes from as well as C. Kenzo.

1179
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:41,692
[SPEAKER_04]: As that NES game way back in the game, right?

1180
01:29:42,052 --> 01:29:42,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1181
01:29:42,572 --> 01:29:44,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1182
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:50,875
[SPEAKER_07]: This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad in 1987.

1183
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:55,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you just asked for.

1184
01:29:55,752 --> 01:29:58,793
[SPEAKER_11]: There's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.

1185
01:29:59,134 --> 01:30:01,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play a little bit of that.

1186
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:04,456
I'm jamming.

1187
01:30:04,536 --> 01:30:05,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm jamming.

1188
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:16,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Better singing.

1189
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:17,926
[SPEAKER_04]: A little less screeching, yeah.

1190
01:30:32,373 --> 01:30:35,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, she's running around with psychic abilities.

1191
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:39,702
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to.

1192
01:30:40,123 --> 01:30:42,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you could just run into a wall.

1193
01:30:42,746 --> 01:30:46,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Or into a trap or something that would just completely kill you.

1194
01:30:47,452 --> 01:30:47,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1195
01:30:48,953 --> 01:31:11,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So, her buddy Seikenso is player 2, and it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12 as their default outfits, I believe, or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game anyway.

1196
01:31:12,167 --> 01:31:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of this theme.

1197
01:31:19,823 --> 01:31:21,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I think I put one in as well.

1198
01:31:23,021 --> 01:31:26,003
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.

1199
01:31:26,264 --> 01:31:27,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's a side-scroller.

1200
01:31:27,424 --> 01:31:28,285
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got different levels.

1201
01:31:28,325 --> 01:31:30,587
[SPEAKER_07]: You have rocks and destructible objects.

1202
01:31:31,127 --> 01:31:31,988
[SPEAKER_07]: You can blow them up.

1203
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:33,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got different enemies.

1204
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:39,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And you basically go horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects.

1205
01:31:39,253 --> 01:31:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can use your psycho energy to get different attacks.

1206
01:31:42,436 --> 01:31:47,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Either by using a shield of rotating spheres, which was one of her moves in King of Fighters.

1207
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.

1208
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:50,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1209
01:31:52,203 --> 01:31:52,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1210
01:31:54,326 --> 01:32:02,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the special items happen to be different.

1211
01:32:02,754 --> 01:32:08,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.

1212
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:16,328
[SPEAKER_07]: But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them, or rams them into an enemy.

1213
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:24,034
[SPEAKER_07]: The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu.

1214
01:32:26,255 --> 01:32:30,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.

1215
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:34,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The song came out on a cassette.

1216
01:32:35,522 --> 01:32:40,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only available for people who purchased the Famicom version of Athena.

1217
01:32:41,243 --> 01:32:46,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending theme.

1218
01:32:47,964 --> 01:32:51,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.

1219
01:32:52,345 --> 01:32:55,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the Psychic Soldier team in 94 and King of Fighters 96.

1220
01:32:56,886 --> 01:33:00,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was Athena's theme in King of Fighters 97 and King of Fighters 2002.

1221
01:33:04,547 --> 01:33:13,653
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was an 87 by Imagine Software and it kind of got some decent success.

1222
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:20,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It got an 8 out of 10 for one rating and a 6 to 9 and 75% for other places but said it was really slow.

1223
01:33:23,299 --> 01:33:26,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Athena and Kenzo have both been in the King of Fighters series.

1224
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:29,563
[SPEAKER_07]: They've also, of course, been in SNK vs. Capcom.

1225
01:33:30,283 --> 01:33:30,964
[SPEAKER_07]: They were...

1226
01:33:32,945 --> 01:34:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit and Kenso was in his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000 as Psycho Soldier Kenso also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystallis on the NES awesome and that's pretty much it it's a fun little waste of time I've got a main ROM of it

1227
01:34:02,828 --> 01:34:04,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

1228
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:07,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.

1229
01:34:08,418 --> 01:34:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You see why it's notable?

1230
01:34:09,961 --> 01:34:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1231
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:12,626
[SPEAKER_07]: First in-game vocal soundtrack.

1232
01:34:13,026 --> 01:34:13,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1233
01:34:13,387 --> 01:34:13,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1234
01:34:14,246 --> 01:34:20,910
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with Part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics.

1235
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:24,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to get those in, if you haven't already, at twitter.com slash OLR.

1236
01:34:24,572 --> 01:34:32,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to get into some rapid news and including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise download content that showed up, among some other things.

1237
01:34:32,936 --> 01:34:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, we have some more news development in a lawsuit against Activision.

1238
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:38,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk about that.

1239
01:34:39,019 --> 01:34:42,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.

1240
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:49,649
[SPEAKER_04]: of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week it is all coming up when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1241
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:57,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1242
01:34:57,948 --> 01:35:04,572
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live on this February the 20th of 2011 with the 402nd episode of our show.

1243
01:35:04,972 --> 01:35:17,118
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to tune in live to us sometimes, visit us at www.orangeloungeradio.com and follow the link on over to allgames.com where we tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

1244
01:35:17,538 --> 01:35:21,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics.

1245
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:28,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling, playing this game, Bulletstorm.

1246
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:29,130
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so funny about it?

1247
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:29,491
[SPEAKER_04]: You like this?

1248
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:32,314
[SPEAKER_12]: There's just a lot of, like, I like the writing in it, I guess.

1249
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:33,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1250
01:35:56,796 --> 01:36:01,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny.

1251
01:36:01,782 --> 01:36:09,110
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they turn around and they see the corpse of the guy near the window with a sticky mine on the window.

1252
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:10,172
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's all...

1253
01:36:12,113 --> 01:36:12,653
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn it.

1254
01:36:13,014 --> 01:36:14,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the thing just explodes.

1255
01:36:14,554 --> 01:36:15,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1256
01:36:15,054 --> 01:36:15,755
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty funny.

1257
01:36:16,595 --> 01:36:16,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1258
01:36:17,015 --> 01:36:20,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's get into some plugs for the sideshows that we do.

1259
01:36:20,577 --> 01:36:24,038
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?

1260
01:36:24,198 --> 01:36:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.

1261
01:36:30,101 --> 01:36:31,521
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually publish on Tuesdays.

1262
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:35,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We are at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

1263
01:36:35,143 --> 01:36:40,185
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.

1264
01:36:40,945 --> 01:36:41,726
[SPEAKER_07]: We are awesome!

1265
01:36:42,326 --> 01:36:42,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to us.

1266
01:36:43,447 --> 01:36:45,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow.

1267
01:36:47,351 --> 01:36:53,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.

1268
01:36:53,676 --> 01:36:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.

1269
01:36:59,682 --> 01:37:03,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's available on iTunes and there will be a real website coming soon.

1270
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:09,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.

1271
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:11,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And then your Twitter topics will be coming up.

1272
01:37:11,752 --> 01:37:14,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is your very last chance to get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.

1273
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:17,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?

1274
01:37:18,188 --> 01:37:20,470
[SPEAKER_12]: EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.

1275
01:37:22,131 --> 01:37:23,791
[SPEAKER_12]: That's sad.

1276
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:26,293
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure.

1277
01:37:26,453 --> 01:37:29,955
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a matter of when that time is and what we do with it.

1278
01:37:29,995 --> 01:37:33,417
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a small team on it and I'm excited about what we'll do.

1279
01:37:35,098 --> 01:37:36,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.

1280
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3 so I'm sure that's got a lot of...

1281
01:37:42,322 --> 01:37:45,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Time being utilized on that and resources.

1282
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:52,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there will be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.

1283
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:57,431
[SPEAKER_12]: EA responded a little bit about it as well.

1284
01:37:57,451 --> 01:38:03,075
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.

1285
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:07,857
[SPEAKER_12]: DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3.

1286
01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:09,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing further to announce.

1287
01:38:10,439 --> 01:38:14,445
[SPEAKER_12]: So, maybe down the line.

1288
01:38:15,927 --> 01:38:17,670
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a pretty fun game, though.

1289
01:38:18,251 --> 01:38:19,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully there will be a sequel.

1290
01:38:20,865 --> 01:38:24,467
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out on the PlayStation 1 Classics.

1291
01:38:24,828 --> 01:38:26,148
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.

1292
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:28,270
[SPEAKER_12]: Finally making its way out.

1293
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:31,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, no JogCon support.

1294
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:32,092
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of sad.

1295
01:38:33,593 --> 01:38:37,775
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be able to play the game, though, very soon, though, on the PSP and the PlayStation 3.

1296
01:38:38,916 --> 01:38:47,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge Racer Unbound is coming out.

1297
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:47,701
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of neat.

1298
01:38:49,843 --> 01:38:53,507
[SPEAKER_12]: No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.

1299
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:56,110
[SPEAKER_12]: March.

1300
01:38:56,811 --> 01:39:01,837
[SPEAKER_12]: So probably around the time that the 3D versions come out.

1301
01:39:03,433 --> 01:39:08,036
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pendulum Mixed Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me On Fire, and Salt In The Wounds

1302
01:39:25,968 --> 01:39:29,569
[SPEAKER_12]: That is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.

1303
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:37,832
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft points each.

1304
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:44,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a little disappointed that they didn't have Hold Your Color or Self vs. Self, my two favorite songs on there.

1305
01:39:44,774 --> 01:39:45,434
[SPEAKER_12]: But, hey, whatever.

1306
01:39:45,514 --> 01:39:46,034
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty cool.

1307
01:39:46,234 --> 01:39:48,455
[SPEAKER_12]: So definitely check that out since.

1308
01:39:49,395 --> 01:40:14,880
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the last content you're getting yeah so since you know last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed is it safe to say the DJ Hero is being yes okay because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release I just sort of it's okay so yeah as of right now it is I mean who knows they could always change their mind just because they say oh we're never gonna do it again doesn't mean anything

1309
01:40:16,294 --> 01:40:17,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelly Summer, CEO of Red Octane

1310
01:40:35,153 --> 01:41:01,492
[SPEAKER_04]: basically says that Activision abused the property quote Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly they abused it there's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue it's a great product my gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero not every game can be a billion dollar franchise but maybe that's what Activision wants I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still a market for this product and then show them up

1311
01:41:02,012 --> 01:41:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.

1312
01:41:04,594 --> 01:41:06,035
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't thrown products out there.

1313
01:41:06,295 --> 01:41:10,097
[SPEAKER_04]: They've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still a strong franchise.

1314
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:14,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.

1315
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:20,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong with just putting out one game every couple or even three or four years.

1316
01:41:20,864 --> 01:41:29,830
[SPEAKER_11]: If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around, I think.

1317
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:30,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so, too.

1318
01:41:32,652 --> 01:41:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining, it is now out.

1319
01:41:38,215 --> 01:41:41,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate.

1320
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:47,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is available for you to download on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.

1321
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,881
[SPEAKER_04]: The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what?

1322
01:41:51,341 --> 01:41:51,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

1323
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:55,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if they need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.

1324
01:41:56,163 --> 01:42:00,645
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes.

1325
01:42:00,945 --> 01:42:04,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.

1326
01:42:05,307 --> 01:42:09,990
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.

1327
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess nothing is really for free, but hey.

1328
01:42:13,791 --> 01:42:17,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys, but I have an email address that I sign up for everything with.

1329
01:42:17,653 --> 01:42:18,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not my regular email.

1330
01:42:20,155 --> 01:42:25,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretel Bot Pack is now out for LittleBigPlanet 2.

1331
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,761
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is out there.

1332
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:35,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's this whole full story, cutscenes, voice acting, original score, prizes to get.

1333
01:42:35,668 --> 01:42:37,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all available out there.

1334
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:39,611
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way.

1335
01:42:43,394 --> 01:42:43,835
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura Well

1336
01:43:12,674 --> 01:43:18,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.

1337
01:43:19,278 --> 01:43:22,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch.

1338
01:43:24,761 --> 01:43:28,203
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes.

1339
01:43:30,644 --> 01:43:31,826
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1340
01:43:50,194 --> 01:43:55,738
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dan the other day was talking about needing four more PS3s and monitors, and I said, no.

1341
01:43:56,318 --> 01:44:02,602
[SPEAKER_07]: You spent $150 on your driving rig, plus a little bit extra getting those seats from the pick and pull, no.

1342
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.

1343
01:44:07,546 --> 01:44:13,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the five monitors.

1344
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:14,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It already had three monitors.

1345
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:17,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's actually a YouTube up of someone playing five monitored.

1346
01:44:17,773 --> 01:44:19,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Five monitored, da, da, da, da, da.

1347
01:44:20,214 --> 01:44:21,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty hot, actually.

1348
01:44:21,434 --> 01:44:22,495
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, no, don't need it.

1349
01:44:25,155 --> 01:44:26,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Billy Mitchell.

1350
01:44:27,836 --> 01:44:29,136
[SPEAKER_07]: He's such a jerk.

1351
01:44:30,257 --> 01:44:32,097
[SPEAKER_07]: He just needs to go back to selling his damn barbecue sauce.

1352
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:36,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade.

1353
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:38,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It's at the Orlando International Airport.

1354
01:44:39,839 --> 01:44:43,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks very Donkey Kong-ish.

1355
01:44:44,621 --> 01:44:45,981
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's no Donkey Kong machine anywhere.

1356
01:44:46,141 --> 01:44:46,481
[SPEAKER_07]: and there.

1357
01:44:47,982 --> 01:44:51,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score because Steve Wiebe was still better.

1358
01:44:51,805 --> 01:44:54,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget there's a third guy now.

1359
01:44:54,327 --> 01:44:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the dentist, Hank Shen.

1360
01:44:57,129 --> 01:44:58,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what else is funny too?

1361
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:00,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently that arcade's been there for a while.

1362
01:45:00,411 --> 01:45:02,313
[SPEAKER_12]: They just keep rebranding it as something else.

1363
01:45:02,913 --> 01:45:31,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Well now we have Step Mania without a pad It's a Kinect hack Yay So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the pad You just play where you are I guess I'd have to see this in motion There's a video of it You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania I guess Good times

1364
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:36,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's it.

1365
01:46:08,825 --> 01:46:11,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.

1366
01:46:11,226 --> 01:46:19,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR, and we read your tweets here on the show and respond to them as appropriate.

1367
01:46:19,331 --> 01:46:22,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight?

1368
01:46:22,073 --> 01:46:29,297
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start off with Blue Swim tonight tweets us, Did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?

1369
01:46:29,838 --> 01:46:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?

1370
01:46:32,259 --> 01:46:33,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you know where this is going.

1371
01:46:34,251 --> 01:46:35,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no.

1372
01:46:35,452 --> 01:46:38,794
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually did watch it today, and I have a word for the race, Rob.

1373
01:46:39,794 --> 01:46:42,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Lusterfuck.

1374
01:46:42,356 --> 01:46:45,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, that's what it was?

1375
01:46:45,177 --> 01:46:50,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance?

1376
01:46:50,922 --> 01:46:56,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it was great, though, because they literally... It was like one of those things, you totally jinxed the race.

1377
01:46:56,927 --> 01:47:02,492
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they're all... Now, we've seen some pretty good driving today, all of a sudden, crash!

1378
01:47:02,592 --> 01:47:05,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?

1379
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:08,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was won by the 20-year-old guy.

1380
01:47:09,258 --> 01:47:13,661
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, well, with 50 laps down, there were...

1381
01:47:14,982 --> 01:47:17,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1382
01:47:45,329 --> 01:47:46,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think that's pretty impressive.

1383
01:47:47,733 --> 01:47:52,178
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just because he was being smart and everybody else was like, oh, follow this guy.

1384
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:52,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1385
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on to some other tweets.

1386
01:47:56,072 --> 01:47:57,954
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100 Matt sends us a couple stories.

1387
01:47:58,014 --> 01:47:59,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is some big news out of New York City.

1388
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:05,780
[SPEAKER_04]: The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.

1389
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:09,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.

1390
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1391
01:48:11,705 --> 01:48:15,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Several places are reporting this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.

1392
01:48:15,908 --> 01:48:23,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Several places are reporting that Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.

1393
01:48:25,494 --> 01:48:33,039
[SPEAKER_04]: According to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being in business and will be closing on the 23rd.

1394
01:48:33,099 --> 01:48:35,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sure if that's this month or next month.

1395
01:48:35,661 --> 01:48:59,706
[SPEAKER_04]: so wow that's crazy though because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting down over here so that's really sad that you know you have the west coast and the east coast big arcades just bam bam shutting down I'd heard about that arcade before I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some of the games so sad to hear it that's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too

1396
01:49:00,786 --> 01:49:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.

1397
01:49:01,647 --> 01:49:03,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Just sad for arcades in general.

1398
01:49:03,868 --> 01:49:08,411
[SPEAKER_04]: This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.

1399
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:10,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they didn't have enough ticket-spinning machines.

1400
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:22,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's just they're not a draw for that shopping center or whatever, so they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center so they go spend money at those stores.

1401
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Or so people want to put stores into the shopping center.

1402
01:49:25,901 --> 01:49:26,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1403
01:49:27,142 --> 01:49:28,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, TigerClaw sends us a tweet.

1404
01:49:28,983 --> 01:49:32,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Can a controller be programmed to speedrun Super Mario Bros.?

1405
01:49:33,445 --> 01:49:34,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1406
01:49:35,225 --> 01:49:40,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey website thingy they got now.

1407
01:49:40,728 --> 01:49:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: ca.kotaku.com Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?

1408
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:46,790
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.

1409
01:49:48,451 --> 01:49:49,332
[SPEAKER_12]: so it's the old format.

1410
01:49:49,392 --> 01:49:59,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five minutes.

1411
01:50:00,357 --> 01:50:04,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They are saying that the mod is real even though some people were calling it a fake.

1412
01:50:05,519 --> 01:50:16,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could plug this in and say, hey guys, look what I can do, and then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically, and it's actually doing the speedrun for you?

1413
01:50:17,246 --> 01:50:19,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?

1414
01:50:19,307 --> 01:50:21,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's just because, hey, let's see if we can do this.

1415
01:50:22,008 --> 01:50:22,989
[SPEAKER_12]: That's basically it.

1416
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:23,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Or that.

1417
01:50:23,609 --> 01:50:23,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that.

1418
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:29,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say I've been a member of OLR since 2002.

1419
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the awesome show, guys.

1420
01:50:31,653 --> 01:50:32,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's a very long time.

1421
01:50:32,934 --> 01:50:36,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for listening that long.

1422
01:50:36,115 --> 01:50:39,897
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple people tweeting us about this, so I should read this.

1423
01:50:39,977 --> 01:50:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Both Defective Candy and Tigerclaw tweeted us this story, and it's about Mexico State Congress asks for a ban.

1424
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Juarez the Cartel

1425
01:51:16,886 --> 01:51:17,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I kind of agree.

1426
01:51:17,567 --> 01:51:18,828
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that big of a game.

1427
01:51:18,848 --> 01:51:19,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1428
01:51:35,174 --> 01:51:38,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.

1429
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and also, we have some listeners that live in Mexico, and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries anyway, because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something that does hit a little close to home.

1430
01:52:00,879 --> 01:52:09,102
[SPEAKER_04]: One more tweet here from DarkTetsuya who tweets us saying, So it's a couple months till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.

1431
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot WonderCon is coming up.

1432
01:52:10,903 --> 01:52:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?

1433
01:52:13,684 --> 01:52:14,684
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1st through the 3rd?

1434
01:52:15,405 --> 01:52:15,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1435
01:52:15,665 --> 01:52:16,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was yawning.

1436
01:52:16,585 --> 01:52:17,346
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

1437
01:52:17,406 --> 01:52:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Second only to Comic-Con, right?

1438
01:52:19,227 --> 01:52:19,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1439
01:52:20,107 --> 01:52:25,210
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long after Game Developers Conference before E3.

1440
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

1441
01:52:25,991 --> 01:52:27,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we see some game announcements.

1442
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:29,733
[SPEAKER_11]: It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.

1443
01:52:30,213 --> 01:52:33,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm used to it being usually... You said it was in April?

1444
01:52:34,315 --> 01:52:35,276
[SPEAKER_04]: April 1st through 3rd.

1445
01:52:35,816 --> 01:52:38,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually it's around this time, to be honest.

1446
01:52:38,758 --> 01:52:39,218
[SPEAKER_11]: February.

1447
01:52:39,578 --> 01:52:40,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Moscone Center or nearby.

1448
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:43,160
[SPEAKER_11]: They must have bumped it out a little.

1449
01:52:43,461 --> 01:52:43,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1450
01:52:44,301 --> 01:52:45,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for Twitter this week.

1451
01:52:45,882 --> 01:52:49,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.

1452
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:52,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more news.

1453
01:52:53,645 --> 01:53:02,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking the PlayStation 3.

1454
01:53:03,528 --> 01:53:07,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak.

1455
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, multiple jailbreaks at this point.

1456
01:53:11,882 --> 01:53:20,708
[SPEAKER_12]: The PlayStation Blog Post warns users, Notice unauthorized circumvention devices for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.

1457
01:53:21,109 --> 01:53:25,012
[SPEAKER_12]: These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.

1458
01:53:25,572 --> 01:53:37,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system, software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system, and code of conduct provisions.

1459
01:53:38,882 --> 01:53:46,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Violation of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates the consumer's guarantee for that system.

1460
01:53:46,784 --> 01:53:51,766
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright laws.

1461
01:53:52,526 --> 01:54:07,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access to the PlayStation Network and access to Curiosity services through PlayStation 3 system terminated permanently.

1462
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:18,947
[SPEAKER_12]: To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.

1463
01:54:20,732 --> 01:54:34,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop using this modified property.

1464
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:36,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Change your ways or else.

1465
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:40,198
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.

1466
01:54:40,898 --> 01:54:46,700
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically saying, obviously, that they don't want people doing that.

1467
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:47,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Or they'll ban you.

1468
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:56,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there.

1469
01:54:56,782 --> 01:55:00,784
[SPEAKER_12]: A new hack that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.

1470
01:55:01,824 --> 01:55:03,964
[SPEAKER_12]: The hack can also be used to ban another console.

1471
01:55:04,025 --> 01:55:14,748
[SPEAKER_12]: All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a refurb warehouse or a second-hand seller or some idiot that's willing to give up that information.

1472
01:55:16,088 --> 01:55:17,969
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of funny.

1473
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:31,997
[SPEAKER_12]: And then finally, Geohot, or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony, has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.

1474
01:55:32,438 --> 01:55:35,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And now what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?

1475
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:37,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but this is not for him.

1476
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:42,684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going strictly to his... He got his lawyers okay for it, so it must be all right.

1477
01:55:43,324 --> 01:55:45,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Donations here are for legal defense only.

1478
01:55:46,186 --> 01:55:48,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I have checked with my lawyers before setting this up.

1479
01:55:48,268 --> 01:55:52,631
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.

1480
01:56:05,881 --> 01:56:17,613
[SPEAKER_12]: They tried to sue a guy for getting his AIBO to run non-Sony approved tricks, making it apparent that they don't really care about privacy, they care about control.

1481
01:56:18,754 --> 01:56:24,140
[SPEAKER_12]: And they also said Sony vs. Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about that.

1482
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:28,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's an advocate against mass piracy.

1483
01:56:28,181 --> 01:56:30,901
[SPEAKER_12]: He does not distribute any copyrighted work but his own.

1484
01:56:31,641 --> 01:56:33,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says he's not going to take this crap lying down.

1485
01:56:34,302 --> 01:56:38,222
[SPEAKER_12]: And he's even pro-DRM in a sense.

1486
01:56:39,223 --> 01:56:44,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, why should I care about your personal legal troubles?

1487
01:56:44,883 --> 01:56:45,384
[SPEAKER_12]: You shouldn't.

1488
01:56:46,044 --> 01:56:52,465
[SPEAKER_12]: And he says, if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never ask for donations.

1489
01:56:54,166 --> 01:56:55,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I see what that's a dig at.

1490
01:56:56,456 --> 01:56:57,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Nero, um...

1491
01:56:59,878 --> 01:57:00,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

1492
01:57:02,119 --> 01:57:04,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there.

1493
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:07,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to beat this issue to death.

1494
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:10,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come up on almost every episode for the past few weeks about this whole issue.

1495
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:17,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does seem that this is moving faster in a legal sense than these types of stories usually do.

1496
01:57:17,642 --> 01:57:23,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm about to get into another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year now.

1497
01:57:23,263 --> 01:57:24,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you've got enough money.

1498
01:57:24,243 --> 01:57:26,264
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.

1499
01:57:26,624 --> 01:57:27,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1500
01:57:27,765 --> 01:57:29,567
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of the worry.

1501
01:57:30,287 --> 01:57:32,489
[SPEAKER_12]: His thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?

1502
01:57:32,649 --> 01:57:41,037
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology on the PlayStation blog for ever removing it.

1503
01:57:41,297 --> 01:57:43,639
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be good PR for Sony and Lord knows they could use it.

1504
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:44,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want an AIBO.

1505
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:48,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.

1506
01:57:49,064 --> 01:57:50,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Those batteries are fickle as shit.

1507
01:57:52,487 --> 01:57:52,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1508
01:57:55,715 --> 01:57:56,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

1509
01:57:57,437 --> 01:57:59,459
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, Donate to help you.

1510
01:57:59,499 --> 01:58:01,641
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.

1511
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:02,802
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not.

1512
01:58:04,043 --> 01:58:06,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Kakaroto explains this really well.

1513
01:58:06,565 --> 01:58:14,553
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, I have never played the PS3 online ever and frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.

1514
01:58:14,593 --> 01:58:19,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Security 101 is why is the security in the client anyways?

1515
01:58:19,637 --> 01:58:20,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I had no idea this would happen.

1516
01:58:21,278 --> 01:58:25,800
[SPEAKER_12]: I am in full support of the cheaters being permabanned from the PlayStation Network.

1517
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:35,243
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, long story short, basically, he needs money, and obviously he feels that he did nothing wrong, and he very well may have done nothing wrong.

1518
01:58:35,323 --> 01:58:46,348
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, Sony owns your system, according to them, and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that you purchased.

1519
01:58:46,828 --> 01:58:48,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, the stuff that he did...

1520
01:58:49,429 --> 01:58:49,709
[SPEAKER_12]: and DarkSakura.

1521
01:59:12,816 --> 01:59:14,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get to this comment from chat.

1522
01:59:15,077 --> 01:59:20,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week.

1523
01:59:20,818 --> 01:59:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room.

1524
01:59:24,599 --> 01:59:31,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key gen tunes as their only signature?

1525
01:59:31,601 --> 01:59:33,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those tunes were actually pretty good too.

1526
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,911
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff.

1527
01:59:36,931 --> 01:59:38,652
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people want fame.

1528
01:59:40,313 --> 01:59:50,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I think once he hacked the iPod and iOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff, that whole thing became kind of legal now.

1529
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:52,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's gone to his head a little bit.

1530
01:59:52,701 --> 01:59:54,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, let's crack the Uncrackable type thing.

1531
01:59:55,603 --> 01:59:56,283
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

1532
01:59:56,924 --> 01:59:57,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1533
01:59:58,968 --> 02:00:01,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.

1534
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:06,716
[SPEAKER_04]: This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides in this case, I don't know.

1535
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:11,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is about, remember this, No Doubt vs. Guitar Hero.

1536
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:15,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Or should I say Band Hero specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.

1537
02:00:16,505 --> 02:00:18,627
[SPEAKER_04]: No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.

1538
02:00:19,148 --> 02:00:22,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, according to a recent report in the LA Times,

1539
02:00:23,071 --> 02:00:45,802
[SPEAKER_04]: a panel of judges has agreed with a lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit by no doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from like Taylor Swift and

1540
02:00:46,062 --> 02:00:52,126
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do Flava Flav or whatever.

1541
02:00:52,246 --> 02:01:00,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain why Guitar Hero went really wrong.

1542
02:01:01,172 --> 02:01:02,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not the lawsuits.

1543
02:01:03,394 --> 02:01:04,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that.

1544
02:01:04,734 --> 02:01:06,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that this whole like...

1545
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of care for the material?

1546
02:01:12,861 --> 02:01:24,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the fine print or whatever.

1547
02:01:24,966 --> 02:01:29,848
[SPEAKER_12]: They assumed that something was going to happen with their characters only singing their own songs and stuff like that.

1548
02:01:30,268 --> 02:01:38,037
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists in their games?

1549
02:01:38,218 --> 02:01:42,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.

1550
02:01:43,043 --> 02:01:44,645
[SPEAKER_12]: It's your own created characters.

1551
02:01:45,066 --> 02:01:46,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you even need these in there?

1552
02:01:47,128 --> 02:01:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more my point, actually, was kind of what I was getting at.

1553
02:01:50,692 --> 02:02:16,128
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time I think the first time we went over this story I probably had said something like you know well they should have probably read the fine print but now looking back on how Guitar Hero has you know essentially failed at this point you kind of go well maybe this really isn't what the game should have been doing in the first place say no doubt and Courtney Love I'm sure are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever their image and their license or their

1554
02:02:17,217 --> 02:02:30,391
[SPEAKER_11]: So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists.

1555
02:02:31,412 --> 02:02:32,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I don't know.

1556
02:02:34,422 --> 02:02:36,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.

1557
02:02:36,823 --> 02:02:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps, perhaps.

1558
02:02:38,624 --> 02:02:40,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?

1559
02:02:40,785 --> 02:02:44,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.

1560
02:02:44,507 --> 02:02:45,168
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got paternity ones.

1561
02:02:45,208 --> 02:02:46,548
[SPEAKER_04]: She fights with her kid all the time.

1562
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:49,150
[SPEAKER_04]: She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems.

1563
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:50,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, gosh.

1564
02:02:51,351 --> 02:02:53,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.

1565
02:02:54,412 --> 02:02:56,273
[SPEAKER_04]: A lawyer for her Twitter feed.

1566
02:02:56,613 --> 02:03:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They should make a Pokemon-style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.

1567
02:03:01,076 --> 02:03:01,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to catch them all.

1568
02:03:03,248 --> 02:03:05,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Real estate attorney, I choose you.

1569
02:03:06,491 --> 02:03:07,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Protect my house.

1570
02:03:09,734 --> 02:03:11,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Contracting lawyer, I choose you.

1571
02:03:11,996 --> 02:03:13,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Fix my air conditioning.

1572
02:03:14,739 --> 02:03:15,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1573
02:03:16,981 --> 02:03:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: A Pokemon game based around lawyers.

1574
02:03:18,723 --> 02:03:19,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're on to something.

1575
02:03:20,284 --> 02:03:21,645
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, though, how about another news story?

1576
02:03:21,665 --> 02:03:22,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta sue them all.

1577
02:03:24,193 --> 02:03:26,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like Sega.

1578
02:03:26,934 --> 02:03:29,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega, or at least something Sega's done.

1579
02:03:30,055 --> 02:03:30,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, I hate them.

1580
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:32,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my butt.

1581
02:03:33,656 --> 02:03:38,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is going to be, for the PCs, Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.

1582
02:03:39,237 --> 02:03:46,500
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 46 of the Sega Genesis's diseases games, and it will be out on March 15th.

1583
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:49,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the list.

1584
02:03:50,281 --> 02:03:53,624
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Volume 1, which has a bunch of stuff, and 2, and 3, and 4.

1585
02:03:55,245 --> 02:03:56,386
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, I'll run through the list.

1591
02:04:41,863 --> 02:05:00,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Micromachines Seriously, dang Alright I like Micromachines They don't make enough games based on them John Machida's dead That's because he talked too fast He got all the words out that he could possibly say As nice as that collection sounds

1592
02:05:01,525 --> 02:05:07,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this Genesis nostalgia I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth Aren't you starting to get to that point?

1593
02:05:07,628 --> 02:05:26,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever I don't think, you really don't need much more than that As far as Genesis nostalgia goes It's not one of our stories that was for tonight That's okay The PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus, whatever They were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March

1594
02:05:27,538 --> 02:05:35,024
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs for one to three bucks a piece.

1595
02:05:35,424 --> 02:05:36,645
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of them up there now.

1596
02:05:36,685 --> 02:05:39,527
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks.

1597
02:05:39,647 --> 02:05:40,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, you got some money to burn.

1598
02:05:41,529 --> 02:05:43,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Pick up a few, you know, a Phantasy Star 2.

1599
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:45,732
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, all right, how many of these are they going to put out?

1600
02:05:45,812 --> 02:05:49,795
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.

1601
02:05:49,995 --> 02:05:51,496
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got full packs out.

1602
02:05:51,977 --> 02:05:53,979
[SPEAKER_07]: You can download different packs of the games.

1603
02:05:54,099 --> 02:05:59,023
[SPEAKER_07]: In my case, it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis.

1604
02:05:59,844 --> 02:06:03,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I really want to play it, I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.

1605
02:06:06,469 --> 02:06:09,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.

1606
02:06:10,793 --> 02:06:11,754
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I mean...

1607
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:28,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.

1608
02:06:29,554 --> 02:06:32,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things.

1609
02:06:33,435 --> 02:06:36,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, dozens and dozens and dozens of times.

1610
02:06:36,696 --> 02:06:42,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just, I don't feel any remorse for downloading a ROM that's

1611
02:06:44,449 --> 02:06:52,485
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years old alright well let's move on with another story and we'll get to the mailbag pretty soon here

1612
02:06:53,171 --> 02:07:02,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but that does not mean that the music genre is dead.

1613
02:07:02,958 --> 02:07:08,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh no, dance games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.

1614
02:07:08,902 --> 02:07:13,786
[SPEAKER_12]: They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in...

1615
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:19,650
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess $809 million in total software sales, up 21% from 2009.

1616
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:26,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And 60% of that, of course, was in North America.

1617
02:07:27,076 --> 02:07:41,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, during the three-month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience, or Just Dance Michael Jackson.

1618
02:07:42,788 --> 02:07:46,092
[SPEAKER_12]: and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway.

1619
02:07:46,953 --> 02:07:47,974
[SPEAKER_12]: All pretty similar titles.

1620
02:07:49,275 --> 02:07:52,278
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that.

1621
02:07:52,378 --> 02:07:56,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't believe how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii.

1622
02:07:56,122 --> 02:07:57,323
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of crazy.

1623
02:07:59,346 --> 02:08:04,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, next month, Just Dance on... Let's see, I caught myself saying that.

1624
02:08:04,731 --> 02:08:08,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Dance on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with Move support.

1625
02:08:09,934 --> 02:08:13,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Or actually, Move required, I guess.

1626
02:08:13,336 --> 02:08:16,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?

1627
02:08:17,098 --> 02:08:17,658
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I do not.

1628
02:08:18,979 --> 02:08:22,441
[SPEAKER_12]: There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii.

1629
02:08:23,141 --> 02:08:28,745
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is going to add, I guess, some new duet choreography.

1630
02:08:29,806 --> 02:08:41,194
[SPEAKER_12]: And for 300 Wii Points, you can download YOY by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.

1631
02:08:43,379 --> 02:08:45,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Freak by Rick James and Sheiks LeFreak

1632
02:09:13,009 --> 02:09:19,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amory, heard them all.

1633
02:09:22,179 --> 02:09:22,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are each $3.

1634
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:22,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1635
02:09:28,826 --> 02:09:31,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.

1636
02:09:31,667 --> 02:09:33,547
[SPEAKER_04]: People like to shake their butt.

1637
02:09:33,667 --> 02:09:38,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games are dead, and then it's like, oh wait, another news.

1638
02:09:38,509 --> 02:09:52,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision, because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping on that bandwagon.

1639
02:09:55,965 --> 02:09:58,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.

1640
02:09:58,886 --> 02:10:10,111
[SPEAKER_04]: There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move, but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal 2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.

1641
02:10:10,912 --> 02:10:17,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.

1642
02:10:18,035 --> 02:10:18,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1643
02:10:36,664 --> 02:11:05,455
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically at the end of the day they announced Portal 2 is available for pre-order now and I was kind of like well duh I mean like if you want to go into GameStop they'll take your five bucks to pre-order Portal 5 I mean you know seems a little weird that they'd announce that but maybe through the official Valve channels or what have you it's available now I don't really know so there you go Portal 2 coming out soon and I know I'm excited about it I can't wait for that to come out

1644
02:11:06,294 --> 02:11:09,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag, right?

1645
02:11:09,516 --> 02:11:10,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to the mailbag.

1646
02:11:10,957 --> 02:11:11,958
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys send us emails.

1647
02:11:12,338 --> 02:11:13,639
[SPEAKER_04]: We answer them here on the show.

1648
02:11:14,259 --> 02:11:18,902
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and find some of her favorite emails to respond to right now.

1649
02:11:21,924 --> 02:11:23,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just taking care of some business.

1650
02:11:24,346 --> 02:11:24,766
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1651
02:11:28,513 --> 02:11:30,655
[SPEAKER_07]: So, first email, we actually got three.

1652
02:11:31,155 --> 02:11:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one that says, Greetings, OLR.

1653
02:11:34,518 --> 02:11:35,860
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my second email of the week.

1654
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:36,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick question.

1655
02:11:37,001 --> 02:11:40,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.

1656
02:11:41,164 --> 02:11:41,965
[SPEAKER_07]: What is going on here?

1657
02:11:42,005 --> 02:11:45,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their games?

1658
02:11:46,029 --> 02:11:52,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.

1659
02:11:53,035 --> 02:11:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Your loyal turtle in Philly, SeriousTurtle.

1660
02:11:58,075 --> 02:12:06,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I missed something about the... With Crysis 2 and Black Ops in those games being $60, why are they raising their prices when more people are going to hold out for sales?

1661
02:12:07,701 --> 02:12:15,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.

1662
02:12:16,285 --> 02:12:17,766
[SPEAKER_04]: A huge sale on Steam this weekend.

1663
02:12:18,386 --> 02:12:18,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1664
02:12:21,328 --> 02:12:24,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say, well, how long have those games been out?

1665
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:25,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Bulletstorm is new, right?

1666
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:26,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Bulletstorm is brand new.

1667
02:12:26,591 --> 02:12:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.

1668
02:12:32,855 --> 02:12:43,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA, Activision, have decided, hey, you know what?

1669
02:12:43,981 --> 02:12:47,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it warrants a $60 price point.

1670
02:12:49,469 --> 02:12:54,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on the Wii.

1671
02:12:54,791 --> 02:13:04,934
[SPEAKER_12]: They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics and support on the download side, so, eh.

1672
02:13:06,361 --> 02:13:32,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers are just going to have their MSRP $59.99 they don't care what platform even on a digital service like Steam where it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved they'll just set their price to whatever they want keep it uniform I can see where the emailer is probably getting a little bit frustrated that you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later but what can you do

1673
02:13:33,703 --> 02:13:37,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go on to the next email.

1674
02:13:37,975 --> 02:13:41,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the next email up is this one.

1675
02:13:41,416 --> 02:13:43,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi LLR, I don't have much to say this week.

1676
02:13:43,396 --> 02:13:45,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm moving to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic.

1677
02:13:45,857 --> 02:13:48,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But I suppose I should make this at least a bit game related.

1678
02:13:48,478 --> 02:13:50,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?

1679
02:13:51,079 --> 02:13:54,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.

1680
02:13:55,420 --> 02:13:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: On a side note, can I plug my new blog?

1681
02:13:57,420 --> 02:13:57,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1682
02:13:58,541 --> 02:14:07,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's moggysmusings.blogspot.com So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.

1683
02:14:07,363 --> 02:14:10,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was a really good tweet from that.

1684
02:14:10,187 --> 02:14:11,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really similar name that I liked.

1685
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:14,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I had retweeted it on OLR.

1686
02:14:15,074 --> 02:14:18,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I kind of already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.

1687
02:14:18,739 --> 02:14:20,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be a nice pairing.

1688
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:24,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.

1689
02:14:25,356 --> 02:14:28,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I want to see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having the license.

1690
02:14:29,219 --> 02:14:32,622
[SPEAKER_11]: I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel-shaded.

1691
02:14:33,322 --> 02:14:35,644
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, thumbs up.

1692
02:14:36,124 --> 02:14:41,088
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the original.

1693
02:14:41,808 --> 02:14:44,791
[SPEAKER_04]: But you kind of go, if anything's going to be good...

1694
02:14:46,337 --> 02:14:48,979
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be this from the professional angle.

1695
02:14:49,139 --> 02:14:50,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand there's still the fan game.

1696
02:14:51,161 --> 02:14:53,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the game is going to be in good hands with fans.

1697
02:14:53,923 --> 02:14:56,265
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's different.

1698
02:14:57,086 --> 02:14:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So how about the next email?

1699
02:15:00,248 --> 02:15:02,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is our last email of the night.

1700
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:02,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1701
02:15:03,690 --> 02:15:06,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.

1702
02:15:06,511 --> 02:15:08,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.

1703
02:15:08,972 --> 02:15:16,015
[SPEAKER_07]: One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7 where the author goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.

1704
02:15:16,855 --> 02:15:18,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen on the podcast every week.

1705
02:15:18,116 --> 02:15:19,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats on 400 eps.

1706
02:15:19,396 --> 02:15:19,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1707
02:15:19,856 --> 02:15:20,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Wendy.

1708
02:15:20,497 --> 02:15:21,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Wendy.

1709
02:15:21,889 --> 02:15:23,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?

1710
02:15:23,832 --> 02:15:24,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a cheap plug?

1711
02:15:24,793 --> 02:15:25,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1712
02:15:25,334 --> 02:15:25,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

1713
02:15:26,035 --> 02:15:26,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1714
02:15:26,536 --> 02:15:26,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1715
02:15:27,337 --> 02:15:30,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would definitely check out the book.

1716
02:15:30,442 --> 02:15:34,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse.

1717
02:15:34,989 --> 02:15:35,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1718
02:15:36,519 --> 02:15:37,080
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1719
02:16:13,544 --> 02:16:20,367
[SPEAKER_07]: My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.

1720
02:16:21,948 --> 02:16:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So, fuck you to my headache.

1721
02:16:24,169 --> 02:16:24,829
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really it.

1722
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:28,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki?

1723
02:16:30,491 --> 02:16:34,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, empty McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.

1724
02:16:38,581 --> 02:16:54,972
[SPEAKER_04]: my FU of the week goes to being so sore pain hurts ow my legs just hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting or whatever be careful SalaciousPop do you have any FUs?

[SPEAKER_04]: any angst?

1726
02:16:56,974 --> 02:17:07,701
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department alright that does it for the FUs of the week

1727
02:17:09,116 --> 02:17:09,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1728
02:17:09,699 --> 02:17:11,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple more stories for you guys.

1729
02:17:11,124 --> 02:17:12,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to get to the phone lines.

1730
02:17:12,992 --> 02:17:14,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.

1731
02:17:14,619 --> 02:17:14,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1732
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:16,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, yes.

1733
02:17:17,422 --> 02:17:19,023
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of interesting, I guess.

1734
02:17:19,543 --> 02:17:25,108
[SPEAKER_12]: They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.

1735
02:17:26,009 --> 02:17:28,331
[SPEAKER_12]: It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote.

1736
02:17:28,351 --> 02:17:41,341
[SPEAKER_12]: They were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360-type control and stuff.

1737
02:17:41,361 --> 02:17:41,862
[SPEAKER_12]: For example...

1738
02:17:42,342 --> 02:17:43,784
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1739
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:14,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls to aim at the player.

1740
02:18:15,024 --> 02:18:19,866
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect and Xbox 360.

1741
02:18:20,166 --> 02:18:22,506
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an interesting idea.

1742
02:18:22,986 --> 02:18:25,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if they can implement it well.

1743
02:18:28,436 --> 02:18:29,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1744
02:18:29,417 --> 02:18:30,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all I can really say about that.

1745
02:18:30,999 --> 02:18:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what have you.

1746
02:18:36,084 --> 02:18:37,245
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be neat.

1747
02:18:37,405 --> 02:18:45,233
[SPEAKER_12]: They could do something even simple like being able to level up the characters or something like that when they're not playing the game.

1748
02:18:47,175 --> 02:18:48,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Toss stuff back and forth, data.

1749
02:18:51,215 --> 02:19:03,046
[SPEAKER_04]: it always kind of reminds me for some reason of the pocket station days I don't know what it is but kind of that whole like you have it on your TV and then you have it in your pocket and whatever else I don't know

1750
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:07,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder where my pocket station went.

1751
02:19:07,812 --> 02:19:08,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you actually own one of those?

1752
02:19:08,852 --> 02:19:09,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I had one.

1753
02:19:09,493 --> 02:19:16,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop courses on the fly.

1754
02:19:16,818 --> 02:19:18,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

1755
02:19:18,739 --> 02:19:28,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because it got like four songs versus three songs if I paid for the fourth mix stuff.

1756
02:19:28,505 --> 02:19:33,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you go.

1757
02:19:33,889 --> 02:19:34,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Plus my edits were on there.

1758
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:35,290
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's fun.

1759
02:19:37,592 --> 02:19:38,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course there is...

1760
02:20:08,885 --> 02:20:09,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be awesome.

1761
02:20:09,645 --> 02:20:11,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's still Yuzo Fushiro doing all the music.

1762
02:20:11,507 --> 02:20:12,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It sure sounds like it.

1763
02:20:13,448 --> 02:20:23,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU 2011, but Bandai Namco has unveiled the website for the game.

1764
02:20:24,494 --> 02:20:33,080
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out, and they're saying it will be sometime before you get to play it, but it will be the Wangan Maxi of the future and worth the wait.

1765
02:20:35,821 --> 02:20:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever that means.

1766
02:20:37,816 --> 02:20:38,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just excited for the soundtrack.

1767
02:20:38,817 --> 02:20:40,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since they had a game, right?

1768
02:20:41,398 --> 02:20:41,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1769
02:20:41,898 --> 02:20:42,398
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been a while.

1770
02:20:44,159 --> 02:20:44,439
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1771
02:20:46,761 --> 02:20:48,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?

1772
02:20:48,361 --> 02:20:50,482
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.

1773
02:20:50,542 --> 02:20:55,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1774
02:20:55,965 --> 02:20:58,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.

1775
02:20:59,447 --> 02:21:03,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last minute stories tonight?

1776
02:21:03,809 --> 02:21:06,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, sure, we can talk about Pixel Force Head to Head.

1777
02:21:06,872 --> 02:21:17,701
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, the guy that brought us all the 8-bit kind of Left 4 Dead, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.

1778
02:21:18,161 --> 02:21:23,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this one, they've got brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting game, including like...

1779
02:21:24,827 --> 02:21:32,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Rio from Street Fighter Wolverine from Marvel Scorpion 30 different characters you can play as Castlevania

1780
02:21:48,783 --> 02:21:50,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.

1781
02:21:50,764 --> 02:21:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1782
02:21:51,765 --> 02:21:52,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1783
02:21:52,685 --> 02:21:55,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Ranma.

1784
02:21:55,547 --> 02:21:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind?

1785
02:21:57,088 --> 02:21:57,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

1786
02:21:57,688 --> 02:22:04,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got back from Katzikon, but I didn't call to give my con review, but I have a question for all three of you.

1787
02:22:04,392 --> 02:22:04,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, what's up?

1788
02:22:05,793 --> 02:22:06,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1789
02:22:06,573 --> 02:22:14,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console is the games for it, correct?

1790
02:22:14,698 --> 02:22:15,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1791
02:22:15,038 --> 02:22:15,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1792
02:22:16,114 --> 02:22:20,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy and he's like, you're incorrect.

1793
02:22:20,995 --> 02:22:22,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the marketing behind it.

1794
02:22:22,876 --> 02:22:31,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, even I find it hard to believe because I feel that there have been games that have been marketed out like a cheap whore and it still has failed to get the numbers.

1795
02:22:32,558 --> 02:22:36,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So, do you believe more if it's the games or the marketing?

1796
02:22:36,299 --> 02:22:39,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, what games failed on the marketing aspect?

1797
02:22:42,216 --> 02:22:42,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band 3

1798
02:23:01,315 --> 02:23:27,803
[SPEAKER_04]: if you want me to go for a bigger title because I don't know we just didn't see Rock Band it wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles and I don't know if that's just because people were over it or what the deal is but yeah I'd have to say that okay I agree with that because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as I was anticipating it and I turned around I'm like it's out but I really didn't see any advertising for it yeah right

1799
02:23:29,747 --> 02:23:37,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.

1800
02:23:37,051 --> 02:23:42,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch too, I thought we had a story last week that that game sold like a million copies or something.

1801
02:23:44,235 --> 02:23:44,916
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1802
02:24:03,733 --> 02:24:08,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge was kind of a popular game, at least I always thought.

1803
02:24:09,499 --> 02:24:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would.

1804
02:24:13,623 --> 02:24:14,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of surprising.

1805
02:24:16,546 --> 02:24:17,006
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1806
02:24:17,767 --> 02:24:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console.

1807
02:24:29,770 --> 02:24:31,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I think marketing kind of goes a long way.

1808
02:24:32,151 --> 02:24:35,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's probably why the Wii did so well.

1809
02:24:37,213 --> 02:24:39,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I think was kind of the way it was marketed.

1810
02:24:39,533 --> 02:24:48,216
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either a good product or a bad product.

1811
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:56,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is that you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale.

1812
02:24:56,919 --> 02:24:58,900
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, a turd is still a turd.

1813
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:00,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that plenty of times.

1814
02:25:01,921 --> 02:25:16,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business and it just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say it stinks and could cause a possible chain reaction.

1815
02:25:20,284 --> 02:25:20,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

1816
02:25:21,606 --> 02:25:23,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.

1817
02:25:24,430 --> 02:25:32,081
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system's only as good as the games that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch titles.

1818
02:25:32,121 --> 02:25:33,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this make me a giant hypocrite?

1819
02:25:34,594 --> 02:25:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not necessarily.

1820
02:25:35,694 --> 02:25:37,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you kind of follow along with me.

1821
02:25:37,335 --> 02:25:44,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you feel your inner child because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?

1822
02:25:45,357 --> 02:25:50,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA and I still haven't finished it yet.

1823
02:25:51,219 --> 02:25:54,400
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first got it, I knocked that game on about five weeks.

1824
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:55,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1825
02:25:56,485 --> 02:25:59,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.

1826
02:25:59,446 --> 02:26:05,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and looking at the 3D pictures.

1827
02:26:05,528 --> 02:26:07,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.

1828
02:26:07,889 --> 02:26:09,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be kind of awesome.

1829
02:26:09,410 --> 02:26:10,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to kind of show it off, too.

1830
02:26:10,650 --> 02:26:12,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures.

1831
02:26:12,811 --> 02:26:18,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping Nintendo does a smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way we can do that.

1832
02:26:20,221 --> 02:26:21,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps, perhaps.

1833
02:26:21,904 --> 02:26:25,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, I also hope that I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.

1834
02:26:26,953 --> 02:26:28,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1835
02:26:28,797 --> 02:26:30,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, anything else on your mind, Ranma?

1836
02:26:31,792 --> 02:26:32,652
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's it.

1837
02:26:33,313 --> 02:26:33,573
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1838
02:26:33,593 --> 02:26:34,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, take care, Ranma.

1839
02:26:34,353 --> 02:26:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1840
02:26:34,793 --> 02:26:35,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the call.

1841
02:26:35,314 --> 02:26:35,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You too, Andrew.

1842
02:26:35,934 --> 02:26:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Laters.

1843
02:26:36,374 --> 02:26:37,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1844
02:26:37,675 --> 02:26:41,396
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1845
02:26:42,777 --> 02:26:46,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.

1846
02:26:46,839 --> 02:26:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll take it.

1847
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:50,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.

1848
02:26:53,462 --> 02:26:53,782
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1849
02:26:54,062 --> 02:26:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last-minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?

1850
02:26:57,027 --> 02:26:57,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, one last one here.

1851
02:26:58,548 --> 02:27:03,410
[SPEAKER_12]: There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.

1852
02:27:04,311 --> 02:27:08,493
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a game called Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

1853
02:27:08,653 --> 02:27:11,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.

1854
02:27:12,035 --> 02:27:13,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.

1855
02:27:13,535 --> 02:27:15,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were saying Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

1856
02:27:15,556 --> 02:27:18,238
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's the full name of the game.

1857
02:27:18,278 --> 02:27:19,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.

1858
02:27:19,779 --> 02:27:20,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1859
02:27:20,679 --> 02:27:24,561
[SPEAKER_12]: But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Pee's.

1860
02:27:25,341 --> 02:27:36,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, so it is a game that's played with vocal input and you can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic.

1861
02:27:36,507 --> 02:27:43,792
[SPEAKER_12]: The titles co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises like pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.

1862
02:27:48,794 --> 02:27:50,435
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta love the indie marketplace.

1863
02:27:50,915 --> 02:27:53,497
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a trailer for it too which people are playing it.

1864
02:28:00,579 --> 02:28:02,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there video?

1865
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:02,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like real video?

1866
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:11,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it looks like... Yeah, we can't hear any of that.

1867
02:28:12,026 --> 02:28:16,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to that Technokitten Adventure.

1868
02:28:17,189 --> 02:28:28,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks and then you scream into it to cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks.

1869
02:28:30,512 --> 02:28:32,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave of the future, ladies and gentlemen.

1870
02:28:33,136 --> 02:28:33,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Wave of the future.

1871
02:28:34,578 --> 02:28:35,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call.

1872
02:28:35,479 --> 02:28:36,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

1873
02:28:36,380 --> 02:28:36,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1874
02:28:38,122 --> 02:28:39,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Gamer Girl.

1875
02:28:39,504 --> 02:28:40,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Gamer Girl.

1876
02:28:40,225 --> 02:28:40,786
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1877
02:28:41,647 --> 02:28:42,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much.

1878
02:28:42,128 --> 02:28:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys played the game...

1879
02:28:48,840 --> 02:29:16,768
[SPEAKER_08]: um there's a game called um Assassin's Creed Legacy on Facebook uh no I have not played the Facebook game I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games what's the what's what's the Facebook game all about um it's kind of like Knights of the Clicky it's pretty cool yeah yeah um I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the Clicky it's pretty fun is it one of those games where it's really easy to uh spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff yeah it's pretty cool

1880
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:20,681
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of Facebook games?

1881
02:29:20,701 --> 02:29:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it really is the wave of the future?

1882
02:29:24,603 --> 02:29:26,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of addicting, actually.

1883
02:29:28,205 --> 02:29:32,448
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not careful, you can kind of get addicted to it.

1884
02:29:34,699 --> 02:29:39,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was playing that Knights of the Clique game, which is so ridiculous for a while.

1885
02:29:39,821 --> 02:29:41,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, one day I just kind of stopped.

1886
02:29:41,861 --> 02:29:42,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that kind of what happened with you?

1887
02:29:42,782 --> 02:29:43,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it ran out of steam with me too.

1888
02:29:44,182 --> 02:29:44,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with you, DarkSakura.

1889
02:29:44,742 --> 02:29:46,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't touched it in ages.

1890
02:29:47,243 --> 02:29:48,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't touched it in like two weeks.

1891
02:29:48,344 --> 02:29:49,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finally gave up.

1892
02:29:49,564 --> 02:29:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore.

1893
02:29:52,205 --> 02:29:54,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?

1894
02:29:54,807 --> 02:30:02,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy when I was moving around.

1895
02:30:03,753 --> 02:30:05,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked in the case and it was actually cracked.

1896
02:30:07,195 --> 02:30:08,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to re-buy the other one.

1897
02:30:09,076 --> 02:30:11,978
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?

1898
02:30:12,038 --> 02:30:16,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game?

1899
02:30:16,141 --> 02:30:17,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Or does it kind of tie into that story?

1900
02:30:18,123 --> 02:30:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed's graphics?

1901
02:30:24,868 --> 02:30:27,250
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of makes you want to play the original game.

1902
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:32,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it's not really tied into the game itself, the original game.

1903
02:30:33,214 --> 02:30:34,915
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more like a standalone.

1904
02:30:35,696 --> 02:30:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1905
02:30:38,155 --> 02:30:42,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say somebody I knew was playing that on Facebook.

1906
02:30:42,237 --> 02:30:44,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Has this been open a long time, like about six months or so?

1907
02:30:45,058 --> 02:30:46,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did it just recently open?

1908
02:30:46,799 --> 02:30:47,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

1909
02:30:47,859 --> 02:30:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I just found out about it yesterday.

1910
02:30:51,101 --> 02:30:53,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?

1911
02:30:53,862 --> 02:30:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook.

1912
02:30:59,304 --> 02:30:59,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a title.

1913
02:30:59,964 --> 02:31:01,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the full title.

1914
02:31:01,465 --> 02:31:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh because it seems like it's going to buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars that it might actually be the game of civilization it might be simplified a lot but I think that might be a lot of fun um right now I like playing you know um Knights of the Clicky um Chocobo's Crystal Tower oh yeah it's kind of confusing but yeah there's

1915
02:31:25,356 --> 02:31:29,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, Gamer Girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?

1916
02:31:30,099 --> 02:31:31,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Do those games make you less depressed?

1917
02:31:31,660 --> 02:31:32,481
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1918
02:31:32,681 --> 02:31:33,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the good work, guys.

1919
02:31:33,922 --> 02:31:37,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, Gamer Girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?

1920
02:31:38,951 --> 02:31:46,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot-em-up games, like, whatever.

1921
02:31:48,542 --> 02:31:52,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty, or like something with zombies in it.

1922
02:31:54,289 --> 02:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I made a game with zombies in it.

1923
02:31:56,852 --> 02:31:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I like watching their brains spew out.

1924
02:32:00,925 --> 02:32:02,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and then, let's see.

1925
02:32:04,607 --> 02:32:06,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a game, but I forgot the name of it.

1926
02:32:07,249 --> 02:32:07,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

1927
02:32:07,669 --> 02:32:08,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Resident Evil.

1928
02:32:08,529 --> 02:32:09,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Resident Evil, there you go.

1929
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:09,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1930
02:32:10,090 --> 02:32:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: More zombie killing.

1931
02:32:11,531 --> 02:32:11,831
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1932
02:32:12,391 --> 02:32:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich.

1933
02:32:15,802 --> 02:32:19,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Gamer Girl, we're going to let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call.

1934
02:32:20,363 --> 02:32:20,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1935
02:32:20,823 --> 02:32:21,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, have a wonderful night.

1936
02:32:22,363 --> 02:32:23,564
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1937
02:32:23,584 --> 02:32:27,224
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to call us, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1938
02:32:28,144 --> 02:32:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last minute stories over there from Loki?

1939
02:32:30,165 --> 02:32:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1940
02:32:31,445 --> 02:32:33,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how am I supposed to fill time until the next call?

1941
02:32:33,946 --> 02:32:34,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I don't know.

1942
02:32:35,846 --> 02:32:36,866
[SPEAKER_12]: We can make up news.

1943
02:32:36,906 --> 02:32:38,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if there's any new stories.

1944
02:32:39,467 --> 02:32:40,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that recently happened?

1945
02:32:40,927 --> 02:32:41,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh,

1946
02:32:44,309 --> 02:32:47,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Nanostray developer working on title for the 3DS.

1947
02:32:47,973 --> 02:32:50,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game.

1948
02:32:54,259 --> 02:32:55,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can make some stories up.

1949
02:32:56,361 --> 02:33:02,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about there was the little Big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?

1950
02:33:03,368 --> 02:33:04,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was covered.

1951
02:33:04,268 --> 02:33:05,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about the patch.

1952
02:33:05,289 --> 02:33:06,549
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a little bit earlier in the show.

1953
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:07,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Ops Zombies.

1954
02:33:08,050 --> 02:33:09,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we're getting another call.

1955
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:09,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo, saved.

1956
02:33:10,151 --> 02:33:11,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1957
02:33:11,071 --> 02:33:11,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1958
02:33:12,412 --> 02:33:14,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Amiga777.

1959
02:33:14,453 --> 02:33:15,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Amiga777.

1960
02:33:15,953 --> 02:33:16,634
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1961
02:33:17,934 --> 02:33:30,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering, have you guys heard about that latest Mario Sports Mix game that was supposed to be coming up?

1962
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, like

1963
02:33:31,697 --> 02:33:34,979
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago.

1964
02:33:35,219 --> 02:33:39,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game.

1965
02:33:41,521 --> 02:33:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1966
02:33:43,822 --> 02:33:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: What were your thoughts on it?

1967
02:33:47,328 --> 02:33:53,371
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash-in to the whole Wii Sports craze.

1968
02:33:53,771 --> 02:34:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock-offs games, a la, I don't know, Deka Sports or whatever.

1969
02:34:00,954 --> 02:34:04,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit.

1970
02:34:04,335 --> 02:34:15,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games, you know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, or whatever the hell they were calling it.

1971
02:34:15,299 --> 02:34:16,240
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1972
02:34:31,059 --> 02:34:38,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing, which was like a PS1 Mario Kart ripoff with Final Fantasy characters.

1973
02:34:38,544 --> 02:34:45,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wish that would come out on the store because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got.

1974
02:34:45,889 --> 02:34:47,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was awesome.

1975
02:34:48,211 --> 02:34:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1976
02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:13,813
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach.

1977
02:35:14,133 --> 02:35:20,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as the hardcore game goes, if you're just kind of a solo player, I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.

1978
02:35:21,418 --> 02:35:22,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I think your money might be better spent somewhere else.

1979
02:35:23,879 --> 02:35:24,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1980
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:32,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I mean, I looked at an article online about it some time ago, and...

1981
02:35:33,683 --> 02:35:36,506
[SPEAKER_09]: The critics were just ripping it to shreds.

1982
02:35:54,604 --> 02:36:14,837
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya in our chatroom does tell us though it is Mario curling if you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario you can get that I thought Mario curling was not in that but was in the stupid Sonic vs. Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing I don't think curling is in this new one I'm reading that from chat so you could be right

1983
02:36:15,759 --> 02:36:17,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could be wrong.

1984
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:27,006
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis, dodgeball, maybe paintball.

1985
02:36:28,447 --> 02:36:32,069
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, it's whatever.

1986
02:36:32,109 --> 02:36:34,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're not the target audience.

1987
02:36:35,431 --> 02:36:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got to ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too because of everything you've read?

1988
02:36:46,115 --> 02:36:53,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that as I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time.

1989
02:36:54,134 --> 02:36:55,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, then it makes the decision pretty easy.

1990
02:36:57,406 --> 02:37:16,641
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article that Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept to, I guess, Square Enix, who was already kind of already in some...

1991
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:29,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Hotwater, and a number of other things like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV, which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet.

1992
02:37:30,168 --> 02:37:32,430
[SPEAKER_09]: What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?

1993
02:37:35,231 --> 02:37:35,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1994
02:37:38,213 --> 02:37:39,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise games?

1995
02:37:41,148 --> 02:37:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: The games?

1996
02:37:41,668 --> 02:37:43,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, it's fine.

1997
02:37:45,330 --> 02:37:49,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I just need to make a decent income in order to get one at this time.

1998
02:37:49,712 --> 02:37:50,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

1999
02:37:50,513 --> 02:37:52,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy.

2000
02:37:53,954 --> 02:37:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2001
02:37:54,655 --> 02:37:55,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bummer.

2002
02:37:55,646 --> 02:37:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show.

2003
02:37:58,549 --> 02:37:59,530
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you so much for the call.

2004
02:38:00,512 --> 02:38:00,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

2005
02:38:01,192 --> 02:38:03,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there.

2006
02:38:03,555 --> 02:38:05,537
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a whopping four.

2007
02:38:07,500 --> 02:38:10,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball.

2008
02:38:11,284 --> 02:38:11,584
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

2009
02:38:12,866 --> 02:38:13,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2010
02:38:16,507 --> 02:38:18,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't think it was a lot of games.

2011
02:38:18,749 --> 02:38:20,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like DECA Sports where there was a whole ton of them.

2012
02:38:20,771 --> 02:38:22,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, you know, a few.

2013
02:38:23,032 --> 02:38:24,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But there you go.

2014
02:38:25,274 --> 02:38:27,336
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2015
02:38:27,536 --> 02:38:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

2016
02:38:29,478 --> 02:38:33,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you can always send us an email or contact us in other ways.

2017
02:38:35,262 --> 02:38:37,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat Room, Twitter, etc, etc.

2018
02:38:38,623 --> 02:38:40,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back to do it again next week.

2019
02:38:40,564 --> 02:38:49,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But since I believe we did all the final thoughts, I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight, it's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show.

2020
02:38:49,528 --> 02:38:52,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight.

2021
02:38:52,869 --> 02:38:58,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half, as you always do, so thank you for being here.

2022
02:38:58,331 --> 02:38:58,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2023
02:38:59,011 --> 02:39:00,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2024
02:39:00,772 --> 02:39:02,333
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't nap today, and I can feel it.

2025
02:39:03,653 --> 02:39:07,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, no, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show.

2026
02:39:07,416 --> 02:39:08,217
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 minutes is not a nap.

2027
02:39:08,797 --> 02:39:09,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It is for me.

2028
02:39:09,638 --> 02:39:12,060
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll go ahead and give my final thought.

2029
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:17,564
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show.

2030
02:39:17,604 --> 02:39:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I love the live listeners and everything, but if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close.

2031
02:39:22,448 --> 02:39:23,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, just saying.

2032
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:25,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Baskin Robbins around the corner.

2033
02:39:25,491 --> 02:39:25,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

2034
02:39:26,692 --> 02:39:28,233
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.

2035
02:39:28,513 --> 02:39:29,715
[SPEAKER_07]: My head hurts so bad.

2036
02:39:30,437 --> 02:39:31,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry to hear it.

2037
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:34,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

2038
02:39:34,584 --> 02:39:35,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope this mod works.

2039
02:39:36,599 --> 02:39:37,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dear, I wonder what this is.

2040
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:39,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this mod going to do, dare I ask?

2041
02:39:40,722 --> 02:39:53,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get a process to it because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online and have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto.

2042
02:39:53,970 --> 02:40:00,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm talking about map mods right now because I've done map mods before, but I have a new method of doing them and...

2043
02:40:01,714 --> 02:40:10,423
[SPEAKER_12]: The previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work and I've tried this before and I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work and who knows.

2044
02:40:10,723 --> 02:40:13,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn.

2045
02:40:15,114 --> 02:40:15,435
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2046
02:40:16,516 --> 02:40:20,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going to do it tonight for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2047
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:24,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live, however you do it, and checking us out.

2048
02:40:24,825 --> 02:40:26,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We really do appreciate all the support.

2049
02:40:26,807 --> 02:40:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, leave us some nice feedback, whether it be on the iTunes store...

2050
02:40:34,355 --> 02:40:36,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys for showing up and supporting us and making it work every week.

2051
02:40:36,516 --> 02:40:37,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, everybody.

2052
02:40:37,196 --> 02:40:38,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2053
02:41:03,866 --> 02:41:06,648
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2054
02:41:07,168 --> 02:41:10,430
