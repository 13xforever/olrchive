1
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, February 13th, 2011, there will be no more hero games at Activision.

2
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:21,211
[SPEAKER_10]: A survey hints at details on Dance Central 2.

3
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:25,679
[SPEAKER_10]: And could your PlayStation 3 games soon require a serial number registration?

4
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,359
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

5
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I am dropping stuff.

6
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:50,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

7
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:54,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a good way to start off the 401st episode of our show.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

9
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the next hundred.

10
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Think we'll make it to 500?

11
00:00:57,562 --> 00:00:57,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

12
00:00:57,882 --> 00:00:58,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

13
00:00:58,422 --> 00:00:58,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

14
00:00:58,902 --> 00:00:59,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

15
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:00,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I got nothing else to do.

16
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:02,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I got nothing better to do.

17
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:02,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

18
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:03,545
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

19
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

20
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:06,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

21
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,027
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

22
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,627
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Loki?

23
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:08,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

24
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:09,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good to hear.

25
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:10,348
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the baby doing?

26
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing okay.

27
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy reading the wife's blogs about the baby.

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because, you know, I don't have a child, but it seems like everybody around me, you know, not everybody, but many people around me are kind of starting to enter that, take that step.

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

30
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting to hear the stories.

31
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you will see posts once a month.

32
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just reminds me, I'm getting old.

33
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:35,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So, have you thought about what the baby's first video game should be?

34
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he's already played Grand Theft Auto, so...

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a minute, you let your baby play Grand Theft Auto?

36
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:50,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he can't really hold the controller well, but he had it at the point where he had one hand on the left analog stick and the other hand on the trigger and he was driving around.

37
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:53,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So technically that is playing Grand Theft Auto.

38
00:01:54,511 --> 00:02:04,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, he doesn't know what he's doing, but he had an Xbox 360 controller and he didn't kill anything, he just was driving around.

39
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a story to tell.

40
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell him when he's like 13.

41
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know your first game was Grand Theft Auto?

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Because by then they'll be up to Grand Theft Auto 17 or whatever.

43
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's also introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show.

44
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have anybody else in the studio tonight, sadly, but we do have, of course, the chat room.

45
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,625
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice and have been that way since 2002.

46
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you want to join us in our chat room.

47
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:45,394
[SPEAKER_04]: We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern But if you want to join our chat room you can do that at chat.orangeloungeradio.com What's this?

48
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,195
[SPEAKER_04]: You took video?

49
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my You actually have a little picture of Josh playing the 360 control That is adorable That is really adorable

50
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, my secondary theme for tonight's show What's that?

51
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,542
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so cute What's that, DarkSakura?

52
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:06,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Is posting random stuff in the chatroom Posting random stuff in the chatroom, just because?

53
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:23,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I found a neat article in Cracked about Easter eggs hidden in albums And I think we need to start doing Easter eggs in our episodes Our episodes need Like, we have an epic burp and you run it through a spectrograph and it's a picture of a puppy

54
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, I'm like, this is why I didn't do this crap before.

56
00:03:54,998 --> 00:04:01,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, now I'm doing all that crap on my level 85 character, so I'm like... And, um...

57
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:07,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have Final Fantasy 3 on the DS, which is pretty cool so far.

58
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:09,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very happy with it.

59
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:32,308
[SPEAKER_11]: We were at Dimple and we had some leftover credit because we traded in like a ton of our old DVDs that we had either replaced or just were crap.

60
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Local music chain, by the way, which also sells games used new.

61
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,063
[SPEAKER_11]: So we were like, well, let's just go ahead and use up our credit.

62
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,624
[SPEAKER_11]: So I picked a game and Dan picked a game.

63
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we said, well, let's use our discount card.

64
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:44,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And it turned out we still had $5 left when we were done.

65
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we thought we were using it all up.

66
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,353
[SPEAKER_11]: So we still have credit there.

67
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess we're going to go back and get another game.

68
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have no idea what that discount card's for.

69
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably have a ton of stuff on there.

70
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:56,421
[SPEAKER_11]: You get like a random 50% off on your purchases or something.

71
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I a bad person?

72
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't really shop at music stores anymore.

73
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Not since Tower Records went under.

74
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,305
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my chain was Tower Records.

75
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:03,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.

76
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to buy import CDs from Tower Records.

77
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,028
[SPEAKER_04]: This was before the interwebs or when interwebs was all dial-up, right?

78
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:12,830
[SPEAKER_04]: When Orange Lounge Radio had a 56K friendly stream, right?

79
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a while ago.

80
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,972
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I was shopping at Tower Records before they went under.

81
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:17,973
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe Virgin Megastore once in a while.

82
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Virgin was awesome for import CDs.

83
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,355
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I have to admit... Who bought an activator at Virgin?

84
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,437
[SPEAKER_04]: When I buy CDs, it's Best Buy.

85
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make me a bad person?

86
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:28,979
[SPEAKER_11]: When I buy CDs, I don't rob.

87
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:29,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I go on Amazon.

88
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And I buy the mp3 downloads.

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,461
[SPEAKER_11]: If I want them that badly.

90
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:39,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this might make me really bad, but the last CD I bought was the Tron soundtrack.

91
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:40,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought that at Target.

92
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:42,467
[SPEAKER_04]: CeeLo Green's album for $5.

93
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:09,923
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're all DRM free on top of it.

94
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:18,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Now iTunes is too and you can convert from their format but it really is just super convenient to get it all on Amazon.

95
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was playing some Final Fantasy 3 while I was waiting around for stuff.

96
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:31,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And I started Oregon Trail today, and I'm like... Oh, the Facebook one?

97
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:32,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it.

98
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it for like five seconds, and I was like, this just... This is overcomplicating it.

99
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:37,728
[SPEAKER_04]: This game has died of dysentery.

100
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

101
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:39,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the best way to put it.

102
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:47,873
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the thing that gets it is that buying the tickets... Now, I'll just go download an Apple MU and play it that way.

103
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,053
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic is gone.

104
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:50,654
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic is kind of gone.

105
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some friends that are into it on Facebook.

106
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:52,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

107
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're into.

108
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:54,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I have no right to judge anyone.

109
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing that Knights of the Clique game for forever, although I haven't touched it in like a week.

110
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,942
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wasn't feeling Oregon Trail.

111
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm three weeks clean on it, Rob.

112
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:02,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really?

113
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,826
[SPEAKER_04]: You should get like a sober sticker for that.

114
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:05,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

115
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.

116
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Rewinding to MMOs a bit.

117
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:13,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I don't want to dwell on WoW too much, but I will tell you one thing I've kind of been looking at.

118
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:18,577
[SPEAKER_04]: As a lot of Warcraft players and other MMO players have been looking at, there's this new game coming out called Rift.

119
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:20,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you read at all about this game?

120
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:23,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it like based off of the tabletop rifts?

121
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure because I don't know enough.

122
00:07:25,683 --> 00:07:26,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the Palladium games?

123
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:27,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know enough about that scene.

124
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But look at some of the YouTubes on Rift and tell me what you think.

125
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, while you're at it, look at videos because we were doing this the other night.

126
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at videos for Guild Wars 2 and tell me what you think.

127
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Guild Wars for a while.

128
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:42,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Guild Wars 2, much different than Guild Wars 1.

129
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:47,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look and see if either of those might woo you from WoW for a little bit.

130
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:47,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

131
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it better not, because Dan doesn't want to buy any more games.

132
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the good news is Rift has an open beta starting really, really soon.

133
00:07:55,897 --> 00:07:56,698
[SPEAKER_05]: This does look pretty.

134
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look at those while we talk about it.

135
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at some of the videos on YouTube.

136
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially some of the PvP looks really pretty.

137
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:04,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're not into PvP, but it has both.

138
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I've started doing PvP.

139
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you really?

140
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:06,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I've done the battles.

141
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get you back on Horde House to talk about that.

142
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:14,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Because our friend and listener got me PvP gear.

143
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

144
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to Loki.

145
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

146
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't play a whole lot this week.

147
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:24,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Mainly just a few things.

148
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:28,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Sword and Poker 2, still playing that in iOS.

149
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:33,311
[SPEAKER_07]: This last dungeon is taking forever, but it's fun still.

150
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:40,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I just unlocked more weapons I can buy, but they're really expensive, so I have to grind some more dungeons for that.

151
00:08:41,316 --> 00:09:08,128
[SPEAKER_07]: um and then I played um Marvel vs Capcom 3 a little bit of that um yeah that too that's an awesome awesome awesome game um I'm not very good at those types of games but it is somewhat button masher friendly I wouldn't say I'm just like a button masher but like I don't have any like real strategy into it you know it's just like okay I know the basic moves and stuff like that and

152
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what happens.

153
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,268
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, feel it out.

154
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:14,129
[SPEAKER_07]: No, like, 50 hit combos for me or anything like that.

155
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:15,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say you're just feeling it up?

156
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:16,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Feeling it out.

157
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

158
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, because there's some pretty, you know, boobtastic characters in there.

159
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, Grand Theft Auto.

160
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, usual.

161
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:28,495
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a must for you.

162
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

163
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we play that at work.

164
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously, we can play more of that.

165
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:40,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's being sued because of the name.

166
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:41,619
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a

167
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,269
[SPEAKER_04]: DeadPixelLive.com

168
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:36,708
[SPEAKER_04]: How did he get all these big name interviews when we weren't looking?

169
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:37,429
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.

170
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:38,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.

171
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

172
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.orange.com for more comments here.

173
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:46,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziba is saying, I am loving Rift and can't wait for Guild Wars 2.

174
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So both those games are getting a lot of buzz.

175
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:53,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, everybody's always going to ask, which one of these is going to be the WoW killer?

176
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:55,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably neither.

177
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

178
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you what the WoW killer will ultimately be.

179
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:00,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I can already tell you.

180
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:01,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I will look at my crystal ball.

181
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you what game is the WoW killer.

182
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:04,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

183
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:04,418
[SPEAKER_11]: WoW 2?

184
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,139
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

185
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW.

186
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:07,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

187
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:09,103
[SPEAKER_04]: WoW is the WoW killer.

188
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:10,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait and see.

189
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds very suicidal.

190
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:17,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, because, well, who?

191
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:18,871
[SPEAKER_11]: How did the Roman Empire fall?

192
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:19,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of the Roman Empire.

193
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:25,999
[SPEAKER_04]: More to quote an old Loki quote, an old, old Loki quote, Ow!

194
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I just shot myself in the foot.

195
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you shooting me in the foot?

196
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, can I pet this?

197
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that Guild Wars 2 now you're looking at?

198
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:34,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

199
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes for great radio, by the way, when you're sitting there going, ooh, pretty.

200
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: You should post some of those links in chat just so people can take a peek for themselves.

201
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:42,917
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to imagine it.

202
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:48,359
[SPEAKER_11]: This place makes Stormwind look like an easy-to-navigate one-lane street.

203
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:49,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

204
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me talk about my gaming week and some of the games I play this week.

205
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly the same type of stuff.

206
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:58,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been somewhat of a slow month in gaming, just like it has been movies.

207
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,442
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not been a lot of new stuff.

208
00:11:59,482 --> 00:12:00,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, more WoW, yeah, okay.

209
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:02,543
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did play one new game.

210
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,484
[SPEAKER_04]: One game kind of came out and it was kind of one of those blink and you might have missed it games.

211
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:14,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I played You Don't Know Jack, the brand new game that just came out from THQ with Jellyvision, of course, who made the old You Don't Know Jack.

212
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's not really a brand new game because it's more like, hey, remember the 90s?

213
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:20,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these games were huge in the 90s.

214
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You Don't Know Jack and You Don't Know Jack the Ride, which I want to say originally was a Sierra thing.

215
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong on that.

216
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody might correct me on that in the chat room.

217
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But that could explain why the long hiatus.

218
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:40,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless of how it happened, THQ has now put out a You Don't Know Jack game for the current generation of consoles.

219
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:40,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's everywhere.

220
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's PC, it's 360, PlayStation, it's everywhere.

221
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:57,585
[SPEAKER_04]: and the 360 is the version I played and I was at a little party with some friends last night and we were playing the new You Don't Know Jack game and the good news is it is pretty much what I remember.

222
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:01,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a funny, quick, polished trivia game.

223
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:04,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of jokes, just kind of like one after the other.

224
00:13:04,646 --> 00:13:07,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That almost kind of dry sense of humor.

225
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:14,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say British sense of humor, not that dry, but just really like non-stop pun after pun and there's these weird jokes

226
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:15,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitties Kitten

227
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,270
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

228
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,592
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also download expansions.

229
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe three are planned right now.

230
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,053
[SPEAKER_04]: One is up already.

231
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten more episodes for five bucks.

232
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is 50 cents an episode.

233
00:14:11,336 --> 00:14:19,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So the value of this game, I would really ask you, how much value are you going to get in like a party atmosphere?

234
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the good news is you can play this on Xbox Live, but I think this would be the absolute worst game

235
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:28,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Possible game you could play on Xbox Live with strangers.

236
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

237
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:37,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would suck all the fun out of the game because you know you're going to have people out there with a finite number of episodes who already know the answers to all the questions and so on.

238
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:39,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think that part, it might be a little bit ridiculous.

239
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:44,235
[SPEAKER_04]: However, playing with trusted friends, I think it could be a great Xbox Live game.

240
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So, one of those, and of course when I say Xbox Live, obviously the PlayStation has this comparable thing.

241
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:50,799
[SPEAKER_04]: PC does not.

242
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I find very interesting.

243
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,420
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the PC version is only $20.

244
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:53,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

245
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:55,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more value there.

246
00:14:56,282 --> 00:15:01,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I mean, there's not a lot of people that would play that multiplayer on a PC.

247
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be kind of hard to play that multiplayer on a PC?

248
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:03,546
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

249
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, it's where I play my WoW.

250
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:10,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I meant like, you know, with friends, you know what I mean?

251
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,982
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no real, you're not going to have like four controllers or something like that, you know?

252
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying.

253
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:19,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a little tough there, I guess.

254
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't own the PC version, so I don't know how they do it.

255
00:15:22,227 --> 00:15:23,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you can have little buzzers or whatever.

256
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:30,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I do hear, though, on the PlayStation 3 version, you can use the actual game buzz controllers, and you don't know Jack, which is nice.

257
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

258
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little more use out of those things.

259
00:15:33,955 --> 00:16:01,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I think single player will only be funny for so long the good news is it is a funny game so you'll get your lols out of it but I think the game works best in a party atmosphere so I think the question would really be are you going to be able to bring this to a party and get use out of this if so it might be worth your money I think it's been mildly successful so far it sold okay but it's something I could figure that will probably drop in price relatively quickly

260
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:02,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to keep in the back of your mind.

261
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,678
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they did the episodes is a little weird.

262
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,399
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take your game from place to place, you're more likely to see repeats.

263
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So just be careful.

264
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:19,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to be smart, copy your game data to a memory card or a USB stick if you're going to take the game from place to place.

265
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:22,184
[SPEAKER_04]: That way the game remembers what episode you've already seen.

266
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, you're really setting yourself up for repeats.

267
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:28,646
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is pretty good about knowing which episodes you've already seen, especially if you're going to go on Xbox Live.

268
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:34,527
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you take it from one place to another, it's not going to know because it's a new Xbox, right?

269
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's nothing to read from.

270
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:41,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to see repeats because you only have so many episodes in the beginning.

271
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:43,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just kind of want to throw that out there.

272
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a word of caution.

273
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they did that is a little weird.

274
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't know Jack.

275
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:54,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Very polished, very funny, constant giggles from the group we were playing with.

276
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good value.

277
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:05,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 50 cents for a game is, you know, gosh, you go to Dave & Buster's and throw away money faster than that on those stupid crane games or skeeball or whatever.

278
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a decent value.

279
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:06,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

280
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:35,465
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a few more questions for the buck or maybe a different way to randomize them or something maybe could be the feedback but I will save that for You Don't Know Jack 2 which I do hope happens at this point or whatever they're going to end up calling it so I definitely give the game a favorable review especially if you like these game show games this blows that seen it shit out of the water like seriously this is the definitive trivia party game

281
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: The only possible contender maybe is Buzz on the PS3.

282
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,032
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have the Xbox, you don't really have that.

283
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So this blows that Cena shit out of the water.

284
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,277
[SPEAKER_04]: This is much better.

285
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:45,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So, take a look.

286
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that was really it for my gaming week.

287
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,567
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

288
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:54,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Some housekeeping.

289
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some, I don't want to say late-breaking news, but it just happened a little earlier.

290
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We're competing against the Grammys tonight.

291
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,972
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, last week it was the Stupor Bowl.

292
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight it's the Grammys.

293
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,114
[SPEAKER_04]: In two weeks it's what, the Oscars?

294
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, we just can't fucking win.

295
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:07,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but no one cares about the Oscars.

296
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:08,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is on Sunday.

297
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,777
[SPEAKER_04]: All the good stuff's going to be on YouTube.

298
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:13,799
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see Gaga hatch out of an egg, it'll be on YouTube later.

299
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:18,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to think of a good name to call the Grammys because I have the Super Bowl.

300
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:19,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

301
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:22,744
[SPEAKER_11]: So Grammys should be the Shamys.

302
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:24,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

303
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Kathy Griffin's The Shmemys or whatever she calls it.

304
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:28,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's for the daytime Emmys.

305
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:29,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

306
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the technical ones or whatever.

307
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, besides, by the way, speaking of Kathy Griffin, just because I love that bitch, I got to give a shout out.

308
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear she's going to have a brand new show on Broadway?

309
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:39,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

310
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only going to be on for like a week in March, but it's called, ready?

311
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:43,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Best name for a show ever.

312
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:43,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?

313
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:45,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Kathy Griffin wants a Tony.

314
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

315
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But this isn't the Kathy Griffin podcast.

316
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:52,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I digress.

317
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:53,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I love her.

318
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: She's just really fucking funny.

319
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:57,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I will listen to her stand up while I play WoW.

320
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to a lot of random stuff while I play WoW.

321
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:01,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to podcasts while I play WoW.

322
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to WoW podcasts while I play WoW.

323
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:04,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very meta.

324
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole thing is very meta.

325
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

326
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:10,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when I was in Blade's Edge and we were on Blade's Edge.

327
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

328
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:12,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Very meta.

329
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:13,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

330
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,036
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

331
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:16,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the Grammys.

332
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: That song won a Grammy.

333
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,905
[SPEAKER_04]: The Baba Yetu from Civilization IV, which is a really great song.

334
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,807
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've never heard it, I'll have to fire up a clip here.

335
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:25,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't really prepared to play it.

336
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:26,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

337
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It won a Grammy, which is funny because the song is actually kind of old.

338
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:30,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's...

339
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:36,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been out for a little while because Civilization 4 was kind of what it was written for, but here's how it works.

340
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:39,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, it didn't win for being in Civilization 4.

341
00:19:39,941 --> 00:19:51,549
[SPEAKER_04]: The artist, Christopher Tin, put it in his recent CD that he released, and the CD, the song from the CD won, and I believe he actually won a Grammy for the whole CD as well.

342
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,930
[SPEAKER_04]: He won two Grammys tonight.

343
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a clip if you've never heard this.

344
00:19:55,972 --> 00:20:05,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, if you haven't played Civilization 4, A, you're missing one of the best PC games ever, and B, you haven't had a chance to just sit on the title screen and listen to this.

345
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:22,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't this song just kind of make you feel like, oh yeah, I'm going to rule the world?

346
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,331
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be a military victory game.

347
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:35,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, this is offensive to Islam.

348
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:35,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

349
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry, that was a little big planet.

350
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:39,118
[SPEAKER_07]: My mistake.

351
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:40,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

352
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:42,620
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

353
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:57,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Grammys

354
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some more video game news tonight.

355
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:21,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The stuff that's not late-breaking, but still is going on in the world of gaming this week.

356
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:22,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's going to start us off, as always.

357
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so this is kind of funny.

358
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:36,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Although it was fixed, and I'm sure that the person that runs Kevin Butler's fake account for the fake person probably didn't understand what was going on here.

359
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:51,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, the person that ran the Kevin Butler on Twitter accidentally reposted the key for... Or one of the keys to the PlayStation 3.

360
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:54,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the whole lawsuit going on because the keys got leaked out?

361
00:21:54,848 --> 00:22:03,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, this is the key that turned out to be one used in the hack through the USB dongle, which I don't think anyone even really uses anymore, but...

362
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:12,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Nonetheless, they retweeted, so let me guess, you sank my battleship, and then they retweeted the key.

363
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,542
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-6-D-C, oh, forget it.

364
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:22,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so, of course, you know, it was later removed off the Twitter account, but it is still funny.

365
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like, oh, hey, someone's not paying attention.

366
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully no one got fired over it, but, you know, still funny.

367
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:40,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you don't know what it is, which I'm sure whoever runs this account on behalf of the Kevin Butler character probably didn't know what it was.

368
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, if I didn't do this show, I wouldn't know what that is.

369
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:48,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, even doing this show, I would look at that and go, why is someone speaking to me in hex?

370
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what is your problem?

371
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly, and that doesn't even look, I mean, come on.

372
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That does not look anything like battleship numbers.

373
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, but if you're kind of that snarky character that Kevin Butler's supposed to be, it doesn't like that a little bit.

374
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge Sony faux pas, or they'll get over it.

375
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:16,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the funnier thing about this is that all these blogs are reporting on it with a screenshot of the tweet.

376
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:21,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the tweet has been seen by like 10 times as many people as would have seen it originally.

377
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:24,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it's really funny, but it is.

378
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:26,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Irony, Rob.

379
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:27,255
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

380
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:27,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Irony.

381
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:32,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So, before we get into the next story, I got derailed by something in the chat room.

382
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think this is kind of neat.

383
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I only have kind of heard of this.

384
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:38,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, have you ever heard of this thing called GetGlue?

385
00:23:39,142 --> 00:23:41,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never... It's like a Foursquare.

386
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:43,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine like Foursquare for just stuff.

387
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:45,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a video game you're playing.

388
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You could check in.

389
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know...

390
00:23:49,048 --> 00:23:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how Foursquare works?

391
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You check in to like... And then you cheat while you're driving by?

392
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:56,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm at Pinkberry and I'm checking in so I can be the mayor.

393
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:58,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And if my friends are nearby, I'll get a text message.

394
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they have this thing called GetGlue where you can check into movies you're watching or whatever.

395
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:05,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got told that Orange Lounge Radio has a GetGlue page.

396
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:08,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have people that check in to listening to this on Sunday night.

397
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:09,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought that was really cool.

398
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:11,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to give a shout out to that.

399
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:14,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're listening to this on the podcast or whatever, you should check in on GetGlue.

400
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:15,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.

401
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,712
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a nice way to help spread the word of OLR.

402
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:23,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And I noticed that some of the related ones happen to be like All Games or Video Game Outsiders, which is also on the network.

403
00:24:23,616 --> 00:24:24,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of funny.

404
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And For Real.

405
00:24:25,737 --> 00:24:27,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've never... Who's For Real?

406
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:33,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the band from the 90s that did I Like to Move It, Move It?

407
00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:34,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that who For Real is?

408
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

409
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:36,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

410
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:37,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

411
00:24:37,746 --> 00:24:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, sorry.

412
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:38,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting off track.

413
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,504
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a little obscure, Rob.

414
00:24:41,524 --> 00:24:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very obscure.

415
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

416
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:49,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it says they were on the... No, it's the one that did... It was a remix of something.

417
00:24:49,918 --> 00:24:50,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on Max.

418
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember what the hell it was now.

419
00:24:57,481 --> 00:25:00,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, for real, did I like to move it, move it.

420
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:02,323
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so stupid that we're having this conversation.

421
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:03,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Highs Off of You.

422
00:25:03,623 --> 00:25:04,263
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

423
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:05,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Did that song, I guess.

424
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

425
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:08,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

426
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:13,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Away from the 90s and into today.

427
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:15,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about the Xperia Play.

428
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:19,928
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xperia Play is the Sony PlayStation phone, for lack of a better term.

429
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically what it is.

430
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:22,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of cute.

431
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:29,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a little PlayStation Go, but this time it actually has a phone in it, so there's a lot of purpose to be getting this.

432
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Xperia Play is, of course, the new smartphone.

433
00:25:32,252 --> 00:25:33,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It is coming out in early spring.

434
00:25:33,873 --> 00:25:36,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be on Verizon's network.

435
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:37,334
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're saying.

436
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:45,151
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a Sony Ericsson MWC 2011 press conference where this Xperia Play got its launch window.

437
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out in March.

438
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:47,773
[SPEAKER_04]: The U.S.

439
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: will be one of the first destinations, and Verizon will be the first carrier for the phone.

440
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:59,742
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't say that it will be the only carrier for the phone, just that it will be the first.

441
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:04,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a pretty good year for Verizon so far between the iPhone and this, so...

442
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but carrier makes me think of a disease carrier.

443
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:11,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine some of the other carriers will be getting this too.

444
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And for folks that are maybe like, I'm not feeling the iPhone.

445
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:15,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more of a gamer.

446
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:19,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is going to be a pretty good choice for them.

447
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, by the way, just so you know, the Xperia Play, it's supposed to be preloaded with what they are saying is a legendary PlayStation 1 game.

448
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:31,263
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also going to come with 50 different games from 20 publishers.

449
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:31,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Not built in.

450
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:32,744
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to buy them.

451
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,886
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the legendary game is supposed to be Ridge Racer.

452
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:35,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

453
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,130
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're not saying that.

454
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just according to Kaz Harai.

455
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,796
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't said exactly what the game is yet.

456
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably Ridge Racer.

457
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:49,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be, but that would be a Namco game.

458
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:49,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

459
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think it would come from Sony's first party itself.

460
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:53,772
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

461
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer.

462
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:59,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be weird and say Twisted Metal.

463
00:26:59,474 --> 00:26:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

464
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:03,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That just seems like an easy game to put there.

465
00:27:04,235 --> 00:27:04,655
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

466
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:07,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be Gran Turismo.

467
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:11,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will be something from Sony in-house.

468
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to bring the third party into play.

469
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:16,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be Irritating Stick.

470
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:17,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

471
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:20,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why when you said that I thought Grand Theft Auto.

472
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:22,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do that all the time.

473
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:23,756
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Grand Theft Auto should be on there.

474
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Those two games couldn't be any more different.

475
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

476
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:27,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Gran Turismo would be a good choice.

477
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a very good choice.

478
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:50,884
[SPEAKER_04]: uh just so you know most of the games that will be coming out for the device they are ports of course of other games i noticed uh there's actually a little guitar hero logo in here which is really funny considering what we're going to talk about in a minute uh but uh yeah some of the other games that will be there assassin's creed dead space battlefield fifa a multiplayer fifa game in mobile what's that

479
00:27:52,816 --> 00:28:00,121
[SPEAKER_04]: so, alright alright, well let's move on with some more news or actually wait, before we do, anyone gonna get one of these here in studio, anyone chat?

480
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,282
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna pick up the experience?

481
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:15,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a PSP I have a PSP, I have an iPhone and I'm locked into the iPhone contract, I can't go run out and get another phone I wouldn't care anyway, you know what, I keep getting flashbacks to the N-Gage and that was pretty bad

482
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this will be better than the N-Gage though, let's be real.

483
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be for real.

484
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:25,322
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to play PlayStation 1 games on the go, just buy a PSP.

485
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:30,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, just buy a PSP 1000 and you can do it just as well.

486
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:37,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Except you don't have the dual sort of analog sticks, you know what I mean?

487
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:42,406
[SPEAKER_11]: If I want to play PS1 games on the go, I'll just bring my PS1 with me.

488
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:43,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Amen.

489
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,471
[SPEAKER_11]: and get a mobile monitor, which I think I've still got one somewhere.

490
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little bit disgusted though, Rob.

491
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:53,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that?

492
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:55,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Because about our next news story.

493
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:57,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Disgusted.

494
00:28:58,174 --> 00:28:59,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, out with it.

495
00:28:59,255 --> 00:28:59,755
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

496
00:29:00,828 --> 00:29:05,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm sure many people know already, but the Hero franchise has gone BOOM!

497
00:29:06,856 --> 00:29:15,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision is discontinuing development of Guitar Hero for 2011 and disbanding their business unit.

498
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:44,977
[SPEAKER_11]: and guess what else is included with that that's going to be DJ Hero as well they're not going to be releasing the new download content packs beyond what they already have and nothing new will be made however you can still download everything that's there now and basically they're saying that they've seen rapid declines in that genre but really I think that Rock Band does it better

499
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:52,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, I mean, let's be honest though, is this really a surprise?

500
00:29:52,919 --> 00:30:03,449
[SPEAKER_07]: No Uh, yes, it is a surprise because I would have thought they would have still tried to whore it out I mean, even if sales have dwindled a little bit, you know, why kill off the whole thing?

501
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know why they killed off the whole thing It's because investors tell them what to do

502
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:13,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, honestly, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, big surprise.

503
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, this was all over.

504
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This news was so big it was on CNN.

505
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:18,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all over Twitter.

506
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:20,943
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have even been a trending topic for all I know.

507
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:24,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But all these people were going, RIP Guitar Hero, dead and gone.

508
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We hardly knew ye.

509
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like, um...

510
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anyone buy the last game in the series?

511
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:32,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anyone buy Warriors of Rock?

512
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:34,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we picked up the Green Day one for five bucks at Dimple.

513
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:35,649
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Rock Band.

514
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even Guitar Hero.

515
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, not Green Day.

516
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:41,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the... Van Halen, Metallica?

517
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:42,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, one of the... It was a...

518
00:30:45,402 --> 00:31:10,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero and let's be real five bucks for that Van Halen one is probably about all it's worth like it was really a terrible bad game it was an obvious milking of the franchise so bad that they gave it away free to inflate the numbers of the Guitar Hero 5 series so they could say hey look how many Guitar Hero units have sold for the franchise way more than Rock Band granted they had way more versions come out than Rock Band so

519
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:19,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still disappointing, I mean, because I don't think that they're done.

520
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're done with this, but when they see an idea where they can make some money, they're going to go after it.

521
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:38,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a feeling that the next game they do is going to be similar to Dance Central, because I don't think they want to be out of the market, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a dance hero.

522
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:43,558
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is that I see some folks in chat, and of course, Black Wolf jumping in.

523
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:47,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought Warriors of Ra, I knew there'd be somebody, there'd be like one person that bought it.

524
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:54,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it didn't sell to zero copies, it sold some, but what I'm just saying is that this decline has been a little bit obvious for a while now.

525
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:59,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people out there that were the same ones touting R.I.P.

526
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:05,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero were kind of rolling their eyes a little bit at the franchise and how it kind of has gone the past couple games.

527
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:09,247
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been nothing really that new in the series for a while now.

528
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of hate to say it, but DJ Hero was going down a very similar path.

529
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:20,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the last game in the series wasn't terrible, but I didn't see where there was really a future in DJ Hero either.

530
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:28,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately one of the things we weren't going to be talking about is how they were saying that their digital downloads were up 20%.

531
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:31,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

532
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:51,286
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're lucky, DJ Hero was, for the first one, was much worse.

533
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:52,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It had five.

534
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I think five packs come out, if that.

535
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:09,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And then DJ Hero 2 had about the same within a relatively short time frame, but I don't... You know, we were talking a little bit how they're basically going to...

536
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:19,847
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, cease putting out download content for, you know, Guitar Hero and stuff like that.

537
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:26,974
[SPEAKER_07]: But honestly, I don't think anyone would have noticed if they stopped because they weren't really doing much to begin with.

538
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:31,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's kind of, kind of sucked.

539
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,342
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they really kind of let that slip through their hands.

540
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:41,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, again, I just don't think the series was kind of going anywhere.

541
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,347
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was kind of on a one-track direction.

542
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:47,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I really challenge a lot of these developers to innovate.

543
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That is how you're going to keep your games more interesting.

544
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:52,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but see, here's the thing.

545
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band, I mean, it's the last band standing, so to speak.

546
00:33:57,114 --> 00:34:04,438
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, they didn't really innovate enough, I guess, with Rock Band 3 with the keyboard and everything.

547
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:04,838
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you mean?

548
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:08,361
[SPEAKER_04]: or they're not marketing it well enough, I guess.

549
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not selling as well as the last one, period.

550
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I mean.

551
00:34:12,904 --> 00:34:13,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

552
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:17,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm just saying, you know, because you're saying they didn't innovate.

553
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:19,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take a step back.

554
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:22,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they innovated, but they're not letting people know that so well.

555
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:28,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really see a lot of Rock Band 3 being marketed as now you can really learn to play an instrument.

556
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really learn to play keyboard.

557
00:34:31,557 --> 00:34:35,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't on the daytime talk shows like I kind of thought it would be and so on.

558
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

559
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

560
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:40,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to say that Rock Band hasn't really innovated.

561
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:48,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's done certainly more than Guitar Hero did, which is why it is now standing alone, so to speak.

562
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't think there'll be a Rock Band 4 this year.

563
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:56,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go so far as to say there's not going to be another rock band until there's another series of consoles.

564
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

565
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything's possible.

566
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:05,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly think it would be smart to support the current rock band and just put out more content.

567
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:07,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's definitely what they're doing.

568
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:08,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's...

569
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:17,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't think there is a need to put out a new console game because their business model right now is just putting out tons of content for it.

570
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So why do you need a new version?

571
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:24,670
[SPEAKER_11]: They're making money that way and on top of that it is fairly cost effective.

572
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,593
[SPEAKER_07]: because Activision's plan was kind of the opposite.

573
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:34,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll force them to buy a new copy of the game or a new version of the game because we're not going to put out a lot of content for it.

574
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:38,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only way you're going to get new content is by spending the $60 to buy a brand new game.

575
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:41,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Some interesting questions from chat here.

576
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,703
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR Dollar Bill says, Guitar Hero started doing the DDR type scene where they made new songs but didn't advance the series much.

577
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:53,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of interesting though, DDR is still alive to tell the tale, so to speak.

578
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR is still kickin'.

579
00:35:55,615 --> 00:36:01,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, DDR and Konami also promised that they're going to support DDR with tons of download content and they never fucking do.

580
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Or for Karaoke Revolution.

581
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:07,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Never had a ton of download content on a regular basis like they promised.

582
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:14,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking also DDR probably has a much lower budget than the Guitar Hero games and I don't think there's as high of an expectation there.

583
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in the end that's what's kept DDR going all these years.

584
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:18,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And the weight loss thing.

585
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:20,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody thinks they're going to lose weight playing DDR.

586
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:21,673
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

587
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me bring up this other comment from our chat room.

588
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:50,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Ezam in our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com says, although I think a good question here is, can Konami take advantage of the void and try to get Guitar Freak's Drum Mania stateside?

589
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer is a resounding giant no.

590
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be bluntly honest with you.

591
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:57,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want him to do it.

592
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want him to do it.

593
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the games are as good as Guitar Hero.

594
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:01,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it.

595
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:04,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Might make you mad, but let's be real.

596
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:04,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

597
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,445
[SPEAKER_04]: People are not going to get those games here.

598
00:37:06,465 --> 00:37:08,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami missed that whole thing.

599
00:37:08,846 --> 00:37:11,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And two words, rock revolution.

600
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: That was their attempt to bring those games stateside and don't think it wasn't.

601
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a...

602
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Mess to say nice.

603
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way, and I put it in my Twitter.

604
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:31,254
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want a second attempt at the guitar games and stuff like that, if you put out a decent release now, it might actually work because you're not going to have a lot of competition.

605
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, you're going to have rock bands competition, but you got to...

606
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:45,490
[SPEAKER_07]: We tell our customers that we have... There's tons of people trying to get into the video game or movie market and stuff like that and people that want to sell on eBay and stuff.

607
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:52,275
[SPEAKER_07]: And we tell them, you've got to have a niche because you're competing with people that have been established in the business for a long time.

608
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, same with the music game genre.

609
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:55,678
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to have a niche.

610
00:37:55,878 --> 00:38:00,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, you're not going to be able to compete with the large library that Rock Band has.

611
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:02,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to need to come up with either...

612
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:06,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Original songs, which granted, Konami is great at original songs.

613
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:09,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami originals are just awesome.

614
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:14,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have, for guitar games, they have a huge library of stuff that they can put in there.

615
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:17,778
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people in the U.S.

616
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:24,004
[SPEAKER_07]: may not necessarily get it or be really enthusiastic about some of that stuff, but

617
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:49,487
[SPEAKER_07]: so what, just put it in the game as well and put some good licensed songs from the US in there and maybe don't fuck up the interface system with grey buttons or your stupid drum controller nobody wants to use just use the peripherals that are out there now, put out some good software and that's it and hell, call Guitar Freaks because you know what, you've got that franchise you have the rights to that, why not?

618
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:57,965
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, if Konami were to kill DDR, OLR and the rest of the computer would go on a rampage and go on a global-sized boycott.

619
00:38:58,485 --> 00:38:59,746
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not really.

620
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:01,107
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, no.

621
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised that news hasn't already come out.

622
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:11,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, not to be a pessimist, I know a lot of you still love your DDR, but I'm going to be just, let's not mince words here.

623
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:14,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same game I loved 10 years ago.

624
00:39:16,212 --> 00:39:16,973
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

625
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:34,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was terrible.

626
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was created by an algorithm.

627
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:40,868
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't actually any original steps for that.

628
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And you couldn't make edits for those.

629
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:45,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And they wanted you to buy four fucking pads for that.

630
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:47,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's not gonna happen.

631
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, back to the Activision news.

632
00:39:50,751 --> 00:39:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, I'm a tiny bit sad that means there's probably not gonna be that DJ Hero game on the 3DS.

633
00:39:57,072 --> 00:40:02,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if that's already in the can, so to speak, but I am assuming that's not happening at this point.

634
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:03,785
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's it.

635
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:09,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been interesting to see that like in the portable market and the whole 3D thing, but oh well.

636
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably would have just been a cheap knockoff of the console games anyway.

637
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

638
00:40:13,815 --> 00:40:14,255
[SPEAKER_04]: What can you do?

639
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:18,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Loki, what else you got for us?

640
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:23,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to talk a little bit more about Activision and the fun stuff.

641
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they're reducing their headcount by 500.

642
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you can kind of guess where that's coming from.

643
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:37,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying they're making significant investments elsewhere.

644
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:48,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Our net headcount at the end of the year is probably not going to be materially different given that we're ramping up development teams around Blizzard's new MMO and around Call of Duty initiatives.

645
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because you have to understand this is why Guitar Hero and the whole Hero franchise went away.

646
00:40:54,656 --> 00:41:08,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I can sink, you know, if I'm Activision, I can sink, you know, say $50 million into, you know, a couple Guitar Hero games and maybe not make quite as much money back.

647
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll make back my investment.

648
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:16,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I can sink $50 million into a couple Call of Duty games and they're going to sell like hotcakes.

649
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where they're going to put their money.

650
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:25,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then this is the other thing that didn't really make any sense to me, but I guess, hey, you paid for the license, so why not?

651
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:28,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Spider-Man!

652
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:30,998
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be another Spider-Man game.

653
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I don't know, the last Spider-Man game did so well.

654
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:38,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so they have that coming in 2011.

655
00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:43,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I guess, two TV licensed titles as well.

656
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:44,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

657
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:59,878
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that they're going to see a new Family Guy game, because, God, the last Family Guy game was so wonderful, and a Wipeout game, which, to be honest, they did have a Wipeout game already, and it was not good.

658
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So... Awesome.

659
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:05,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to go.

660
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:09,367
[SPEAKER_07]: That's totally awesome, just to keep that shit around, and...

661
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:17,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, there is that new Spider-Man movie that's coming out, what, next year or whatever, the one they're filming right now with the whole, the reboot.

662
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:20,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but this is just based on that, though.

663
00:42:20,578 --> 00:42:21,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

664
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because this is just, it's going to be like Shattered Dimensions or something.

665
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I would have thought.

666
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of going back to this, I was actually reading, there was a letter to, well, I guess, a letter from the editor and the newest Game Informer that, this is obviously before the whole Guitar Hero stuff went down,

667
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:39,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

668
00:42:54,036 --> 00:42:55,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the fuck are you trying to make a Bond game?

669
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:02,324
[SPEAKER_07]: The Bond franchise has kind of lost its appeal years ago.

670
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:10,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a game that not necessarily this company would be good to make a title for.

671
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a good racing game instead.

672
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:41,030
[SPEAKER_04]: well I don't know about the because honestly I thought that first Daniel Craig Bond movie Casino Royale which a couple years ago was really good it was like it was a nice swift kick in the pants a lot of people were very skeptical about it it was really good but I think the biggest problem was that they were putting out a Bond game when Bond wasn't really in people's minds because Quantum of Solace didn't do as well and some would argue it probably wasn't as good of a movie either and this new Bond game Bloodstone or whatever it was called came out like two years after that like people were not thinking about James Bond

673
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

674
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,781
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew it.

675
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:00,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they just kind of set him up to fail and they got rid of him.

676
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:04,185
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, there is a new Bond movie now coming out.

677
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: They finally confirmed they're going to do a new Bond movie.

678
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it'll be as good as Casino Royale was.

679
00:44:09,008 --> 00:44:11,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder who's going to make the game tie in for that one.

680
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:14,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's going to be Activision because they had the lights to the Bond franchise.

681
00:44:15,092 --> 00:44:16,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But how did Goldeneye end up doing for them?

682
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,741
[SPEAKER_07]: That did okay, I think.

683
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:19,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it?

684
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:19,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, come on.

685
00:44:19,882 --> 00:44:21,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Goldeneye.

686
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:23,842
[SPEAKER_07]: All it is is Goldeneye re-skinned with Daniel Craig on it, and that's it.

687
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably sold more than the other one, sadly.

688
00:44:26,403 --> 00:44:26,883
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably did.

689
00:44:26,903 --> 00:44:28,383
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not Bizarre's fault?

690
00:44:28,563 --> 00:44:29,644
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not Bizarre's fault.

691
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:33,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Bizarre's fault, or there was really no fault to them anyways.

692
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:42,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they could have made the game as great as possible, but when you put it out a week before fucking Call of Duty comes out, no one's going to pay attention to that.

693
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,527
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be like, fuck that, I'm getting Call of Duty.

694
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:53,840
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest problem, I think, with Blur is that it came out the exact same time as Split Second and Mod Nation Racers.

695
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And people just didn't want to buy all those racers.

696
00:44:55,662 --> 00:44:56,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And Red Dead Redemption.

697
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:00,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, Blur, I'm sure, was a pretty good game.

698
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:01,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

699
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just tiny.

700
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And Activision, I don't think, cares.

701
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:06,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

702
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It's frustrating.

703
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:18,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and by the way, I don't remember if this was mentioned before, but remember that Seven Studios, the one that put out that game Scratch?

704
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, Activision bought them and then dissolved them.

705
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:23,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Scratch even ever come out?

706
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:28,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, it never came out because they bought the studio and then they fired them all.

707
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:30,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's awesome.

708
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:31,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Way to go, Activision.

709
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to get rid of your competition.

710
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:34,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something.

711
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:36,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, geez.

712
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:40,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then one more thing I was going to mention, too.

713
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,202
[SPEAKER_07]: One other thing they said they weren't going to put out this year, a new Tony Hawk game.

714
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the last two Tony Hawk games were terrible, so finally they learned a little bit.

715
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: No new Tony Hawk game this year.

716
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: All they need to do is go back to Pro Skater, and they'd be just fine.

717
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:54,670
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

718
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you talking in our chat room, DarkSakura, to the listeners about James Bond.

719
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:05,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we were discussing, a couple of us had the same first Bond movie we saw in the theater.

720
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
[SPEAKER_11]: That was A View to a Kill.

721
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,901
[SPEAKER_04]: The 80s one, right, yeah.

722
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:10,861
[SPEAKER_11]: With Duran Duran doing the intro and Grace Jones.

723
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Grace fucking Jones.

724
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:12,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I love her.

725
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Fierce, fierce human being.

726
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, vicious.

727
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: She's next to the word fierce.

728
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:20,004
[SPEAKER_04]: She invented fierce.

729
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:21,244
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no other.

730
00:46:21,884 --> 00:46:25,145
[SPEAKER_11]: When you look in the dictionary, there's actually no words.

731
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:28,186
[SPEAKER_11]: It just automatically links you mentally to Wikipedia about her.

732
00:46:30,226 --> 00:46:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

733
00:46:31,868 --> 00:46:36,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how Bizarre could have sold a million billion of the Bond game.

734
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:37,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make it all about Grace Jones.

735
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:38,395
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

736
00:46:39,537 --> 00:46:41,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have to go on Wikipedia and look up Grace Jones.

737
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on.

738
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,482
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they sold a ton of games?

739
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

740
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:47,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Smash Bros.

741
00:46:47,944 --> 00:46:48,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Bond.

742
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:51,006
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be awesome.

743
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:52,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a little silly now.

744
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:56,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, the Xbox Live House Party is coming very soon.

745
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:01,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember this is the whole little let's do the Summer of Arcade promotion at a different time in the year.

746
00:47:01,754 --> 00:47:04,957
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, seriously, they need to host this with Kid and Play.

747
00:47:05,017 --> 00:47:05,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

748
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:08,399
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

749
00:47:08,419 --> 00:47:12,302
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to dig them out of wherever rehab center they're in.

750
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if I've taken someone's story later.

751
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:16,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I am.

752
00:47:16,304 --> 00:47:17,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is coming up tonight.

753
00:47:17,425 --> 00:47:30,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's been more and more furious rumors this week that Xbox is planning on launching a TV network within Xbox, which some time ago Conan was wooed to be a part of before they decided to stick with something a little more traditional.

754
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It would not be beyond all reason that Kid and Play could do some type of...

755
00:47:36,878 --> 00:47:37,538
[SPEAKER_04]: House Party

756
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:58,908
[SPEAKER_07]: WolfGirl

757
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:14,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like such crap.

758
00:48:14,214 --> 00:48:16,436
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently she was in Pee Wee's Playhouse Christmas Special.

759
00:48:17,076 --> 00:48:17,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

760
00:48:17,557 --> 00:48:18,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the Beastmaster.

761
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:20,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, can I talk about the house party?

762
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:26,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize Grace Jones was not invited to the house party, but I still want to talk about some of the awesome games that are coming out.

763
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:28,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It all starts this week, February 16th.

764
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:29,508
[SPEAKER_04]: The first release comes out.

765
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:32,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardcore Uprising comes out first.

766
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:35,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game that is kind of like Contra.

767
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really like Contra, but it's not.

768
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:38,796
[SPEAKER_04]: $15 for that.

769
00:48:39,077 --> 00:48:39,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Bejeweled

770
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:40,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Blitz Blitz Blitz Blitz

771
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:10,918
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what else you got for us besides links to Grace Jones' Wikipedias?

772
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:12,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now I'm reading about Studio 54.

773
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:12,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

774
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:42,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, according to EA, 7% of mobile gaming is done on the toilet.

775
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:49,432
[SPEAKER_11]: They did some research, and this is actually from EA Mobile.

776
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:58,878
[SPEAKER_11]: They basically said there were five different percentages of when people tend to play their games.

777
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:02,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And also went over some myths.

778
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:06,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So according to the research, 47% of the time is people playing at home.

779
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:17,107
[SPEAKER_11]: 12% of that time is during a commute, 14% while at work, 7% in the restroom, and 3% during school hours, and 1% at the airport.

780
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:22,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we have a clip of DarkSakura playing on her mobile phone here.

781
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

782
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:24,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

783
00:50:26,129 --> 00:50:27,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

784
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:30,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

785
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

786
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:34,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

787
00:50:37,273 --> 00:50:37,713
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

788
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:39,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

789
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:41,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

790
00:50:43,236 --> 00:50:44,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting on the toilet.

791
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:46,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Sitting on the toilet.

792
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:49,079
[SPEAKER_11]: That's enough of that, Rob.

793
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,342
[SPEAKER_11]: There actually was a shirt that I almost got one time that says iPhone changed the way I pee.

794
00:50:58,084 --> 00:50:58,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was pretty funny.

795
00:50:59,024 --> 00:51:04,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I admit I used to play my phone sometimes at work, but

796
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this one might have actually been a little more appropriate for mobile gaming Now flush

797
00:51:30,768 --> 00:51:31,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be real though?

798
00:51:32,272 --> 00:51:32,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real.

799
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:35,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised the number isn't higher.

800
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:41,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's people who admit to it.

801
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:44,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco is having a sale right now.

802
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: A variety of companies are having iPhone game sales right now where you can get a lot of pretty good iPhone games really cheap.

803
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:52,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the games I bought this week was Pac-Man Championship Edition.

804
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pretty faithful translation.

805
00:51:56,803 --> 00:52:00,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Controls could be a little better with actual tangible buttons, but whatever.

806
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:03,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll tell you, I probably played most of that game.

807
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:24,166
[SPEAKER_11]: I play a lot of Solitaire on the toilet I will freely admit this, my toilet game of choice is Solitaire And reading my Facebook Loki, what's your favorite mobile game to play on the pooper?

808
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't play games on the toilet Really?

809
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I don't What do you do, you just sit there and think?

810
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:32,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

811
00:52:52,682 --> 00:52:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need-

812
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:13,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, there is one other game that actually I did play extensively in the bathroom and that was Angry Birds.

813
00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:18,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dan walked by the bathroom and hearing the tweet noises.

814
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,760
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, are you playing that game in there again?

815
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:21,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

816
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:25,304
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Angry Birds on the toilet.

817
00:53:29,228 --> 00:53:29,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

818
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:33,007
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, how about those other myths, by the way?

819
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:35,950
[SPEAKER_11]: The myth, the top mobile games are all casual.

820
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,982
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they said that their biggest performers, there was Epyx, Infinity Blade, and Dead Space, which were at the top of the App Store.

821
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:49,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And that one size game fits all platforms, and not so.

822
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:57,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the Android ones are specifically having to be redone for working on Android.

823
00:53:58,887 --> 00:53:59,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And brands don't matter.

824
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And he says, yeah, they do.

825
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:02,888
[SPEAKER_11]: The top iPhone games are all brands.

826
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,189
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is as good as it gets.

827
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:06,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said, no, there's going to be better.

828
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:09,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob told me to.

829
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:39,640
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a lot coming out this week.

830
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I will cut you.

831
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:47,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I will put that sitting on the toilet on repeat and blast it.

832
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:50,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sorry about that, Loki.

833
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:50,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Very rude of us.

834
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:51,396
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no problem.

835
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:58,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomorrow, we have Dragon Quest VI Realms of Revelation coming out on the Nintendo DS, which is pretty cool.

836
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:12,209
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're looking for a game with anthropomorphic consoles, because they have Hyperdimension Neptunia, the special edition with an art book in there.

837
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:21,255
[SPEAKER_07]: They have chicks not really resembling consoles, but representing different consoles in that game.

838
00:55:21,415 --> 00:55:23,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, it's like the console wars for real.

839
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:23,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That's on PlayStation 3.

840
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Brunswick Pro Bowling on the Xbox 360 with Kinect, and that's going to be coming out this week as well.

841
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:36,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

842
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:40,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely worth picking up that one.

843
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:46,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone I know had it early because I have special connections in my new job.

844
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:52,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gears of War Triple Pack is coming out this week in case you haven't played any of those games and you want to catch up before the new one comes out.

845
00:55:53,036 --> 00:55:53,717
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, how is it?

846
00:55:55,123 --> 00:55:56,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Marvel vs. Capcom 3?

847
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:56,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

848
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:57,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking awesome.

849
00:55:57,724 --> 00:55:58,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

850
00:55:58,485 --> 00:55:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

851
00:55:59,305 --> 00:56:00,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about Deadpool.

852
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:02,506
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just freaking sweet.

853
00:56:02,646 --> 00:56:09,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and by the way, Shu McGrath and Jill Valentine, unlock content.

854
00:56:09,489 --> 00:56:11,230
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a key for the download content.

855
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not download content.

856
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:14,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

857
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:15,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It's paid unlock content.

858
00:56:15,852 --> 00:56:16,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I don't think it's paid.

859
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just time delayed for people that don't have special editions.

860
00:56:21,154 --> 00:56:21,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, alright.

861
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:22,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

862
00:56:22,995 --> 00:56:23,636
[SPEAKER_07]: But it may be paid.

863
00:56:24,316 --> 00:56:24,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

864
00:56:24,738 --> 00:56:27,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

865
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:28,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

866
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:29,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Other things.

867
00:56:29,524 --> 00:56:31,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Amnesia on PC coming out this week.

868
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:35,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Dance Paradise on Xbox 360 and also supporting Kinect.

869
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:36,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it's terrible though.

870
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:38,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep that in mind.

871
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:55,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeons on PC Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles I'm sorry that's actually getting to next week but that will be coming out on PSP next week or the week after next that's it

872
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, going on to Japanese release dates and what's coming out in Japan this week.

873
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:05,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is getting its release in Japan this week as well.

874
00:57:05,504 --> 00:57:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be out on the Xbox 360 this week.

875
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on the 360 this week, Two Worlds 2, the Japanese version, and a game called Catherine.

876
00:57:13,408 --> 00:57:15,550
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a game from Atlus that is coming out.

877
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Personas Team first game for the HD system.

878
00:57:19,992 --> 00:57:20,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about...

879
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:25,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Vincent is a wishy-washy salaryman, a little too afraid to be tied down.

880
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Facing the appeals of marriage from his longtime girlfriend Catherine, all he wanted to do was to escape.

881
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:35,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And one night he succeeded into the arms of the beautiful young Catherine.

882
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Catherine with a K and Catherine with a C. This sounds kind of weird, but it could be kind of awesome too.

883
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a strategy game, and there's like these guys with sheep heads.

884
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of weird.

885
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:45,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It is fucking weird.

886
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: This looks like a scary game.

887
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:50,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you say Persona, I think, oh, it's going to be the Prinnies.

888
00:57:50,205 --> 00:57:51,867
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this is like a freaking weird game.

889
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,309
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a creepy, erotic game.

890
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:54,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of.

891
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:54,871
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hot.

892
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Night Trap all over again.

893
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:03,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on to the PlayStation 3 and the releases coming out over there.

894
00:58:03,996 --> 00:58:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, of course, Catherine gets a release there as well, as well as Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

895
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:12,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is getting a price reduction this week, if you haven't checked that out.

896
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:15,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And Two Worlds 2, also on the PlayStation 3 this week.

897
00:58:16,023 --> 00:58:18,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So, lots of cross-platform love this week.

898
00:58:18,785 --> 00:58:22,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.

899
00:58:22,927 --> 00:58:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: There is nothing on the Wii this week.

900
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:25,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But next week, there's a Gundam game.

901
00:58:26,229 --> 00:58:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that next week.

902
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,952
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

903
00:58:50,770 --> 00:59:17,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know and on the Sony PSP if you're sad about Guitar Hero having gone under you might be a fan of this series DJ Max Portable 3 is a very big release for the music game fans this week on the PSP that is in regular and limited edition also Monochrome and My Mary May With Bee get price reductions this week that's really what it's called but DJ Max Portable 3 look at that

904
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:24,260
[SPEAKER_04]: All the great K-pop songs in a Beatmania-esque style interface, but on your PSP.

905
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely a lot of cult fans.

906
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:29,362
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a lot of people listening to this show that import that game, I am sure.

907
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for Japanese release dates.

908
00:59:31,463 --> 00:59:34,584
[SPEAKER_04]: How about overseas in the old country?

909
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,500
[SPEAKER_11]: A few things.

910
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:41,925
[SPEAKER_11]: We have on the 16th, Hardcore Uprising on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

911
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:52,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also have on the 18th, Crash Time 4 for Xbox 360, Death Smiles, and then Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

912
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:54,052
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have PopCap hits.

913
00:59:54,893 --> 00:59:55,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

914
00:59:56,874 --> 00:59:57,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And Death Smiles is pretty cool.

915
00:59:58,527 --> 01:00:00,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know what a lot of people will be playing this week.

916
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:01,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Death Smiles.

917
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:01,749
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

918
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:05,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is totally worthy, by the way.

919
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

920
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:08,533
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a chance to check it out early too, huh?

921
01:00:08,593 --> 01:00:09,013
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you think?

922
01:00:09,594 --> 01:00:09,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Worthy.

923
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:14,837
[SPEAKER_11]: But Tatsunoko vs. Capcom fighting scheme not as great.

924
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

925
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:16,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

926
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:21,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wasn't too fond of that when I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

927
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:22,341
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very mash friendly.

928
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:24,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, sounds good for me.

929
01:00:24,522 --> 01:00:25,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I love button mashing.

930
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:30,030
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

931
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not there just yet.

932
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:31,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

933
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:51,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony is claiming that the Gran Turismo Academy, one little event contest that they have going on right now where people race and report their times, I guess, in Gran Turismo 5 on different tracks for different specific categories, with a chance to win a spot as a real race driver.

934
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:55,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they say round two was ruined by cheaters.

935
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And it won't count, so they're moving everybody to round three.

936
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:03,583
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's how they claim it was cheated.

937
01:01:04,184 --> 01:01:10,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the track has a nice little S turn in it, and so people were cutting corners in the track driving off-road.

938
01:01:12,608 --> 01:01:13,649
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a design of the track.

939
01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:17,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't actually something that people used like a mod or something like that to cheat in.

940
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,472
[SPEAKER_07]: They were just cutting corners off-road.

941
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:21,993
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cheating?

942
01:01:23,444 --> 01:01:26,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're like, but in real racing, you would have gotten a penalty for that.

943
01:01:27,227 --> 01:01:31,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe somebody that spent so long making their game... Well, then maybe the game should have penalized you.

944
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:32,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

945
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if you had spent all that time, you know, perfecting your game, maybe you should have, I don't know, added a penalty for cutting the track like that.

946
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:40,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, though.

947
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:48,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I realize Gran Turismo is supposed to be, like, the real deal racing simulator and all that, but, like, games like Mario Kart and shit, and even things like Blur, you're kind of encouraged to do shit like that.

948
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:49,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Burnout.

949
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially Burnout.

950
01:01:50,962 --> 01:01:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Off-roading is encouraged and rewarded.

951
01:01:53,684 --> 01:01:54,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

952
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:55,847
[SPEAKER_04]: That game fuel.

953
01:01:56,187 --> 01:01:58,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That entire fucking game was off-roading.

954
01:01:58,109 --> 01:01:58,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

955
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,271
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even a glitch.

956
01:02:00,552 --> 01:02:02,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just a part of the track.

957
01:02:02,274 --> 01:02:03,395
[SPEAKER_07]: You're cutting out the track.

958
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:06,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that seems a little silly.

959
01:02:06,984 --> 01:02:09,365
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems a little silly to throw the whole thing out because of that.

960
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:11,286
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say about that.

961
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:13,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I think your competition's stupid.

962
01:02:13,808 --> 01:02:20,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's interesting because isn't the prize or whatever for winning the competition to race a real car?

963
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:25,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that they race on that track with the S-curve and drive the fucker off-road because that would be hilarious.

964
01:02:25,416 --> 01:02:27,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they don't want people that are going to do that.

965
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna do that anyways.

966
01:02:29,672 --> 01:02:30,512
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would do.

967
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd drive that thing straight into a wall.

968
01:02:33,393 --> 01:02:34,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, expensive car.

969
01:02:34,673 --> 01:02:35,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Crash.

970
01:02:35,614 --> 01:02:38,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You might also get set on fire and I don't think you really want that.

971
01:02:39,235 --> 01:02:40,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a fire suit.

972
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

973
01:02:43,457 --> 01:02:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

974
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:48,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, round three, though, does start on Monday, so whatever.

975
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:51,100
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how people cheat on that real soon.

976
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:51,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

977
01:02:52,654 --> 01:02:56,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to some more stories for you guys.

978
01:02:57,018 --> 01:03:06,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to get into the classic game of the week, which of course is DarkSakura diving into the vault and finding a game that she thinks you guys should be playing.

979
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:07,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Space 2

980
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:46,118
[SPEAKER_04]: and unfortunately he's not able to walk forward with the mouse and you know this is kind of the bummer with a lot of games that have custom or don't have customizable controls is a lot of times they're customized really weird and people want to change them so

981
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Space 2, We Hear You, Steve Papautas

982
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:11,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry if I said that wrong.

983
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Said that there will be a PC version patch enabling full control remapping.

984
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:19,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be coming out soon.

985
01:04:19,925 --> 01:04:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some full remarks that were made.

986
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:26,887
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dead Space 2 team is aware of the issue that disabled players are having with Dead Space 2 PC.

987
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:37,530
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, a number of folks on our team are so passionate about getting this fix done that they are currently working hard to allow players to remap key bindings to the mouse which should help disabled players enjoy the game.

988
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,250
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very cool.

989
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that they listened, especially with that reason being in place.

990
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:45,534
[SPEAKER_04]: A little silly it wasn't there the first time.

991
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:49,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, customizable controls is a very standard thing in this day and age.

992
01:04:49,897 --> 01:04:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: However, maybe this lesson will help other developers learn it, right?

993
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,061
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of games, though, that really need to have...

994
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:03,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I still... You remember how pissed off I got the very, very first time I played World of Warcraft and found I couldn't use my mouse?

995
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:03,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

996
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:04,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a controller.

997
01:05:05,132 --> 01:05:05,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

998
01:05:05,732 --> 01:05:09,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'd been playing Final Fantasy XI on a controller and I'd been playing PSO on a controller.

999
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:40,064
[SPEAKER_11]: so they should just allow any kind of custom controller to work I think there's a mod for Warcraft where you can use a controller but it's not officially supported so you can't really count it I'm used to the damn keyboard now but I really think that games need to not limit people in how they can control that if you can map anything out on a keyboard then you should be able to map it out on a gamepad as well

1000
01:05:40,644 --> 01:06:04,897
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think it's all this this type of story is a very humbling thing I think too for the developers who have to kind of stop and go oh yeah not everybody is as fortunate as I am to have every you know the 10 fingers and 10 toes doing you know what they what it does you know what I mean so it's uh it's a little bit humbling and just a reminder customizable controls go a long way in helping more people play your game

1001
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:09,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to a segment we do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1002
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:17,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chance for DarkSakura to dive through the vault and find a video game that she says, Hey, you ungrateful kids.

1003
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:18,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1004
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1005
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:21,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop watching those crappy Grammys.

1006
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Get off my lawn.

1007
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:26,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And play this classic game right now.

1008
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:29,046
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1009
01:06:29,554 --> 01:06:39,403
[SPEAKER_11]: The game is Star Parodia, which I had the hardest time finding because a lot of places romanize it as Parodier, which makes sense because it's a parody of Star Soldier.

1010
01:06:40,103 --> 01:06:42,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've talked about this game before, but I haven't used it as a classic game.

1011
01:06:43,006 --> 01:06:43,386
[SPEAKER_11]: I checked.

1012
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:44,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's take a look.

1013
01:06:44,827 --> 01:06:48,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna play a little bit of music.

1014
01:06:54,582 --> 01:06:55,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1015
01:07:12,325 --> 01:07:13,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And it only came out in Japan.

1016
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:18,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were going to be bringing it out in North America as Phantasy Star Soldier, but they did not.

1017
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:26,173
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually had a release through the Virtual Console in Europe on May 16th, 2008.

1018
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, it was released in America on August 11th, 2008.

1019
01:07:32,157 --> 01:07:33,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So you guys can actually play this game now.

1020
01:07:33,657 --> 01:07:34,178
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty funny.

1021
01:07:35,098 --> 01:07:49,921
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a vertically scrolling shooter like the Star Soldier games and has the collecting power-ups to upgrade your weapons and different bosses and mini-bosses and horizontal shooting with your vehicle of choice.

1022
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:56,263
[SPEAKER_11]: This one also has a high score time attack mode that were in Star Soldier.

1023
01:07:57,023 --> 01:07:58,244
[SPEAKER_11]: But now for the parody part.

1024
01:07:58,424 --> 01:08:03,507
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cutesy, has very cartoony type of graphics, and not very violent.

1025
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:08,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when you kill an enemy, they don't die, they just wave white flags.

1026
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:11,152
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can choose one of three different vehicles.

1027
01:08:11,192 --> 01:08:21,699
[SPEAKER_11]: You can choose the Paracelsus from Star Soldier, or a giant flying bomber man, or a PC engine that shoots cue cards and CD-ROMs at the enemies.

1028
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,781
[SPEAKER_11]: This game is super adorable cute.

1029
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:26,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this game.

1030
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:31,884
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember when my friend, we were visiting my friend who lived in Berkeley at the time.

1031
01:08:32,164 --> 01:08:34,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Like right now they're fighting the origami monster.

1032
01:08:34,204 --> 01:08:35,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like one of those tangrams.

1033
01:08:35,965 --> 01:08:36,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1034
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:44,107
[SPEAKER_11]: But a friend of ours, you know, was just breaking out the most bizarre of her PC Engine collection and saying, play this.

1035
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's pretty fun.

1036
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,868
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is actually one I'm looking for a legit of.

1037
01:08:47,908 --> 01:08:48,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a copy of it.

1038
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:51,349
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a fun little game.

1039
01:08:52,825 --> 01:08:55,709
[SPEAKER_11]: and... I mean, it's just... I love parody games.

1040
01:08:55,769 --> 01:09:00,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I love games that are fun, you know, good, solid games that don't take themselves too seriously.

1041
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:04,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I love the Proteus series a lot more than this, obviously.

1042
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,567
[SPEAKER_11]: But... this one's just really...

1043
01:09:08,307 --> 01:09:13,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And on top of that, I like that all the little guys that they talk to in the intro are little Bomberman guys.

1044
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:22,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're outfitting a PC Engine, you know, with a big smiley face, with a copy of Super Star Soldier, so it'll fight.

1045
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:23,698
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty funny.

1046
01:09:23,718 --> 01:09:26,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a little sexy lady standing on the stage in the background there.

1047
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,642
[SPEAKER_11]: She's like, ooh, don't shoot me.

1048
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:33,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I think one of the enemies you fight in this is like a black Bomberman.

1049
01:09:34,565 --> 01:09:35,885
[SPEAKER_11]: and all kinds of stuff.

1050
01:09:36,145 --> 01:09:37,646
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really a fun little game.

1051
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:39,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love the music in it.

1052
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:40,307
[SPEAKER_11]: The music's great.

1053
01:09:41,308 --> 01:09:42,188
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the giant fish.

1054
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:44,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a fish.

1055
01:09:44,369 --> 01:09:45,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Who plays a maraca, apparently.

1056
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it plays maracas.

1057
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:47,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1058
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:50,092
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's totally worth it.

1059
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,713
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get it on Virtual Console.

1060
01:09:51,873 --> 01:09:53,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I totally recommend it.

1061
01:09:53,474 --> 01:09:56,476
[SPEAKER_11]: It's officially listed as Star Parodia.

1062
01:09:56,536 --> 01:10:00,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned it as Star Parodia, so it doesn't matter.

1063
01:10:00,257 --> 01:10:02,959
[SPEAKER_11]: It's written as Star Parodia.

1064
01:10:03,795 --> 01:10:09,002
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Star Parodia, or whatever you want to say.

1065
01:10:09,343 --> 01:10:10,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Soldier, but, you know.

1066
01:10:11,926 --> 01:10:13,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is available on Virtual Console?

1067
01:10:13,889 --> 01:10:17,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is, and America came out again on August 11th, 2008.

1068
01:10:19,196 --> 01:10:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1069
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:22,460
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it, your classic game of the week.

1070
01:10:23,021 --> 01:10:25,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's part of the show where we're going to take a quick break.

1071
01:10:25,044 --> 01:10:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1072
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:26,766
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to come right back.

1073
01:10:27,106 --> 01:10:34,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot more stories to talk about in Part B tonight, including a very interesting story about possible serial numbers coming to PlayStation 3 games tomorrow.

1074
01:10:36,718 --> 01:10:39,402
[SPEAKER_04]: and your Twitter topics.

1075
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:40,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Last chance to get those in you guys.

1076
01:10:41,124 --> 01:10:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1077
01:10:43,387 --> 01:10:47,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to follow us on Twitter so you can interact with the show and send us your story suggestions.

1078
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:49,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we're going to take a break.

1079
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:52,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:10:58,393 --> 01:11:07,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, the February 13th of 2011, or 2011, whatever it is you prefer.

1081
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,504
[SPEAKER_04]: We're up against the Grammys tonight, but whatever, all the good stuff will be on YouTube later anyway.

1082
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't stop some of our live people from kind of watching it with one eye and listening to this show with their ears or what have you.

1083
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:25,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still here, you know, kind of moving away at the gaming news from the week.

1084
01:11:25,675 --> 01:11:27,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to get into the Twitter topics real soon.

1085
01:11:27,535 --> 01:11:29,696
[SPEAKER_04]: A chance for you guys to interact with us here live on the show.

1086
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Some rapid fire news, of course, in a moment as well.

1087
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:35,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe more talk about Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1088
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:35,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1089
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,279
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1090
01:11:52,837 --> 01:11:53,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Comic Insanity.

1091
01:11:54,459 --> 01:11:56,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And today we had a special guest on the show.

1092
01:11:57,441 --> 01:12:01,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We had PJ Perez, who is the publisher for Pop Goes the Icon.

1093
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:03,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.

1094
01:12:04,307 --> 01:12:16,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also host this with Maren Marvel, as we all know her as Tiara, and Shadow, or Dan Shadow, or whichever name he's deciding to go by this week.

1095
01:12:17,378 --> 01:12:17,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1096
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:18,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1097
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,123
[SPEAKER_11]: We go live on Tuesday at InfamousNFAMOUS.net Awesome.

1098
01:12:25,464 --> 01:12:31,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The spinoff show that I do is called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, or Horde House for short, if you're a fan of World of Warcraft.

1099
01:12:31,588 --> 01:12:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll probably like this show.

1100
01:12:32,509 --> 01:12:35,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It's myself and Extifer being really lulzy about the game.

1101
01:12:35,972 --> 01:12:38,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And this week was some PvP-centric talk.

1102
01:12:38,553 --> 01:12:41,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are into PvP at all, you might want to check out this week's show.

1103
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:46,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, all the Warcraft news and everything going on in the world of Warcraft.

1104
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:47,099
[SPEAKER_04]: on Horde House.

1105
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out on iTunes.

1106
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:48,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very fun.

1107
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,641
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not cool enough to have a website yet.

1108
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:51,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe someday.

1109
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:54,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1110
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:57,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Some quick, quick stuff that just didn't make the show otherwise.

1111
01:12:57,684 --> 01:13:00,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely your last chance to get those Twitter topics in.

1112
01:13:00,586 --> 01:13:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be getting those right after the quick fire news stories.

1113
01:13:03,887 --> 01:13:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, Project M, a kind of a homebrew effort to make Super Smash Bros.

1114
01:13:09,812 --> 01:13:12,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Brawl play a little bit more like Super Smash Bros.

1115
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:15,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Melee, has released its first demo.

1116
01:13:15,337 --> 01:13:19,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what's kind of cool about this hack is it doesn't require that you have any sort of mods done to your system.

1117
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need to do is dump it onto a SD card and pop it into your Wii, and away you go.

1118
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:58,029
[SPEAKER_07]: so you can download that from Project M's website which is projectm.smashmods.com and I believe that you do need a card though that is less than 2 gigs in size in order to be able to have the thing work but yeah check it out it's really more for the hardcore Malibu player because there's a lot of tweaks and stuff in there that most average people probably wouldn't get so that is out there to check out

1119
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:09,700
[SPEAKER_07]: In case you have a Netflix disc for your PlayStation Wii, well, unfortunately, it's not going to work after February 16th.

1120
01:14:10,601 --> 01:14:20,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess, you know, they're going to send out an email to all the members saying that the disc will cease to function, and that's it.

1121
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:21,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1122
01:14:23,267 --> 01:14:23,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

1123
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:30,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But, of course, you can always download the streaming software via the Wii Shop channel because that's why they're getting rid of this.

1124
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:32,472
[SPEAKER_07]: There is another option for you.

1125
01:14:34,013 --> 01:14:38,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Be sure to do that if you want to still stream stuff on your Wii.

1126
01:14:39,336 --> 01:14:42,620
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1127
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:08,144
[SPEAKER_07]: The Battle of Little Slugger, Kano's Salt, and those are going to be released as remixed extended versions.

1128
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:14,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Beatus Blues, we're getting, I guess, a retro remix for that release.

1129
01:15:15,526 --> 01:15:18,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be awesome because the music from Super Meat Boy is great.

1130
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:18,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1131
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:19,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1132
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:23,948
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be probably some really hard stuff too, which will be awesome.

1133
01:15:23,968 --> 01:15:30,950
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, his comment was, I wanted to have some stuff in there for people who delight in 100%ing expert Dragon Force.

1134
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'll give you an idea of how hard it's going to be.

1135
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:34,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1136
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:36,431
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1137
01:15:36,691 --> 01:15:36,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1138
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're expected sometime after February 15th.

1139
01:15:39,932 --> 01:15:40,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1140
01:15:41,368 --> 01:16:10,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, let's get to some other news, and this kinda sorta has to do with that same thing, except it's not Super Meat Boy, it's Rock Band, and what is coming out this week on Rock Band, the good news is, despite all of the stuff that's going on with Guitar Hero, Rock Band is still kicking, with some expansions, and I like this, this week is the February Heartache Duets Pack, which I think is great, which includes Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart.

1141
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:10,838
[SPEAKER_04]: That's

1142
01:16:11,139 --> 01:16:11,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Lita Ford

1143
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:22,386
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we do have Animotion with Obsession, which I think is cool Bob, B.O.B.

1144
01:16:22,446 --> 01:16:38,857
[SPEAKER_04]: with Hayley Williams with Airplanes Human League with Don't You Want Me Lady Antebellum with Need You Now Stevie Nicks with Stop Dragging My Heart Around Oh, now that's a good one By far the coolest No, this blows all the others out of the water You ready?

1145
01:16:39,898 --> 01:16:42,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Paradise by The Dashboard Light by Meatloaf

1146
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Outstanding.

1147
01:16:45,181 --> 01:16:46,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely outstanding.

1148
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,922
[SPEAKER_11]: But we just scared Shermie out with that list.

1149
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:50,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Not quite.

1150
01:16:50,503 --> 01:16:51,603
[SPEAKER_04]: She is sitting in the doorway.

1151
01:16:51,943 --> 01:16:54,024
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be something even Shermie could enjoy.

1152
01:16:54,764 --> 01:17:02,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hitting the blogs this week about a three-year-old named Oliver Smith who was playing a game on the Nintendo Wii that his mom bought him.

1153
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:04,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Victoria is the mom's name.

1154
01:17:05,108 --> 01:17:07,669
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is on the European version of the Wii.

1155
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:11,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Countdown, which is based off a television show that they have over in Britain.

1156
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,457
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically you unscramble words.

1157
01:17:14,477 --> 01:17:17,324
[SPEAKER_04]: They show up in whatever format and then you unscramble them.

1158
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:27,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the kid got a word, S-H-A-H-S-I-T-E-D, and you know what that unscrambled into?

1159
01:17:28,203 --> 01:17:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Shitheads.

1160
01:17:29,324 --> 01:17:29,744
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1161
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Shitheads.

1162
01:17:31,525 --> 01:17:41,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So this little three-year-old got exposed to that word, and of course, according to the angry mother, I couldn't believe my eyes as the word was slowly unveiled as an obscene insult.

1163
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Oliver is a really bright kid, and we play this game to help him build up his word bank.

1164
01:17:45,569 --> 01:17:47,590
[SPEAKER_04]: He was already asking what the word meant.

1165
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1166
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody let that one slip by in the dictionary.

1167
01:17:52,707 --> 01:17:53,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoops.

1168
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:58,711
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you expose your children to it early, then it's not a special order and they won't be as inclined to say it.

1169
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:01,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And this last one.

1170
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:07,138
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I don't even really want to report on it, but it's just kind of sad because of everything we have going on with Guitar Hero and all that.

1171
01:18:07,878 --> 01:18:10,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, Karaoke Revolution Glee Volume 2.

1172
01:18:11,201 --> 01:18:11,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming.

1173
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:13,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1174
01:18:13,062 --> 01:18:13,743
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 more songs.

1175
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:16,208
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1176
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:42,040
[SPEAKER_11]: A bunch of crap.

1177
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:43,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, not crap.

1178
01:18:44,063 --> 01:18:49,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy 1 and 2 is coming to PlayStation Network in Europe and it will be £7.99.

1179
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:55,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be the UMD versions that came out in 2008.

1180
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:59,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, as far as I recall, weren't very great.

1181
01:19:00,462 --> 01:19:03,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's going to be a new DDR game for iOS.

1182
01:19:03,366 --> 01:19:10,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be Dance Dance Revolution Freedom and it is free and has four songs.

1183
01:19:11,636 --> 01:19:14,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that the tap to start is a thumbprint.

1184
01:19:14,299 --> 01:19:15,140
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually cool.

1185
01:19:16,021 --> 01:19:16,301
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1186
01:19:18,806 --> 01:19:19,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it looks interesting.

1187
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:20,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'll give it a try.

1188
01:19:20,947 --> 01:19:21,888
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's free, why not?

1189
01:19:21,968 --> 01:19:22,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoot.

1190
01:19:23,289 --> 01:19:29,613
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it looks like Arcade Infinity is actually for real closing its doors.

1191
01:19:30,734 --> 01:19:32,255
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be closing on February 26, 2000.

1192
01:19:32,835 --> 01:19:36,097
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to fake closing their doors like we had a couple months ago.

1193
01:19:36,217 --> 01:19:38,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're closing on February 26, 2011.

1194
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:43,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's actually L.A.

1195
01:19:43,302 --> 01:19:46,564
[SPEAKER_11]: County denied their application for business license extension

1196
01:19:49,793 --> 01:20:03,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So, they have to close, the county wants them to close shop, pay for a new license, and wait for all of the hearings and city council votes in order for it to stay open, which could take up to eight months.

1197
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do they have such, what's their problem with this arcade?

1198
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:10,784
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, it's like they hate them.

1199
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:16,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're saying it's not the money, it's just how long AI would have had to remain closed.

1200
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:19,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's going away.

1201
01:20:20,427 --> 01:20:21,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate you LA.

1202
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:23,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Officially.

1203
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just, it's, you know, we kind of talked about this when the news came up the first time.

1204
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:30,110
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of sad to hear about these arcades closing.

1205
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:30,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1206
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:40,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, but I'm sure there'll be no shortage of little arcades where ticket spitting machines come out and all that stuff.

1207
01:20:41,174 --> 01:20:41,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1208
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:45,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move into the Twitter topics.

1209
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:51,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week you guys send us your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1210
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We like to read some of our favorites here on the show.

1211
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting into some of the tweets sent to us tonight.

1212
01:20:57,302 --> 01:20:57,883
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few.

1213
01:20:57,923 --> 01:20:59,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, there's tons of tweets tonight.

1214
01:20:59,884 --> 01:21:06,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And getting into the first tweet here from Eternal Rapture says, Listening live for the first time tonight because I live in the UK.

1215
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm staying up till 5 a.m.

1216
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:08,372
[SPEAKER_04]: for you guys.

1217
01:21:09,113 --> 01:21:10,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's way past your bedtime.

1218
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:12,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's a three-day weekend or something.

1219
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:20,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft tweets us and says, Since Bobby Yetu won the Grammy it was nominated for, I think it's only fair to have it on OLR's I Love This Song this week.

1220
01:21:20,603 --> 01:21:21,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think so?

1221
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:24,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm all for having actual content on the website.

1222
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:27,349
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be amazing.

1223
01:21:27,769 --> 01:21:28,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

1224
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:29,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Seg.

1225
01:21:30,772 --> 01:21:35,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Sending us a tweet saying, the only relevant Grammy news, I'm sorry, is that it?

1226
01:21:35,595 --> 01:21:36,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it is a tweet to us.

1227
01:21:36,536 --> 01:21:43,040
[SPEAKER_04]: The only relevant Grammy news is Christopher Tinn winning one for Baba Yetu from Civ 4, which is very relevant.

1228
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:43,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1229
01:21:44,081 --> 01:21:45,161
[SPEAKER_04]: That is extremely relevant.

1230
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:46,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to hear it.

1231
01:21:47,743 --> 01:21:48,844
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1232
01:21:49,644 --> 01:21:54,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Jake Jake LL sends us, sorry, that's a spam tweet.

1233
01:21:57,609 --> 01:21:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Get an NFL game for free.

1234
01:21:59,411 --> 01:21:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

1235
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:01,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1236
01:22:02,476 --> 01:22:08,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Swim sends us a tweet here saying, Loki, have you seen the new Earth Defense Force insect Armageddon trailer, Pesticide Gun?

1237
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:10,959
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I haven't seen it yet.

1238
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about that?

1239
01:22:12,559 --> 01:22:15,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Swim sends us a link to that little video right here so we can take a look at it.

1240
01:22:15,861 --> 01:22:16,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1241
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:18,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pause this and turn this up.

1242
01:22:18,882 --> 01:22:20,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what sucks about that game?

1243
01:22:20,162 --> 01:22:21,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it's been delayed.

1244
01:22:45,972 --> 01:22:47,593
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1245
01:22:47,893 --> 01:22:49,815
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that it's delayed to June.

1246
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:52,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You mad?

1247
01:22:53,237 --> 01:22:53,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

1248
01:22:54,038 --> 01:22:55,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not mad but disappointed.

1249
01:22:56,048 --> 01:22:58,169
[SPEAKER_04]: and a couple from Tigerclaw here.

1250
01:22:58,329 --> 01:23:02,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess a Plants vs. Zombies board game is actually happening.

1251
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:02,970
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1252
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:03,891
[SPEAKER_04]: A board game?

1253
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a little strange, but kind of not surprising.

1254
01:23:06,672 --> 01:23:09,153
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of this stuff usually crosses over into other worlds.

1255
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:12,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, there's a Plants vs. Zombies board game.

1256
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:14,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It was spotted at Toy Fair 2011.

1257
01:23:14,194 --> 01:23:24,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a 2-4 player game with 80 zombie guards, cards, excuse me, 40 plant cards and different game boards on which you place these plants and battle the various zombies.

1258
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:28,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to play that on an iPad the other day.

1259
01:23:29,483 --> 01:23:30,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted an iPad after that.

1260
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:36,091
[SPEAKER_04]: The iPad works a little better, those versions, than the other ones.

1261
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:42,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also a tweet from Tigerclaw telling us that the World of Starcraft mod, remember this?

1262
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:50,342
[SPEAKER_04]: This was somebody taking Starcraft 2 and making a custom mod in it that was World of Starcraft, and Blizzard did not take too kindly to this.

1263
01:23:50,382 --> 01:23:51,963
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about this on Horde House a little bit this week.

1264
01:23:52,344 --> 01:23:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now called Starcraft Universe.

1265
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:57,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has a name that I guess is a little less threatening to Blizzard.

1266
01:23:57,688 --> 01:23:59,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And now Sony gets pissed off.

1267
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1268
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:01,812
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1269
01:24:02,172 --> 01:24:04,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it has its name changed and there you go.

1270
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:10,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, SSJ100Matt says his tweet tonight saying, Resident hockey fan with some hockey game news.

1271
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:14,904
[SPEAKER_04]: NHL 2K11 is available now for the iPad for $5.

1272
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:17,447
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're into hockey, check that out.

1273
01:24:18,528 --> 01:24:19,889
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not Blades of Steel though.

1274
01:24:19,909 --> 01:24:22,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That will always be the best hockey game as far as I'm concerned.

1275
01:24:23,372 --> 01:24:23,813
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1276
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:27,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a couple last-minute tweets.

1277
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read these.

1278
01:24:28,616 --> 01:24:39,384
[SPEAKER_04]: SilverSonic tweets us on Twitter and saying, I just linked this in the chat room, but did you hear the story of the 11-year-old boy in the UK that spent 1 million pounds on Xbox Live?

1279
01:24:39,464 --> 01:24:39,904
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

1280
01:24:39,924 --> 01:24:41,045
[SPEAKER_04]: He links us the story here.

1281
01:24:41,845 --> 01:24:49,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the 11-year-old kid racked up a 1,000-pound debt on the debit card through the Xbox Live.

1282
01:24:51,072 --> 01:25:01,006
[SPEAKER_04]: he bought accessories and new games on the consoles after it saved details of a previously registered card it's hard to get those cards off there yeah it is

1283
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:02,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1284
01:25:03,452 --> 01:25:08,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, why is she kind of letting the kid run rampant with this?

1285
01:25:08,276 --> 01:25:15,983
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this little picture where her and the kid are kind of posing together, looking all, I don't know, I don't want to say happy, but they look kind of frumpy, I guess.

1286
01:25:17,564 --> 01:25:26,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting is that I guess she showed the thing to the kid, and she says, when I showed him, he burst into tears.

1287
01:25:26,832 --> 01:25:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: He unplugged the Xbox and said he didn't want it anymore.

1288
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:33,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't punished him because he feels bad enough and I know he won't do it again.

1289
01:25:34,778 --> 01:25:35,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know though.

1290
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:37,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm working two jobs and I'm a single mother.

1291
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't pay this back.

1292
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:41,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Be responsible.

1293
01:25:41,802 --> 01:25:43,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you put the card in there in the first place?

1294
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:48,945
[SPEAKER_07]: They have parental things that they can enable to where you can disable live purchases.

1295
01:25:49,225 --> 01:25:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1296
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:58,890
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't pay attention on how to set controls on your consoles, then you can only blame yourself for when someone spends money on it.

1297
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:02,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't pretend, oh, I didn't know.

1298
01:26:04,619 --> 01:26:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for tweets tonight.

1299
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us on Twitter and send us some tweets for next week.

1300
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:13,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1301
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:13,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1302
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:16,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no patience for those type of people.

1303
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,685
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of ironic, I guess.

1304
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's suing Sony this time, so Sony's suing other people.

1305
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, LG has sent a lawsuit to Sony regarding their system, the PlayStation 3.

1306
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: They claim that certain electronic devices having a Blu-ray disc player and components there violates four of its patents.

1307
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:44,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And that includes, I guess, a lot of devices like Bravia TVs.

1308
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,763
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only piece of hardware, I guess, they were singling out was the PlayStation 3.

1309
01:26:50,524 --> 01:26:53,066
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually have a specific model, which is the 160 gigabyte system.

1310
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:00,792
[SPEAKER_07]: The complaint with the U.S.

1311
01:27:00,953 --> 01:27:07,659
[SPEAKER_07]: International Trade Commission has the power to block imports of products that violate U.S.

1312
01:27:07,739 --> 01:27:09,160
[SPEAKER_07]: patents.

1313
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:15,846
[SPEAKER_07]: In short, LG is looking to have the ITC keep the PS3s off American shores.

1314
01:27:18,038 --> 01:27:28,442
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they've also filed a civil suit against Sony in federal court in California making similar claims and seeking cash compensation for unauthorized use of its inventions.

1315
01:27:31,462 --> 01:27:31,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1316
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:32,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Very.

1317
01:27:34,324 --> 01:27:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1318
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:02,098
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1319
01:28:02,758 --> 01:28:03,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on with this.

1320
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,720
[SPEAKER_04]: This rumor just never stops.

1321
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,502
[SPEAKER_04]: This rumor is always around, and it's, when is Apple getting into gaming?

1322
01:28:09,542 --> 01:28:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: When is Apple getting into gaming?

1323
01:28:10,742 --> 01:28:13,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like, well, they're already in gaming if you consider the iPhone.

1324
01:28:13,783 --> 01:28:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But okay, how about the consoles?

1325
01:28:15,284 --> 01:28:16,905
[SPEAKER_04]: When are they going to get back into consoles?

1326
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:21,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I guess you could say the Pippin, but I think Apple would rather not talk about that.

1327
01:28:21,607 --> 01:28:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, one of the rumors that keeps coming up is the Apple TV because, you know, they've sold this device for very cheap and it's kind of way to get Apple connected to your television.

1328
01:28:31,134 --> 01:28:36,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the rumors are coming up again that perhaps Apple TV games are more real than you think.

1329
01:28:36,638 --> 01:28:42,481
[SPEAKER_07]: But how, let me put it this way, the Apple TV, is it even powerful enough to run games on it?

1330
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:53,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know it's, I think it's Intel Atom CPU, but, I mean, is that comparable to like an iPod or something, or an iPhone?

1331
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:57,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, can they run, I mean, would they even be able to have the horsepower to do that?

1332
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:59,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you'd be talking top of the line stuff here.

1333
01:28:59,973 --> 01:29:02,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you'd be playing exactly Gears of War on one of these things.

1334
01:29:03,274 --> 01:29:15,698
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe either some type of device between your iPhone and this, like maybe it can talk to the iPhone and kind of like what your PSP is supposed to do with the PS3 where you beam images from one source to the other.

1335
01:29:16,878 --> 01:29:26,068
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cool now if you could stream games from say your iPod or iPhone or something like that and then play them on the Apple TV with a controller.

1336
01:29:26,649 --> 01:29:27,770
[SPEAKER_07]: A physical controller.

1337
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:34,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Although at the same time just like a physical controller for my iPod would be awfully nice.

1338
01:29:34,778 --> 01:29:35,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1339
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:57,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I use my remote control as a tangible controller, perhaps?

1340
01:29:58,472 --> 01:29:58,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1341
01:29:59,032 --> 01:30:02,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait, I didn't even tell you where this rumor comes from because you're going to laugh at this.

1342
01:30:02,895 --> 01:30:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why this is a rumor all over again.

1343
01:30:05,376 --> 01:30:11,660
[SPEAKER_04]: There's beta code out there for the new iOS 4.3 because, you know, they regularly do updates to iOS and so forth.

1344
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:20,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, 4.3 apparently in the code references ATV games and people think that means Apple TV because ATV.

1345
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: and the code I guess also talks about controllers of some sort, leaderboards, scheduling games and of course, a storefront.

1346
01:30:34,045 --> 01:30:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this news isn't, like, shocking.

1347
01:30:35,907 --> 01:30:40,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of one of those matter-of-time types of things, but it's interesting to see what sort of things they have planned.

1348
01:30:41,211 --> 01:30:44,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there would be a new Apple TV that would help facilitate this, and we'll see.

1349
01:30:45,435 --> 01:30:47,676
[SPEAKER_07]: The price point's awfully nice of the Apple TV.

1350
01:30:47,737 --> 01:30:51,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they're trying to get people to bring it in as, like, a game console.

1351
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:51,660
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

1352
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:59,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, if they even drop the price, like, say, another $20, $79.99, that would be pretty, you know, appealing to people that aren't necessarily...

1353
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:28,313
[SPEAKER_07]: into gaming and the other thing which would be kind of cool and I'm not too sure on the whole I don't know too much about the Apple TV other than the fact that you can stream shit from your PC your Apple or iTunes or whatever to it and stuff can you run apps on there already on the Apple TV can like I say browse Google or something you know do Facebook and stuff like that you can do on like the iPods and the iPhones and stuff can you do that stuff already on Apple TV

1354
01:31:29,933 --> 01:31:32,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do the song.

1355
01:31:32,594 --> 01:31:34,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think you can do movies and stuff.

1356
01:31:34,414 --> 01:31:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1357
01:31:35,035 --> 01:31:37,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well you can do movies, but you can't run apps.

1358
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:39,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do Facebook or anything like that.

1359
01:31:39,856 --> 01:31:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1360
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:46,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be interesting if they did that because then they would be trying to compete with Google TV and stuff like that.

1361
01:31:47,538 --> 01:31:52,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you throw gaming in there, that could be interesting seeing as it's way cheaper than Google TV.

1362
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:53,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1363
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:55,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be smart for them to do that.

1364
01:31:55,811 --> 01:32:06,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets people to bring that shit into their house for the gaming, and then they can sell them on, hey, look, you can buy TV shows, or you can buy this.

1365
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:13,636
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be a real stretch here, but maybe this is part of what the whole iPad 2 thing has to do with.

1366
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:22,101
[SPEAKER_04]: because we haven't heard a lot out of iPad 2 besides that it's supposed to have this front-facing camera and might have the nice retina display.

1367
01:32:22,161 --> 01:32:22,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1368
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really heard anything but a bunch of rumors.

1369
01:32:25,843 --> 01:32:28,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But there will be that inevitable press conference at some point.

1370
01:32:29,084 --> 01:32:33,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So could this maybe tie into that somehow?

1371
01:32:33,327 --> 01:32:36,468
[SPEAKER_07]: They were saying even that the 3.4 – or was it 4.3?

1372
01:32:36,568 --> 01:32:37,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1373
01:32:37,169 --> 01:32:38,670
[SPEAKER_07]: The new –

1374
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:44,614
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us in the meantime?

1375
01:33:05,931 --> 01:33:16,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it looks like there has been an alleged Dance Central 2 survey that might be looking at a feature list.

1376
01:33:17,477 --> 01:33:27,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, Kotaku says that it has an email survey from Microsoft Game Studios that has a list of those features, that it's in pre-production.

1377
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:50,735
[SPEAKER_11]: and that it would have the ability to create custom dances and play as backup dancers or singers and then you can replay entire sequences and get specific feedback on your dancing and then they're also having a fitness mode and an online offline multiplayer contest and that you will have a social aspect to it so

1378
01:33:52,236 --> 01:33:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: God, does this mean that you can put a video of yourself, like, dancing through, captured via the Kinect, I don't know, like, somehow automatically?

1379
01:33:59,661 --> 01:34:00,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

1380
01:34:04,604 --> 01:34:05,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds kind of scary to me.

1381
01:34:06,225 --> 01:34:06,725
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit.

1382
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:09,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, they want that whole community thing.

1383
01:34:10,034 --> 01:34:14,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And after all, they've been, you know, doing the first party Kinect games and take pictures of you.

1384
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:19,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I'm surprised you can't share those pictures, you know, with like Facebook and stuff.

1385
01:34:20,578 --> 01:34:23,419
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I'm unaware that you can easily.

1386
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I would think that they would want to do something like that.

1387
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:34,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And wasn't there some sort of feature that was supposed to be coming where we can do screenshots from games and stuff like that and like share them on Facebook and that kind of crap?

1388
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:45,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause wasn't there like when they were talking about the whole Facebook integration and stuff And it's like, hey look, I just, you know, blah blah blah and Tiger Woods And here's a screenshot of me hitting a hole in one or some crap

1389
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:47,167
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar has that.

1390
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:47,828
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar has that.

1391
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:13,426
[SPEAKER_07]: and Def Jam Rapstar has that.

1392
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:14,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, Konami.

1393
01:35:14,746 --> 01:35:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got components for a good game in there.

1394
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting.

1395
01:35:18,307 --> 01:35:21,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Def Jam Rapstar is one of the better music games that's been put out recently.

1396
01:35:21,988 --> 01:35:22,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

1397
01:35:25,048 --> 01:35:26,029
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the potential.

1398
01:35:26,069 --> 01:35:28,909
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just like, I don't want to do it.

1399
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:29,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't.

1400
01:35:31,870 --> 01:35:33,731
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of disappointing, I suppose.

1401
01:35:34,512 --> 01:35:38,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Crysis 2 has been leaked online, including multiplayer.

1402
01:35:38,854 --> 01:35:45,318
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the final version of the game, but it's a near-final build of the game, including multiplayer.

1403
01:35:46,018 --> 01:35:50,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, apparently, I guess that there's...

1404
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:59,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other things including that it doesn't have the DRM on it, that there's a way to bypass it and that kind of stuff.

1405
01:36:00,045 --> 01:36:12,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there's some stuff that's placeholder in it, like some of the sound effects, some of the assets are missing, but it is quite playable and is floating around out there for those unscrupulous types that may want to download that and check it out.

1406
01:36:15,888 --> 01:36:17,508
[SPEAKER_07]: or you could support the game.

1407
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can do them.

1408
01:36:19,589 --> 01:36:21,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, all the dev tools are included with it, too.

1409
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means that came from the inside.

1410
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a development copy.

1411
01:36:26,611 --> 01:36:27,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, it came from the inside.

1412
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:31,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got to be frustrating, though, for the company as a whole.

1413
01:36:32,312 --> 01:36:34,132
[SPEAKER_04]: What a way to screw over your coworkers.

1414
01:36:34,152 --> 01:36:35,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, a month before it comes out.

1415
01:36:35,673 --> 01:36:36,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1416
01:36:37,593 --> 01:36:37,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes.

1417
01:36:38,473 --> 01:36:40,534
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to be doing some damage control on that.

1418
01:36:41,451 --> 01:37:08,400
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah um it that I think the the same thing happened with the last crisis game as well that it leaked out before it came out I remember I remember that it did and I just didn't care though because that was a time when I actually was building computer for crisis um and so I actually got crisis with my graphics card that came with my computer so it wasn't such a big deal for me but um

1419
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:10,397
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gotta suck.

1420
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would have sucked even more if it was on consoles.

1421
01:37:16,985 --> 01:37:18,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would have been terrible.

1422
01:37:18,306 --> 01:37:19,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's see here.

1423
01:37:19,148 --> 01:37:20,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to read.

1424
01:37:20,069 --> 01:37:25,996
[SPEAKER_07]: They were talking about comments, though, of what's not exactly working in it and stuff.

1425
01:37:26,476 --> 01:37:28,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently...

1426
01:37:31,417 --> 01:37:32,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1427
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:34,579
[SPEAKER_07]: There's, yeah, assets missing.

1428
01:37:34,619 --> 01:37:41,363
[SPEAKER_07]: There's temporary sounds and stuff for certain things, and it's buggy, which is not surprising.

1429
01:37:46,726 --> 01:37:48,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

1430
01:37:48,627 --> 01:37:51,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You think this could be damaging for the entire series in the future?

1431
01:37:51,349 --> 01:37:53,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, could this jeopardize more than just Crysis 2?

1432
01:37:53,911 --> 01:37:53,991
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1433
01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:04,709
[SPEAKER_07]: well no but I think that they definitely need to make sure that they what they should have done

1434
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,021
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1435
01:38:29,719 --> 01:38:31,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we know who the goat killed.

1436
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:32,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with this.

1437
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,681
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a development copy.

1438
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:36,922
[SPEAKER_07]: It got leaked from the inside, so you gotta find out who leaked it.

1439
01:38:39,884 --> 01:38:42,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just imagining what the temporary sounds are like.

1440
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:47,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you shoot someone and he goes, I don't think it's anything like that.

1441
01:38:47,487 --> 01:38:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if it's anything, it's probably stuff from the original Crisis game.

1442
01:38:52,190 --> 01:38:52,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that.

1443
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:57,292
[SPEAKER_11]: If I was a developer, I'd put in funny sounds as my placeholders.

1444
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:03,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to check out the game though, honestly, because I liked the first one.

1445
01:39:03,362 --> 01:39:05,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I just couldn't finish it because it was so goddamn buggy.

1446
01:39:05,967 --> 01:39:09,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm picking up the next one on console though.

1447
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:11,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360 all the way.

1448
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:13,287
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1449
01:39:13,327 --> 01:39:23,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one more story for you guys before we get into some of the other segments here about the... This is kind of along the same lines because this could be an effect we might see in the future for this whole piracy.

1450
01:39:23,617 --> 01:39:24,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1451
01:39:24,157 --> 01:39:24,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

1452
01:39:25,218 --> 01:39:27,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Companies are doing what they want to do.

1453
01:39:28,721 --> 01:39:34,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is about PlayStation 3 games possibly getting serial numbers.

1454
01:39:34,947 --> 01:39:39,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is some sources that were speaking with the site PS3 Sense, which is Dutch.

1455
01:39:40,469 --> 01:39:46,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony is going to implement a serial code security system for future PS3 game releases.

1456
01:39:46,631 --> 01:39:48,991
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be very similar to what you already know on PC titles.

1457
01:39:49,011 --> 01:39:50,812
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a long code that comes in the box.

1458
01:39:51,252 --> 01:39:54,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to enter that in in order to play the game or install the game.

1459
01:39:54,814 --> 01:39:57,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And that code can be used on up to five consoles.

1460
01:39:59,177 --> 01:40:03,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, folks are saying, well, you're just basically slowing down the inevitable.

1461
01:40:03,139 --> 01:40:06,181
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to find ways to hack around those serial number requirements anyway.

1462
01:40:06,641 --> 01:40:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just piss off those folks that buy this stuff legitimately.

1463
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've just killed the used market as well.

1464
01:40:11,944 --> 01:40:12,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So, awesome.

1465
01:40:14,286 --> 01:40:16,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they don't do that because it's just dumb.

1466
01:40:17,402 --> 01:40:26,478
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting is that Kotaku actually called Sony on this for comments, and Sony told him, we are looking at a few options, not ready to confirm our next steps yet.

1467
01:40:26,498 --> 01:40:27,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, they are looking at that.

1468
01:40:27,459 --> 01:40:28,461
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't flat out deny it.

1469
01:40:29,642 --> 01:40:30,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1470
01:40:53,774 --> 01:40:56,236
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know what the problem with that is?

1471
01:40:56,656 --> 01:40:58,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even going to necessarily stop piracy.

1472
01:40:58,518 --> 01:41:01,199
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to stop people buying your console is what it's going to do.

1473
01:41:01,239 --> 01:41:06,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to stop people, especially people like the hardcore gamers out there that have multiple consoles.

1474
01:41:06,903 --> 01:41:07,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1475
01:41:07,724 --> 01:41:08,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck it.

1476
01:41:08,204 --> 01:41:10,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just not going to buy this game on the PS3.

1477
01:41:10,285 --> 01:41:13,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I will buy it on the Xbox 360 or whatever other consoles are out there.

1478
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:15,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1479
01:41:15,028 --> 01:41:20,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what's going to happen because I think Sony would be surprised how fast word is going to travel like that and if

1480
01:41:20,592 --> 01:41:22,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And Piracy on their games is not a huge... I mean, let's put it this way.

1481
01:41:22,893 --> 01:41:24,754
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360 has had Piracy on it for a very long time.

1482
01:41:24,994 --> 01:41:27,595
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see them going to very drastic measures like this.

1483
01:41:44,362 --> 01:41:48,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas PS3 piracy is just kind of getting around.

1484
01:41:48,765 --> 01:41:53,507
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of cumbersome because Blu-ray rips aren't exactly the smallest things to download.

1485
01:41:54,007 --> 01:41:58,210
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking some games being 20 to 50 gigs in size.

1486
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:02,992
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not convenient for a lot of people to just download and pirate.

1487
01:42:03,412 --> 01:42:10,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Granted, people could do it, and there are people out there that will do it, but it's a lot of...

1488
01:42:11,747 --> 01:42:13,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Hoops that jump through, basically.

1489
01:42:13,569 --> 01:42:19,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And to go this route and kind of punish everybody that owns a PS3, it's a really dumb idea.

1490
01:42:20,154 --> 01:42:22,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they think it's necessary, then great.

1491
01:42:22,775 --> 01:42:23,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Go that route.

1492
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't be surprised if there's a huge backlash over it.

1493
01:42:27,762 --> 01:42:32,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orangeloundtrader.com to try and see some of the comments here.

1494
01:42:32,723 --> 01:42:34,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer Girl in our chatroom says, dude, that doesn't surprise me.

1495
01:42:34,923 --> 01:42:37,324
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to put serial numbers on humans now, too.

1496
01:42:37,524 --> 01:42:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So that might be a little bit too sci-fi for me.

1497
01:42:40,485 --> 01:42:40,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1498
01:42:41,525 --> 01:42:41,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1499
01:42:42,085 --> 01:42:45,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee says, more of a reason for me not to buy a PlayStation 3 and its products.

1500
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Dartetsuya says, why is it the Earth's measures only seem to harm the legit users?

1501
01:42:52,527 --> 01:42:56,651
[SPEAKER_04]: and RedTheHaze says, rumors from no-name site, something plausible from a no-name site.

1502
01:42:57,612 --> 01:42:58,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you never know.

1503
01:42:58,612 --> 01:43:05,218
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's been things we've reported on in the past that, you know, they call us a no-name site, so, you know, whatever.

1504
01:43:05,558 --> 01:43:08,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know we're not on the A list of internet gaming websites.

1505
01:43:08,521 --> 01:43:10,443
[SPEAKER_04]: We're more like on the F list, which is fine.

1506
01:43:10,723 --> 01:43:14,066
[SPEAKER_07]: If their console gets completely hacked open anyways...

1507
01:43:14,864 --> 01:43:18,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Jailbreaking a console is okay Jailbreaking a console is okay

1508
01:43:24,105 --> 01:43:30,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, let's just say that they do implement some sort of serial code or whatever that can be tracked.

1509
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:38,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, right now people have found ways to get past even the firmware checks because the newest firmware that's out there obviously breaks all the hacks that are out there.

1510
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:43,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people have found ways around that even, and they're still able to connect to the PlayStation Network.

1511
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:47,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they can find a way around that, they can probably find a way around the authentication thing.

1512
01:43:48,689 --> 01:44:05,389
[SPEAKER_07]: and then it doesn't even matter and on top of all that how the hell are you going to work that authentication thing in to people that don't have access to online if your console is not connected to the internet then you can't play your damn game that you bought so how's that going to work

1513
01:44:07,155 --> 01:44:32,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I can say this for a business looking into something is not the same thing as implementing it and I think that they're smart to look at their options but if they do implement it then that's when it gets stupid they do kind of owe it to these third parties that you know some of them having a lot of problems you know we just reported on that crisis story or whatever they do kind of owe it to them to keep their system safe so I don't know

1514
01:44:33,533 --> 01:44:34,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well let's get to the mailbag.

1515
01:44:35,377 --> 01:44:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura likes to dive into the email bag and read some of her favorite emails.

1516
01:44:41,348 --> 01:44:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura, why don't you get to it?

1517
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:50,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, today's emails... Oh, we actually just got one more while I decided to check, so I'm going to read it to you.

1518
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:52,832
[SPEAKER_11]: God, we got a lot of emails today, Rob.

1519
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:56,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I guess is good in contrast to how it's been before.

1520
01:44:57,333 --> 01:45:00,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, OLR, this is Red the Haze, long-time listener since 2007.

1521
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:10,157
[SPEAKER_11]: If this email makes you in time for your February 13th show, as to I'm typing this last minute...

1522
01:45:10,957 --> 01:45:18,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I called for the first time last week on your 400th show to congratulate you and I spoke about the Super Bowl and I would like to apologize to you guys about that.

1523
01:45:18,365 --> 01:45:25,813
[SPEAKER_11]: OLR is one of my favorite podcasts and I felt bad in talking about something not game related or even food related so I came up with a last minute gaming question.

1524
01:45:26,574 --> 01:45:27,635
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is this.

1525
01:45:27,715 --> 01:45:31,098
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm about to join the Air Force soon when I finish basic training and go to tech school.

1526
01:45:31,478 --> 01:45:35,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be able to game on the consoles for a while and only be allowed to have a laptop or PC.

1527
01:45:36,162 --> 01:45:40,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you guys recommend a gaming laptop, a pre-built PC, and some PC gaming controllers?

1528
01:45:41,286 --> 01:45:51,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Since the Wired360 controller's D-pad is crap for some emulator action, I would say right away that probably the best gaming-specific laptops out there are the Alienwares.

1529
01:45:51,815 --> 01:45:52,876
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gonna pay some money for them.

1530
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:15,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And seriously, I have an Asus Republic of Gamers laptop or whatever.

1531
01:46:16,075 --> 01:46:17,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It works great for games.

1532
01:46:17,236 --> 01:46:25,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the one I bought is pretty low-end, but I can run Grand Theft Auto in it, which is a very, I guess...

1533
01:46:28,326 --> 01:46:49,703
[SPEAKER_07]: it could use some work as far as enhancing the game spec wise it can run Crysis fine chugs on Grand Theft Auto but you know you can just don't spend a lot of money because those aces not the aces but the Alienware ones can be like over a thousand dollars my PC is this what do I have again

1534
01:46:50,023 --> 01:46:57,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I have an HP Quad Core that I picked up a couple years ago for $800 with a monitor and all.

1535
01:46:57,705 --> 01:47:01,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And all I had to do was put in a new graphics card and power supply.

1536
01:47:02,846 --> 01:47:08,448
[SPEAKER_11]: And I play everything I want to play and I do all my graphics work and it's just fine.

1537
01:47:09,128 --> 01:47:09,248
[SPEAKER_11]: I've

1538
01:47:10,649 --> 01:47:13,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, you guys have seen what games look like on my computer.

1539
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:14,531
[SPEAKER_11]: They run really well.

1540
01:47:14,691 --> 01:47:18,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, he was saying he's playing on running emulators, right?

1541
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:18,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1542
01:47:19,153 --> 01:47:20,274
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need anything super high-end.

1543
01:47:20,294 --> 01:47:29,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're running emulators, remember that, especially when it comes down to maim and stuff, the main things you're going to want to focus on are the speed of your CPU and...

1544
01:47:30,839 --> 01:47:32,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, most emulators will run on a freaking netbook.

1545
01:47:33,001 --> 01:47:34,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's true.

1546
01:47:34,842 --> 01:47:35,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm talking about MAME here.

1547
01:47:36,103 --> 01:47:38,744
[SPEAKER_07]: MAME, you're going to really need to focus on one thing.

1548
01:47:38,785 --> 01:47:44,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if it's dual core, quad core, because most of the MAME builds don't support the multi-threading and stuff like that.

1549
01:47:44,568 --> 01:47:49,672
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're really going to have to focus on the actual core speed of it.

1550
01:47:49,752 --> 01:47:54,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want something that's high twos to threes.

1551
01:47:54,896 --> 01:47:56,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they have fours out there, but...

1552
01:47:57,037 --> 01:47:59,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan's had MAME running just fine on his quad core.

1553
01:47:59,379 --> 01:48:00,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know, I want to jump in here.

1554
01:48:00,379 --> 01:48:12,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, but I'm saying, you know, a lot of stuff that's fine, but like if you're trying to run really high-end MAME stuff like, you know, Gauntlet Legends or something like that, I mean, that's going to require a 4 gigahertz processor.

1555
01:48:12,748 --> 01:48:17,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me jump in here because RedTheHaze is actually in chat right now in our chat room and says, Money isn't a problem.

1556
01:48:17,153 --> 01:48:18,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm willing to spend 1K+.

1557
01:48:18,554 --> 01:48:19,475
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1558
01:48:19,515 --> 01:48:20,196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably your answer.

1559
01:48:20,757 --> 01:48:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I would say kind of two things here.

1560
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:29,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Toshiba that I bought on sale for like $400 during a 4th of July sale at Fry's like two years ago.

1561
01:48:29,446 --> 01:48:31,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And it runs wow, cataclysm.

1562
01:48:31,588 --> 01:48:33,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't play max graphics settings, but...

1563
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:36,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get away with playing a few PC games.

1564
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:38,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play StarCraft 2 on it on low settings too.

1565
01:48:38,692 --> 01:48:40,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can kind of get away with some of the newer stuff.

1566
01:48:40,873 --> 01:48:43,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just I won't get that pristine gaming experience.

1567
01:48:43,995 --> 01:48:44,815
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was only $400.

1568
01:48:44,995 --> 01:48:50,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind with my lower end, it was under spec for Star Trek Online, but I played Star Trek Online just fine.

1569
01:48:51,098 --> 01:48:52,378
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked shitty, but it played.

1570
01:48:52,899 --> 01:48:53,739
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all I cared about.

1571
01:48:54,902 --> 01:48:56,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this comment from Salacious Pop in our chatroom.

1572
01:48:56,964 --> 01:49:00,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the best feedback is actually going to come from our chatroom on this because I haven't bought a laptop in a while.

1573
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:03,169
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is pretty much how I did it when I bought it.

1574
01:49:03,309 --> 01:49:05,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what Salacious Pop says in our chatroom.

1575
01:49:05,371 --> 01:49:12,438
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, just look at what's on clearance at Best Buy that has a name brand ATI or Radeon card and then Google benchmarks.

1576
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:18,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's the smart thing to do is don't go in there and impulse buy something or don't buy something just because it's on sale.

1577
01:49:19,204 --> 01:49:27,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Google the things, get reviews on them, see what they're capable of, and try to make the best informed decision you can.

1578
01:49:27,590 --> 01:49:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want me to recommend you something right off the cusp, oh my gosh, technology changes so fast, it's really hard for me to say something.

1579
01:49:33,814 --> 01:49:36,215
[SPEAKER_04]: The Toshiba I bought two years ago, they probably don't even make anymore.

1580
01:49:36,235 --> 01:49:38,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably an even better one that's 400 bucks now.

1581
01:49:39,998 --> 01:49:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that laptop Loki has.

1582
01:49:42,119 --> 01:49:43,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty nice, the Asus.

1583
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,781
[SPEAKER_11]: My little dinky netbook.

1584
01:49:45,301 --> 01:49:46,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I run SNES ROMs on it all the time.

1585
01:49:47,903 --> 01:49:48,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And I run them in Linux.

1586
01:49:50,006 --> 01:49:53,011
[SPEAKER_11]: So, of course, it's running more efficiently than it would have been in Windows.

1587
01:49:54,173 --> 01:49:58,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I'm not going to be able to name that definitive laptop for you, but I think you've got tons of options.

1588
01:49:58,401 --> 01:50:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Just do your best to make an informed decision when you go shopping.

1589
01:50:00,464 --> 01:50:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't impulse buy.

1590
01:50:01,586 --> 01:50:02,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not impulse buy.

1591
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:05,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for all your hard work and passion for gaming.

1592
01:50:06,112 --> 01:50:07,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish you all the best.

1593
01:50:07,533 --> 01:50:07,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1594
01:50:07,873 --> 01:50:08,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you guys.

1595
01:50:08,813 --> 01:50:09,314
[SPEAKER_11]: All hearts.

1596
01:50:10,354 --> 01:50:10,715
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1597
01:50:10,815 --> 01:50:21,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Forgive any grammatical mistakes as to I've been up for the last 20 hours finishing up a special Valentine's video for my GF and forgot that you guys are on right now as I'm typing this letter.

1598
01:50:21,141 --> 01:50:22,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Much love, RedTheHaze.

1599
01:50:22,202 --> 01:50:27,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Or hey, if you want to spend a lot of money on a computer or something, do your own case mod.

1600
01:50:27,385 --> 01:50:28,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Just build a fucking...

1601
01:50:29,086 --> 01:50:57,435
[SPEAKER_07]: you know regular computer inside of like a you know a nice you know durable like suitcase type thing you can totally have a cut out Air Force logo and show your you know a really nice case mod for see that's the thing high end laptops are so fucking expensive and if you're like you know they're saying like there's some there $3,000 for $3,000 you can build a nice PC and a nice monitor if you spend just a little bit of time you know putting together even a very crude you know case mod for it

1602
01:50:57,975 --> 01:50:58,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

1603
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:13,141
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from RubbaBuh.

1604
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:35,741
[SPEAKER_11]: When you were doing the listless, I'm thinking horror genre games.

1605
01:51:36,201 --> 01:51:37,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Lonsdart Deathmatch.

1606
01:51:37,362 --> 01:51:39,622
[SPEAKER_11]: The graphics would look like those airplane safety cards.

1607
01:51:40,803 --> 01:51:41,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Davros Speak and Spell.

1608
01:51:41,963 --> 01:51:43,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Spell Exterminate.

1609
01:51:44,424 --> 01:51:45,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Teddy Ruxpin Soul Stealer.

1610
01:51:45,904 --> 01:51:48,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin and you have to sleep sometime.

1611
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:50,465
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty funny.

1612
01:51:52,025 --> 01:51:52,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1613
01:51:53,806 --> 01:51:56,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Those Teddy Ruxpin dolls were pretty scary back in the day, just so you know.

1614
01:51:56,887 --> 01:51:57,807
[SPEAKER_04]: They were freaky.

1615
01:51:57,998 --> 01:51:58,098
[SPEAKER_11]: TDU 2

1616
01:52:15,919 --> 01:52:17,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Do cops know how to drive off-road this time?

1617
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was hilarious in the last one.

1618
01:52:20,142 --> 01:52:21,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's cops chasing after me.

1619
01:52:21,483 --> 01:52:22,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to drive off-road.

1620
01:52:22,724 --> 01:52:23,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, you can't get me.

1621
01:52:24,605 --> 01:52:30,509
[SPEAKER_11]: The other news is that GameStop is giving out codes for TDU2 Casino to the first purchasers of the game.

1622
01:52:30,709 --> 01:52:35,092
[SPEAKER_11]: The only problem is the day it was released, none of the casino codes worked.

1623
01:52:35,652 --> 01:52:48,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I discovered that the codes weren't activated until February 9th at the earliest it was really great being able to find that on the Atari support forums but they never put it in on the news feeds on their site or in the in-game news feed

1624
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's poopy.

1625
01:52:54,341 --> 01:52:58,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, email from CMD, whoever.

1626
01:52:58,923 --> 01:53:03,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, a couple of days ago my mother purchased on pre-order for me the Nintendo 3DS.

1627
01:53:04,225 --> 01:53:12,049
[SPEAKER_11]: It is selling for $350 Australian, I guess that's AUD Australian, which includes the 3DS, one game, and an accessories pack.

1628
01:53:12,069 --> 01:53:14,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So March 31st I am going to be super happy.

1629
01:53:14,270 --> 01:53:15,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work.

1630
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:18,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for you, send us one.

1631
01:53:19,112 --> 01:53:19,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie wants one.

1632
01:53:20,868 --> 01:53:22,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey guys, Molten Brown here.

1633
01:53:22,168 --> 01:53:24,509
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm writing to congratulate you on your 400th episode.

1634
01:53:24,889 --> 01:53:25,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the awesome work.

1635
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:27,670
[SPEAKER_11]: My weekends are never the same without you.

1636
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:32,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really writing in with game-related questions or news, but just some comments.

1637
01:53:32,892 --> 01:53:38,534
[SPEAKER_11]: One, to Loki, over a comment you said a couple of episodes ago about a court's decision to allow the suit against J-Hat.

1638
01:53:39,074 --> 01:53:45,879
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea that a court has jurisdiction against a person whose online activities has a presence in their state is not a new or random thing.

1639
01:53:46,319 --> 01:54:03,531
[SPEAKER_11]: If I remember civil procedure correctly, depending on what the website is doing, directly advertising and soliciting customers, I think it's a message board site where the owners and other parties can communicate with each other or being a neutral site that just allows users to look up information will influence whether the court feels they have jurisdiction over a party.

1640
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:17,678
[SPEAKER_11]: The more the site seems to directly advertise and solicit customers, the more likely it is that the court will find they do have jurisdiction over the party who owns slash uses the website because the party has purposefully availed themselves to the privilege of doing business in the particular state.

1641
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:23,401
[SPEAKER_11]: This means that the party voluntarily subjected themselves to the jurisdictions of courts in that state.

1642
01:54:23,702 --> 01:54:29,905
[SPEAKER_11]: A court can see J-Hat's website as soliciting customers because it was advertising a service, the ability to jailbreak your PS3.

1643
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:35,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't say it's a service because all he was doing is sharing information.

1644
01:54:35,796 --> 01:54:39,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not really, you know, hey, I'll jailbreak your PS3 for you.

1645
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a matter of perception, but it does have a point.

1646
01:54:44,343 --> 01:54:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: It's however the court decides to see it.

1647
01:54:46,405 --> 01:54:52,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can understand if they were bringing him to California because his website's hosted in California, but that's not the case.

1648
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:57,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all because he communicated on Twitter, which pretty much everybody on the planet does nowadays.

1649
01:54:58,514 --> 01:55:04,798
[SPEAKER_07]: and he had a PayPal account, which he had a donation thing on his webpage.

1650
01:55:05,318 --> 01:55:06,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That was their criteria for it.

1651
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it was because, hey, guess what?

1652
01:55:09,281 --> 01:55:13,083
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a lot of lawyers on retainer in California, so that...

1653
01:55:15,184 --> 01:55:34,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever, it's still going through and I remember there's some extra stuff going on with the case right now where now he's surrendered his hard drive and stuff to the courts for Sony to go through as well as with his lawyer present of course.

1654
01:55:35,260 --> 01:55:36,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the translation is, ha ha!

1655
01:56:00,743 --> 01:56:01,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter anyways.

1656
01:56:02,105 --> 01:56:06,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's like, oh no, I hope he deleted his hard drive stuff and I hope all this stuff.

1657
01:56:06,809 --> 01:56:11,574
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't think he did anything wrong and he's out to prove that and so he has nothing to hide.

1658
01:56:14,187 --> 01:56:19,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Number two, at Rob, your fake fight with Ranma during 400th episode made me think of this song.

1659
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:20,271
[SPEAKER_11]: YouTube link here.

1660
01:56:20,672 --> 01:56:22,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Listening to the first few seconds will explain why.

1661
01:56:22,773 --> 01:56:24,394
[SPEAKER_11]: The video isn't that impressive, but it's awesome.

1662
01:56:24,434 --> 01:56:25,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like that bitch.

1663
01:56:26,256 --> 01:56:27,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see her.

1664
01:56:28,217 --> 01:56:29,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like that bitch.

1665
01:56:30,038 --> 01:56:30,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see her.

1666
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch.

1667
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:32,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch.

1668
01:56:33,021 --> 01:56:34,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's pretty much me and Ranma.

1669
01:56:34,642 --> 01:56:35,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1670
01:56:35,562 --> 01:56:36,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1671
01:56:36,543 --> 01:56:37,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

1672
01:56:37,484 --> 01:56:37,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch.

1673
01:56:38,445 --> 01:56:38,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch.

1674
01:56:39,405 --> 01:56:39,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1675
01:56:40,086 --> 01:56:40,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1676
01:56:40,946 --> 01:56:42,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone can say the word bitch over and over.

1677
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:42,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

1678
01:56:43,992 --> 01:56:44,793
[SPEAKER_11]: 3.

1679
01:56:44,152 --> 01:56:44,793
[SPEAKER_11]: On my nickname.

1680
01:56:44,853 --> 01:56:48,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Since Rob makes fun of my nickname from time to time, I felt I had to explain it.

1681
01:56:49,077 --> 01:57:00,627
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was trying to figure out a nickname for America's Army, I created Molten Brown in homage to my eyes, which kind of look mahogany on the edges, the closest color I could think of, but as you get closer to the people, the color lightens up significantly.

1682
01:57:01,067 --> 01:57:01,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I always thought...

1683
01:57:02,308 --> 01:57:09,970
[SPEAKER_11]: My eyes had a molten feel to them like there was a flame behind my eyes that caused the color to lighten.

1684
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:16,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, when I'm angry or happy, my eye color seems to lighten up as if the fire is being turned up a notch because of how I am feeling.

1685
01:57:16,552 --> 01:57:18,452
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thought Molten Brown made sense as a nickname.

1686
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:19,433
[SPEAKER_11]: That's poetic.

1687
01:57:19,453 --> 01:57:21,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's all from me.

1688
01:57:21,053 --> 01:57:24,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, don't I feel like crap for going straight to the poop reference.

1689
01:57:26,234 --> 01:57:26,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Pun intended.

1690
01:57:27,255 --> 01:57:27,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1691
01:57:27,915 --> 01:57:28,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice story.

1692
01:57:29,255 --> 01:57:31,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I feel like Molten Brown myself.

1693
01:57:32,757 --> 01:57:34,279
[SPEAKER_11]: This message is brought to you by snow.

1694
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:38,524
[SPEAKER_11]: The only substance I can think of that's beautiful but consistently makes me want to punch someone in the face.

1695
01:57:40,227 --> 01:57:41,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to sum it up.

1696
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:47,151
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is from Catastrophic Moggy.

1697
01:57:47,931 --> 01:57:48,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, OLR.

1698
01:57:49,272 --> 01:57:58,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure this week you'll all be abuzz about the news of the deaths of Guitar Hero and DJ Hero, so I thought I'd pass on a bit of news that's got me excited.

1699
01:57:58,694 --> 01:58:02,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I was more than a bit miffed when I heard that the 3DS was region locked.

1700
01:58:02,935 --> 01:58:07,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I often import DS games because they are cheaper and usually release long before they are in Europe.

1701
01:58:07,756 --> 01:58:10,337
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, if they remember to release them here at all.

1702
01:58:10,977 --> 01:58:14,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it might sound silly, but I also prefer the cases that are used in the US.

1703
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:17,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Much better than the ugly, bulky, semi-clear cases we get here.

1704
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:23,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually like the European cases, honestly, but I see your point.

1705
01:58:24,663 --> 01:58:29,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, what I am getting at is that I was seriously thinking about whether I'll bother getting a 3DS.

1706
01:58:29,985 --> 01:58:33,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I only got a 360 a couple months ago and still have tons of games I want to try.

1707
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:37,568
[SPEAKER_11]: But I read that Cave Story is being released on it.

1708
01:58:37,988 --> 01:58:39,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that threw a spanner in the works.

1709
01:58:40,649 --> 01:58:43,211
[SPEAKER_11]: and the concept art looks really impressive.

1710
01:58:44,272 --> 01:58:46,094
[SPEAKER_11]: See you guys around Catastrophic Magi.

1711
01:58:46,154 --> 01:58:47,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to look at this now.

1712
01:58:49,016 --> 01:58:50,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see what the art looks like.

1713
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:53,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1714
01:58:55,602 --> 01:58:56,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, pretty.

1715
01:58:58,625 --> 01:58:59,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Jamie wants this.

1716
01:59:01,507 --> 01:59:03,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to link it in the chat room because it's pretty.

1717
01:59:05,871 --> 01:59:06,592
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really pretty.

1718
01:59:09,593 --> 01:59:12,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried Cave Story but I thought it was kind of meh.

1719
01:59:12,438 --> 01:59:13,520
[SPEAKER_11]: But dude, this is pretty.

1720
01:59:14,742 --> 01:59:15,945
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go, everyone.

1721
01:59:16,045 --> 01:59:16,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Take a look in there.

1722
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:37,697
[SPEAKER_11]: and now for our next email and by the way, thank you CatastrophicMuggy for sharing that link it's pretty anyway, next email up hey OLR, seeing as the mailbag has been somewhat skimpy on average for a while now I thought that I'd send an email this week covering a few topics

1723
01:59:38,217 --> 01:59:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, there is a free video available on PSN, iTunes, and the Xbox Live Zoom Marketplace which is the pilot of Mr. Sunshine.

1724
01:59:45,342 --> 01:59:50,044
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy to find on PSN and iTunes but it takes a little hunting to find it via Xbox Live Zoom.

1725
01:59:51,806 --> 01:59:52,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me.

1726
01:59:53,129 --> 01:59:59,031
[SPEAKER_11]: On a semi-related note, I found out a cool little deal that I'm sure that DarkSakura would make use of since she's a Marvel fan.

1727
01:59:59,191 --> 01:59:59,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1728
02:00:00,172 --> 02:00:06,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Assuming that there's Target stores out west and sales are nationwide, not just reasonable, they have Planet Hulk on Blu-ray for dirt cheap.

1729
02:00:07,294 --> 02:00:11,856
[SPEAKER_11]: At least at my favorite Target, the shelf tag listed as $10 however it rang up as $7.50.

1730
02:00:12,757 --> 02:00:15,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Movies, especially Blu-rays, don't get much cheaper than that new or used.

1731
02:00:15,918 --> 02:00:20,159
[SPEAKER_11]: After seeing it, I was awestruck over how gorgeous the animation was and how good the voice acting was.

1732
02:00:20,339 --> 02:00:21,380
[SPEAKER_11]: All in all, it's a good buy.

1733
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:27,361
[SPEAKER_11]: As a side note, if you were able to do so, try picking up the animated Dante's Inferno movie released in tandem with the game.

1734
02:00:27,961 --> 02:00:29,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It was equally as good as Planet Hulk.

1735
02:00:29,582 --> 02:00:35,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if you're a fan of certain voice actors, I should mention that both Mark Hamill and Steve Blum had roles in Dante's Inferno.

1736
02:00:35,743 --> 02:00:42,445
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I would be interested in seeing Dante's Inferno, but I am not a Hulk fan at all because Marvel has just gone overboard with Hulk.

1737
02:00:42,925 --> 02:00:46,649
[SPEAKER_11]: and every single freaking issue that Hulk should have nothing to do with.

1738
02:00:46,969 --> 02:00:48,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Hulk was in Spider-Girl.

1739
02:00:48,591 --> 02:00:50,433
[SPEAKER_11]: What do Hulk and Spider-Girl have in common?

1740
02:00:50,914 --> 02:00:53,316
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not an argument for this podcast.

1741
02:00:53,436 --> 02:00:55,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably no Hulk for me.

1742
02:00:55,398 --> 02:00:58,181
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did like the Ultimate Avengers ones.

1743
02:00:58,201 --> 02:00:58,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are cool.

1744
02:01:00,231 --> 02:01:06,758
[SPEAKER_11]: As for the last topic, I assume that you have already covered the story about Activision giving Guitar Hero the axe as well as shredding Tony Hawk.

1745
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:08,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Puns fully intended.

1746
02:01:08,760 --> 02:01:10,122
[SPEAKER_11]: In my honest opinion, it's about time.

1747
02:01:10,202 --> 02:01:15,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision really ran these two franchises into the ground and frankly they haven't learned that quality is greater than quantity.

1748
02:01:15,988 --> 02:01:25,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Where they went wrong with Guitar Hero, at least, is the fact that they inundated the market with poorly supported via download content titles every year like clockwork.

1749
02:01:26,256 --> 02:01:34,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, if they had followed EA's slash Harmonix lead and used the Rock Band business model, they would have fared better and the bottom wouldn't have fallen out of the music game market.

1750
02:01:34,562 --> 02:01:40,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet that within two to three years' time, the Call of Duty series will likely suffer the same fate.

1751
02:01:41,027 --> 02:01:43,429
[SPEAKER_11]: It isn't too far of a stretch to predict that happening.

1752
02:01:43,769 --> 02:01:45,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for taking the time to read this email.

1753
02:01:45,610 --> 02:01:47,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Errors and all, it's appreciated.

1754
02:01:47,792 --> 02:01:48,152
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1755
02:01:48,372 --> 02:01:57,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I haven't fully put it together in time for this week's show, hopefully by next week if possible, I'd like to initiate a little contest open to USPS3 owners.

1756
02:01:57,858 --> 02:02:02,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry everyone else, you wouldn't be able to make use of the prize even if you won due to how PSN is set up.

1757
02:02:03,062 --> 02:02:08,506
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be one winner who will get some videos from the USPSN video store.

1758
02:02:08,546 --> 02:02:10,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who has a PS3 and is in the US may enter.

1759
02:02:10,987 --> 02:02:12,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need to come up with a wordy trivia question.

1760
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:14,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

1761
02:02:16,171 --> 02:02:16,651
[SPEAKER_11]: That's shiny.

1762
02:02:17,612 --> 02:02:18,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And last one.

1763
02:02:18,813 --> 02:02:19,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy 401.

1764
02:02:20,394 --> 02:02:22,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it wrong that I play Angry Birds on the toilet at work?

1765
02:02:23,136 --> 02:02:23,877
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Mike.

1766
02:02:24,618 --> 02:02:25,738
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's you and everyone else.

1767
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:29,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

1768
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:29,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1769
02:02:30,602 --> 02:02:31,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for the emails.

1770
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:39,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails to have them read next week here on Z Program.

1771
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:42,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe I'll still have my, you know, disease voice.

1772
02:02:43,583 --> 02:02:43,943
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1773
02:02:44,504 --> 02:02:49,325
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a few more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the Skype line.

1774
02:02:50,185 --> 02:02:53,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but before we get to those, we have to get into the FUs of the week.

1775
02:02:54,387 --> 02:02:57,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the part of the show where we get angsty, as we've done for the last 400 weeks.

1776
02:03:16,652 --> 02:03:33,484
[SPEAKER_11]: My F you goes towards people not understanding the difference between making a comment about an article and then spamming your Facebook with a bajillion comments arguing a political point that you really don't care to discuss.

1777
02:03:34,805 --> 02:03:37,126
[SPEAKER_11]: So, forget it.

1778
02:03:38,187 --> 02:03:40,749
[SPEAKER_11]: If it happens again, I'm going to do what I did this time and delete it.

1779
02:03:42,450 --> 02:03:43,451
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the form of me.

1780
02:03:44,266 --> 02:03:45,266
[SPEAKER_11]: My wall, me.

1781
02:03:45,326 --> 02:03:46,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Your wall, you.

1782
02:03:48,127 --> 02:03:49,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Respect my authority.

1783
02:03:49,467 --> 02:03:50,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook is serious business.

1784
02:03:51,128 --> 02:03:52,328
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I'm back on LiveJournal.

1785
02:03:54,469 --> 02:03:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I never left LiveJournal.

1786
02:03:55,829 --> 02:04:00,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why people are... I didn't leave LiveJournal, but I ignored it for a little bit.

1787
02:04:00,991 --> 02:04:02,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize there's a lot of creepy shit on LiveJournal.

1788
02:04:02,951 --> 02:04:03,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.

1789
02:04:03,631 --> 02:04:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the LOL, the Harry Potter stuff, but that's not what everybody's into.

1790
02:04:08,273 --> 02:04:08,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1791
02:04:10,293 --> 02:04:11,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, Loki.

1792
02:04:13,474 --> 02:04:13,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1793
02:04:15,509 --> 02:04:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I was mad at something earlier this week.

1794
02:04:17,251 --> 02:04:18,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember what it was.

1795
02:04:18,892 --> 02:04:21,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um... I don't know.

1796
02:04:22,515 --> 02:04:23,777
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Drama, I suppose.

1797
02:04:24,978 --> 02:04:27,600
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good fallback option, I guess.

1798
02:04:31,243 --> 02:04:32,925
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to Dance360 for breaking.

1799
02:04:35,267 --> 02:04:37,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... Dance in the back going, yeah!

1800
02:04:39,113 --> 02:04:41,939
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to that little audio boo-boo I just had there going on there.

1801
02:04:42,139 --> 02:04:43,161
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to not being perfect.

1802
02:04:43,622 --> 02:04:46,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact I don't have tacos right now because tacos suck.

1803
02:04:46,687 --> 02:04:48,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, can I add one little tiny one?

1804
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:48,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1805
02:04:48,751 --> 02:04:49,552
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're going to help me.

1806
02:04:50,114 --> 02:04:50,274
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1807
02:04:50,314 --> 02:04:51,115
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to my Ventrilo.

1808
02:04:53,075 --> 02:04:55,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I can help fix that for you though.

1809
02:04:56,956 --> 02:04:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, actually, I don't have a lot to be mad about.

1810
02:04:59,257 --> 02:05:00,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are fine right now.

1811
02:05:01,677 --> 02:05:01,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1812
02:05:02,478 --> 02:05:05,478
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the fact that I'm separated on Valentine's Day.

1813
02:05:05,939 --> 02:05:08,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like separated in that context, maybe separated by distance.

1814
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just a day.

1815
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, the meaning's still there.

1816
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:12,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh come on, Rob.

1817
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody got decapitated, so you're okay.

1818
02:05:15,001 --> 02:05:16,661
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's fine.

1819
02:05:17,622 --> 02:05:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1820
02:05:19,202 --> 02:05:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, let's get back into a couple more gaming news stories and then we're going to get to your calls.

1821
02:05:25,124 --> 02:05:25,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Should be fun tonight.

1822
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:49,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they're doing something very similar to the Contra thing where they have a project that's a collaboration between a bunch of different members.

1823
02:05:49,858 --> 02:05:53,822
[SPEAKER_07]: They have one that's actually being done between 12 of the community members.

1824
02:05:53,882 --> 02:05:56,825
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Hansel and Gretel Bot.

1825
02:05:57,365 --> 02:06:02,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a seven-level LittleBigPlanet 2 adventure that has cutscenes and everything.

1826
02:06:02,669 --> 02:06:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say that the level design is on par with the single-player campaign that's with LittleBigPlanet 2.

1827
02:06:12,956 --> 02:06:17,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely worth checking out, and it will be out hopefully soon.

1828
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:21,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty sweet.

1829
02:06:21,201 --> 02:06:23,463
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually covered it on the PlayStation blog as well.

1830
02:06:25,126 --> 02:06:25,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1831
02:06:43,933 --> 02:06:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to really be picky choosy on what video games I buy.

1832
02:06:47,834 --> 02:06:49,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll rent it or something.

1833
02:06:50,255 --> 02:06:50,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1834
02:06:51,615 --> 02:06:52,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

1835
02:06:52,996 --> 02:06:55,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to get to the Skype line.

1836
02:06:55,296 --> 02:06:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1837
02:06:59,037 --> 02:07:03,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Do make sure if you're going to give us a call on Skype, you do call Echo 123 first to test your setup.

1838
02:07:03,658 --> 02:07:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember the other rule of radio.

1839
02:07:05,899 --> 02:07:09,220
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to call a radio show, mute your radio once you get through.

1840
02:07:09,537 --> 02:07:12,419
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, one more story for you guys, though, and it has to do with dogs and kitties.

1841
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:19,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendogs plus cats is one of the launch titles for the 3DS, and the breeds have been revealed.

1842
02:07:19,885 --> 02:07:25,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, there are going to be several different versions of the game, duh.

1843
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:38,636
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them is Toy Poodle and Friends, which comes with a Toy Poodle, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Mini Schnauzer, Boxer, Bull Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Shih Tzu, Jack Russell, and Pomeranian.

1844
02:07:39,176 --> 02:07:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1845
02:07:40,576 --> 02:07:41,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a dog person.

1846
02:07:41,477 --> 02:07:41,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1847
02:07:42,455 --> 02:07:52,539
[SPEAKER_04]: French Bulldog and Friends comes with French Bulldog, Shetland Sheepdog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Chihuahua, Dalmatian, Yorkshire Terrier, German Shepherd, Husky, and Basset Hound.

1848
02:07:53,259 --> 02:07:58,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And Shiba Inu and Friends, which will be Golden Retriever and Friends for those of us here in the U.S.

1849
02:07:58,161 --> 02:07:58,461
[SPEAKER_04]: and Europe.

1850
02:07:59,101 --> 02:08:06,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Shiba Inu, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Mini Pinscher, Dachshund, Maltese, Great Dane, Pugs, and Cocker Spaniels.

1851
02:08:06,644 --> 02:08:08,205
[SPEAKER_11]: And your Great Dane will die in two years.

1852
02:08:09,285 --> 02:08:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1853
02:08:10,286 --> 02:08:12,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't really see what the cats are yet.

1854
02:08:12,748 --> 02:08:15,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the cats are the same in every game or what the deal is.

1855
02:08:16,512 --> 02:08:18,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd get which everyone has a Mal in it.

1856
02:08:19,555 --> 02:08:20,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they were worshipped.

1857
02:08:20,996 --> 02:08:23,638
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd want a Fat Shermie too.

1858
02:08:23,938 --> 02:08:27,622
[SPEAKER_04]: More information is available on the Japanese site, Nintendo.co.jp.

1859
02:08:28,002 --> 02:08:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: More information is available there.

1860
02:08:30,204 --> 02:08:32,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I will probably get the one with the Welsh Corgi in it.

1861
02:08:32,827 --> 02:08:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's a freaking poodle.

1862
02:08:35,289 --> 02:08:35,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

1863
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:38,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I want one with a big, big fat shirmy in it.

1864
02:08:38,532 --> 02:08:42,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want this game, but I feel compelled to buy this game.

1865
02:08:43,156 --> 02:08:44,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't want this game.

1866
02:08:45,538 --> 02:08:47,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either, and I feel compelled to buy it.

1867
02:08:47,139 --> 02:08:49,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

1868
02:08:49,381 --> 02:08:54,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be one of those games that I play for like a day, and then I get so sick of it.

1869
02:08:55,146 --> 02:08:55,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, me too.

1870
02:08:56,192 --> 02:08:57,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever, you know.

1871
02:09:26,983 --> 02:09:31,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want Fat Shermie the game.

1872
02:09:32,615 --> 02:09:35,061
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my new dream game, everybody, is Fat Shermie.

1873
02:09:35,381 --> 02:09:36,885
[SPEAKER_04]: What would happen in Fat Shermie the game?

1874
02:09:37,635 --> 02:09:42,101
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to poke her and have her make really weird faces at you and then you'd have to clean up her litter box.

1875
02:09:42,942 --> 02:09:45,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you'd also have to figure out ways to keep her from shitting on the kitchen floor.

1876
02:09:46,046 --> 02:09:47,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd be very careful not to talk about the tester.

1877
02:09:49,029 --> 02:09:50,872
[SPEAKER_11]: She's not in the room so we can talk about it all we want.

1878
02:09:51,693 --> 02:09:52,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones.

1879
02:09:53,054 --> 02:09:54,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Calls already coming in.

1880
02:09:54,516 --> 02:09:55,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1881
02:09:55,437 --> 02:09:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1882
02:09:56,394 --> 02:09:57,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is X-Link.

1883
02:09:57,195 --> 02:09:58,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, X-Link, how you doing, buddy?

1884
02:09:58,658 --> 02:09:59,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, doing good.

1885
02:09:59,419 --> 02:09:59,860
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, man?

1886
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:03,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be better if I know I wasn't getting gypped off or you don't know Jack for the PC.

1887
02:10:04,267 --> 02:10:07,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of funny because the creators are Pokemon and PC people, but that's alright.

1888
02:10:08,074 --> 02:10:08,455
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

1889
02:10:09,690 --> 02:10:29,297
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess apparently on one of the forums, one of the guys took a screenshot of the Twitter account for You Don't Know Jack, and one of the guys replied by, because they were asking if they were willing to pay more money, if they could get more than two players local, and he goes, are more PC players too fat to fit more than two at a keyboard?

1890
02:10:31,914 --> 02:10:32,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow.

1891
02:10:32,734 --> 02:10:33,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, really?

1892
02:10:33,995 --> 02:10:34,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously?

1893
02:10:34,475 --> 02:10:35,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That is kind of funny.

1894
02:10:35,975 --> 02:10:36,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit funny.

1895
02:10:37,176 --> 02:10:38,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1896
02:10:38,616 --> 02:10:49,700
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they legitimately did it on purpose or they kind of did it as kind of like a test run to see how many people buy it and maybe put it down the road as possibly a DLC or a patch or something or what they're going to do.

1897
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:58,483
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope they really seriously do just one or two because it doesn't feel like the full experience without like four players that I'm used to playing beforehand.

1898
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:27,537
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know before speaking of beforehand though we didn't have back in the 90s all this Xbox Live stuff and all that fun stuff like if you didn't have other people to play with in the same room it just yeah but at the same time too though if I have four people here at the house and I want to play with four people like my next door neighbors for example then I can't do that I can only play with one person at a time like if I were to play somewhere else and it's not like me and my girlfriend versus my two neighbors instead it will be either me and my girlfriend my girlfriend versus one of my neighbors or

1899
02:11:28,266 --> 02:11:29,587
[SPEAKER_00]: or me versus my girl.

1900
02:11:29,647 --> 02:11:30,387
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying though?

1901
02:11:30,507 --> 02:11:32,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people will be left out.

1902
02:11:32,968 --> 02:11:34,629
[SPEAKER_04]: You are getting the shorter end of the stick.

1903
02:11:34,669 --> 02:11:36,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it is $10 cheaper for what it's worth.

1904
02:11:38,831 --> 02:11:42,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but still, I'd rather pay if it was the extra $10 for the two.

1905
02:11:42,613 --> 02:11:47,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, I would definitely pay that because it still feels a little left out.

1906
02:11:47,415 --> 02:11:52,818
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time too, I hope they do something about that because at the same time too, a lot of people are complaining about it.

1907
02:11:53,434 --> 02:12:02,980
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure a lot more people were too and if it was like one of people like me for example who bought on day one and didn't know this I might have been a little hesitant and be like well screw this I'll wait till Steam has on sale then buy it.

1908
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:10,784
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time too though it's a great game and definitely worth 20 bucks and it has Steam achievements for the PC and it's definitely worth to buy.

1909
02:12:11,824 --> 02:12:18,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Swords and Poker 1 and 2 are back on the iTunes store

1910
02:12:18,702 --> 02:12:31,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a shit ton of fun, I guess I could say personally, playing those two games.

1911
02:12:32,032 --> 02:12:34,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always bounce back and forth between the first and second one.

1912
02:12:34,874 --> 02:12:37,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of fun, so if you're into card games, definitely buy those.

1913
02:12:37,935 --> 02:12:39,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It is such an awesome game.

1914
02:12:39,036 --> 02:12:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, now that it's on the App Store, you need to buy it.

1915
02:12:41,059 --> 02:12:41,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like 99 cents.

1916
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:42,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they came back?

1917
02:12:42,861 --> 02:12:43,842
[SPEAKER_07]: They came back.

1918
02:12:44,203 --> 02:12:45,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Sword and Poker 2 and Sword and Poker 1.

1919
02:12:46,325 --> 02:12:47,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, go buy it on the App Store.

1920
02:12:48,428 --> 02:12:50,630
[SPEAKER_07]: It will take over your life.

1921
02:12:50,771 --> 02:12:51,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It will.

1922
02:12:51,692 --> 02:12:52,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

1923
02:12:52,292 --> 02:12:54,075
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty big endorsement.

1924
02:12:54,115 --> 02:12:54,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to look into that.

1925
02:12:55,356 --> 02:12:57,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are about $5-$6.

1926
02:12:58,358 --> 02:13:01,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the second one is like $3 and I think the first one is $2.

1927
02:13:02,901 --> 02:13:08,304
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you're looking at like $5-$6 worth of money.

1928
02:13:08,545 --> 02:13:13,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably like at least 50 hours into the second game already.

1929
02:13:13,908 --> 02:13:20,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm like a few hours into the second one but I'm still trying to finish up the first one and the first one is just as bad as the second.

1930
02:13:21,573 --> 02:13:23,134
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of fun though, it's very challenging.

1931
02:13:24,025 --> 02:13:25,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me take it back to You Don't Know Jack for a minute.

1932
02:13:25,806 --> 02:13:30,628
[SPEAKER_04]: As somebody who played it like a long time ago, these tech issues aside, were you really happy to see this come back?

1933
02:13:30,668 --> 02:13:31,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a worthy upgrade?

1934
02:13:32,189 --> 02:13:34,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and yes.

1935
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:41,073
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all the pretty much old features, like a few new things added as well, but anybody who's a trivia fan, definitely buy it.

1936
02:13:41,153 --> 02:13:43,974
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth the money, regardless of what system.

1937
02:13:44,214 --> 02:13:46,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it will be the first of several revival games?

1938
02:13:47,116 --> 02:13:47,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.

1939
02:13:47,877 --> 02:13:50,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope so in a good way, not in a bad way.

1940
02:13:50,338 --> 02:13:52,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they did a pretty decent job, like I said before.

1941
02:13:52,940 --> 02:13:58,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really wish that there were four players that could do something like that down the road or maybe add another one with it.

1942
02:13:58,484 --> 02:13:59,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, yes, that would be awesome.

1943
02:13:59,845 --> 02:14:03,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that it has DLC and stuff that's going to be attached to it would make it even worse.

1944
02:14:05,589 --> 02:14:10,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now instead of buying, like, you don't know Jack Sports, now it's like, oh, you can get the Sports DLC for it.

1945
02:14:12,034 --> 02:14:13,235
[SPEAKER_00]: So, definitely.

1946
02:14:13,275 --> 02:14:20,199
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I bought NBA Jam for the iTouch and iPad, and it's wonderful.

1947
02:14:20,559 --> 02:14:20,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

1948
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:22,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like it.

1949
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:25,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think on the iOS, though, those games would kind of blow.

1950
02:14:26,383 --> 02:14:30,445
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a little smaller, but for me, I like it.

1951
02:14:30,706 --> 02:14:35,569
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same way as NBA Jam, and it has a lot of unlockable stuff.

1952
02:14:35,989 --> 02:14:37,670
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing it for quite a while, so...

1953
02:14:38,379 --> 02:14:38,659
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1954
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:46,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, buddy, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but enjoy the You Don't Know Jack, even though you didn't get it on Xbox 360, so I can't play with you, but I guess life goes on.

1955
02:14:47,365 --> 02:14:48,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully make it one day PC.

1956
02:14:48,886 --> 02:14:50,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You always have WoW to play.

1957
02:14:50,848 --> 02:14:51,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.

1958
02:14:51,348 --> 02:14:53,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Although... How do you do in Civ V, by the way?

1959
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:56,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing it for a while, and then I went back to WoW.

1960
02:14:56,312 --> 02:14:57,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you interested in Rift at all?

1961
02:14:57,492 --> 02:14:58,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Any interest in Rift?

1962
02:14:58,793 --> 02:14:59,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.

1963
02:14:59,414 --> 02:14:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1964
02:14:59,814 --> 02:15:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1965
02:15:00,114 --> 02:15:00,334
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1966
02:15:00,655 --> 02:15:00,935
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1967
02:15:00,975 --> 02:15:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to let you go so we can get more calls.

1968
02:15:02,096 --> 02:15:02,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1969
02:15:02,956 --> 02:15:03,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1970
02:15:03,276 --> 02:15:03,456
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1971
02:15:03,517 --> 02:15:03,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1972
02:15:04,617 --> 02:15:09,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1973
02:15:09,721 --> 02:15:10,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go take another call.

1974
02:15:11,462 --> 02:15:12,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1975
02:15:12,302 --> 02:15:12,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1976
02:15:15,985 --> 02:15:16,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello?

1977
02:15:16,786 --> 02:15:17,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1978
02:15:17,626 --> 02:15:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1979
02:15:18,307 --> 02:15:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1980
02:15:20,468 --> 02:15:20,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

1981
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:22,409
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just calling in.

1982
02:15:23,690 --> 02:15:27,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring back all these memories of like old games I used to play, like

1983
02:15:28,035 --> 02:15:52,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Street Fighter, Metal Gear, Mortal Kombat, King of Fighters, Final Fantasy, Darkstalkers, Double Dragon, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Spyro,

1984
02:15:55,322 --> 02:15:57,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You should turn down your speakers, dude.

1985
02:15:57,223 --> 02:15:58,543
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I want to see how long you can keep going.

1986
02:15:58,603 --> 02:16:00,624
[SPEAKER_04]: What other old classic games?

1987
02:16:11,248 --> 02:16:12,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what's the point?

1988
02:16:12,268 --> 02:16:12,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1989
02:16:14,309 --> 02:16:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even understand.

1990
02:16:16,649 --> 02:16:22,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much to the caller from area code 612-670... Maybe I'll give the rest out later.

1991
02:16:22,932 --> 02:16:23,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's take some more calls.

1992
02:16:25,356 --> 02:16:26,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1993
02:16:26,716 --> 02:16:27,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1994
02:16:28,196 --> 02:16:29,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is D.R.

1995
02:16:29,097 --> 02:16:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Dollar Bill.

1996
02:16:29,857 --> 02:16:32,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's on your mind?

1997
02:16:33,017 --> 02:16:33,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

1998
02:16:33,757 --> 02:16:35,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, just quickly.

1999
02:16:35,358 --> 02:16:36,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think I'd get through this quick.

2000
02:16:38,018 --> 02:16:41,979
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, I was trying to remember if you didn't know Jack, the original PC version.

2001
02:16:42,639 --> 02:16:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there was four players even on the original version.

2002
02:16:45,899 --> 02:16:46,460
[SPEAKER_09]: There wasn't.

2003
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was three on the original version.

2004
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:49,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

2005
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:54,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so I couldn't say his thing about it should have been four players, but...

2006
02:16:55,310 --> 02:17:01,596
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was based on the same concept, I'm trying to picture four people holding the keyboard together.

2007
02:17:01,616 --> 02:17:03,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems kind of crowded, don't you think?

2008
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:09,002
[SPEAKER_09]: At one keyboard, yeah, that might be a little bit comfy.

2009
02:17:10,723 --> 02:17:13,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, the online multiplayer, I agree with.

2010
02:17:13,986 --> 02:17:14,927
[SPEAKER_09]: They should do that.

2011
02:17:15,047 --> 02:17:17,990
[SPEAKER_09]: But on a local machine, I don't know.

2012
02:17:18,010 --> 02:17:19,131
[SPEAKER_09]: It just didn't seem right.

2013
02:17:20,563 --> 02:17:40,869
[SPEAKER_04]: but you used to do three on one keyboard and I seem to remember the buzzer keys were like Q space bar and like right bracket or something they were kind of like spread out so you could sit kind of in an interesting arrangement and do it four might be getting a little comfy but you could like give a person the mouse and they could like click it I don't know ooh that would be a good one okay

2014
02:17:42,176 --> 02:17:58,887
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that one, and there was something else, and I... Oh, yeah, just really quick, because I heard at the beginning of the show, you guys were talking about DDR and Guitar Hero, how, like, they both seem to be following one point of the continuously kind of the same game, but very little evolution between the two.

2015
02:17:59,707 --> 02:18:10,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, DDR just slowly didn't really evolve much, just maybe some different step charts and maybe a couple different modes eventually, but it's still alive a lot longer than Guitar Hero.

2016
02:18:11,764 --> 02:18:13,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

2017
02:18:23,419 --> 02:18:26,201
[SPEAKER_04]: One theory that we had is that the games are simply lower budget.

2018
02:18:26,541 --> 02:18:30,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Because keep in mind, Konami, they do license songs now, but they don't license quite as many.

2019
02:18:30,764 --> 02:18:32,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 10 songs maybe in a game.

2020
02:18:32,785 --> 02:18:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And they use their in-house team for the rest of it.

2021
02:18:35,006 --> 02:18:37,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the expectations just aren't quite as high.

2022
02:18:37,508 --> 02:18:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think they still sell quite a few through the whole weight loss thing.

2023
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:49,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not Wii Fit, but certainly... I was even listening to a morning show here locally where somebody brought up, and they were saying it jokingly,

2024
02:18:50,036 --> 02:19:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some chick who got a Wii for Valentine's Day and she was saying to the host that she was going to play lots of Wii Fit and the host was going, you're not going to play any Wii Fit.

2025
02:19:00,345 --> 02:19:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to play it for three days and then you're going to be over it and then you'll say, oh, I'm going to play Dance Dance Revolution.

2026
02:19:06,329 --> 02:19:07,290
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll play that two times too.

2027
02:19:07,530 --> 02:19:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So the name is still out there is my point.

2028
02:19:11,193 --> 02:19:18,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still getting name checked in some places but I just think overall those games are lower budget and so they have lower expectations and I think that's why those games still go.

2029
02:19:18,980 --> 02:19:19,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately

2030
02:19:19,540 --> 02:19:20,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It shows.

2031
02:19:22,903 --> 02:19:25,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also still very Japan-centric.

2032
02:19:25,625 --> 02:19:28,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Konami closed their offices here in the U.S.

2033
02:19:29,067 --> 02:19:30,408
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have the one in L.A., I think.

2034
02:19:30,468 --> 02:19:31,189
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the one in L.A.

2035
02:19:31,289 --> 02:19:32,270
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't have the one in Hawaii.

2036
02:19:32,290 --> 02:19:34,111
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the one in North Bay.

2037
02:19:34,671 --> 02:19:36,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, I'm sorry, NorCal in the Bay.

2038
02:19:37,394 --> 02:19:38,314
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have those anymore.

2039
02:19:38,394 --> 02:19:40,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of that, I imagine, is coming out of Japan.

2040
02:19:40,976 --> 02:19:42,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And those games are probably still selling in Japan.

2041
02:19:42,898 --> 02:19:46,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas Guitar Hero, what, did they have one in Japan?

2042
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was it?

2043
02:19:48,235 --> 02:19:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it ever got released in Japan I didn't think it would Guitar Hero?

2044
02:19:53,700 --> 02:20:12,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was like one I think one of them did get a localized Japanese release but I don't think it was huge I could be wrong, don't quote me on that or call me an idiot if I'm wrong but I want to say one time I do remember reading about it Okay, that's cool Anything else on your mind, buddy?

2045
02:20:14,138 --> 02:20:15,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on your mind, buddy?

2046
02:20:16,608 --> 02:20:18,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that's alright, man.

2047
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:20,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't have much to say except, hi guys.

2048
02:20:20,912 --> 02:20:21,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up?

2049
02:20:21,972 --> 02:20:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well at least you aren't high as hell like the last caller.

2050
02:20:26,856 --> 02:20:27,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2051
02:20:28,137 --> 02:20:28,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2052
02:20:29,318 --> 02:20:29,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You too, bye guys.

2053
02:20:31,917 --> 02:20:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Last Minute Stories for our listeners tonight.

2054
02:20:50,594 --> 02:20:52,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to see here.

2055
02:20:53,056 --> 02:20:55,138
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking a little bit more about the Xperia Play.

2056
02:20:55,439 --> 02:21:00,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it's going to have battery life enough for five plus hours of gameplay, which is kind of cool.

2057
02:21:01,284 --> 02:21:10,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a 5.1 megapixel camera, 400 megabytes of onboard memory, as well as you can expand it via SD memory cards.

2058
02:21:11,516 --> 02:21:13,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to Orange Wright in our chat room.

2059
02:21:13,437 --> 02:21:15,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Very knowledgeable dude when it comes to the music games.

2060
02:21:15,738 --> 02:21:18,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 3 and Aerosmith were released in Japan.

2061
02:21:18,879 --> 02:21:20,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Same as the other releases, no localization.

2062
02:21:21,261 --> 02:21:22,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the clarification.

2063
02:21:23,341 --> 02:21:24,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take some more calls.

2064
02:21:25,478 --> 02:21:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2065
02:21:26,359 --> 02:21:26,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2066
02:21:27,319 --> 02:21:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2067
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:30,841
[SPEAKER_03]: And this time, Rob, I'm not going to attack you tonight.

2068
02:21:30,881 --> 02:21:31,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2069
02:21:31,342 --> 02:21:32,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

2070
02:21:32,502 --> 02:21:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

2071
02:21:33,403 --> 02:21:33,883
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2072
02:21:34,684 --> 02:21:35,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's up?

2073
02:21:36,145 --> 02:21:36,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much.

2074
02:21:37,466 --> 02:21:39,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some interesting topics I want to discuss.

2075
02:21:39,647 --> 02:21:41,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make them brief as possible.

2076
02:21:41,508 --> 02:21:41,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2077
02:21:41,808 --> 02:21:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, I would like to give my prediction for episode 500.

2078
02:21:48,072 --> 02:21:48,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2079
02:21:48,413 --> 02:21:48,873
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

2080
02:21:51,226 --> 02:21:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, you and Salacious Pop get married live on the air.

2081
02:21:57,770 --> 02:22:01,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that, but okay, sure.

2082
02:22:01,093 --> 02:22:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Predictions, predictions.

2083
02:22:03,494 --> 02:22:08,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And right after that we find out DarkSakura is pregnant and she gives birth live on the air.

2084
02:22:08,518 --> 02:22:09,318
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not happening.

2085
02:22:10,939 --> 02:22:15,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And after all is said and done, Loki is still oblivious to the entire world as he still plays Grand Theft Auto IV.

2086
02:22:17,803 --> 02:22:21,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in two years they're going to have Grand Theft Auto 5, so I mean, come on.

2087
02:22:22,366 --> 02:22:26,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to be playing Saints Row 3 later on this year, so I'm very excited about that.

2088
02:22:26,569 --> 02:22:28,230
[SPEAKER_07]: At least a quick break on Grand Theft Auto.

2089
02:22:28,270 --> 02:22:36,496
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, gotta be honest though, the Grand Theft Auto games we play are not quite the Grand Theft Auto games that other people play.

2090
02:22:37,196 --> 02:22:56,120
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a little different type of an animal that we're playing lots of high explosives and people flying through the air and and bus foo there is bus foo in this game it's it's a sight that behold seriously we'll be making new videos once it's all done too I can't wait to see those

2091
02:23:00,163 --> 02:23:02,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other lovely predictions?

2092
02:23:02,284 --> 02:23:03,084
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a ways to go.

2093
02:23:03,964 --> 02:23:10,106
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all for the predictions, but as I've been listening for the last couple of podcasts, I've been trying to catch up.

2094
02:23:10,986 --> 02:23:14,688
[SPEAKER_03]: My quick take on Sony's Neo Geo Pocket.

2095
02:23:18,009 --> 02:23:21,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it's going to be 3G and all this enabled.

2096
02:23:21,730 --> 02:23:22,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it now.

2097
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:26,111
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to market the portable console at about

2098
02:23:28,223 --> 02:23:41,393
[SPEAKER_03]: $400.

2099
02:23:29,164 --> 02:23:41,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're going to do, they're probably going to partnership with either AT&T or T-Mobile where you go in and you get the console for $99.99 with a two-year contract with it.

2100
02:23:44,976 --> 02:23:46,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, lock them in with a contract.

2101
02:23:46,878 --> 02:23:47,638
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it.

2102
02:23:47,658 --> 02:23:48,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they're trying to do with the phone.

2103
02:23:50,180 --> 02:23:52,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hey, it kind of worked for the taco.

2104
02:23:52,242 --> 02:23:53,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not for the NGP?

2105
02:23:55,239 --> 02:23:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2106
02:23:55,880 --> 02:24:09,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, if anyone is serious about gaming with 3G on the NGP or even anything like the iPod or iPad, whatever, don't fucking sign up for this shit.

2107
02:24:09,497 --> 02:24:10,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I mean...

2108
02:24:11,699 --> 02:24:14,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you just get the cheapest data plan possible.

2109
02:24:36,096 --> 02:24:44,718
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously though, if I want to game my laptop, and I got through a week of just using it for surfing the web, but I have MiFi.

2110
02:24:44,798 --> 02:24:51,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't use it anymore because it's $45 a month for just data, whereas I can just tether it to my phone and I get the same shit.

2111
02:24:51,699 --> 02:24:56,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, they don't want you to do that, and that's done through a hack, but hey, whatever.

2112
02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:00,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a relatively easy hack, so it can be done by pretty much anybody.

2113
02:25:01,981 --> 02:25:26,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know, my phone is the same way, I can do that with mine, but now that, you know, Version Mobile and everybody else, they're capping how much bandwidth you can spend when doing all of this, and guarantee, if everyone's gonna be on these 3G networks gaming, it'll be a funny thing that, as they're gaming, they hit their cap, and you see their network logo saying, sorry, you have used up all your bandwidth, push this button to add more time, or

2114
02:25:26,155 --> 02:25:37,081
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way you'll run through... Unless you're gaming 24-7 over 3G, and a lot of people have Wi-Fi in their houses, there is not going to be a time that you're into a cap problem.

2115
02:25:37,121 --> 02:25:38,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not fast enough.

2116
02:25:38,822 --> 02:25:39,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

2117
02:25:41,546 --> 02:25:42,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be rare to do that.

2118
02:25:42,687 --> 02:25:46,688
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they have those caps in place, because those people are using way more data.

2119
02:25:47,248 --> 02:26:03,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried streaming stuff on my phone, and it shows me the kind of data it's using, but unless you don't have Wi-Fi in your house, you're just on this 3G and that's it, then maybe it would take some really heavy use.

2120
02:26:03,293 --> 02:26:09,555
[SPEAKER_07]: But for most people where they're near Wi-Fi, like I have Wi-Fi at work, I have Wi-Fi at home, there's Wi-Fi here.

2121
02:26:10,055 --> 02:26:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just have, I can bounce on all those with my phone, with my iPod, and there's very rare times that are in between that I actually need to use the 3G for anything, or, you know, my cable goes out or something like that.

2122
02:26:23,703 --> 02:26:24,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

2123
02:26:24,263 --> 02:26:29,947
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very rare, so I don't think that's really going to be an issue, but, you know, who knows.

2124
02:26:31,047 --> 02:26:31,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

2125
02:26:33,075 --> 02:26:44,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well Ranma, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls Alright, cool, that's cool Alright, take care buddy You got it, bye Alright, we got more calls coming in Why not, let's get to it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2128
02:27:01,641 --> 02:27:04,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, playing video games sometimes helps, but I don't know.

2129
02:27:07,282 --> 02:27:08,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't know.

2130
02:27:09,663 --> 02:27:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what caused you to start smoking crack in the first place?

2131
02:27:14,423 --> 02:27:18,564
[SPEAKER_14]: It was probably the Nintendo coming out with Mario Sports Mix.

2132
02:27:20,044 --> 02:27:21,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's more of a recent thing.

2133
02:27:21,645 --> 02:27:23,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Sports Mix hasn't really come out yet.

2134
02:27:23,465 --> 02:27:25,466
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's been out for a week.

2135
02:27:25,926 --> 02:27:26,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one week.

2136
02:27:26,626 --> 02:27:27,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've been addicted to crack for a week.

2137
02:27:31,223 --> 02:27:31,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh Uh-huh

2138
02:27:54,388 --> 02:27:58,751
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, well, I mean, I'm just kind of curious why you and your buddies want to like troll this online radio show.

2139
02:27:58,791 --> 02:28:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, we don't think we're like all that or nothing.

2140
02:28:01,893 --> 02:28:03,034
[SPEAKER_04]: We do our show for free.

2141
02:28:03,074 --> 02:28:08,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of worked our asses off for the past nine years to provide the show for free to people on the internet.

2142
02:28:08,037 --> 02:28:10,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering what made it worthy of trolling.

2143
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:11,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, was it something we said?

2144
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys just like really fucking bored or what?

2145
02:28:14,522 --> 02:28:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a small penis is involved.

2146
02:28:16,123 --> 02:28:16,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

2147
02:28:16,423 --> 02:28:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's let the man have his say.

2148
02:28:18,004 --> 02:28:18,925
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to troll him back.

2149
02:28:19,285 --> 02:28:19,866
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

2150
02:28:20,726 --> 02:28:21,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Just be real with me, dude.

2151
02:28:23,754 --> 02:28:27,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, we're pretty big fans, actually.

2152
02:28:28,322 --> 02:28:30,506
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been looking at it a long time, and we just thought, you know...

2153
02:28:32,742 --> 02:28:33,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, okay.

2154
02:28:33,762 --> 02:28:42,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've been really big fans, so for that you want to call in and talk about your crack problem and spam our picture feed and spam the Twitter account and all that stuff?

2155
02:28:42,765 --> 02:28:47,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you show your appreciation for us working our ass off for free for so many years?

2156
02:28:47,546 --> 02:28:54,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if maybe I said something to make the interwebs angry, then cool, let us know.

2157
02:28:54,749 --> 02:29:01,051
[SPEAKER_04]: What did we say to bring the wrath of whatever 4chan-y site you guys are with?

2158
02:29:01,611 --> 02:29:02,371
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the deal?

02:29:09,101 --> 02:29:34,328
[SPEAKER_04]: well yeah just be real dude don't you don't have to like ask your friends for an answer or whatever like I applaud you for not hanging up the phone like a chicken shit when I called you out but like just be real with me what's up what is this all about are you don't you have something you want to promote or plug is there a website behind this whole thing

2160
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:41,164
[SPEAKER_14]: No, to be perfectly honest, this is boredom.

2161
02:29:41,585 --> 02:29:42,587
[SPEAKER_04]: This is boredom?

2162
02:29:43,308 --> 02:29:43,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude!

2163
02:29:43,669 --> 02:29:48,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, for the record, this is the only time we've actually done this.

2164
02:29:48,517 --> 02:29:48,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never...

2165
02:29:50,188 --> 02:29:50,728
[SPEAKER_14]: We love video games.

2166
02:29:50,748 --> 02:29:50,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on.

2167
02:30:12,505 --> 02:30:14,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you're bored, go play a game.

2168
02:30:15,386 --> 02:30:16,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I just, I don't know.

2169
02:30:16,866 --> 02:30:17,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it, dude.

2170
02:30:17,847 --> 02:30:19,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I just kind of feel like you're wasting your time.

2171
02:30:20,087 --> 02:30:20,527
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

2172
02:30:20,707 --> 02:30:22,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but, I mean.

2173
02:30:22,508 --> 02:30:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's life.

2174
02:30:23,708 --> 02:30:24,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay, that's cool.

2175
02:30:24,509 --> 02:30:25,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for the hits.

2176
02:30:25,449 --> 02:30:29,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it because, you know, E3 is all about who gets the most hits on their website right now.

2177
02:30:29,630 --> 02:30:30,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys have really helped with that tonight.

2178
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:32,451
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll help.

2179
02:30:32,531 --> 02:30:32,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

2180
02:30:34,212 --> 02:30:37,073
[SPEAKER_14]: But in all seriousness, dude, you guys really are cool.

2181
02:30:37,133 --> 02:30:38,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like what you guys are doing.

2182
02:30:39,314 --> 02:30:41,735
[SPEAKER_14]: We really do listen, and I'm being sincere about that.

2183
02:30:41,975 --> 02:30:43,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you have a funny way of showing it.

2184
02:30:43,635 --> 02:30:48,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm just saying, you got a funny way of showing it, pal, but I... You know what?

2185
02:30:49,097 --> 02:30:53,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it's the internet, and that's the type of stuff we subject ourselves to doing a public show, but I'm just saying...

2186
02:30:55,771 --> 02:30:57,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot worse in my lifetime.

2187
02:30:57,732 --> 02:30:58,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

2188
02:30:58,312 --> 02:31:04,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, growing up as a gay guy for as many years as I've done and so forth, I've been subjected to a lot worse in my lifetime.

2189
02:31:04,875 --> 02:31:08,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but... Anyhow, you have a lovely day.

2190
02:31:09,236 --> 02:31:09,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for trolling.

2191
02:31:09,916 --> 02:31:10,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, you too.

2192
02:31:10,917 --> 02:31:11,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

2193
02:31:12,778 --> 02:31:15,319
[SPEAKER_11]: At least he's not posting on the internet that I need to get back in the kitchen.

2194
02:31:18,140 --> 02:31:19,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Given that I'm not the one that cooks.

2195
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:21,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I still want to know, like...

2196
02:31:22,301 --> 02:31:22,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is it?

2197
02:31:23,102 --> 02:31:23,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, just tell me.

2198
02:31:23,863 --> 02:31:24,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Baba Booey?

2199
02:31:25,185 --> 02:31:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: You got his number.

2200
02:31:26,006 --> 02:31:26,767
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the deal?

2201
02:31:27,308 --> 02:31:28,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, but you know what?

2202
02:31:28,570 --> 02:31:30,692
[SPEAKER_11]: If I give it... I'm not saying give it out.

2203
02:31:30,713 --> 02:31:31,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying track it.

2204
02:31:32,815 --> 02:31:33,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's New York.

2205
02:31:33,877 --> 02:31:35,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... And it's one of those, like, I don't...

2206
02:31:36,974 --> 02:31:37,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know.

2207
02:31:38,736 --> 02:31:39,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it something?

2208
02:31:39,717 --> 02:31:41,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because you're a bitch, DarkSakura?

2209
02:31:41,819 --> 02:31:42,380
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a bitch?

2210
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So they got to troll the show because you're a bitch?

2211
02:31:44,582 --> 02:31:45,063
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2212
02:31:45,483 --> 02:31:45,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck them.

2213
02:31:47,445 --> 02:31:48,587
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I have to say.

2214
02:31:48,707 --> 02:31:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I can be as much of a bitch as I want.

2215
02:31:50,209 --> 02:31:50,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even care.

2216
02:31:50,969 --> 02:31:52,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's giving it more attention than it deserves.

2217
02:31:53,672 --> 02:31:55,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we get answers.

2218
02:31:56,235 --> 02:31:56,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

2219
02:31:57,563 --> 02:31:57,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2220
02:31:58,564 --> 02:32:00,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, who wants to follow that call?

2221
02:32:00,545 --> 02:32:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use me on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

2222
02:32:04,989 --> 02:32:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

2223
02:32:05,269 --> 02:32:08,152
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks in chat seems to enjoy that last call.

2224
02:32:08,172 --> 02:32:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2225
02:32:09,873 --> 02:32:10,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2226
02:32:14,289 --> 02:32:19,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, let's talk a little bit more about Activision and what they're focusing their efforts towards now.

2227
02:32:19,911 --> 02:32:25,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Since they're not doing the Guitar Hero franchise, they are continuing on with their toy licensing franchise.

2228
02:32:25,172 --> 02:32:27,173
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how they did the games with the Zuzu Pets and stuff.

2229
02:32:27,473 --> 02:32:28,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Now with Squinkies!

2230
02:32:28,833 --> 02:32:36,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Squinkies, based off of some sort of toy that's like those 25 cent machines where there's a little crappy toy that comes in the bubble.

2231
02:32:36,975 --> 02:32:38,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're making a game based off that.

2232
02:32:38,936 --> 02:32:42,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, they're making a game called Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, which has...

2233
02:32:44,258 --> 02:32:44,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the

2234
02:33:14,605 --> 02:33:15,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they did.

2235
02:33:15,966 --> 02:33:18,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, there's Activision pooping on your franchises.

2236
02:33:19,189 --> 02:33:20,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Putting out kids games.

2237
02:33:20,810 --> 02:33:23,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if it's highly marketable, then they're going to pimp it out.

2238
02:33:24,841 --> 02:33:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to some more calls.

2239
02:33:27,484 --> 02:33:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2240
02:33:28,404 --> 02:33:28,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2241
02:33:29,385 --> 02:33:30,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zaku.

2242
02:33:30,346 --> 02:33:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, my buddy.

2243
02:33:31,307 --> 02:33:32,128
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you tonight?

2244
02:33:32,788 --> 02:33:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, doing pretty good.

2245
02:33:33,989 --> 02:33:39,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to wait for the next day or so when I have to take the girl out for Valentine's Day.

2246
02:33:40,615 --> 02:33:45,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And just lamenting over the death of the inevitable guitar hero.

2247
02:33:45,380 --> 02:33:46,441
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of knew that was coming.

2248
02:33:48,956 --> 02:33:49,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sad?

2249
02:33:49,576 --> 02:33:54,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you one of those people that was on Twitter going, RIP Guitar Hero, pouring a 40 in your honor?

2250
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:55,941
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.

2251
02:33:56,702 --> 02:34:02,406
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, I knew this was going to happen ever since Guitar Hero 3 came out.

2252
02:34:03,127 --> 02:34:04,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, more like World Tour.

2253
02:34:05,168 --> 02:34:15,136
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they started to have the whole Me Too attitude of, let's just milk the proverbial golden cap dry until we can pummel harmonics, which...

2254
02:34:16,115 --> 02:34:17,236
[SPEAKER_01]: and Turn never worked out.

2255
02:34:17,736 --> 02:34:19,317
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is the thing with Activision.

2256
02:34:19,917 --> 02:34:25,121
[SPEAKER_01]: In a nutshell, they take good franchises and they just run them and just send them straight to hell.

2257
02:34:25,681 --> 02:34:27,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what they're going to do with Call of Duty.

2258
02:34:28,203 --> 02:34:34,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you have five Guitar Hero games out in a single year, that's almost like one per quarter.

2259
02:34:35,667 --> 02:34:40,691
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes to show that you just don't give a shit about the franchise.

2260
02:34:41,531 --> 02:34:51,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Konami, on the other hand, they at least make efforts to innovate and just please the hardcore fanbase while picking up the casuals along the way.

2261
02:34:51,976 --> 02:34:54,178
[SPEAKER_01]: At least they're having some sort of consistency.

2262
02:34:54,378 --> 02:35:05,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about now, but during their time with the whole DDR series, even with Bomani in general, they just kept it a little bit more consistent and not as bland.

2263
02:35:06,164 --> 02:35:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2264
02:35:07,099 --> 02:35:17,523
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's... The way I see it is that Harmonix now is tasked with just, like, trying not to, you know, make the same mistakes as Activision.

2265
02:35:17,603 --> 02:35:19,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're well aware of that.

2266
02:35:19,544 --> 02:35:22,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, they have to innovate.

2267
02:35:22,905 --> 02:35:27,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what made them survive that day.

2268
02:35:27,907 --> 02:35:31,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what will keep them going, you know, keep them going forward.

2269
02:35:35,117 --> 02:35:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is the reason why, I mean I know you, you have been calling into this show for years, which I totally appreciate, don't get me wrong, especially in light of the last couple calls we've had.

2270
02:35:45,569 --> 02:35:48,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You have called in about DDR and all this stuff.

2271
02:35:48,492 --> 02:35:56,321
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this whole, why does DDR seem to persevere when I'm not so sure DDR really innovates in the way that some other games do?

2272
02:35:56,881 --> 02:36:12,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you still add, you still have the, I guess the way I see it is that Konami still recognizes that the hardcore players are still the ones that are going to be picking up DDR a lot more than, let's say, the casuals, by a slight edge.

2273
02:36:13,332 --> 02:36:16,815
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to please, you know, they're trying to please both demographics.

2274
02:36:17,435 --> 02:36:22,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a multi-pronged approach to their series.

2275
02:36:22,919 --> 02:36:23,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2276
02:36:24,039 --> 02:36:27,822
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas Activision just treats it like shovelware.

2277
02:36:27,862 --> 02:36:34,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Just try to get all the licenses, not really innovate in terms of new gameplay features.

2278
02:36:35,008 --> 02:36:40,312
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard was the most appalling innovation that they had was just the ability to change the guitar skin.

2279
02:36:41,113 --> 02:36:50,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike, let's say, Harmonix, which actually allowed you, in the third installment, play with a lot more instruments, like a keyboard.

2280
02:36:51,638 --> 02:37:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ability to play them in pro mode, which says a lot about them, that they're really thinking long term with that whole franchise, whereas Activision just cares about how much money can we make with Guitar Hero in each quarter.

2281
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:11,601
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about the bottom line Bills, bills, bills

2282
02:37:33,038 --> 02:37:51,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Herald heralded that whole video game you know the whole genre into into near disaster or the video game crash I'm pretty sure you know I have a gut feeling that Activision will be the ones that's gonna herald everything to mediocrity like in two years I bet you in two years they're gonna have like a

2283
02:37:51,969 --> 02:37:52,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

2284
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:11,970
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2285
02:38:12,391 --> 02:38:14,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can go and wrap up the show.

2286
02:38:15,153 --> 02:38:18,395
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you, as always, for your insight, because I know you're passionate about the music games.

2287
02:38:18,756 --> 02:38:19,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate it.

2288
02:38:19,236 --> 02:38:19,496
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2289
02:38:19,857 --> 02:38:20,157
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2290
02:38:20,277 --> 02:38:20,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2291
02:38:21,278 --> 02:38:21,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

2292
02:38:21,958 --> 02:38:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2293
02:38:23,479 --> 02:38:23,760
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2294
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:25,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2295
02:38:25,681 --> 02:38:26,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't say it wasn't entertaining.

2296
02:38:27,202 --> 02:38:27,703
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2297
02:38:28,503 --> 02:38:31,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the last last minute stories from Loki.

2298
02:38:33,474 --> 02:38:35,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't think I have much left here.

2299
02:38:36,037 --> 02:38:38,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been a very exciting Newsweek, all things considered.

2300
02:38:38,519 --> 02:38:43,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside of the more and more and more stuff getting shut down over at Activision, there's not a lot else to it.

2301
02:38:44,124 --> 02:38:46,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I pretty much covered most of everything.

2302
02:38:49,389 --> 02:38:51,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's pretty much it, I think.

2303
02:38:52,231 --> 02:38:52,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty then.

2304
02:38:53,627 --> 02:38:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we get down to the end of the show tonight.

2305
02:39:00,388 --> 02:39:01,748
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

2306
02:39:02,028 --> 02:39:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your final thought?

2307
02:39:03,829 --> 02:39:07,969
[SPEAKER_11]: You know that face that's really scrunchy that people do for trolls on the internet?

2308
02:39:08,250 --> 02:39:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2309
02:39:08,910 --> 02:39:15,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I kept imagining that call, just that mouth moving back and forward while that guy was talking, and it made me giggle a little bit.

2310
02:39:15,611 --> 02:39:16,311
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty funny.

2311
02:39:16,711 --> 02:39:21,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually saw a really funny gif of that with the whole, you mad, you mad, you mad, like rotating around it, and it's just funny.

2312
02:39:22,092 --> 02:39:22,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

2313
02:39:23,226 --> 02:39:24,887
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet, it's fun to be a part of.

2314
02:39:25,007 --> 02:39:26,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, what's your final thought?

2315
02:39:26,348 --> 02:39:28,870
[SPEAKER_07]: People need to stop talking like they type on the internet.

2316
02:39:28,990 --> 02:39:31,972
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's... Lol, Loki!

2317
02:39:31,993 --> 02:39:33,914
[SPEAKER_07]: It's seriously the worst... IKR?

2318
02:39:34,715 --> 02:39:37,437
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the worst trend whatsoever.

2319
02:39:37,497 --> 02:39:43,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just... Remember how people used to get pissed off at other people with the Ebonics and shit like that?

2320
02:39:43,501 --> 02:39:44,842
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just getting worse.

2321
02:39:45,002 --> 02:39:45,162
[SPEAKER_04]: ZOMG!

2322
02:39:46,363 --> 02:39:49,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, yeah, we understand you mistyped on a keyboard.

2323
02:39:49,585 --> 02:39:50,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha, that's funny.

2324
02:39:51,286 --> 02:39:53,367
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to talk like that because you sound like an idiot.

2325
02:39:53,807 --> 02:39:54,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say one thing.

2326
02:39:54,728 --> 02:39:56,849
[SPEAKER_11]: We found OMG Yogurt and they were pretty good.

2327
02:39:58,469 --> 02:40:01,391
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with all these yogurt explosion chains recently?

2328
02:40:01,451 --> 02:40:01,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

2329
02:40:02,492 --> 02:40:04,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I hate Kotaku's new layout.

2330
02:40:04,573 --> 02:40:06,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I should say Gawker's new layout.

2331
02:40:06,554 --> 02:40:12,377
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, sometimes you don't need to improve something because it's fine the way it was.

2332
02:40:13,638 --> 02:40:14,699
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now go troll that.

2333
02:40:14,759 --> 02:40:16,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a reason to go troll.

2334
02:40:16,119 --> 02:40:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, trolling our website is like stalking Kathy Griffith or something like that.

2335
02:40:23,183 --> 02:40:25,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, seriously, who cares?

2336
02:40:25,724 --> 02:40:27,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no one cares.

2337
02:40:28,505 --> 02:40:33,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, we don't get a lot of page hits, so no one's really going to notice that you're trolling.

2338
02:40:34,928 --> 02:41:03,222
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever the more we talk about it the more they're going to be like we should do it again my final thought I want to do more traveling and I'm thinking a trip to Seattle would need to be in the near future possibly around Labor Day possibly you're telling me a different time because other traveling in March I'm thinking about a particular expo that goes on in Seattle every year anyhow we'll have to talk about that offline

2339
02:41:03,908 --> 02:41:05,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow, that's it.

2340
02:41:05,509 --> 02:41:07,950

02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:13,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously another crazy day here at the ranch, but you know, in all seriousness, you know what we ask?
