9457	12461	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
14084	15446	Tonight, February 20th, 2011.
16488	18731	Could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?
19072	21516	Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.
21836	24080	And is PC piracy really in decline?
31889	32149	Falafel
62984	64965	Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.
65105	66026	Falafels are delicious.
66126	68328	I'm going to go have another.
68428	73471	One of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that one of the races in it was like a Lollapalooza or something.
73831	77654	I just call them falafels because they're adorable and cute like falafels.
77674	79015	You know who really likes falafels?
79095	81917	Wait, yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight is speaking early.
81957	82737	Yes, Salacious Pop.
82917	86760	Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.
87720	89702	Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
91055	91315	Hi.
91515	92316	How are you doing, Loki?
92656	93356	I'm doing good.
94037	94377	All right.
94537	96458	Everything flaw-fulfilled in your world?
96518	96878	I don't know.
97019	98559	I don't know what to ask.
99640	100240	Sure.
100260	100981	Okay, there you go.
101261	102682	What was the dinner of choice tonight?
102722	103362	I'll ask this.
103482	104423	I was crapping McDonald's.
104463	109846	I wasn't really that hungry, but I knew if I didn't eat anything, I'd be hungry later, so I just had a quarter pounder.
109866	110687	There you go.
110987	116070	It wasn't very good, and the fries aren't very good, but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.
117691	142253	any McDonald's you go to so it was just I don't know Orange Lounge Foodio you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio but a lot of the times we also talk about food also joining us tonight as you already know is the one and only Salacious Pop here in studio I'm sorry for speaking out of turn please don't beat me you need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak hello what's up
143891	144672	How's your week going?
144992	145192	Good.
145472	145693	Yeah?
145933	146433	Yeah.
146613	147914	I have PETA, so it's a lot better now.
148415	152238	Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a 65-year-old man.
152558	153379	I can't move today.
153960	159504	We ran around doing a local version of The Amazing Race scavenger hunt.
159644	164288	It was just between about 15 or 16 friends, all within Sacramento downtown.
164929	169513	By the way, no charity, no organization, just because we can.
169873	170313	We're bored.
170453	173014	Yeah, when people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.
174234	177955	Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams.
178355	180455	Can't let them win over you.
180855	182616	So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.
182756	188757	There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.
189357	190997	Lots of running back and forth.
191077	199179	And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling and can't sit up without help.
199840	200923	It's like, I'm a gamer.
200983	202287	I don't do physical activity.
202387	204032	You know, this is too much.
204520	206161	That's what you get for not playing any more DDR.
206341	209764	But I have half a Vicodin, so I'm feeling a lot better after that.
210384	211885	Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain.
211925	212926	It just makes you not care.
213186	213806	Exactly.
213846	215087	That's exactly what it is.
215307	216368	I just don't care anymore.
217509	221011	But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.
221151	222192	We were on opposing teams.
222732	227475	I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was on a few times in the past.
227976	229337	I think she filled in for you one time.
229377	230517	Her and Irene were on a show.
230838	233219	But Victoria and I were a team, and we came in second.
233299	233619	Woo!
234700	235040	It was fun.
235380	240903	Yeah, and after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have the winner and the runner up.
240943	242283	We're not doing this shit anymore.
242443	243063	We're done.
243364	244624	The rest of you were too far behind.
245925	246265	The end.
246725	248606	But yeah, I had a good time.
248666	249386	And I will say this.
249506	251927	It was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.
252607	255048	So, you know, doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.
255408	259130	But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.
260051	269806	I don't know how many of y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or are even old enough to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now, and they're kind of fun, actually.
269846	271208	I want Amazing Race slot cars.
271749	272050	Okay.
273652	276114	I'm surprised that's a hobby more of us aren't into is slot car.
276134	278315	Because I always kind of walk by the stores and I go, ooh, that's cool.
278556	280037	I used to love those when I was a kid too.
280057	286261	The hobby store that, well, Dan's into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.
287082	290284	And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.
291244	294667	Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can run it on the slot sets.
296411	301052	Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?
301072	303733	I think I want to say there was at least a Micro Machines game.
303773	308595	You know the Typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's?
309355	311495	It has a pinball table in there.
311695	313816	They have a slot car thing in there.
314196	314376	Nice.
315197	316038	Going to our chat room.
316438	322583	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
322663	329388	Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.
329468	331770	We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.
331810	332290	We love Brad.
332871	333952	Rob isn't out of shape.
334432	335253	Round is a shape.
335893	336254	You know what?
336274	338475	Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment actually.
338495	339976	That was rather rude, don't you think?
340016	340397	No, I'm kidding.
341759	352299	and then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing SSJ100Matt says OLR House MD Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with it's not lupus it's a house joke, TV joke
354355	358438	Anyhow, also you can join us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
358458	361580	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
361780	365622	All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
365842	369645	We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you have been playing this week.
369725	371005	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
371126	371786	How was your gaming week?
372594	375896	I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3
401297	401897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
420766	425971	Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs. Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since.
427432	429514	With its freaky-ass control style.
430094	438542	And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man is totally janked in that game.
439443	440223	His moves are messed up.
440484	442325	You know, he's all messed up now.
442385	443706	It's all about Deadpool.
443746	446789	A movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.
446869	447189	What? !
448752	451513	Well, they killed Johnny Storm.
452013	452313	I know.
452433	453873	Who was the most interesting of all of them?
453913	457014	Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.
457954	458294	Not really.
459994	460294	All right.
460714	464195	Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?
464335	472417	Oh, I was going to say it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy III, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.
473377	480161	What's particularly interesting about that is that 1 and 2 on the iPhone were based off the PSP versions.
480601	482922	There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.
483283	486404	We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.
487325	490486	But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone.
490827	491867	So what is it going to be?
492448	493248	We don't know.
493468	497570	I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they did 1, 2, and 4.
497610	497710	So...
502230	502650	I don't know.
502830	504691	I think they're just going to go through and re-sprite them.
504891	513953	In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for just one color and might just pull whatever they were working on for that because they had it in the works.
514013	514893	It just never came out.
515534	517734	So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.
518134	521875	It would be interesting, though, if they do one for iPhone, why don't they just release it for PSP as well?
522456	525056	I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.
525156	526116	I think they're great.
527037	530078	Two is really simple to play because I have two on my iPhone.
530358	531438	I am so excited for four.
532456	539118	There's a part of me that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi, but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.
539638	545280	I hope they bring 4 and the After Years onto the iOS as well because I don't really play with PSP anymore.
545660	550261	I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.
551124	553405	Well, After Years did start as a mobile game.
553565	553725	Yeah.
554065	557465	But anyhow, let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom.
557485	558986	Because this is a complaint I hear a lot.
559286	560786	So I'm kind of curious what DarkSakura thinks about it.
560806	562306	Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.
562366	563247	I'm like, so not cool.
563567	566947	Well, outside of E3, but that was how long ago and it was early build of the game.
567408	571628	But AkumaJP in our chatroom says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.
571768	572829	Not really that fun.
573389	573669	Agree?
573709	574049	Disagree?
575191	578733	I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.
579773	584296	I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.
584336	584876	That's the thing.
585276	591519	It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter IV, same thing.
592260	601745	But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because you can just throw off your super with a push of a button.
603925	624453	when you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it then there's you can definitely I'm trying to see how to phrase this right because it's not like you know like in Tekken where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game if you've got skill with it then you can beat a masher I don't know if that makes sense so it can be fun
625427	636301	Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the, I don't know, for basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before to get like a six or seven hit.
636942	643910	But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have to practice and know how to do that stuff.
644491	645572	Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.
665532	666393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
683044	684025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
698702	723310	and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off because we could do all of those 44 hit combos and everything too but the the thing though is that with the early versus games versus the late versus game first that's a lot of versus the late versus games is that they the early ones still went on that Street Fighter you know the six button layout style whereas hi whereas we have um
725420	753575	a four button with a special so it's just kind of different sorry we're being interrupted with food requests that's why we're distracted so anyhow I wanted to ask to throw this out real quick though speaking of Killer Instinct I realize that everything's up in the air with Rare and they're not really with Nintendo anymore and things aren't like they used to be but like seriously seriously what's got to happen for there to be a Killer Instinct 3
754375	754896	I know.
755236	755917	How bad?
755997	757538	Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?
757638	758539	Me, me, me, me, me.
758619	759400	Okay, that's me and Jamie.
759420	759680	That's it.
760061	760541	All right.
760621	761002	Still.
761943	766687	I still wanted the public flogging of whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct Complete 64.
766887	768909	That piece of crap port.
769090	769190	Ugh.
769710	771011	Already upset thinking about it.
771071	773093	The SNES version was the best home port.
773354	773774	The end.
774415	774915	Or MAME.
774935	775656	Mm-hmm.
777067	779429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
794301	804566	is that he actually waited until the... Because the game would start with a random stage and he waited until Orchid Stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV file back in the day.
804826	805286	That's nice.
805567	806347	That was so sweet.
806507	811810	By the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her unrealistic boobies.
812050	813591	She was the first one I beat the game with in KI2.
813611	813731	Nice.
815717	816978	All right, let's move on.
817219	818400	Loki, how you doing?
818420	819101	How was your game of the week?
819261	819762	Oh, it was all right.
820142	821403	Didn't play a lot, though.
822965	827971	Just mainly sorting poker, too, and... Ah, I keep forgetting to get that game.
828451	829012	It's awesome.
829052	830674	You always tell me about it, and I always forget to get it.
830914	831255	I will.
831875	834358	And then just Grand Theft Auto, mainly, because...
836155	837796	I don't know, that's about it.
838236	843859	Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.
844419	848841	It's only like 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.
849361	853704	But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.
853784	854144	What's that?
854504	855204	Murder Boner.
856925	859406	So that's pretty sweet.
862768	863748	God, I love that kind of stuff.
863828	867769	I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.
868309	869649	It's Bayonetta with a dick.
870210	872470	It's Murder Boner is what it is.
872770	874390	Okay, Bayonetta with a Murder Boner.
874490	875191	All right, fair enough.
875911	876711	All right.
877451	880172	Salacious Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.
881772	883152	I actually played a few games this week.
883192	886573	Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually...
887253	889775	And I already reviewed the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself.
889815	898461	But I just want to emphasize, if you are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another.
898741	905906	Because I'll tell you, it was a little bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack where you can only access the first five in the beginning.
906286	908988	And then as you play, you unlock one more.
909048	911389	So it's like you only ever have five open at a time.
911809	916893	But what was frustrating about that is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house.
917153	917714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
942355	944857	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
958607	959448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
973604	973984	DarkSakura.com
990180	991242	Other games I played this week.
991362	1005300	I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the... It's Contra, but it's not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that... Like the same Contra music.
1005581	1006762	So it's Contra, people.
1007103	1007503	It's just Contra.
1008144	1023259	I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old school gamers wish they had so much more of on Xbox Live It really is just like a souped up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo game now with
1024380	1028603	3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.
1029144	1031125	It just uses, you know... 2.5D?
1031425	1037149	Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing where, you know, things are coming out of the background and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff.
1037169	1042072	But, like, if you like Contra, this is like an... You don't even have to think you're going to want this game.
1042212	1042733	Buy this game.
1043433	1045775	It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.
1046375	1048577	It's, you know, modernized a bit.
1048857	1051378	There's this full-on anime opening sequence.
1051438	1053520	It's like... It kind of just made me think of, like,
1054000	1055241	Yeah, fuck yeah.
1055301	1057162	Contra, fuck yeah.
1057402	1059083	Fire, burn.
1059323	1060144	Chicks with guns.
1060604	1061364	It was kind of awesome.
1061704	1062245	Cool.
1062765	1063585	It's definitely worth your time.
1063826	1067508	The only downside, no up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
1067548	1068028	It didn't work.
1068168	1069949	Unless I put it in the wrong place or something.
1070009	1071290	I wasn't able to get that code to work.
1071330	1071930	Try it backwards.
1072370	1072610	Maybe.
1072630	1074171	You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?
1074712	1075072	You die.
1075412	1076052	Yeah, I know.
1076092	1078314	One of the Gradius games did that too, I think.
1078374	1080495	If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.
1080695	1081575	Wasn't it Gradius 4?
1081735	1081976	Yeah.
1083036	1089579	on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used L-R-L-R, then you would get all the power-ups instead of left, right, left, right.
1089959	1091799	And I think Gradius V only let you do it three times.
1095041	1100302	Also, I played an indie game on the Marketplace called Try Not to Fart.
1101423	1103824	And that's the set of... Jamie looks disgusted.
1104484	1105404	No, I'm not disgusted.
1105464	1106365	It's just like a, what?
1107365	1109146	It actually cracked me up.
1109186	1109906	It's really funny.
1110046	1114147	It's just basically like you actually try to hold down buttons.
1114187	1117328	Buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have to press that right button.
1117909	1119989	And then when it flashes, you let go.
1120349	1123471	And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels.
1123731	1130053	But then as you move on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y. So it's like Twister.
1130293	1131553	Yeah, it's like Twister.
1132013	1133274	And then if you screw up, you fart.
1133314	1133714	Yeah.
1134094	1135935	So, do you come here often?
1154372	1156575	Oh, well, I didn't... You know, they're having this conversation.
1156915	1161882	And then, like, if you accidentally fart, it'll go... And it's like... It's just like, Ew, that's disgusting.
1162302	1166187	It's just... Like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way.
1166828	1168610	But... I like how your shoes are tied.
1168670	1168851	Like...
1170032	1171253	Don't spend money on it.
1172093	1183958	No, I shouldn't say that because this is an indie development place, but I just, you know, I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.
1184158	1187180	The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe.
1187760	1189381	Yes, I remember that.
1189401	1190142	I do remember that.
1190342	1190742	That was funny.
1190902	1191283	Alright.
1217940	1218460	Thank you.
1218941	1220741	SalaciousPop brought me food for that.
1220781	1221982	He rocks.
1224142	1232725	Before I turn it over to SalaciousPop for his gaming week, let me talk real quickly about... I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because there was an NDA and everything, but it's an open beta.
1232826	1235086	Everybody's playing it if they're interested in it.
1235166	1235627	It's Rift.
1236187	1237327	I played for a little bit this week.
1238147	1239408	I grinded the character up to level 8.
1241189	1242189	How do I explain Rift?
1242649	1251391	It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways to the point where I didn't know what button did what and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?
1251531	1255353	Oh, well in WoW I hit N and sure enough I hit N and it brought up my talent tree.
1255853	1259634	So it's kind of funny that I kind of like knew the buttons from just having played WoW so much.
1261795	1270501	But obviously Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's be honest, Rift in its advertising campaign is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something like that.
1270581	1272222	This isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.
1272323	1273343	You're not in Azeroth.
1273423	1274064	Yeah, something like that.
1274084	1275025	Like, not in Kansas.
1275325	1275845	Exactly.
1277326	1280809	So I played the game to like level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know.
1281029	1284832	And, I don't know, I gotta be honest, I wasn't really feeling it.
1285372	1285973	Like, the game...
1287042	1288143	Thank you for watching!
1306788	1329563	I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels I'm not going to try and review the game I played it, I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels Everybody's telling me you have to really invest time into it But let's be real, the game also kind of has to do something to make me want to get that far Wasn't that everybody's biggest bitch about Final Fantasy XIII?
1329944	1331525	It doesn't get good until you're like 15 hours in
1332762	1334203	That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.
1335223	1336644	Yeah, true.
1336704	1344728	Some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and redid all the starting areas to make them a little more interesting.
1345328	1346949	So, you know, Rift, it's a new game.
1347529	1348750	They'll iron out some of the kinks.
1348850	1349650	It'll be interesting.
1351171	1352731	I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.
1353132	1356233	I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the V-Retail one or not.
1356793	1360095	I'm not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but whatever.
1360816	1362920	Did you have something you wanted to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?
1363021	1363522	How does it look?
1363562	1364023	Is it pretty?
1365165	1365405	Yeah.
1365586	1366127	Pretty pretty?
1366227	1366788	It's pretty.
1366928	1367349	I don't know.
1367409	1368371	There's something about...
1369668	1371529	Something about the way the characters look.
1371589	1376811	I kind of like the cartoony look of WoW that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic.
1376871	1378792	It does have more intense character customization.
1379132	1380432	I spent a lot more time doing that.
1380492	1381313	So that was kind of cool.
1381773	1383313	But I don't know.
1383673	1387375	I thought the scenery looked really nice.
1387455	1389216	I really like the environments.
1389676	1392437	I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects.
1392517	1393597	All that's really beautiful.
1394237	1398039	But I wasn't really into the way the characters looked or the monsters.
1398539	1399840	But, you know, I don't know.
1400940	1401821	That's really an opinion.
1402281	1403261	So, there you go.
1403782	1405242	So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week.
1407163	1407743	We'll move on.
1408184	1411385	I already mentioned the Twitter and the Facebook and all that as far as housekeeping goes.
1411425	1412866	I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.
1413386	1416548	So, let's get into some actual... Falafels.
1416968	1417648	Falafels.
1417848	1419409	And then game... Oh, yes, Salacious Pop.
1419589	1420129	My Gaming Week.
1420149	1420489	Oh, I'm sorry.
1420770	1422130	Well, that's what happens when you leave the room.
1422450	1423831	Salacious Pop, how was your Gaming Week?
1425601	1427983	I left the room because I was sent to bring him food.
1428003	1429165	I know.
1429525	1430606	You were gone for like an hour.
1430767	1431628	That's right.
1432589	1435452	Well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp.
1435472	1438335	That's more appropriate for your other podcast.
1438896	1444623	The Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.
1445303	1449345	Then some You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.
1451846	1457589	I played about an hour's worth of the great Gatsby tribute, NES RomHack.
1458390	1458870	Amazing.
1458970	1459290	Love it.
1459650	1461171	That was a book that we had to cover.
1461191	1463833	I think it was junior or senior year in high school.
1464893	1467795	Tell me about how this works as an NES game.
1467975	1468475	I don't get it.
1468675	1476639	In level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend who is sort of the person that he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.
1477420	1486084	You show up at Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage.
1486124	1487065	It's basically a platformer.
1487145	1489766	You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at him.
1492816	1494898	And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.
1496119	1496720	So I played that.
1497000	1498841	I hated that book, just so you know.
1498962	1505067	Well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have to read in high school, really depends on the teacher.
1506328	1506949	I'll give you that.
1507089	1509151	But I never liked being forced to read books.
1509571	1511953	And there were some truly terrible books I had to read in high school.
1511993	1513395	We had to read a separate piece.
1513555	1514876	Oh my god, I hate that book so much.
1514916	1516357	And The Crucible, Arthur Miller.
1516377	1517698	I think I read a separate piece.
1518139	1519240	What's a separate piece about?
1519660	1520061	DarkSakura.com
1544798	1546959	The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.
1547119	1548840	But I loved Catcher in the Rye.
1548860	1553063	I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.
1554744	1558927	So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky.
1559927	1561948	Did you talk about the Holden the Fart game?
1562369	1562829	Yes, I did.
1562889	1563749	Okay, I missed that.
1566232	1573434	So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each number of the question.
1574354	1579916	The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh, number five, girl, you rock my world, girl, cracks me up.
1580296	1582396	I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.
1583257	1584157	So you have to play that game.
1584897	1588598	Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.
1589958	1591079	Yeah, but that's all.
1592799	1595160	What other classic books should they turn into an 8-bit game?
1598496	1599156	Watership Down.
1600297	1600657	Oh, yeah.
1601197	1601777	That'd be a good one.
1602478	1605399	How about Brave New World?
1606739	1607840	How about Atlas Shrugged?
1607860	1610041	And then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.
1611301	1611962	What's the book?
1612382	1617004	James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages and it's a classic.
1619004	1621045	I'm liking on the name of the book.
1621886	1622926	Maybe somebody in chat will know it.
1622946	1625167	Well, we've already had The Inferno.
1626992	1627753	Oh yeah, that's true.
1628935	1631037	By the way, DarkToagak in our chatroom, I love this comment.
1631518	1635343	LMAO, we're reading that in English right now and the teacher brought that game up.
1637325	1639548	I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.
1639568	1639989	So you know what?
1640069	1644374	If I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to get people interested.
1644694	1645776	Like I think, I don't know.
1646627	1651551	I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.
1652151	1653813	Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.
1654673	1659277	It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in New York.
1660438	1663220	I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.
1663701	1664341	I don't like her.
1665202	1665462	Anyway.
1666263	1666823	Video games!
1666863	1667324	Video games!
1667364	1667964	Wow, wow, wow.
1668344	1671487	Alright, let's talk about some actual video game news.
1671547	1672087	Loki, help.
1672348	1674049	Or we're going to turn into the literary podcast.
1675775	1681877	Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar cutscene directors.
1683857	1688318	I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.
1688698	1696320	He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.
1697780	1698320	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1714162	1725187	Focusing on the takeover of the American Embassy and outline the game saying that they're looking at about 8 to 10 different roles or different perspectives that are going to be in the game, different characters.
1726167	1731090	And initially you'll start the game off as like an Iranian but American-born U.S.
1731730	1738193	State Department translator who is, I guess, coming in with the objective to try to free the U.S.
1738273	1738893	hostages.
1740791	1743612	So, interesting subject, I suppose.
1745233	1754577	They're saying that, obviously, it's going to be a social-political title, and there's going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.
1754597	1762541	I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's not a sandbox game.
1763101	1774190	But it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting subject.
1774310	1782096	Honestly, before I was born, so I'm not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened.
1782717	1784078	So you're calling us old then, basically?
1784538	1785639	Yes, I am calling you old.
1785839	1787200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1808954	1823140	or like you can change history in it I don't know but then again I love civilization so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now but it's different I can't explain it it's different is this a game you're interested in playing Loki?
1823300	1836865	not really it doesn't sound that interesting even with the Grand Theft no because it's a guy who was a cutscene director I mean so what they directed stuff it's not the people actually I don't know it doesn't really count
1837421	1839003	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1853740	1855061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1871275	1877761	Is this maybe a way... Because all of us in the room admit we weren't really old enough to understand what was going on at the time.
1878501	1883285	So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened?
1884206	1885027	I guess it could be.
1885567	1888230	I mean, I just don't care.
1889491	1889931	I don't know.
1890011	1892273	That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.
1892833	1895656	It's just like I wouldn't want a game based off of...
1897563	1898684	I don't know, most of history.
1898804	1900865	I just don't really give a crap about history.
1902205	1910810	Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.
1913111	1922036	I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could just go and read everything, which I have.
1922616	1924317	I go back and read history books for fun.
1925029	1929492	The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer Red Alert.
1929573	1934516	Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.
1935077	1935777	Here's the funny thing.
1936538	1943724	I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know is stretching it a little bit, but that's going way back.
1943744	1945105	Remember Battle of Olympus on the NES?
1945125	1946145	That game was awesome.
1946466	1948948	And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.
1949588	1957894	But if they were to make a video game on other recent historical things, let's be honest, if they were to make a game on 9-11, that's not a game.
1958154	1960236	That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.
1960516	1963278	That's just not... Games are... I don't know.
1963298	1964178	They're supposed to be entertaining.
1964198	1965619	How do you even make a game out of that?
1965659	1966280	I mean, really.
1966340	1968361	Well, hopefully there isn't one.
1968401	1972224	But how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?
1972284	1972985	I mean, come on.
1973085	1973665	It's weird.
1973745	1975726	Okay, let me put this, though, into perspective, okay?
1976867	1977988	Say that...
1980390	1982992	World War II just ended three months ago.
1983913	1986535	And someone wants to put 1942 on the market.
1989758	1990578	It's the same thing.
1991439	1992700	And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.
1992900	1993521	That wouldn't fly.
1993781	1994001	Yeah.
1994982	1999906	Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?
1999946	2001447	There's zillions and zillions.
2001928	2005371	And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.
2006226	2007728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2026311	2027472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2048146	2053932	If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a stealth game where you investigate where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.
2072993	2075256	Return of Time Pilot, maybe.
2075297	2077660	Because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?
2078442	2079183	Modernize that.
2079884	2082086	Way off topic here, but he brought it up.
2083066	2083807	Melgar Solid.
2084107	2089071	Wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Melgar Solid style game set in like a high school or something like that?
2089091	2093734	You know, just like a high school kid or something and all very sneaky around and stuff.
2093774	2094855	Are you shooting people?
2094875	2096416	Because that's not going to go over very well.
2096436	2097296	No, I'm not shooting people.
2097336	2100659	I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.
2100679	2101860	Oh, like gossip.
2101900	2104201	That should be the Mean Girls game.
2104281	2107364	Not this like puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip
2108024	2114168	Biotch of the School, where you like eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.
2114208	2117690	Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.
2117710	2119411	Just like way too dramatic.
2119591	2122052	You know, just like everything way over-dramatized.
2122072	2128596	You know, just ridiculously amount, a ridiculous amount of drama to the game.
2129516	2130117	It'd be awesome.
2131057	2132238	No one has that kind of sense of humor.
2132479	2143788	But Konami, I can see that you have that sense of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and... God, what was that crappy high school dating game that they had on the PSP?
2144749	2148993	Oh, I don't even... I remember the game, I don't remember what it was called.
2150093	2155318	Well, anyways, see, I think all those things can be fixed with a little bit of the middle of your soul thrown in.
2156212	2165456	And hell, if you want to be funny even better, even better if you want to be a little bit more funny, you can have the principal or dean to be actually Old Snake.
2165516	2166316	It'd be hilarious.
2167697	2169538	Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know?
2172108	2172388	All right.
2173009	2177111	Let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon.
2177572	2181995	And actually, a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this week.
2182435	2185337	And they announced a lot of new games that are coming out.
2185837	2188379	And the first is the Fables series.
2188759	2190440	This is the comic book series Fables.
2190801	2192642	That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012.
2193903	2196464	So that's one of the games that they are working on right now.
2196484	2199086	You know, kind of fairy tales.
2199867	2200867	This is interesting.
2203008	2231654	characters from various fairy tales like Snow White, Pinocchio and this stuff they get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City so like if you're thinking like Fables is like oh it's like a Hansel and Gretel no no no no no no it's very different I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic Vertigo which is DC's sort of more I want to say adult but they're more serial like mature imprint they put Fables out I have the two first volumes and it's awesome
2231983	2247484	I actually just, we talked about a new issue that came out which is a Cinderella based one where she's an assassin So it's like Enchanted but Enchanted meets Leon Professional Pretty much How do you think it's going to translate into a game?
2247524	2248686	Those of you that know the books pretty well
2249486	2253829	I think it could do it.
2254049	2254910	They cuss a lot.
2255650	2260413	Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F-bomb in the comic.
2260773	2263275	Beauty and the Beast go see her for marital problems.
2263575	2265016	And she's like, I'm not a caseworker.
2265076	2265716	Leave me alone.
2266417	2269479	If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.
2269499	2270239	Why are you asking me?
2270319	2271880	I get banged by seven different dwarves.
2272020	2272321	F off.
2273481	2278942	Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up in the comic.
2279162	2285643	Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is Dorothy Gale.
2286824	2287164	Oh, wow.
2287224	2288824	Who's codenamed Silver Slipper.
2289684	2289924	Nice.
2290424	2290504	Yeah.
2290524	2291725	Because they have the shoe thing going on.
2291965	2292625	Can I be honest?
2293405	2296766	I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm, like, really interested.
2296826	2298026	I'm going to have to, like, borrow your books.
2298366	2299166	That sounds awesome.
2300387	2303649	I like things from my childhood like Really Really Messed Up.
2305229	2307971	If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.
2309031	2310732	Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?
2310792	2311332	Yeah.
2311612	2318656	Really, Tiger Claw, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation of The Great Gatsby in 3, that's gonna make no fucking sense.
2318916	2328020	I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.
2329520	2330381	Not to say it's bad.
2330401	2331082	I like Moulin Rouge.
2331362	2331603	Yeah.
2331643	2334386	But I just don't like this 3D orgy all these movies are having.
2334406	2335087	No, no, I understand that.
2335327	2337069	Everybody's, whatever.
2337189	2340413	I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.
2341274	2341715	Thank you.
2341855	2342856	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2342876	2343777	This is why I love him.
2344198	2345419	It's in 40!
2346340	2347141	With the Batman movies.
2349281	2353184	Alright, so anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale Press event.
2353464	2355385	Jurassic Park is one of the other games.
2355425	2356826	We've known they've been working on this for a while.
2357166	2360328	They showed off a little more about the game, and it's going to be coming out in April.
2360869	2364931	And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently...
2366152	2371576	The story involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved.
2371596	2372816	And you could say the book too, of course.
2374117	2377699	Although, not to get off track, but I always found it interesting.
2377779	2380781	Did you ever read the sequel to the book?
2381142	2383143	The Jurassic Park, The Lost World, the book?
2383663	2387305	Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?
2387546	2387726	Yeah.
2387946	2391048	Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back.
2391068	2391228	Yeah.
2391328	2392028	I'll have this done in two weeks
2422549	2424530	When he escapes, he gets killed, right?
2424570	2425991	But what was he trying to do?
2426051	2430595	He was trying to get out of there with the shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.
2430775	2431916	But it's never recovered.
2431956	2433217	It's always assumed lost.
2433797	2438620	So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?
2438661	2439281	Where did it go?
2439361	2439941	Who found it?
2439961	2440582	What did they do with it?
2441262	2445706	I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie.
2446587	2448548	I'm pretty excited about this.
2448568	2449409	This is going to be pretty awesome.
2449849	2452531	Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.
2452811	2454713	That's $5 off the regular price.
2455614	2456675	The Walking Dead.
2457135	2459897	This is a show on AMC that a lot of people are really into.
2460077	2460978	Also a graphic novel.
2461218	2465201	Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.
2467343	2469945	Are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?
2470045	2472787	I don't know the show at all, but you know the book and you know the show.
2473688	2476610	I know it's a book first and then it became the AMC show.
2476670	2480493	I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.
2483035	2485897	Other than I love stuff with zombies.
2485917	2486978	I never get bored of zombies.
2487799	2488740	So, yeah.
2489901	2492323	Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.
2492363	2494546	There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.
2495867	2499551	Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.
2500092	2504957	Also, Hector Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.
2505497	2510243	It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult-like.
2510923	2519326	And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.
2519987	2530351	And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fanboy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really going to be making it.
2531071	2531671	Oh, that explains a lot.
2531691	2531831	Well...
2553360	2580059	and the cool thing is though the silver lining people are still allowed to do their thing and you know they're putting out what the third game or they just put out the third series or third episode in their series so you know it's cool that that's able to coexist because you know what I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe so to speak why not we have all these you know like we were saying earlier World War 2 games we have TV shows we had two Star Trek shows on at the same time you know so why not
2581135	2589362	So, and it's cool that one's free and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way, but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.
2589462	2589922	You know what I mean?
2590583	2594386	I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals because I know they're really passionate about what they do.
2594846	2600171	But, you know, on one department you have the same group that made Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.
2600431	2602332	Telltale has a proven track record.
2602353	2603113	They have the pedigree.
2603293	2603814	Exactly.
2603974	2605996	That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.
2607056	2610517	It's really cool that both are going to be coexisting and what have you.
2610797	2613218	I am so excited to see what they put out.
2614519	2618480	I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.
2618520	2622942	I realize she's living in a fort in the middle of the woods now and doesn't really do a lot with gaming.
2622962	2624802	They live in Yosemite or something weird.
2624962	2626763	They pretty much removed themselves from society.
2627043	2632965	So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy because I have so many video game memories tied to her and Ken.
2633505	2661470	and they just like I don't even think I have to say this because I think they already know but Telltale if they're going to be rebooting it we've got to have something as awesome as Rosella the fourth game and I think there will be nods they'll be winking nods to the old stuff I believe it so it'll be cool because they didn't say it's a remake it's a reboot more to be revealed at E3 so very cool very very cool so lots of news out of Telltale this week
2662955	2663936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2684953	2693319	Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off discs and then downloading a crack file so that they could play the discs.
2694180	2705368	And that now, because there are so many things that are included in the games now that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game goodies...
2706249	2723151	that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not going to get any of the bragging rights that go along with having the game and a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple systems who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it
2723972	2736064	and the other thing too is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost effective to run your own server for a lot of these games.
2736144	2743351	You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're playing Ragnarok Online.
2743471	2745854	Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.
2746374	2746794	I digress.
2749055	2750636	But the WoW ones are really jank.
2751316	2753397	It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.
2753457	2763401	And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters over.
2764178	2767799	Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?
2768100	2768720	Yeah, they did.
2769280	2770841	So, that was really cool.
2771261	2777023	And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that you can't pirate a free game.
2778684	2779324	It's, you just...
2780791	2782252	It's free anyway, so why not?
2783392	2788935	And it's not like, you know, if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server, then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself.
2789555	2793777	As opposed to, you know, getting the community content like how they did with Second Life, you know.
2794497	2804302	So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.
2806027	2809750	I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting the same experience that a person who pays for it does Unless it's Ragnarok Online
2833689	2854888	I like with your first person shooters that you've got servers set up for online play and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled if you've got a pirated version because I've noticed a few of those running about
2856297	2868125	Yeah, I've noticed a lot for more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever, Modern Warfare 2, StarCraft 2, even without the cinematics, these games are huge.
2868145	2872608	And I know that at home, broadband connections are faster than they've ever been.
2872928	2876971	You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like 100 bucks.
2877411	2881934	But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70 gigs.
2881974	2882134	Yeah.
2883175	2887546	and it's like, yeah, alright, leave it running overnight but it's like, that's just too much.
2887606	2888529	I'd rather just buy it.
2888789	2889411	Like, I don't know.
2889892	2891637	Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.
2894255	2894595	We'll see.
2894635	2897996	That's what everyone would like to hear to think is that it's really slow.
2898016	2901217	But honestly, it doesn't take much.
2901517	2904038	And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.
2904078	2911239	They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.
2911659	2913220	And they have programs like JDownloader.
2913740	2919002	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2938567	2941668	This question is going to sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.
2941728	2943788	What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?
2943828	2951490	Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before they call your house and threaten you.
2951810	2955651	And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.
2955931	2960233	Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.
2960253	2965274	Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I want to say StarCraft II is at least 20.
2966566	2970670	Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's a big game.
2971070	2972431	Yeah, but everything's compressed.
2973092	2979517	You're talking like the most you're going to probably have two DVD 9 disc images or whatever.
2979857	2981919	You're looking at 18 gigs or something like that.
2982460	2988024	Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's going to be very difficult to hit your cap of 250 gigs.
2989445	2990306	I can tell you this now.
2990326	2995748	I download my episode of Supernatural every week because I'm at Temple on Friday night and so I miss it.
2996228	3011033	So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural and I've just downloaded the first four episodes of Being Human Season 3 and the first two of the American version of it like last night while I was playing World of Warcraft and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.
3011854	3012774	So it's really not that hard.
3013996	3016362	TV shows are kind of a different thing though.
3016382	3020813	Are you not able to watch Supernatural online like on the official website or anything like that?
3021604	3032168	Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.
3032508	3042691	Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's Drag Race, every week.
3043571	3045533	Go on and watch that on LOGO's website.
3045854	3048276	Watch the Colbert Report.
3048636	3049717	Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.
3049738	3050258	The Daily Show.
3050298	3051719	It doesn't even have to be like Hulu or whatever.
3051740	3052460	You can go on the website.
3052500	3054562	Survivor, every week is there.
3055083	3062090	Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.
3062501	3064242	Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way.
3064442	3065162	That's weird.
3066323	3071765	And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television is absolutely stupid.
3072325	3075566	And I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being talked down to.
3076447	3080589	So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it.
3080669	3087331	And if I'm in the middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish watching the episode.
3087451	3091113	Or I can go mining or something.
3092394	3094835	Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.
3094875	3097576	This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.
3098176	3099217	We're talking about King's Quest.
3100217	3104538	Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orange.radio.com saying, Reboot Space Quest.
3105219	3105519	Yes.
3106039	3114822	Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?
3115982	3117323	Not the Heroes games?
3117343	3122146	The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember anymore.
3122586	3124207	If they sign off on it, then hell yeah.
3124827	3126908	Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.
3127289	3129690	But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?
3129770	3133292	So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.
3134152	3134432	I don't know.
3134452	3138995	Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably better left in the past.
3140066	3140688	But I digress.
3140768	3141389	Let's move on.
3141469	3142311	Loki, what do you have for us?
3142492	3150110	Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great or good or worth playing.
3150780	3152281	Thanks for watching!
3170694	3174617	Plain Theft of Actual Games
3193150	3203012	Stole the game and the assets and everything else and put it up on the Apple App Store and were selling it for quite a long time.
3203152	3203712	I remember this.
3203752	3206392	This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.
3206952	3220215	Yes, and it was just like they were trying to get people trying to get Apple's attention to get it taken down because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99 cent app and
3222075	3230823	It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy section of the App Store.
3230903	3235807	So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.
3235867	3237648	And now it's finally back.
3238749	3241511	The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.
3241892	3242092	Yeah.
3243553	3248619	So, that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.
3248659	3252564	But, I mean, a lot of damage has been done and people already have the old version of the game.
3252764	3254126	So, it kind of sucks.
3254677	3255737	What can be done about this though?
3255757	3260518	It's very interesting because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to screen for copyrighted stuff.
3260798	3264739	I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace, they'd kind of get that.
3265159	3269840	But you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest, I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game either.
3270100	3270320	No.
3270760	3272860	You don't have time to play everything.
3273240	3273700	Exactly.
3273760	3275801	So how do you stop theft like that?
3276521	3280322	I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace does a peer review.
3280982	3281802	Is that the answer?
3282042	3282382	I don't know.
3283995	3286277	It might be the answer, I don't know.
3286577	3289219	But it's not the only game they have that happened to it.
3289279	3294042	There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with fighting animals.
3294082	3295463	It was like a 3D fighter game.
3296203	3301927	And that actually had a version of it ripped off and put on there.
3302167	3311954	A little bit different situation, that is people that they claimed they were sold the rights to the game and stuff like that, but the developer said, no, you only have the rights to this,
3314395	3315736	Flash Game, or something like that.
3315796	3316916	We have the rights to do this.
3317116	3318936	So there's a big ol' thing about that.
3318996	3321437	Well, that's not so much a blatant rip-off.
3321477	3323758	That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other.
3326098	3331100	Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.
3331620	3332420	Smurfs Village.
3332620	3334301	Obviously a game that's out there.
3334361	3335241	It's free to play.
3336221	3337181	Thanks for watching!
3354406	3355486	Thanks for watching!
3379454	3379754	DarkSakura.com
3395100	3398422	What did you want to say, SalaciousBob?
3398682	3400664	I don't even have kids in my household.
3400764	3402585	I'm usually very protective of my stuff.
3402905	3405527	For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.
3405587	3409049	I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.
3409489	3412411	I want to be asked for my password every single time.
3414043	3435050	and there's also ways if you have kids and this is something that you're afraid that might happen there's a way you can also disable first off you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well you can also disable in app purchases and it's opt out though it's not opt in which is the problem it's opt out so you need to make sure you do that
3435330	3436170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3454657	3455858	Capcom's fault.
3456078	3459659	I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down.
3459739	3465741	And to be honest, I haven't had to... Nobody uses my phone but me, so I haven't had to explore those options.
3465781	3466722	I don't know.
3466762	3469943	I agree that they should lock it down, but they're also making it seem that it seems like...
3470723	3473165	The kids aren't even aware that it's costing money.
3473225	3474185	And then there's my other thought.
3474445	3480970	Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that somewhat?
3481030	3483511	Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this?
3483631	3485212	Well, I guess maybe some parents don't know.
3485433	3487254	They may not know it's a free Smurfs game.
3489238	3492099	I still think some onus is on the parents.
3492179	3494600	It is negligence on the parents' part for sure.
3495181	3496781	But you're right.
3496901	3499482	You shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.
3499542	3511007	They're making it as easy as possible for it to happen so that maybe, say, a kid racks up $30 worth of purchases or something like that.
3511347	3512428	The parent might go, shit.
3513388	3516531	but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded.
3517511	3522956	Whereas thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all of a sudden Capcom's giving them their money back.
3522996	3529061	But how many times is this happening that they're not getting their money back or not even trying to get their money back?
3530504	3541772	A lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is, it doesn't say, this costs you $5.
3542812	3546295	It says, this costs you 20 fairy dust points.
3546655	3548016	So the kid's like, oh, okay.
3548216	3549237	And when they refill their...
3550037	3550957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3566042	3567502	There's always a layer of... Party points?
3567542	3569283	They haven't even... They didn't do Gil?
3569723	3572944	I don't think... It's not really... I think they're just Squeenix coins or something like that.
3573064	3582706	Yeah, so it doesn't actually talk about this is money, $4, because a kid might recognize that, but there's that sort of... I don't know.
3582726	3585627	I think it's a very... Some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.
3586127	3594132	Some comments from our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod Touch, you can log off your account before giving it to a kid to play.
3594632	3595592	There's a suggestion.
3596293	3601296	Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store to keep their kids occupied.
3601676	3603697	I've seen them watching videos and playing games.
3604457	3606258	X-Link says, parents are being stupid.
3606338	3608880	I have two kids and I know about what these games do.
3609320	3610021	And here's a clue.
3610201	3612282	If something is free, there's a catch.
3612742	3615943	So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying, this is a problem.
3616083	3633409	So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has told Capcom in no uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.
3633469	3638371	In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your game.
3638871	3639331	Fix it.
3642515	3644016	That's basically what that means.
3644536	3646638	Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.
3646658	3649301	Well, basically from Apple and credit card companies.
3649961	3653885	Because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't authorize this charge.
3654125	3657208	Yeah, let's do a chargeback and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.
3657508	3658409	So, yeah.
3660279	3660680	Interesting.
3661180	3664405	I do think, though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.
3664505	3665766	They enabled this feature.
3665867	3667529	They made it so easy to do.
3668010	3670172	They need to kind of educate people.
3670212	3671614	And they're making money off of it.
3671835	3672455	They are making money.
3673176	3674919	And they approved Capcom's game.
3675139	3677642	So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.
3678223	3681166	and I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff.
3681246	3682627	I think Apple needs to own some of that.
3682647	3686531	And it's not that difficult to patch this shit.
3686591	3687232	I mean, fuck.
3687812	3690034	There's games that patch themselves once a week.
3690114	3690735	I mean, come on.
3691095	3692797	Just do it.
3693177	3693738	Just fix it.
3694904	3695204	All right.
3695545	3696586	Well, we'll see what develops with that.
3696606	3701130	And there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention to what's going on with your kids.
3701190	3701650	Seriously.
3702131	3703252	That still wouldn't stop it.
3703652	3703952	All right.
3704293	3706034	Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.
3706495	3712120	And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else is buying this game.
3712440	3717305	But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on all the big gaming blogs.
3717745	3718126	But yes...
3718846	3723389	It is true, they are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition.
3723429	3725511	It's called a Final Shipment.
3725531	3728212	I'm surprised they didn't call it like an Encore Shipment or something like that.
3728653	3739000	But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on a Wii disc.
3739080	3739900	That's all it is.
3740040	3741001	No extra frills.
3741241	3742342	No nothing.
3742362	3744443	Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.
3744603	3745804	Oh, excuse me.
3745964	3746905	Excuse me.
3747205	3747505	How dare I?
3768351	3769813	No, but basically here's the thing.
3769953	3771194	It's not in large quantities.
3771374	3773336	It's going to be just as limited as it was before.
3773937	3775238	They're just releasing a few more.
3775298	3778562	In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.
3778822	3783247	Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack shit, basically.
3783707	3791249	So, yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited, but hey, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.
3791289	3799731	But honestly, just tell yourself, it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to port it over to the Wii.
3800031	3800771	That's all it is.
3801051	3804032	If you want that soundtrack and you want that book...
3805390	3808592	Great, I guess, but I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.
3808612	3811594	I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.
3811834	3819279	They're just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.
3819379	3826823	I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.
3828044	3831045	And if they want more for it, talk them down.
3831285	3838788	And the fact that this game is going for that much money online and the fact that they're like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.
3839288	3839888	You know what that means?
3840148	3842569	More of this shit is going to happen coming soon.
3842589	3846850	I mean, you bet your ass that they're going to fucking reprint that goddamn.
3846870	3851392	Remember the Legend of Zelda bonus that they had for preordering Wind Waker and shit?
3851612	3852112	How much you want?
3852172	3854513	But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.
3854633	3860958	They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out Mario 64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.
3861878	3863680	But they could always do more GameCube games.
3863860	3869204	Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS or Mario Kart or whatever.
3869964	3872526	They could easily do it for another system.
3872806	3879291	Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them and people are dumb enough to purchase them.
3880092	3880772	Let's also be real.
3880812	3881873	What else is coming out on the Wii?
3883888	3887169	There's that awesome looking roleplaying game in Japan that's not coming out here.
3887189	3891130	There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports Mix.
3891150	3892431	They haven't announced a new title.
3892991	3894892	Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.
3894952	3897653	This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?
3898233	3898293	No.
3899508	3899868	and DarkSakura.
3926616	3926996	I don't know.
3927436	3928277	They don't really have a lot.
3928537	3931078	They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff.
3932039	3932399	We'll see.
3933159	3934820	In the meantime, more news.
3935941	3936521	DarkSakura.
3937133	3938434	Yes, I have news.
3940275	3955427	There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this is going to seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.
3955587	3958950	How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.
3959250	3985845	But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's Psychophysiology Lab and Biofeedback Clinic So it at least has a reputable study that was done about it They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression And they played Bejeweled 2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle And they all experienced a significant reduction in anxiety and better mood
3987006	4002729	does this explain why sometimes and I don't know how many of y'all do this but like when I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home but I'm just I'm just not feeling you know it's raining out I'm just feeling kind of blah I'll sit there on Facebook and play that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour like is that tie into this
4004663	4005564	I will admit something.
4006904	4010587	You know that towards the end of my job period I was very unhappy.
4011427	4012268	Very unhappy.
4013468	4015029	I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.
4017370	4021933	I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk and I would always feel better.
4023314	4026936	Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.
4028956	4041965	I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks but it was just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air and I found I could get back to work and do fine.
4043086	4045668	But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?
4045708	4050331	Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft Auto 4.
4050371	4051392	He's been doing it for years.
4053021	4054142	That's not for blowing off stress.
4055042	4057264	That makes my coworkers more stressful.
4057284	4062467	I'm not saying Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your way to relax?
4062527	4064668	It's your way to kind of unwind at work, right?
4065048	4066169	A little bit?
4066189	4068270	It doesn't really matter.
4068310	4071953	I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.
4072333	4073213	People like games.
4073233	4074274	I mean, there's lots of things.
4074751	4080076	I couldn't sit and do that with Final Fantasy 2, for example, which I was still playing on my phone.
4080736	4082658	Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.
4083098	4085821	I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game.
4087662	4095830	But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back to later, it's easier.
4096130	4099573	You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.
4100825	4106299	That's, yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard, and clearly I'm not alone.
4108581	4136357	S2100 Matt in our chatroom says I can attest to this, ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty Rickster in our chatroom says maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax play modes interesting, that is true Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but
4137097	4137557	Interesting.
4139519	4152166	But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really just casual games or if other games are involved in it.
4153066	4154928	But I do see where...
4155808	4158189	New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.
4183948	4190532	Actually, playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.
4191673	4192833	Because they don't frighten me.
4192853	4193814	The games don't frighten me.
4194854	4195575	People frighten me.
4195695	4196015	Really?
4196115	4198056	Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.
4199237	4204280	I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.
4205701	4207422	People freak me out more than the game does.
4208202	4209243	And fake blood freaks me out.
4209881	4216106	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, video games do help you relax until you start kicking and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.
4216827	4219770	They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.
4219790	4221451	You know what stresses me the hell out?
4222192	4224213	Playing fighting games with Dan.
4224714	4225895	Because he's a dick.
4227136	4227757	I love you!
4229418	4230679	But he's a jerk when he wins.
4231480	4232300	He's a sore winner.
4234962	4240445	All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.
4240485	4241345	We'll start in the U.S.
4241385	4241826	with Loki.
4242046	4245827	There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out this week, which is pretty cool.
4247268	4250409	Starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you I was playing.
4250570	4253531	Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.
4254051	4259656	But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox 360.
4259716	4264139	That includes early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.
4264420	4265781	It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.
4266181	4271165	And then also the Limited Edition, which is on PS3 and PC.
4271285	4273767	So you can check those out.
4274428	4278591	Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.
4278631	4280613	That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
4281493	4283534	Um, let's see here.
4283554	4287516	Ys 1 and 2 Chronicles with the soundtrack.
4287596	4289657	That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.
4291218	4296820	Uh, re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice, and Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.
4296880	4299922	Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlas saying that they're marking some of that stuff down.
4300642	4301703	Those are coming out this week as well.
4302043	4311969	The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi.
4312450	4312650	All for $30.
4316172	4337769	Night's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Trackmania, Built to Race Trackmania is an awesome game on PC so you should definitely check it out if you have a Wii that'll be coming out on Wii and I believe also on DS as well it's such a great racing game
4338690	4342673	and then a crappy game called Rec Room.
4342793	4343834	It's coming out on DS.
4343914	4344874	It's a portable Wii game.
4345515	4346135	Party stuff.
4346796	4347016	Fun.
4347796	4352499	Blob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3.
4355481	4356362	No PC on that, I guess.
4356522	4359264	I remember the original Da Blah, but it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.
4359825	4362707	Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.
4363607	4366330	Because people don't remember the first one so well.
4366350	4367711	It was kind of one of those under the radar.
4367731	4371093	If you have a PlayStation 3 that doesn't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.
4371113	4371253	Yippee.
4377805	4380566	Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.
4381026	4381706	That's pretty cool.
4383367	4389950	I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius, that's coming out on PC this week.
4390031	4391351	Yeah, probably is another expansion.
4392092	4393252	EverQuest loves their expansions.
4393812	4394313	I'm surprised.
4394333	4397254	That's kind of interesting that they're doing that.
4397834	4398275	And then...
4401141	4401601	What else?
4403262	4415869	Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life If you like those hidden picture type games, that's coming out on DS this week That's basically it
4417265	4420050	Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.
4420390	4427201	This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called Muchi Muchi Pork and Pink Sweets.
4428002	4429224	Yes, that's really what it's called.
4429625	4431528	It's from Cave, so, uh...
4434298	4434818	It never came out here.
4460114	4460414	and so on.
4481946	4483648	Lave Once, Mermaid's Tears Makai Senkei Disgaea 4
4499066	4517182	Rune Factory Oceans comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3 Moving on to the Nintendo Wii real quick to see if there's anything coming out in Japan Yeah, they get Rune Factory Oceans there as well And then SD Gundam G Generation World Like we really need another super deformed Gundam
4518643	4535212	you know you love your Gundam games don't lie also it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan it comes out on February 26th I seriously thought about you know the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing that and I was like no
4536653	4538554	So, yeah, this is the big week, guys.
4538694	4565052	Winning 11 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, let's see, Nintendogs Plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle Editions, Leighton Koju to Kisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Leighton, and Combat of Giants Dinosaur 3D.
4566834	4573685	all of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week so that's Saturday, that's the 26th so what games are you going to get on the 3DS when it comes out?
4574907	4580076	I'm probably going to, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats and maybe the Street Fighter game
4581417	4582378	You make bad decisions.
4602655	4607238	Actually, Dead or Alive didn't really interest me that much, but Street Fighter, whatever.
4607418	4609419	But Dead or Alive, not coming out at launch.
4609799	4610379	Coming out in May.
4611260	4616043	Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kind of cool, coming out in May.
4616523	4618084	It's not coming out right away.
4618884	4621245	So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?
4621426	4621766	I don't.
4622666	4623607	I'm just going to wait until May.
4624307	4646660	I think it looks cool, I actually wanna, I don't know, I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it, I can't control it I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like living expenses You know what, if I was in that situation, I would probably do the same thing
4647091	4648713	Even though we've paid off all our bills.
4650354	4651695	I would sell stuff in the house.
4652095	4656239	It's not even any rational reason.
4656339	4658241	It's just ridiculous stuff.
4658261	4660783	Dan's talking that he wants the PlayStation phone.
4660963	4664506	The Pilotwings game looks pretty awesome if it were coming out at launch.
4664626	4665487	Oh, it's not at launch?
4665527	4667089	They haven't announced their launch titles.
4667109	4670051	Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.
4670351	4672033	Which means they're like, oh, we got nothing.
4673260	4677441	Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob, can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing it?
4678502	4680723	You can't see this, but I'm flipping you off right now.
4681063	4685144	I want you to buy Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my place.
4686024	4687365	You guys are assholes.
4687465	4690406	What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?
4691406	4693127	Kid Icarus, because you don't play portable games at all.
4693147	4693807	It's not coming out at launch.
4694007	4695727	Well, that's, yeah, I can wait though.
4695767	4696568	Obviously you can't.
4696788	4699669	Okay, launch window games as they're going to, they're like...
4700769	4701730	I love Nintendo.
4701750	4702290	That's great.
4702510	4703531	Launch window games.
4703651	4706373	It's just, you know, from launch to three months after launch.
4706433	4707694	That's not a window.
4707794	4709975	That is... Launch window is that week.
4710175	4711456	That is a launch window.
4712997	4714598	You don't launch for three months.
4715159	4715779	That's not a launch.
4715799	4716940	Yeah, three months is a quarter.
4717100	4718941	That's the difference between Q2 and Q3.
4718981	4720262	That's, yeah.
4720562	4725205	Okay, but anyways, if we're going to say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool.
4725306	4725866	Dream Trigger.
4726106	4729268	It's a shooter music game, which is kind of cool.
4730209	4730309	Um...
4732156	4739081	I hate even wanting to say this, but the new Spongebob squiggle pants, the one that's like... No, no, no.
4739541	4740562	It's like WarioWare.
4741823	4744565	It's a WarioWare type game.
4745225	4748848	I got not to get... Oh, what was I going to... Not the Spongebob, but the other one.
4749228	4752691	I was going to ask about... Oh, music shooter games.
4752911	4754772	Do we have a definitive date for Child of Eden yet?
4754792	4755893	I want to say we have.
4755913	4756853	It's like in June right now.
4756873	4757154	Okay.
4757214	4757414	Okay.
4758195	4760657	I don't think it's got a date on it.
4760937	4765101	Yeah, we'll get there, but I never did the PSP ones because everybody was bitching at me about winning the 3DS.
4765482	4767464	So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan.
4767804	4775332	Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.
4775412	4777314	Alright, now ma'am, we may go to the UK.
4777774	4780096	On the 22nd, we have Cities in Motion for PC.
4780316	4783578	The 23rd, we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled Blitz Live.
4783698	4786981	On the 24th, Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm.
4787361	4788642	We have Deblob 2.
4789622	4806895	We have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Grey Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us Cling Together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.
4808812	4809672	I'm efficient.
4812033	4814274	Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.
4814854	4815154	All right.
4815714	4820315	Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see how efficient she is on that.
4820695	4822636	All right, Loki.
4822856	4828718	This is kind of odd, but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's in, so...
4830256	4832459	What's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?
4832499	4834921	They're releasing tablets.
4835002	4839587	Because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were first coming around.
4841112	4841492	and DarkSakura.
4868644	4871727	But no, they do have the S1 tablet.
4872207	4877972	It's a PlayStation Suite certified tablet, which means it's going to be running the Android operating system.
4878892	4882435	And they haven't really said what it's going to look like.
4882775	4888100	Although there was a rumored design, it was some sort of tablet that actually folds.
4889200	4893664	It has like a screen that actually bends, which is kind of funky, but cool, I guess.
4894385	4894545	And...
4896326	4899048	That'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.
4901930	4923086	But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and PlayStation Network services, delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across the... I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.
4923647	4923727	Uh...
4925728	4948499	so yeah they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out in the market and it plays PlayStation 1 games no one I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch to play a PlayStation 1 game on a goddamn tablet it's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of signed agreed
4949794	4950835	And here's the other thing, too.
4951055	4956700	Why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what?
4956820	4961204	We may just extend this PlayStation Suite to the Apple iPad or something like that.
4961584	4966368	And a lot more people, I'm sure, have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever, and they can play their games on there.
4966388	4977818	But I, for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because, one, it would take up a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity.
4978138	4990843	and two, it would play like shit because touch controls here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be dead when I start using it for the first time right?
4991884	4992804	that's the real question
4995069	4995429	I don't know.
5015919	5017140	Just wait it out.
5017200	5020962	Seriously, there's no need to rush in to play PlayStation 1 games.
5021022	5031328	If you really need to play PlayStation 1 games, you can get a PlayStation 1, a PlayStation 2, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer.
5031528	5033789	You can just wait.
5033910	5035931	There are plenty of ways to do it.
5036651	5038152	Here's something you shouldn't wait for.
5038832	5043493	If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should buy it new.
5043894	5048215	Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.
5048595	5057158	Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.
5057238	5059899	This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.
5060339	5062382	But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.
5063403	5068490	So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the PlayStation 3 used.
5068971	5075320	By the way, just want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official quote on this, that's why this is news this week, because they did make a comment on it.
5076380	5083364	Once the PSN key has been consumed with a disc, it cannot be resold or replayed with the second user adding a sub.
5083844	5087206	Only the original consumer can use that account.
5087546	5091708	They say the retail disc and the PSN code, they are one and the same.
5091948	5093669	Once you use it, it is gone.
5093949	5096490	A second-hand user cannot obtain a new code.
5096610	5102880	And the only reason this is happening and just because it's an MMO and because it has a 30-day free trial.
5103240	5109230	Otherwise, people would just be able to pop it in the different systems or just loan it to friends and have 30-day trials for everybody.
5109570	5109751	Which...
5111021	5113243	I mean, honestly, it's not a bad idea.
5113303	5114984	It's a good way to get people hooked on your game.
5115064	5120308	But no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single game out there.
5120948	5122790	I think when they do that, people will be pissed.
5122830	5124951	This is, you know, this is all right.
5125332	5126913	This is expected with an MMO.
5127679	5131301	Yeah, with an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.
5131461	5145909	So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really care where you... Like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.
5146610	5150472	I don't have to go out and buy another disc because that serial number is attached to my subscription.
5150732	5155475	Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than buying them through Blizzard, but they still work.
5155575	5156395	And you shouldn't be such a...
5179282	5179882	Thanks for watching!
5197888	5207622	So, you know, in theory, say your friend has the game also and he lost his disc and you're a kind soul and want to loan him your disc, that is absolutely fine.
5207642	5208683	It will work just fine.
5208763	5213090	It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to play it.
5213750	5214692	There's no extra code.
5216696	5223939	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you cancelled your subscription.
5247059	5251001	You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360.
5251962	5257085	And I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in the game and get 30 days free.
5257145	5261148	Well, and here's the other thing, too, about the DC Universe thing.
5261308	5266091	Let's just say it's not as prone as the 360, but let's say your system dies.
5267992	5268312	Crack.
5269533	5270513	Because it's tied to your system.
5272955	5274476	I guess you have to call their customer service.
5275717	5275977	All right.
5276468	5277789	Well, anyhow, I got one more.
5278430	5279111	No, wait, I lied.
5279151	5279471	That's it.
5279511	5280492	That was my last story.
5280792	5283475	So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.
5284416	5292283	Let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online for 30 days for free in serial numbers.
5292664	5298890	Let's go back to a day when we had a single player game in front of us on the TV and we liked it.
5299662	5301904	Psycho Soldier Psycho Soldier
5326502	5330206	She's just a little girl with power inside, burning bright...
5345987	5346628	Vocal Soundtrack
5367147	5377690	and it's a sequel to SNK's Athena and this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character Athena Asamiya comes from as well as C. Kenzo.
5378951	5381692	As that NES game way back in the game, right?
5382052	5382272	Yes.
5382572	5384332	Wow.
5384533	5390875	This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad in 1987.
5393411	5395732	Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you just asked for.
5395752	5398793	There's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.
5399134	5401815	Let's play a little bit of that.
5402015	5404456	I'm jamming.
5404536	5405496	I'm jamming.
5416245	5416785	Better singing.
5416825	5417926	A little less screeching, yeah.
5432373	5435777	Basically, she's running around with psychic abilities.
5436679	5439702	It's a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to.
5440123	5442165	Because you could just run into a wall.
5442746	5446370	Or into a trap or something that would just completely kill you.
5447452	5447532	Um...
5448953	5471166	So, her buddy Seikenso is player 2, and it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12 as their default outfits, I believe, or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game anyway.
5472167	5479643	And, of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of this theme.
5479823	5481867	Like, I think I put one in as well.
5483021	5486003	But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.
5486264	5487404	Like I said, it's a side-scroller.
5487424	5488285	You've got different levels.
5488325	5490587	You have rocks and destructible objects.
5491127	5491988	You can blow them up.
5492588	5493829	And you've got different enemies.
5494290	5499213	And you basically go horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects.
5499253	5501896	And you can use your psycho energy to get different attacks.
5502436	5507420	Either by using a shield of rotating spheres, which was one of her moves in King of Fighters.
5508020	5509942	And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.
5509962	5510042	Yeah.
5512203	5512304	And...
5514326	5522034	And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the special items happen to be different.
5522754	5528520	Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.
5529821	5536328	But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them, or rams them into an enemy.
5538950	5544034	The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu.
5546255	5550438	I don't know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.
5551839	5554622	The song came out on a cassette.
5555522	5560283	It was only available for people who purchased the Famicom version of Athena.
5561243	5566804	So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending theme.
5567964	5571845	And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.
5572345	5575926	It was the Psychic Soldier team in 94 and King of Fighters 96.
5576886	5580426	And it was Athena's theme in King of Fighters 97 and King of Fighters 2002.
5584547	5593653	As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was an 87 by Imagine Software and it kind of got some decent success.
5593713	5600497	It got an 8 out of 10 for one rating and a 6 to 9 and 75% for other places but said it was really slow.
5603299	5606561	Well, Athena and Kenzo have both been in the King of Fighters series.
5606581	5609563	They've also, of course, been in SNK vs. Capcom.
5610283	5610964	They were...
5612945	5641558	in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit and Kenso was in his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000 as Psycho Soldier Kenso also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystallis on the NES awesome and that's pretty much it it's a fun little waste of time I've got a main ROM of it
5642828	5644070	Alright, there it is.
5644211	5647597	Your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.
5648418	5649300	You see why it's notable?
5649961	5650161	I do.
5650201	5652626	First in-game vocal soundtrack.
5653026	5653267	I do.
5653387	5653708	Very cool.
5654246	5660910	All right, well, we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because we're going to be back with Part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics.
5660950	5664211	Be sure to get those in, if you haven't already, at twitter.com slash OLR.
5664572	5672496	And we're going to get into some rapid news and including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise download content that showed up, among some other things.
5672936	5677819	And then, of course, we have some more news development in a lawsuit against Activision.
5678219	5678939	And we'll talk about that.
5679019	5682821	It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.
5684202	5689649	of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week it is all coming up when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5695387	5697908	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5697948	5704572	We are live on this February the 20th of 2011 with the 402nd episode of our show.

5717538	5721102	We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics.
5721482	5728169	But first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling, playing this game, Bulletstorm.
5728189	5729130	What's so funny about it?
5729210	5729491	You like this?
5729511	5732314	There's just a lot of, like, I like the writing in it, I guess.
5732894	5733575	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5756796	5761221	Pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny.
5761782	5769110	And then they turn around and they see the corpse of the guy near the window with a sticky mine on the window.
5769731	5770172	And he's all...
5772113	5772653	God damn it.
5773014	5774434	And then the thing just explodes.
5774554	5775014	I don't know.
5775054	5775755	It's pretty funny.
5776595	5776955	All right.
5777015	5780497	Well, let's get into some plugs for the sideshows that we do.
5780577	5784038	DarkSakura, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?
5784198	5786979	Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.
5790101	5791521	We actually publish on Tuesdays.
5791601	5795123	We are at Infamous.net and F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
5795143	5800185	You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.
5800945	5801726	We are awesome!
5802326	5802867	Listen to us.
5803447	5805669	It's me, Maren Marvel, and Dan Shadow.
5807351	5813156	And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
5813676	5819141	It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.
5819682	5823585	And it's available on iTunes and there will be a real website coming soon.
5824486	5829830	Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.
5830191	5831692	And then your Twitter topics will be coming up.
5831752	5834794	So this is your very last chance to get those in at twitter.com slash OLR.
5835775	5837016	Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?
5838188	5840470	EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.
5842131	5843791	That's sad.
5844452	5846293	So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure.
5846453	5849955	It's just a matter of when that time is and what we do with it.
5849995	5853417	We have a small team on it and I'm excited about what we'll do.
5855098	5856959	I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.
5857119	5860501	Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3 so I'm sure that's got a lot of...
5862322	5865644	Time being utilized on that and resources.
5866724	5872368	I'm sure there will be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.
5873849	5877431	EA responded a little bit about it as well.
5877451	5883075	They're saying Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.
5885256	5887857	DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3.
5888698	5889799	Nothing further to announce.
5890439	5894445	So, maybe down the line.
5895927	5897670	It was a pretty fun game, though.
5898251	5899252	Hopefully there will be a sequel.
5900865	5904467	One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out on the PlayStation 1 Classics.
5904828	5906148	My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.
5907409	5908270	Finally making its way out.
5908290	5911231	Of course, no JogCon support.
5911351	5912092	That's kind of sad.
5913593	5917775	You will be able to play the game, though, very soon, though, on the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
5918916	5927060	And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge Racer Unbound is coming out.
5927080	5927701	So that's kind of neat.
5929843	5933507	No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.
5935810	5936110	March.
5936811	5941837	So probably around the time that the 3D versions come out.
5943433	5948036	The Pendulum Mixed Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me On Fire, and Salt In The Wounds
5965968	5969569	That is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.
5971430	5977832	And, of course, the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft points each.
5978372	5984334	I am a little disappointed that they didn't have Hold Your Color or Self vs. Self, my two favorite songs on there.
5984774	5985434	But, hey, whatever.
5985514	5986034	It's pretty cool.
5986234	5988455	So definitely check that out since.
5989395	6014880	that's the last content you're getting yeah so since you know last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed is it safe to say the DJ Hero is being yes okay because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release I just sort of it's okay so yeah as of right now it is I mean who knows they could always change their mind just because they say oh we're never gonna do it again doesn't mean anything
6016294	6017736	Kelly Summer, CEO of Red Octane
6035153	6061492	basically says that Activision abused the property quote Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly they abused it there's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue it's a great product my gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero not every game can be a billion dollar franchise but maybe that's what Activision wants I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still a market for this product and then show them up
6062012	6064314	Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.
6064594	6066035	They haven't thrown products out there.
6066295	6070097	They've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still a strong franchise.
6070898	6074100	Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.
6074400	6080804	I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong with just putting out one game every couple or even three or four years.
6080864	6089830	If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around, I think.
6090430	6090871	I think so, too.
6092652	6097855	I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining, it is now out.
6098215	6101076	It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate.
6101637	6107179	And that is available for you to download on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.
6108080	6110881	The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what?
6111341	6111761	It's free.
6112041	6115263	And so if they need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.
6116163	6120645	You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes.
6120945	6124927	But if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.
6125307	6129990	You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.
6130390	6132231	I guess nothing is really for free, but hey.
6133791	6137573	I don't know about you guys, but I have an email address that I sign up for everything with.
6137653	6138814	It's not my regular email.
6140155	6145259	We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretel Bot Pack is now out for LittleBigPlanet 2.
6146260	6147761	So that is out there.
6147941	6155227	I guess there's this whole full story, cutscenes, voice acting, original score, prizes to get.
6155668	6157069	It's all available out there.
6157109	6159611	There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way.
6163394	6163835	DarkSakura Well
6192674	6198517	And this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.
6199278	6202900	Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch.
6204761	6208203	It is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes.
6210644	6211826	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6230194	6235738	So Dan the other day was talking about needing four more PS3s and monitors, and I said, no.
6236318	6242602	You spent $150 on your driving rig, plus a little bit extra getting those seats from the pick and pull, no.
6243583	6246545	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.
6247546	6253750	That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the five monitors.
6253770	6254751	It already had three monitors.
6254931	6257292	Well, there's actually a YouTube up of someone playing five monitored.
6257773	6259113	Five monitored, da, da, da, da, da.
6260214	6261094	It was pretty hot, actually.
6261434	6262495	But I'm like, no, don't need it.
6265155	6266896	So, Billy Mitchell.
6267836	6269136	He's such a jerk.
6270257	6272097	He just needs to go back to selling his damn barbecue sauce.
6273398	6276759	But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade.
6277139	6278899	It's at the Orlando International Airport.
6279839	6283500	And it looks very Donkey Kong-ish.
6284621	6285981	But there's no Donkey Kong machine anywhere.
6286141	6286481	and there.
6287982	6291785	Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score because Steve Wiebe was still better.
6291805	6294287	And don't forget there's a third guy now.
6294327	6296248	There's the dentist, Hank Shen.
6297129	6298350	And you know what else is funny too?
6298390	6300371	Apparently that arcade's been there for a while.
6300411	6302313	They just keep rebranding it as something else.
6302913	6331811	Yeah Well now we have Step Mania without a pad It's a Kinect hack Yay So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the pad You just play where you are I guess I'd have to see this in motion There's a video of it You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania I guess Good times
6336030	6336631	So yeah, that's it.
6368825	6371026	All right, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.
6371226	6379311	Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash OLR, and we read your tweets here on the show and respond to them as appropriate.
6379331	6382053	Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight?
6382073	6389297	We're going to start off with Blue Swim tonight tweets us, Did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?
6389838	6391799	Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?
6392259	6393560	I think you know where this is going.
6394251	6395052	Uh, no.
6395452	6398794	We actually did watch it today, and I have a word for the race, Rob.
6399794	6402296	Lusterfuck.
6402356	6405157	Seriously, that's what it was?
6405177	6410040	Because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance?
6410922	6416727	Yeah, but it was great, though, because they literally... It was like one of those things, you totally jinxed the race.
6416927	6422492	You know, they're all... Now, we've seen some pretty good driving today, all of a sudden, crash!
6422592	6425915	Like, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?
6427296	6428857	And then it was won by the 20-year-old guy.
6429258	6433661	It was like, well, with 50 laps down, there were...
6434982	6437124	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6465329	6466952	I still think that's pretty impressive.
6467733	6472178	But it's just because he was being smart and everybody else was like, oh, follow this guy.
6472198	6472298	So...
6474651	6475972	All right, moving on to some other tweets.
6476072	6477954	S2100 Matt sends us a couple stories.
6478014	6479735	I guess this is some big news out of New York City.
6480516	6485780	The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.
6486601	6489603	And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.
6490624	6491084	Let's see.
6491705	6495368	Several places are reporting this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.
6495908	6503893	Several places are reporting that Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.
6505494	6513039	According to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being in business and will be closing on the 23rd.
6513099	6515081	Not sure if that's this month or next month.
6515661	6539706	so wow that's crazy though because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting down over here so that's really sad that you know you have the west coast and the east coast big arcades just bam bam shutting down I'd heard about that arcade before I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some of the games so sad to hear it that's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too
6540786	6541026	Weird.
6541647	6543248	Just sad for arcades in general.
6543868	6548411	This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.
6548431	6550952	I guess they didn't have enough ticket-spinning machines.
6550972	6562299	Well, it's just they're not a draw for that shopping center or whatever, so they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center so they go spend money at those stores.
6563080	6565881	Or so people want to put stores into the shopping center.
6565901	6566202	Yeah.
6567142	6568743	Alright, TigerClaw sends us a tweet.
6568983	6572664	Can a controller be programmed to speedrun Super Mario Bros.?
6573445	6574885	Interesting.
6575225	6580588	It is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey website thingy they got now.
6580728	6584069	ca.kotaku.com Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?
6584149	6586790	No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.
6588451	6589332	so it's the old format.
6589392	6599076	Alright, well apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five minutes.
6600357	6604138	They are saying that the mod is real even though some people were calling it a fake.
6605519	6616725	I mean, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could plug this in and say, hey guys, look what I can do, and then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically, and it's actually doing the speedrun for you?
6617246	6619267	Like, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?
6619307	6621608	I think it's just because, hey, let's see if we can do this.
6622008	6622989	That's basically it.
6623249	6623469	Or that.
6623609	6623949	Or that.
6625710	6629192	Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say I've been a member of OLR since 2002.
6629372	6631593	Thanks for the awesome show, guys.
6631653	6632894	Wow, that's a very long time.
6632934	6636075	Thank you for listening that long.
6636115	6639897	We have a couple people tweeting us about this, so I should read this.
6639977	6646881	Both Defective Candy and Tigerclaw tweeted us this story, and it's about Mexico State Congress asks for a ban.
6648461	6649981	Call of Juarez the Cartel
6676886	6677407	Yeah, I kind of agree.
6677567	6678828	It's not that big of a game.
6678848	6679008	Yeah.
6695174	6698477	I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.
6699317	6719834	You know, and also, we have some listeners that live in Mexico, and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries anyway, because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something that does hit a little close to home.
6720879	6729102	One more tweet here from DarkTetsuya who tweets us saying, So it's a couple months till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.
6729622	6730883	I forgot WonderCon is coming up.
6730903	6732824	That's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?
6733684	6734684	April 1st through the 3rd?
6735405	6735645	Yes.
6735665	6736325	Sorry, I was yawning.
6736585	6737346	That's alright.
6737406	6738606	Second only to Comic-Con, right?
6739227	6739827	Yeah.
6740107	6745210	There might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long after Game Developers Conference before E3.
6745530	6745951	You never know.
6745991	6747531	Sometimes we see some game announcements.
6747551	6749733	It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.
6750213	6753415	I'm used to it being usually... You said it was in April?
6754315	6755276	April 1st through 3rd.
6755816	6758698	Usually it's around this time, to be honest.
6758758	6759218	February.
6759578	6760999	Moscone Center or nearby.
6762200	6763160	They must have bumped it out a little.
6763461	6763621	Yeah.
6764301	6765802	That's going to do it for Twitter this week.
6765882	6769343	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.
6770583	6772364	Let's move on with some more news.
6773645	6782828	Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking the PlayStation 3.
6783528	6787850	Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak.
6787990	6790211	Of course, multiple jailbreaks at this point.
6791882	6800708	The PlayStation Blog Post warns users, Notice unauthorized circumvention devices for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.
6801109	6805012	These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.
6805572	6817762	Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system, software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system, and code of conduct provisions.
6818882	6826664	Violation of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates the consumer's guarantee for that system.
6826784	6831766	In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright laws.
6832526	6847450	Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access to the PlayStation Network and access to Curiosity services through PlayStation 3 system terminated permanently.
6848030	6858947	To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.
6860732	6874556	Now, on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop using this modified property.
6874576	6876177	Change your ways or else.
6876537	6880198	You can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.
6880898	6886700	It's basically saying, obviously, that they don't want people doing that.
6887180	6887880	Or they'll ban you.
6889480	6896102	Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there.
6896782	6900784	A new hack that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.
6901824	6903964	The hack can also be used to ban another console.
6904025	6914748	All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a refurb warehouse or a second-hand seller or some idiot that's willing to give up that information.
6916088	6917969	It's kind of funny.
6919470	6931997	And then finally, Geohot, or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony, has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.
6932438	6935199	And now what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?
6935219	6937060	Yeah, but this is not for him.
6937401	6942684	It's going strictly to his... He got his lawyers okay for it, so it must be all right.
6943324	6945986	Donations here are for legal defense only.
6946186	6948128	I have checked with my lawyers before setting this up.
6948268	6952631	If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.
6965881	6977613	They tried to sue a guy for getting his AIBO to run non-Sony approved tricks, making it apparent that they don't really care about privacy, they care about control.
6978754	6984140	And they also said Sony vs. Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about that.
6984600	6988081	And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's an advocate against mass piracy.
6988181	6990901	He does not distribute any copyrighted work but his own.
6991641	6993762	And he says he's not going to take this crap lying down.
6994302	6998222	And he's even pro-DRM in a sense.
6999223	7004843	And he says, why should I care about your personal legal troubles?
7004883	7005384	You shouldn't.
7006044	7012465	And he says, if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never ask for donations.
7014166	7015853	I see what that's a dig at.
7016456	7017922	Uh, Nero, um...
7019878	7020558	Let's see here.
7022119	7024799	Well, let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there.
7025699	7027000	I don't want to beat this issue to death.
7027060	7030260	It's come up on almost every episode for the past few weeks about this whole issue.
7030720	7037622	But it does seem that this is moving faster in a legal sense than these types of stories usually do.
7037642	7043243	Because I'm about to get into another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year now.
7043263	7044183	Well, you've got enough money.
7044243	7046264	You can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.
7046624	7047445	Wow.
7047765	7049567	That's kind of the worry.
7050287	7052489	His thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?
7052649	7061037	It says, let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology on the PlayStation blog for ever removing it.
7061297	7063639	It'd be good PR for Sony and Lord knows they could use it.
7064079	7064920	And I want an AIBO.
7066942	7068844	Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.
7069064	7070625	Those batteries are fickle as shit.
7072487	7072567	Um...
7075715	7076656	Let's see here.
7077437	7079459	It says, Donate to help you.
7079499	7081641	You're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.
7082081	7082802	No, I'm not.
7084043	7086545	Kakaroto explains this really well.
7086565	7094553	It says, I have never played the PS3 online ever and frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.
7094593	7099137	Security 101 is why is the security in the client anyways?
7099637	7100978	I had no idea this would happen.
7101278	7105800	I am in full support of the cheaters being permabanned from the PlayStation Network.
7106580	7115243	So, you know, long story short, basically, he needs money, and obviously he feels that he did nothing wrong, and he very well may have done nothing wrong.
7115323	7126348	It's just, you know, Sony owns your system, according to them, and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that you purchased.
7126828	7128209	And really, the stuff that he did...
7129429	7129709	and DarkSakura.
7152816	7154716	Let me get to this comment from chat.
7155077	7160738	I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week.
7160818	7164199	However, I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Buster in the chat room.
7164599	7171180	Whatever happened to when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key gen tunes as their only signature?
7171601	7173261	Some of those tunes were actually pretty good too.
7175250	7176911	There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff.
7176931	7178652	A lot of people want fame.
7180313	7190400	I think once he hacked the iPod and iOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff, that whole thing became kind of legal now.
7190440	7192081	I think it's gone to his head a little bit.
7192701	7194702	Oh, well, let's crack the Uncrackable type thing.
7195603	7196283	But I don't know.
7196924	7197184	I don't know.
7198968	7201991	Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.
7202471	7206716	This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides in this case, I don't know.
7207416	7211180	But this is about, remember this, No Doubt vs. Guitar Hero.
7212501	7215704	Or should I say Band Hero specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.
7216505	7218627	No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.
7219148	7222471	Well, according to a recent report in the LA Times,
7223071	7245802	a panel of judges has agreed with a lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit by no doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from like Taylor Swift and
7246062	7252126	It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do Flava Flav or whatever.
7252246	7260352	Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain why Guitar Hero went really wrong.
7261172	7262773	And it's not the lawsuits.
7263394	7264394	I'm not saying that.
7264734	7266976	I'm saying that this whole like...
7269179	7271800	Lack of care for the material?
7272861	7284526	I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the fine print or whatever.
7284966	7289848	They assumed that something was going to happen with their characters only singing their own songs and stuff like that.
7290268	7298037	But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists in their games?
7298218	7302943	I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.
7303043	7304645	It's your own created characters.
7305066	7306728	Why do you even need these in there?
7307128	7310312	That's more my point, actually, was kind of what I was getting at.
7310692	7336128	and you know it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time I think the first time we went over this story I probably had said something like you know well they should have probably read the fine print but now looking back on how Guitar Hero has you know essentially failed at this point you kind of go well maybe this really isn't what the game should have been doing in the first place say no doubt and Courtney Love I'm sure are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever their image and their license or their
7337217	7350391	So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists.
7351412	7352013	Like, I don't know.
7354422	7356303	Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.
7356823	7357704	Perhaps, perhaps.
7358624	7360645	Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?
7360785	7364027	I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.
7364507	7365168	She's got paternity ones.
7365208	7366548	She fights with her kid all the time.
7366568	7369150	She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems.
7369570	7370350	You know, gosh.
7371351	7373532	And then she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.
7374412	7376273	A lawyer for her Twitter feed.
7376613	7380615	They should make a Pokemon-style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.
7381076	7381856	Got to catch them all.
7383248	7385090	Real estate attorney, I choose you.
7386491	7387472	Protect my house.
7389734	7391716	Contracting lawyer, I choose you.
7391996	7393137	Fix my air conditioning.
7394739	7395179	I love it.
7396981	7398662	A Pokemon game based around lawyers.
7398723	7399723	I think we're on to something.
7400284	7401645	For now, though, how about another news story?
7401665	7402306	Gotta sue them all.
7404193	7406254	Well, I like Sega.
7406934	7409995	I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega, or at least something Sega's done.
7410055	7410955	Me, I hate them.
7411375	7412155	Bite my butt.
7413656	7418777	So there is going to be, for the PCs, Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.
7419237	7426500	That's 46 of the Sega Genesis's diseases games, and it will be out on March 15th.
7428540	7429481	Sorry for the list.
7430281	7433624	We have Volume 1, which has a bunch of stuff, and 2, and 3, and 4.
7435245	7436386	No, seriously, I'll run through the list.
7436406	7444111	There's Golden Axe, Altered Beast, Comic Zone, Echo the Dolphin, Gang Ground, Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master, Vector Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crackdown, and Space Harrier 2.
7444231	7451756	Volume 2, Echo Jr., Fatal Labyrinth, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Bonanza Brothers, Super Thunder Blade, East Sweat City Under Siege, Kid Chameleon, Ristar,
7452677	7464065	Golden Axe 2, Galaxy Force 2, Columns, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Volume 3, Biohazard Battle Columns 3, Revenge of Columns, Sword of Vermilion, Virtua Fighter 2, Echo of the Tides of Time, Alien Storm, Decap Attack, Flicky, Sonic 3, and Knuckles Sonic Spinball.
7464465	7475493	And Volume 4, Landstalker, Shining Force, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, aka Puyo Puyo, Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2, Alien Soldier, Light Crusader, Sonic 3D Blast, Gunstar Heroes, Woohoo!
7475933	7480056	Shining Force 2, Shining in the Darkness, ToeJam & Earl, and ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkadron.
7481863	7500535	Micromachines Seriously, dang Alright I like Micromachines They don't make enough games based on them John Machida's dead That's because he talked too fast He got all the words out that he could possibly say As nice as that collection sounds
7501525	7507548	I don't know, this Genesis nostalgia I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth Aren't you starting to get to that point?
7507628	7526618	Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever I don't think, you really don't need much more than that As far as Genesis nostalgia goes It's not one of our stories that was for tonight That's okay The PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus, whatever They were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March
7527538	7535024	They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs for one to three bucks a piece.
7535424	7536645	And there's a lot of them up there now.
7536685	7539527	And it's like, this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks.
7539647	7540988	Sure, you got some money to burn.
7541529	7543230	Pick up a few, you know, a Phantasy Star 2.
7543270	7545732	But it's like, all right, how many of these are they going to put out?
7545812	7549795	This is going to run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.
7549995	7551496	They've got full packs out.
7551977	7553979	You can download different packs of the games.
7554099	7559023	In my case, it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis.
7559844	7563847	So if I really want to play it, I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.
7566469	7569952	Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.
7570793	7571754	And honestly, I mean...
7574230	7588674	I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.
7589554	7592655	I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things.
7593435	7596436	I mean, dozens and dozens and dozens of times.
7596696	7602317	And I just, I don't feel any remorse for downloading a ROM that's
7604449	7612485	20 years old alright well let's move on with another story and we'll get to the mailbag pretty soon here
7613171	7622618	Well, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but that does not mean that the music genre is dead.
7622958	7628682	Oh no, dance games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.
7628902	7633786	They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in...
7634526	7639650	I guess $809 million in total software sales, up 21% from 2009.
7640911	7646255	And 60% of that, of course, was in North America.
7647076	7661287	Of course, during the three-month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience, or Just Dance Michael Jackson.
7662788	7666092	and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway.
7666953	7667974	All pretty similar titles.
7669275	7672278	That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that.
7672378	7676062	And I can't believe how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii.
7676122	7677323	It's just kind of crazy.
7679346	7684231	Of course, next month, Just Dance on... Let's see, I caught myself saying that.
7684731	7688893	Dance on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with Move support.
7689934	7693236	Or actually, Move required, I guess.
7693336	7696357	I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?
7697098	7697658	No, I do not.
7698979	7702441	There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii.
7703141	7708745	And this is going to add, I guess, some new duet choreography.
7709806	7721194	And for 300 Wii Points, you can download YOY by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.
7723379	7725360	Super Freak by Rick James and Sheiks LeFreak
7753009	7759857	Also, of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amory, heard them all.
7762179	7762680	Those are each $3.
7762720	7762940	Alright.
7768826	7771007	Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.
7771667	7773547	People like to shake their butt.
7773667	7778449	Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games are dead, and then it's like, oh wait, another news.
7778509	7792113	I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision, because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping on that bandwagon.
7795965	7798826	Some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.
7798886	7810111	There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move, but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal 2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.
7810912	7817755	It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.
7818035	7818635	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7836664	7865455	and basically at the end of the day they announced Portal 2 is available for pre-order now and I was kind of like well duh I mean like if you want to go into GameStop they'll take your five bucks to pre-order Portal 5 I mean you know seems a little weird that they'd announce that but maybe through the official Valve channels or what have you it's available now I don't really know so there you go Portal 2 coming out soon and I know I'm excited about it I can't wait for that to come out
7866294	7869496	Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag, right?
7869516	7870537	We're going to go to the mailbag.
7870957	7871958	You guys send us emails.
7872338	7873639	We answer them here on the show.
7874259	7878902	DarkSakura is going to dive into the email bag and find some of her favorite emails to respond to right now.
7881924	7883625	I was just taking care of some business.
7884346	7884766	No problem.
7888513	7890655	So, first email, we actually got three.
7891155	7894478	We have one that says, Greetings, OLR.
7894518	7895860	This is my second email of the week.
7896000	7896620	Quick question.
7897001	7900724	I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.
7901164	7901965	What is going on here?
7902005	7905508	Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their games?
7906029	7912634	I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.
7913035	7915337	Your loyal turtle in Philly, SeriousTurtle.
7918075	7926680	I'm sorry, I missed something about the... With Crysis 2 and Black Ops in those games being $60, why are they raising their prices when more people are going to hold out for sales?
7927701	7935705	Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.
7936285	7937766	A huge sale on Steam this weekend.
7938386	7938546	So...
7941328	7944110	I would say, well, how long have those games been out?
7944130	7945270	Because Bulletstorm is new, right?
7945290	7946411	Yeah, Bulletstorm is brand new.
7946591	7952655	But I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.
7952855	7963821	Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA, Activision, have decided, hey, you know what?
7963981	7967263	Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it warrants a $60 price point.
7969469	7974591	Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on the Wii.
7974791	7984934	They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics and support on the download side, so, eh.
7986361	8012815	I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers are just going to have their MSRP $59.99 they don't care what platform even on a digital service like Steam where it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved they'll just set their price to whatever they want keep it uniform I can see where the emailer is probably getting a little bit frustrated that you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later but what can you do
8013703	8017249	Alright, let's go on to the next email.
8017975	8021096	Okay, the next email up is this one.
8021416	8023316	Hi LLR, I don't have much to say this week.
8023396	8025497	I'm moving to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic.
8025857	8028438	But I suppose I should make this at least a bit game related.
8028478	8030578	So what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?
8031079	8034700	Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.
8035420	8037060	On a side note, can I plug my new blog?
8037420	8037720	Sure.
8038541	8047063	It's moggysmusings.blogspot.com So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.
8047363	8050167	I think there was a really good tweet from that.
8050187	8051909	It's a really similar name that I liked.
8052190	8054453	I had retweeted it on OLR.
8055074	8058598	Since I kind of already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add.
8058739	8060802	I think it's going to be a nice pairing.
8062464	8064727	I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.
8065356	8068999	Yeah, I want to see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having the license.
8069219	8072622	I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel-shaded.
8073322	8075644	But other than that, thumbs up.
8076124	8081088	You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the original.
8081808	8084791	But you kind of go, if anything's going to be good...
8086337	8088979	It'll be this from the professional angle.
8089139	8090841	I understand there's still the fan game.
8091161	8093443	And of course, the game is going to be in good hands with fans.
8093923	8096265	But, you know, that's different.
8097086	8099268	So how about the next email?
8100248	8102209	Yes, this is our last email of the night.
8102729	8102989	Alrighty.
8103690	8106171	I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.
8106511	8108792	It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.
8108972	8116015	One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7 where the author goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.
8116855	8118036	Listen on the podcast every week.
8118116	8119336	Congrats on 400 eps.
8119396	8119776	Take care.
8119856	8120157	Wendy.
8120497	8121097	Thank you, Wendy.
8121889	8123772	Are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?
8123832	8124753	Maybe a cheap plug?
8124793	8125174	I don't know.
8125334	8125875	I'm just kidding.
8126035	8126516	I'm kidding.
8126536	8126757	Yeah.
8127337	8130402	Well, I would definitely check out the book.
8130442	8134368	I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse.
8134989	8135110	So...
8136519	8137080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8173544	8180367	My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.
8181948	8183468	So, fuck you to my headache.
8184169	8184829	That's really it.
8188490	8188951	Uh, Loki?
8190491	8194473	Um, empty McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.
8198581	8214972	my FU of the week goes to being so sore pain hurts ow my legs just hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting or whatever be careful SalaciousPop do you have any FUs?
8215052	8215473	any angst?
8216974	8227701	FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department alright that does it for the FUs of the week
8229116	8229659	Let's move on.
8229699	8231104	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
8231124	8232892	Then we're going to get to the phone lines.
8232992	8234458	And I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.
8234619	8234799	Loki.
8235800	8236261	Ah, yes.
8237422	8239023	This is kind of interesting, I guess.
8239543	8245108	They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.
8246009	8248331	It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote.
8248351	8261341	They were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360-type control and stuff.
8261361	8261862	For example...
8262342	8263784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8280220	8294644	Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls to aim at the player.
8295024	8299866	So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect and Xbox 360.
8300166	8302506	It's an interesting idea.
8302986	8305147	I mean, if they can implement it well.
8308436	8309077	Interesting.
8309417	8310959	I guess that's all I can really say about that.
8310999	8314843	Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what have you.
8316084	8317245	It would be neat.
8317405	8325233	They could do something even simple like being able to level up the characters or something like that when they're not playing the game.
8327175	8328557	Toss stuff back and forth, data.
8331215	8343046	it always kind of reminds me for some reason of the pocket station days I don't know what it is but kind of that whole like you have it on your TV and then you have it in your pocket and whatever else I don't know
8345370	8347271	I wonder where my pocket station went.
8347812	8348772	Did you actually own one of those?
8348852	8349473	Yeah, I had one.
8349493	8356117	Remember I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop courses on the fly.
8356818	8358519	Oh yeah, that's right.
8358739	8368485	Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because it got like four songs versus three songs if I paid for the fourth mix stuff.
8368505	8373629	So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you go.
8373889	8374750	Plus my edits were on there.
8374770	8375290	So that's fun.
8377592	8378813	Of course there is...
8408885	8409605	It's going to be awesome.
8409645	8411467	I hope it's still Yuzo Fushiro doing all the music.
8411507	8412347	It sure sounds like it.
8413448	8423994	Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU 2011, but Bandai Namco has unveiled the website for the game.
8424494	8433080	It is coming out, and they're saying it will be sometime before you get to play it, but it will be the Wangan Maxi of the future and worth the wait.
8435821	8436482	Whatever that means.
8437816	8438797	I'm just excited for the soundtrack.
8438817	8440657	It's been a while since they had a game, right?
8441398	8441578	Yeah.
8441898	8442398	It has been a while.
8444159	8444439	All right.
8446761	8448341	Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?
8448361	8450482	We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.
8450542	8455845	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8455965	8458566	So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.
8459447	8463649	So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last minute stories tonight?
8463809	8466331	Yeah, sure, we can talk about Pixel Force Head to Head.
8466872	8477701	It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, the guy that brought us all the 8-bit kind of Left 4 Dead, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.
8478161	8483826	Well, this one, they've got brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting game, including like...
8484827	8492793	Rio from Street Fighter Wolverine from Marvel Scorpion 30 different characters you can play as Castlevania
8508783	8510424	All right, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
8510764	8511745	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8511765	8512105	Who's this?
8512685	8515127	Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Ranma.
8515547	8516447	Hey, Ranma, what's on your mind?
8517088	8517648	Not too much.
8517688	8524172	I just got back from Katzikon, but I didn't call to give my con review, but I have a question for all three of you.
8524392	8524892	Sure, what's up?
8525793	8526093	Okay.
8526573	8534077	Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console is the games for it, correct?
8534698	8535018	Yes.
8535038	8535098	Yes.
8536114	8540795	I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy and he's like, you're incorrect.
8540995	8542376	It's the marketing behind it.
8542876	8551938	Now, even I find it hard to believe because I feel that there have been games that have been marketed out like a cheap whore and it still has failed to get the numbers.
8552558	8556179	So, do you believe more if it's the games or the marketing?
8556299	8559740	And if so, what games failed on the marketing aspect?
8562216	8562476	Rock Band 3
8581315	8607803	if you want me to go for a bigger title because I don't know we just didn't see Rock Band it wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles and I don't know if that's just because people were over it or what the deal is but yeah I'd have to say that okay I agree with that because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as I was anticipating it and I turned around I'm like it's out but I really didn't see any advertising for it yeah right
8609747	8617031	And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.
8617051	8622875	Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch too, I thought we had a story last week that that game sold like a million copies or something.
8624235	8624916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8643733	8648998	It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge was kind of a popular game, at least I always thought.
8649499	8653223	And it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would.
8653623	8654924	So just kind of surprising.
8656546	8657006	All right.
8657767	8666916	So I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console.
8669770	8671891	I think marketing kind of goes a long way.
8672151	8675972	I think that's probably why the Wii did so well.
8677213	8679133	I think was kind of the way it was marketed.
8679533	8688216	But I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either a good product or a bad product.
8688896	8696499	And what I mean by that is that you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale.
8696919	8698900	But at the end of the day, a turd is still a turd.
8699660	8700901	I've heard that plenty of times.
8701921	8716689	I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business and it just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say it stinks and could cause a possible chain reaction.
8720284	8720745	Perhaps.
8721606	8723368	Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.
8724430	8732081	The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system's only as good as the games that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch titles.
8732121	8733423	Does this make me a giant hypocrite?
8734594	8735574	No, not necessarily.
8735694	8737275	I think you kind of follow along with me.
8737335	8744777	It's like you feel your inner child because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?
8745357	8750859	I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA and I still haven't finished it yet.
8751219	8754400	When I first got it, I knocked that game on about five weeks.
8755040	8755220	Mm-hmm.
8756485	8759126	I got to tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.
8759446	8765048	Actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and looking at the 3D pictures.
8765528	8767869	Like, I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.
8767889	8769009	I think that's going to be kind of awesome.
8769410	8770590	Just to kind of show it off, too.
8770650	8772311	You know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures.
8772811	8778793	And I'm hoping Nintendo does a smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way we can do that.
8780221	8781323	Perhaps, perhaps.
8781904	8785971	Plus, I also hope that I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.
8786953	8788115	Yeah.
8788797	8790500	Alright, well, anything else on your mind, Ranma?
8791792	8792652	No, that's it.
8793313	8793573	All right.
8793593	8794273	Well, take care, Ranma.
8794353	8794773	Have a good one.
8794793	8795294	Thanks for the call.
8795314	8795754	You too, Andrew.
8795934	8796194	Laters.
8796374	8797655	Bye.
8797675	8801396	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8802777	8806279	Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.
8806839	8807839	Yeah, I'll take it.
8809200	8810640	It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.
8813462	8813782	All right.
8814062	8816083	Any other last-minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?
8817027	8817988	Yeah, one last one here.
8818548	8823410	There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.
8824311	8828493	It is a game called Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.
8828653	8831855	Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.
8832035	8833515	Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.
8833535	8835516	I thought you were saying Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.
8835556	8838238	No, that's the full name of the game.
8838278	8839718	Yeah, it's Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee Pee.
8839779	8840079	Okay.
8840679	8844561	But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Pee's.
8845341	8856147	Anyways, so it is a game that's played with vocal input and you can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic.
8856507	8863792	The titles co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises like pew pew pew pew pew pew pew.
8868794	8870435	You gotta love the indie marketplace.
8870915	8873497	They have a trailer for it too which people are playing it.
8880579	8882140	Is there video?
8882200	8882860	Is that like real video?
8882880	8891846	Yeah, it looks like... Yeah, we can't hear any of that.
8892026	8896128	I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to that Technokitten Adventure.
8897189	8908236	Basically, there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks and then you scream into it to cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks.
8910512	8912274	Wave of the future, ladies and gentlemen.
8913136	8913877	Wave of the future.
8914578	8915439	Let's go to another call.
8915479	8916360	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
8916380	8916740	Who's this?
8918122	8919264	Hi, this is Gamer Girl.
8919504	8920205	Hi, Gamer Girl.
8920225	8920786	What's on your mind?
8921647	8922108	Nothing much.
8922128	8924230	Have you guys played the game...
8928840	8956768	um there's a game called um Assassin's Creed Legacy on Facebook uh no I have not played the Facebook game I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games what's the what's what's the Facebook game all about um it's kind of like Knights of the Clicky it's pretty cool yeah yeah um I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the Clicky it's pretty fun is it one of those games where it's really easy to uh spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff yeah it's pretty cool
8959160	8960681	What do you think of Facebook games?
8960701	8962742	Do you think it really is the wave of the future?
8964603	8966544	It's kind of addicting, actually.
8968205	8972448	If you're not careful, you can kind of get addicted to it.
8974699	8979641	Yeah, I was playing that Knights of the Clique game, which is so ridiculous for a while.
8979821	8981801	And I don't know, one day I just kind of stopped.
8981861	8982762	Isn't that kind of what happened with you?
8982782	8983942	Yeah, it ran out of steam with me too.
8984182	8984722	Same with you, DarkSakura.
8984742	8986943	I haven't touched it in ages.
8987243	8988304	I haven't touched it in like two weeks.
8988344	8989524	I just finally gave up.
8989564	8991565	I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore.
8992205	8994467	Do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?
8994807	9002732	Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy when I was moving around.
9003753	9005934	I looked in the case and it was actually cracked.
9007195	9008916	So I had to re-buy the other one.
9009076	9011978	How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?
9012038	9016081	Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game?
9016141	9017742	Or does it kind of tie into that story?
9018123	9023066	Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed's graphics?
9024868	9027250	It kind of makes you want to play the original game.
9027990	9032554	Even though it's not really tied into the game itself, the original game.
9033214	9034915	It's more like a standalone.
9035696	9035836	Right.
9038155	9042217	I want to say somebody I knew was playing that on Facebook.
9042237	9044738	Has this been open a long time, like about six months or so?
9045058	9046259	Or did it just recently open?
9046799	9047579	Probably.
9047859	9049540	I just found out about it yesterday.
9051101	9053842	Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?
9053862	9058904	Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook.
9059304	9059944	It had a title.
9059964	9061085	I can't remember the full title.
9061465	9080805	but uh because it seems like it's going to buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars that it might actually be the game of civilization it might be simplified a lot but I think that might be a lot of fun um right now I like playing you know um Knights of the Clicky um Chocobo's Crystal Tower oh yeah it's kind of confusing but yeah there's
9085356	9089879	Alright, well, Gamer Girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?
9090099	9091640	Do those games make you less depressed?
9091660	9092481	No.
9092681	9093701	Keep up the good work, guys.
9093922	9097364	Wait, Gamer Girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?
9098951	9106941	Actually, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot-em-up games, like, whatever.
9108542	9112908	Call of Duty, or like something with zombies in it.
9114289	9115491	I made a game with zombies in it.
9116852	9118594	I like watching their brains spew out.
9120925	9122986	Oh, and then, let's see.
9124607	9126408	I had a game, but I forgot the name of it.
9127249	9127649	It's all good.
9127669	9128089	Oh, Resident Evil.
9128529	9129450	Oh, Resident Evil, there you go.
9129590	9129770	Yeah.
9130090	9130991	More zombie killing.
9131531	9131831	All right.
9132391	9133892	You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich.
9135802	9139763	Alright, Gamer Girl, we're going to let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call.
9140363	9140723	You're welcome.
9140823	9141743	Take care, have a wonderful night.
9142363	9143564	You too.
9143584	9147224	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to call us, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9148144	9149905	Any other last minute stories over there from Loki?
9150165	9150325	Nope.
9151445	9153085	Oh, how am I supposed to fill time until the next call?
9153946	9154446	Uh, I don't know.
9155846	9156866	We can make up news.
9156906	9158686	Let's see if there's any new stories.
9159467	9160907	Anything that recently happened?
9160927	9161467	Uh,
9164309	9167272	Nanostray developer working on title for the 3DS.
9167973	9170655	Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game.
9174259	9175720	Maybe we can make some stories up.
9176361	9182787	Well, how about there was the little Big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?
9183368	9184148	Yeah, I was covered.
9184268	9185049	I talked about the patch.
9185289	9186549	No, it's a little bit earlier in the show.
9186830	9187810	Black Ops Zombies.
9188050	9189070	Hold on, we're getting another call.
9189211	9189851	Woo, saved.
9190151	9191051	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9191071	9191411	Who's this?
9192412	9194393	Hey, this is Amiga777.
9194453	9195933	Amiga777.
9195953	9196634	What's on your mind, buddy?
9197934	9210240	Hey, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering, have you guys heard about that latest Mario Sports Mix game that was supposed to be coming up?
9210300	9211000	I don't know, like
9211697	9214979	From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago.
9215219	9219821	I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game.
9221521	9223582	Okay.
9223822	9225043	What were your thoughts on it?
9227328	9233371	To me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash-in to the whole Wii Sports craze.
9233771	9240573	It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock-offs games, a la, I don't know, Deka Sports or whatever.
9240954	9244295	The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit.
9244335	9255079	Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games, you know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, or whatever the hell they were calling it.
9255299	9256240	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9271059	9278124	I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing, which was like a PS1 Mario Kart ripoff with Final Fantasy characters.
9278544	9285789	I really wish that would come out on the store because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got.
9285889	9287871	So yeah, that was awesome.
9288211	9288832	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9308770	9313813	This will be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach.
9314133	9320657	But as far as the hardcore game goes, if you're just kind of a solo player, I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.
9321418	9322959	I think your money might be better spent somewhere else.
9323879	9324180	Right.
9325780	9332364	Okay, I mean, I looked at an article online about it some time ago, and...
9333683	9336506	The critics were just ripping it to shreds.
9354604	9374837	DarkTetsuya in our chatroom does tell us though it is Mario curling if you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario you can get that I thought Mario curling was not in that but was in the stupid Sonic vs. Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing I don't think curling is in this new one I'm reading that from chat so you could be right
9375759	9377440	I mean, I could be wrong.
9377580	9387006	I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis, dodgeball, maybe paintball.
9388447	9392069	But, you know, it's whatever.
9392109	9394491	I mean, we're not the target audience.
9395431	9404357	So I got to ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too because of everything you've read?
9406115	9413953	Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that as I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time.
9414134	9415777	Oh, well, then it makes the decision pretty easy.
9417406	9436641	But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article that Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept to, I guess, Square Enix, who was already kind of already in some...
9437901	9449728	Hotwater, and a number of other things like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV, which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet.
9450168	9452430	What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?
9455231	9455712	I don't know.
9458213	9459214	Rise games?
9461148	9461568	The games?
9461668	9463389	Oh no, it's fine.
9465330	9469692	I just need to make a decent income in order to get one at this time.
9469712	9470493	I gotcha.
9470513	9472974	Yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy.
9473954	9474214	Alright.
9474655	9475095	It's a bummer.
9475646	9478269	All right, well, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can go and wrap up the show.
9478549	9479530	But thank you so much for the call.
9480512	9480852	Bye-bye.
9481192	9483315	Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there.
9483555	9485537	It's a whopping four.
9487500	9490863	Ooh, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball.
9491284	9491584	That's it.
9492866	9493066	Huh.
9496507	9498689	Yeah, I didn't think it was a lot of games.
9498749	9500731	It wasn't like DECA Sports where there was a whole ton of them.
9500771	9502552	It was just, you know, a few.
9503032	9504354	But there you go.
9505274	9507336	All right, well, that is going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9507536	9509137	So sorry to those folks that didn't get through.
9509478	9513801	But, you know, you can always send us an email or contact us in other ways.
9515262	9517783	Chat Room, Twitter, etc, etc.
9518623	9520144	We'll be back to do it again next week.
9520564	9529147	But since I believe we did all the final thoughts, I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight, it's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show.
9529528	9532389	So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight.
9532869	9538231	I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half, as you always do, so thank you for being here.
9538331	9538631	Thank you.
9539011	9540512	And do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
9540772	9542333	We didn't nap today, and I can feel it.
9543653	9547036	Wait a minute, no, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show.
9547416	9548217	20 minutes is not a nap.
9548797	9549278	It is for me.
9549638	9552060	All right, I'll go ahead and give my final thought.
9552120	9557564	My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show.
9557604	9562348	I mean, I love the live listeners and everything, but if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close.
9562448	9563909	I'm just saying, just saying.
9563990	9565210	It's Baskin Robbins around the corner.
9565491	9565911	That's true.
9566692	9568233	DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.
9568513	9569715	My head hurts so bad.
9570437	9571338	Oh, sorry to hear it.
9572100	9574364	And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?
9574584	9575566	I hope this mod works.
9576599	9577740	Oh dear, I wonder what this is.
9578260	9579981	What is this mod going to do, dare I ask?
9580722	9593950	Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get a process to it because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online and have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto.
9593970	9600413	I'm talking about map mods right now because I've done map mods before, but I have a new method of doing them and...
9601714	9610423	The previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work and I've tried this before and I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work and who knows.
9610723	9613186	Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn.
9615114	9615435	All right.
9616516	9620080	Well, that's going to do it tonight for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
