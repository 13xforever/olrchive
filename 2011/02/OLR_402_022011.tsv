0	19160	Today, February 20th, 2011, could a PlayStation gaming tablet be in the future?
19160	21920	Copycats cause problems on Apple's App Store.
21920	31920	Is PC piracy really in decline?
31920	35520	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35520	39040	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39040	43400	It is episode number 402 for February 20th, 2011.
43400	46840	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome
46840	47840	co-hosts.
47840	51440	Say hello over there to Ms. Ms. Jamie Summers.
51440	52440	I love pitas.
52440	53440	How are you?
53440	54440	Full of pitas.
54440	55440	Pita filled?
55440	58520	We are having the best pitas tonight.
58520	61280	You know when you say that really fast, it sounds a little dirty.
61280	62280	Falafel.
62280	65160	Falafel is kind of a dirty word too, I don't know why.
65160	66160	Falafels are delicious.
66160	67880	I'm going to go have another.
67880	71280	One of the things, one of the nice things I can say about Final Fantasy XIV is that
71280	73840	one of the races in it was like a lollafel or something they were called.
73840	77520	I just called them falafels cause they're adorable and cute like falafels.
77520	79160	You know who really likes falafels?
79160	82040	Yes, Salacious Pop, our guest tonight who's speaking early.
82040	83040	Yes, Salacious Pop.
83040	87720	Bill O'Reilly loves falafels.
87720	90080	Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.
90080	91080	Hi.
91080	92440	How are you doing, Loki?
92440	93960	I'm doing good.
93960	96400	Alright, falafel filled in your world?
96400	97400	I don't know.
97400	99400	I don't know what to ask.
99400	100400	Sure.
100400	101400	Okay, there you go.
101400	102640	What was the dinner of choice tonight?
102640	103640	I'll ask this.
103640	104640	Ah, just crappy McDonald's.
104640	107340	I wasn't really that hungry but I knew if I didn't eat anything I'd be hungry later
107340	112880	so I just, I had a quarter pounder and it wasn't very good and the fries aren't very
112880	117720	good but I kind of expect in the evening that the fries are never good.
117720	122160	Any McDonald's you go to so it was just, I don't know.
122160	126440	Orange Lounge Foodio, you know we always talk about video games here on Orange Lounge Radio
126440	129360	but a lot of the times we also talk about food.
129360	133520	Also joining us tonight, as you already know, is the one and only Salacious Pop here in
133520	134520	studio.
134520	135520	I'm sorry for speaking out of turn.
135520	136520	I know.
136520	137520	Please don't beat me.
137520	140560	You need to be holding the cheer stick if you want to speak.
140560	143960	Hello, what's up?
143960	144960	How's your week going?
144960	145960	Good.
145960	146960	Yeah?
146960	147960	Yeah.
147960	148960	I have pita so it's a lot better now.
148960	151080	Why don't you tell the audience about what you and I did yesterday and why I'm now a
151080	152400	65 year old man.
152400	153960	I can't move today.
153960	159520	We ran around doing a local version of the Amazing Race scavenger hunt.
159520	164400	It was just between about 15 or 16 friends all within Sacramento downtown.
164400	168720	By the way, no charity, no organization.
168720	169720	Just because we can.
169720	170720	We're bored.
170720	171720	Yeah.
171720	174400	When people get this bored, then this is what we come up with.
174400	178480	Lots of running, of course, because you've got to beat the other teams, you know.
178480	180920	Can't let them win over you.
180920	182840	So yeah, lots of running up and down stairs.
182840	189520	There was a competition where we had to throw horseshoes, play horseshoes and get two ringers.
189520	191120	Lots of running back and forth.
191120	197360	And now Rob is in muscle agony because he's out of shape to the point to where he's hobbling
197360	199920	and can't sit up without help.
199920	200920	It's like I'm a gamer.
200920	202760	I don't do physical activity, you know.
202760	203760	This is too much.
203760	206520	That's such a gift for not playing any more DDR.
206520	210040	But I have half a Vicodin so I'm feeling a lot better after that.
210040	213280	Because Vicodin doesn't take care of the pain, it just makes you not care.
213280	214280	Exactly.
214280	215280	That's exactly what it is.
215280	217600	I just don't care anymore.
217600	221160	But believe it or not, Salacious Pop and I were not a team.
221160	222440	We were on opposing teams.
222440	226340	I was with Lady Victoria, who I don't think has been on this show in years, but she was
226340	227840	on a few times in the past.
227840	229360	I think she filled in for you one time.
229360	230920	Her and Irene were on a show.
230920	233400	But Victoria and I were a team and we came in second.
233400	234400	Woo!
234400	235400	So it was fun.
235400	236400	Yeah.
236400	240000	And after the first and second place was decided, the other teams were like, all right, we have
240000	241000	the winner and the runner up.
241000	242360	We're not doing this shit anymore.
242360	243360	We're done.
243360	245940	The rest of you are too far behind.
245940	246940	The end.
246940	247940	Yeah.
247940	248940	I had a good time.
248940	252640	And I will say this, it was more fun than the Amazing Race game on the Wii.
252640	255520	So doing the Amazing Race game for real was fun.
255520	259960	But about an equal level of the Amazing Race slot machine.
259960	264640	I don't know how many y'all have casinos in your neck of the woods or even old enough
264640	269800	to gamble, but there's Amazing Race slot machines now and they're kind of fun, actually.
269800	273600	I want Amazing Race slot cars.
273600	274800	I'm surprised that's a hobby.
274800	277800	Four of us aren't into a slot car because I always kind of walk by the stores and go,
277800	278800	ooh, that's cool.
278800	280000	I used to love those when I was a kid too.
280000	287160	The hobby store that will dance into doing the RC trucks, the rock crawlers in the cars.
287160	291320	And one of the places he goes to has full slot car sets.
291320	294560	Like with everything and you just build your own car and then you can rent it on the slot
294560	295560	sets.
295560	296560	Good tie.
296560	301040	Aren't there slot car racers on various consoles as well?
301040	304320	I think I want to say there was at least like a Micro Machines game.
304320	311600	The typhoon thing, the simulator at Dave & Buster's that has a pinball table in there.
311600	314080	They have a slot car thing in there.
314080	315080	Oh, fun.
315080	316080	Nice.
316080	317080	Going to our chat room.
317080	321200	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern and AllGames.com
321200	322680	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
322680	326380	Do join us for a live taping sometime and you can join our chat room and give your witty
326380	329520	insight to the show just like the folks are tonight.
329520	331820	We'll start off with Brad from the show Pod Culture.
331820	332820	We love Brad.
332820	334360	Rob isn't out of shape.
334360	335960	Round is a shape.
335960	336960	You know what?
336960	338560	Maybe I don't love Brad so much after that comment, actually.
338560	339560	That was rather rude.
339560	340560	Don't you think?
340560	341560	No, I'm kidding.
341560	344720	And then some folks are joking about the whole doctor thing.
344720	349720	SSJ100Matt says, OLR house MD, Twitch Dark Tetsuya promptly follows up with, it's not
349720	350720	Lupus.
350720	353360	It's a house joke, TV joke.
353360	354360	Anyhow.
354360	358560	Also, you can join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
358560	361840	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
361840	365120	All sorts of ways to interact with the show because we are the show where every gamer
365120	366120	has a voice.
366120	368840	We're going to start off with talking about our gaming weeks and the types of games you
368840	369840	have been playing this week.
369840	371160	Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
371160	372560	How was your gaming week?
372560	374680	I played well.
374680	381120	And then I played nobi nobi boy today because I have the nobi nobi app on my iPhone and
381120	385720	I every so often get randomly curious to see just how far he's stretched and he's finally
385720	388840	hit Jupiter or that girl has stretched.
388840	393200	So she's at Jupiter now because nobi nobi boy keeps feeding her his love.
393200	397440	And it's just really stupid crack that I use to fill time.
397440	401360	And I haven't played any more Final Fantasy 3.
401360	403360	In fact, I'm just going to start it over.
403360	406280	Oh, you start over.
406280	410000	Yeah, because I just want to sit and marathon it.
410000	414320	You know what, if I don't play an RPG for a long amount of time, I kind of find I have
414320	416760	to go back and start over as well.
416760	420320	Like, because I feel like I'm so lost in the story.
420320	427480	Oh, and don't forget Marvel vs Capcom 3, which we haven't got yet, but we've played it since
427480	430140	with its freaky ass control style.
430140	437440	And I do have to agree with my co-host on another podcast, Comic Insanity, that Spider-Man
437440	439480	is totally janked in that game.
439480	440520	His moves are messed up.
440520	442960	You know, he's all messed up now.
442960	443960	It's all about Deadpool.
443960	447240	Movie reboot, and he's joining Fantastic Four.
447240	448240	What?
448240	451600	Well, they killed Johnny Storm.
451600	452600	I know.
452600	454000	Who was the most interesting of all of them?
454000	458040	Well, according to Tiara, he was at home eating a sandwich when he died.
458040	459040	Not really.
459040	460040	All right.
460040	464280	Anyhow, what else was I going to say about all that?
464280	468440	Oh, I was going to say, it didn't make the show roll tonight, but about Final Fantasy
468440	473320	3, it was announced that Square is doing a version of that for the iPhone.
473320	478480	And what's particularly interesting about that is that, well, 1 and 2 on the iPhone
478480	480680	were based off the PSP versions.
480680	483360	There hasn't been a Final Fantasy 3 on PSP.
483360	487400	We know there's going to be a 4 on PSP soon, but still not a 3.
487400	492500	But the DS version wouldn't make sense on the iPhone, so what is it going to be?
492500	493500	We don't know.
493500	497080	Well, see, I had waited for Final Fantasy 3 to come out on Wonderswan Color, but they
497080	500200	did 1, 2, and 4.
500200	504720	So I don't know, I think they're just going to go through and resprite them.
504720	510320	In fact, I had a feeling that they had worked on a Final Fantasy 3 for Wonderswan Color
510320	513920	and might just pull whatever they were working on for that, because they had it in the works,
513920	515600	it just never came out.
515600	517520	So maybe kind of go back and get some of the programming.
517520	520780	It would be interesting, though, if they do 1 for iPhone, why don't they just release
520780	522360	it for PSP as well?
522360	525080	I'll tell you, I love those remakes on PSP.
525080	526080	I think they're great.
526080	530240	It was actually, 2 is really simple to play on, because I have 2 on my iPhone.
530240	532560	I am so excited for 4.
532560	536000	There's a part of me, though, that was still thinking about going back and finishing Vi,
536000	539600	but I have it on Sega CD and I could just play that on Sega CD.
539600	544880	I hope they bring 4 and the after years onto the iOS as well, because I don't really play
544880	545880	with PSP anymore.
545880	550840	I wouldn't mind the Final Fantasy 7 cell phone game.
550840	553760	Well, after years did start as a mobile game.
553760	554760	Yeah.
554760	558240	Let me read this comment real quick regarding Marvel vs. Capcom, because this is a complaint
558240	560760	I hear a lot, so I'm kind of curious what Dark Soccer thinks about it.
560760	562320	Believe it or not, I still haven't played it yet.
562320	563320	I'm like, so not cool.
563320	567440	Well, outside at E3, but that was how long ago, and it wasn't really built of the game.
567440	571880	But AkumaJP in our chat room says, Marvel vs. Capcom is just button bashing to me.
571880	573160	Not really that fun.
573160	574160	Agree?
574160	575160	Disagree?
575160	579640	I think it's a lot of fun, especially if you know what you're doing.
579640	584440	I mean, you can pull off moves, but anyone can just pick it up and play it.
584440	585440	That's the thing.
585440	590960	It's that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom control style, because it's the same company, Street Fighter
590960	592440	4, same thing.
592440	599480	But I think that the whole issue with it is because it is easy to get in and mash, because
599480	604040	you can just throw off your super with the push of a button.
604040	608640	When you actually stop and learn the moves associated with it, then there's...
608640	609640	You can definitely...
609640	613880	I'm trying to see how to phrase this right, because it's not like, you know, like in Tekken
613880	617880	where you can have a masher totally beat someone who's actually good at the game.
617880	622000	If you've got skill with it, then you can beat a masher.
622000	624000	I don't know if that makes sense.
624000	625240	So it can be fun.
625240	629400	Yeah, I feel with the versus control style, like for the...
629400	630560	I don't know.
630560	634820	For basic combos, yes, it's very easy for even someone who's never played it before
634820	637080	to get like a six or seven hit.
637080	641440	But if you go to the tournaments or go on YouTube and look at the crazy stuff, you have
641440	644680	to practice and know how to do that stuff.
644680	649280	Like I remember in X-Men versus Street Fighter, you'd go jab, jab, medium, medium, fierce,
649280	652360	fierce, and you basically work through the buttons like a zigzag.
652360	655360	That style, that's still in there, and that's not really easy to do.
655360	657480	Wasn't that kind of...
657480	661120	To throw it back, wasn't that kind of killer instincts thing, is it was very easy to combo
661120	663320	if you just kind of knew the layout?
663320	664320	Yeah, that's why...
664320	665680	Darkstalkers 3 was the same thing.
665680	669160	That's why I always kind of liked killer instinct, to be honest, is that you don't really button
669160	671680	mash, but it's not that hard to figure out the...
671680	672680	There's a sequence.
672680	674920	If you learn the sequence, it just all comes naturally.
674920	679600	In Killer Instinct, the way it was is light punch was linked to a medium kick, which was
679600	683160	in turn linked to hard kick.
683160	686380	And then the other way, so it was sort of like a crisp, but you could also go from light
686380	690600	to hard, but you'd have to move them back in a certain order, and you could figure out
690600	693600	any combo that way, but the buttons were linked a certain way.
693600	694600	I used to...
694600	698840	Well, we had a killer instinct at my arcade when I went to the University of South Alabama,
698840	703240	and my friend Marcy and I would just trade off, because we could do all of those 44 hit
703240	708480	combos and everything, too, but the thing, though, is that with the early versus games
708480	713840	versus the late versus games, that's a lot of versus, the late versus games is that the
713840	720800	early ones still went on that Street Fighter, you know, the six button layout style, whereas...
720800	722360	Hi.
722360	731920	Because we have a four button with a special, so it's just kind of different.
731920	737880	Sorry, we're being interrupted with food requests, that's why we're distracted, so anyhow.
737880	743560	I wanted to throw this out real quick, though, speaking of Killer Instinct, I realize that
743560	747560	everything's up in the air with Rare, and they're not really with Nintendo anymore,
747560	752400	and things aren't like they used to be, but seriously, seriously, what's gotta happen
752400	754280	for there to be a Killer Instinct 3?
754280	755280	I know.
755280	756280	Like, how bad?
756280	757800	Who in this room would love a Killer Instinct 3?
757800	758800	Me, me, me, me, me.
758800	760800	Okay, that's me and Jamie, that's it.
760800	761800	All right, still...
761800	766260	I still wanted the public flogging of the whoever was responsible for the Killer Instinct
766260	770960	Complete 64, that piece of crap port, ugh, already upset thinking about it.
770960	773360	The SNES version was the best home port.
773360	774360	The end.
774360	775360	Yes.
775360	776360	Or MAME.
776360	777360	Mhm.
777360	778360	And I love the mar-cats.
778360	779360	Ah, I love the CD.
779360	780360	Good times.
780360	781360	I listened to that so much.
781360	782880	Killer Instinct had awesome music, it really did.
782880	784880	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
784880	788400	Actually, Killer Instinct 2, though, did have one really good piece of music, and that was
788400	789400	Orchid's theme.
789400	790400	Mhm.
790400	794320	And I remember, this is when I lived in Alabama, and Dan and I were just friends online, is
794320	799040	that he actually waited until the, cause the game would start with a random stage, and
799040	803640	he waited until Orchid's stage popped up so he could record the music for me as a WAV
803640	804640	file back in the day.
804640	805640	Oh, that's nice.
805640	806640	That was so sweet.
806640	812080	And by the way, loved Maya in Killer Instinct 2 with her, like, unrealistic boobies.
812080	814760	She was the first one I beat the game with in KI 2.
814760	815760	Nice.
815760	816760	All right.
816760	817760	Let's move on.
817760	818760	Loki!
818760	819760	How you doing?
819760	820760	How was your game of the week?
820760	821760	Oh, it was all right.
821760	822760	Didn't play a lot, though.
822760	823760	Um.
823760	826480	Just mainly, Sword and Poker 2, and um.
826480	828480	I keep forgetting to get that game.
828480	829480	It's awesome.
829480	830480	You always tell me about it.
830480	831480	I always forget to get it.
831480	832480	It's seriously awesome.
832480	833480	I will.
833480	834480	And then, um, just Grand Theft Auto, mainly.
834480	838240	I don't know, that's about it.
838240	844480	Although I am currently, during the show, playing Bulletstorm, so I don't know.
844480	849480	It's only, like, 30 seconds into the game because I got it booted up and then hit pause.
849480	853880	But it's already introduced me to a new phrase, which is awesome.
853880	854880	What's that?
854880	855880	Murder Boner.
855880	856880	So, uh.
856880	857880	That's pretty sweet.
857880	858880	Um.
858880	863680	Gotta love that kind of stuff.
863680	868360	I have heard, literally, one of my friends describe Bulletstorm literally like this.
868360	869960	It's Bayonetta with a dick.
869960	872640	It's Murder Boner, is what it is.
872640	873640	Okay.
873640	874640	Bayonetta with a murder boner.
874640	875640	All right.
875640	876640	Fair enough.
876640	877640	All right.
877640	878640	Um.
878640	880600	Slice of Pop left the room for a minute, so I'll go ahead and get into my gaming week.
880600	881600	Um.
881600	883200	I actually played a few games this week.
883200	888020	Continued some You Don't Know Jack, which was actually, you know, and I already reviewed
888020	891320	the game last week, so I don't want to repeat myself, but I just want to emphasize, if you
891320	896280	are going to pick up this game, know in advance that you need your save file to move with
896280	899840	you if you're going to go from one Xbox to another, because I'll tell you, it was a little
899840	903920	bit frustrating the way they lock out games in You Don't Know Jack, where you can only
903920	909000	access the first five in the beginning, and then as you play, you unlock one more, so
909000	913160	it's like you only ever have five open at a time, but what was frustrating about that
913160	917400	is that, well, we'd already played the first three when we were at my friend's house, so
917400	921560	when we let the game just randomly pick an episode, we got the first game over again,
921560	925000	so Alan and I were just sitting there, you know, we knew it was just, who buzzed faster?
925000	926000	Who can buzz faster?
926000	930600	It was really all it came down to, so I was a little bit frustrated that that happened.
930600	935400	I understand they probably designed it that way for Xbox Live mode, so that way there
935400	939120	would always be some episodes at the end, most people haven't got to yet, but I would
939120	945440	say for the next You Don't Know Jack game, it would be even better if the non-Xbox Live
945440	950960	games were one set of games, and then the Xbox Live games were like another set of games,
950960	956440	and what they could even do is that, like, let's say you have 70 offline episodes, and
956440	963320	let's say 50 online episodes, have it so that if you have already played all 50 episodes
963320	968120	online, you only get matched up with other people that have played all 50 episodes online.
968120	971280	That way, all the, like, I don't want to say cheaters, but all the people that already
971280	972280	know-
972280	973280	Have, like, staggered levels.
973280	974280	Exactly.
974280	975280	You know, kind of like-
975280	977080	Like, matching, I guess, sort of way.
977080	980320	That would be my feedback for the You Don't Know Jack folks, otherwise I still think it's
980320	986200	hilarious, it's a great party game, it's fun, it's not a $60 game, which is great, and,
986200	990280	you know, it's worth your time, so do check it out.
990280	995960	Other games I played this week, I played Hardcore Uprising, which is the, it's Contra, but it's
995960	1004040	not for the Xbox Live, although when you get to the start screen, it still has that doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo,
1004040	1008020	like the same Contra music, so it's Contra, people, it's just Contra.
1008020	1013760	I really think this is the type of game that a lot of old-school gamers wish they had so
1013760	1016160	much more of on Xbox Live.
1016160	1022080	It really is just, like, a souped-up version of the old Nintendo or the Super Nintendo
1022080	1029160	game, now with 3D-ish graphics, but not a 3D game, if that makes sense.
1029160	1030160	It just uses-
1030160	1031160	2.5D?
1031160	1035600	Yeah, yeah, like a 2.5D type of thing, where, you know, things are coming out of the background
1035600	1039160	and the foreground and all sorts of cool stuff, but, like, if you like Contra, this is like
1039160	1043440	an, you don't even have to think, you're gonna want this game, buy this game.
1043440	1046440	It's Contra on Xbox Live, and that's really all there is to say.
1046440	1051440	It's, you know, modernized a bit, there's this full-on anime opening sequence, it's
1051440	1058800	like, it kind of just made me think of, like, yeah, fuck yeah, Contra, fuck yeah, fire burn,
1058800	1062240	you know, chicks with guns, it was kind of awesome, so.
1062240	1063240	Cool.
1063240	1064240	It's definitely worth your time.
1064240	1065360	The only downside?
1065360	1067560	No up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start.
1067560	1070720	It didn't work, unless I put it in the wrong place or something, I wasn't able to get that
1070720	1071720	code to work.
1071720	1072720	Try it backwards.
1072720	1073720	Maybe.
1073720	1074720	You know what happens if you do that in Parodius?
1074720	1075720	You die.
1075720	1076720	Yeah, I know.
1076720	1077720	That happened at-
1077720	1078720	But-
1078720	1079720	One of the Gradius games did that, too, I think.
1079720	1080720	If you do it backwards, then you get your power-ups.
1080720	1087520	Wasn't it Gradius 4 on the Super Nintendo would kill you, but if you used LRLR, then you would
1087520	1089960	get all the power-ups, instead of left, right, left, right, the shoulder buttons.
1089960	1094040	And I think Gradius 5 only let you do it three times.
1094040	1095040	So.
1095040	1102080	Also, I played an indie game on the marketplace called Try Not to Fart, and that's the set
1102080	1103520	of- Jamie looks disgusted.
1103520	1107360	No, I'm not disgusted, it's just like a what?
1107360	1111760	It actually cracked me up, like, it's really funny, like, it's just basically like, you
1111760	1115920	actually try to hold down buttons, like, buttons will light up on the screen, and so you have
1115920	1120360	to press that right button, and then when it flashes, you let go.
1120360	1124560	And that sounds really easy, and it is for the first couple levels, but then as you move
1124560	1129600	on, it's like, A, now Y, now right trigger, now let go of Y, now let go of A.
1129600	1130600	So it's like Twister.
1130600	1133920	Yeah, yeah, it's like Twister, and then if you screw up, you fart.
1133920	1140280	But what's great is that it's like you're on a date with a girl or whatever, and so,
1140280	1144000	like, the best part of the game is the inane conversation that's happening in the background
1144000	1145000	where you're trying not to fart.
1145000	1146000	I like fish.
1146000	1150640	Exactly, they're, like, talking about, and it's all these, like, total douchebag topic
1150640	1153720	types of things, like, you know, so, do you come here often?
1153720	1157480	Oh, well, I didn't, you know, they're having this conversation, and then, like, if you
1157480	1162360	accidentally fart, it'll go pfft, and it's like, it's just like, ew, that's disgusting.
1162360	1167520	It's just, like, it's really funny in a six-year-old kind of way, but.
1167520	1169200	I like how your shoes are tied.
1169200	1171600	Like, don't spend money on it.
1171600	1177440	No, I shouldn't say that, because it's an indie development place, but I just, you know,
1177440	1178440	it reminds me a lot of-
1178440	1184160	I can't see spending more than a couple dollars on it, which is what it costs, so fine.
1184160	1191480	The Leisure Suit Larry game, Magna Cum Laude, I believe, where they had this, like, game
1191480	1194560	where you're talking, you're hitting on women and stuff, and you have this little sperm
1194560	1199040	that you have to kind of move up and down through, like, this maze that's coming along
1199040	1206040	the screen, you have to dodge, like, the, uh, I don't know, just, like, STDs or whatever,
1206040	1210720	but if you hit that stuff, he starts saying weird things, you know?
1210720	1212280	Yes, I remember that.
1212280	1213280	It's kind of funny.
1213280	1214280	I do remember that.
1214280	1215280	That was funny.
1215280	1221080	So, all right, um, thank you, Salacious Pop brought me food for that.
1221080	1222080	He rocks.
1222080	1226560	All right, um, uh, before I turn it over to Salacious Pop for his gaming week, let me
1226560	1229720	talk real quickly about, and I don't know if I'm supposed to be talking about this because
1229720	1233040	there was an NDA and everything, but, eh, it's an open beta.
1233040	1235200	Everybody's playing it, if they're interested in it.
1235200	1236200	It's Rift.
1236200	1238080	I played for a little bit this week.
1238080	1242720	I grinded a character up to level 8, and, uh, how do I explain Rift?
1242720	1247920	It's really, really like World of Warcraft in a lot of ways, to the point where I didn't
1247920	1251400	know what button did what, and I was like, how do I bring up my talent tree?
1251400	1255520	Oh, well, in WoW, I hit N, and sure enough, I hit N, and it brought up my talent tree.
1255520	1259120	So, it's kind of funny that I kind of, like, knew the buttons from just having played WoW
1259120	1264960	so much, um, but obviously, Rift's trying to do its own thing, and let's, let's be honest,
1264960	1269600	Rift, in its advertising campaign, is trying to say, this isn't Azeroth anymore, or something
1269600	1270600	like that.
1270600	1272400	It's trying to say, this isn't like Azeroth, or I don't know.
1272400	1273400	You're not in Azeroth.
1273400	1274400	Yeah, something like that.
1274400	1276400	Like, not in Kansas.
1276400	1277400	Exactly.
1277400	1281960	Um, so I played the game to, like, level 8 or so, maybe level 9, I don't know, and, um,
1281960	1283520	I don't know, I gotta be honest.
1283520	1289040	I wasn't really feeling it, like, the game didn't have anything that just made me jump
1289040	1291240	out of my seat, go, wow, that's cool.
1291240	1296560	Now, I do hear the PVP's pretty cool, and there are some, like, questing in the world
1296560	1301560	events, and that's something that was in Warhammer, that I really liked in Warhammer, um, the
1301560	1306680	whole public questing idea, and I wish WoW had something like that, and I did like that.
1306680	1310360	But um, you know, I didn't get to sample enough, probably in 8 levels, so it's really, I'm
1310360	1314160	not going to try and review the game, because, you know, I'm just telling you, I played it,
1314160	1318800	I wasn't blown away by the stuff I saw in the early 8 levels, everybody's telling me
1318800	1324200	you have to really invest time into it, but let's be real, you know, the game also kind
1324200	1327640	of has to do something to make me want to get that far, I mean, wasn't that everybody's
1327640	1329940	biggest bitch about Final Fantasy 13?
1329940	1332840	It doesn't get good until you're, like, 15 hours in?
1332840	1334400	That was my bitch about World of Warcraft.
1334400	1338840	Yeah, and, you know, true, some people have the same bitch about World of Warcraft, which
1338840	1342020	is why when they did Cataclysm, one of the first things they did, they went back and
1342020	1344960	redid all the starting areas, to make them a little more interesting.
1344960	1350040	So, you know, Rift, it's a new game, they'll iron out some of the kinks, it'll be interesting,
1350040	1353040	um, I'm kind of curious to see where it ends up.
1353040	1357240	I haven't made my decision yet if I'll actually buy the Fury Tail one or not, I kind of, I'm
1357240	1360920	not looking forward to paying another monthly fee, but, whatever.
1360920	1363040	Would you, did you have something you want to say about Rift, Salacious Pop?
1363040	1365040	How does it look, is it pretty?
1365040	1367520	Yeah, it's pretty, I don't know.
1367520	1372280	There's something about, something about the way the characters look, I kind of like the
1372280	1377200	cartoony look of WoW, that Rift is trying to be a little more realistic, it does have
1377200	1380960	more intense character customization, I spent a lot more time doing that, so that was kind
1380960	1381960	of cool.
1381960	1388160	But, um, I don't know, like, I thought the scenery looked really nice, I really liked
1388160	1394280	the environments, I loved some of the sunsets and the water effects, all that's really beautiful,
1394280	1399120	but I wasn't, like, really into the way the characters looked, or the monsters, but, you
1399120	1403840	know, I don't know, I could, that's, that's really an opinion, so, there you go.
1403840	1408800	So that was pretty much it for My Gaming Week, uh, we'll move on, I already mentioned the
1408800	1411680	Twitter and the Facebook and all that, as far as housekeeping goes, I don't think I
1411680	1415480	have a whole lot else to add, so, let's get into some actual...
1415480	1416480	Falafels!
1416480	1417480	Falafels!
1417480	1419600	And then Game, oh, yes, Salacious Pop?
1419600	1420600	My Gaming Week.
1420600	1423280	Oh, I'm sorry, well that's what happens when you leave the room, Salacious Pop, how was
1423280	1424600	your Gaming Week?
1424600	1428440	Yeah, I left the room because I was sent to bring him food, so...
1428440	1430960	I know, you were gone for, like, an hour.
1430960	1431960	That's right.
1431960	1438040	Um, well, I play a lot of WoW, so derp derp, that's more appropriate for your other podcast.
1438040	1442480	Um, the Valentine's Day holiday in WoW is wrapping up, and I still haven't completed
1442480	1445440	it yet, so I need to do that tonight before it goes away.
1445440	1450120	Then some, uh, You Don't Know Jack on Xbox 360.
1450120	1459080	Um, I played about an hour's worth of The Great Gatsby Tribute, NES ROM Hack, amazing,
1459080	1460080	love it.
1460080	1463760	That was a book that we had to cover, I think it was junior or senior year in high school.
1463760	1464760	It's an old...
1464760	1467880	Okay, tell me about how this works as an NES game.
1467880	1468880	I don't get it.
1468880	1474600	It's, in level one, you play Sam, I think, the friend, who is sort of the person that
1474600	1477440	he's sort of narrating all the stuff that goes down.
1477440	1483920	You show up at, um, Gatsby's party, and you have to dodge butlers and drunk flappers and
1483920	1487200	find Gatsby in the library at the end of the stage, and it's basically a platformer.
1487200	1492860	You're jumping over mobs and shooting pew-pew bullets at them.
1492860	1495200	And it's The Great Gatsby, so I love it.
1495200	1496880	Um, so I played that.
1496880	1498800	I hated that book, just so you know.
1498800	1503080	That, well, that book, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, all the books you have
1503080	1506240	to read in high school really depends on the teacher, I feel.
1506240	1509920	I'll give you that, but I never liked being forced to read books, and there were some
1509920	1511680	truly terrible books I had to read in high school.
1511680	1515760	And we had to read a separate piece, oh my god, I hate that book so much, and The Crucible,
1515760	1516760	Arthur Miller, ugh.
1516760	1519320	I think I read a separate piece, and I didn't, what's a separate piece about?
1519320	1522960	I sound so uneducated right now, this is years ago, what's a separate piece about?
1522960	1526840	It's the best friend, and they're on the branch, and one of them sort of jostles the branch,
1526840	1528240	and his best friend falls.
1528240	1529560	I think I really like that book.
1529560	1532400	And breaks his arm, and he feels guilty about it like his whole life.
1532400	1534560	Yes, I like, I really like that book.
1534560	1535560	Awful.
1535560	1538680	It's my least favorite, I hate this book, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
1538680	1539680	Dandelion Wine.
1539680	1543280	I've never seen, we haven't covered that one.
1543280	1544800	Ugh, terrible.
1544800	1547160	The Grapes of Wrath totally made me want to slash my wrists.
1547160	1548560	But I loved Catcher in the Rye.
1548560	1549560	We did a nice advance, but not.
1549560	1554760	I was that angsty kid who liked all that, you know, books that say fuck.
1554760	1561360	So yeah, Great Gatsby, WoW, Knights of the Clicky, did you talk about the hold in the
1561360	1562360	fart game?
1562360	1563360	Yes I did.
1563360	1566240	I missed that.
1566240	1572320	So in You Don't Know Jack, between the questions, there are little animated segments for each
1572320	1574280	number of the question.
1574280	1579240	The one for number five is auto-tuned, ooh number five girl, you rock my world girl.
1579240	1580240	Cracks me up.
1580240	1583240	I cannot listen to it without dying of laughter.
1583240	1584960	So you have to play that game.
1584960	1589480	Every time question five comes up, I just hear giggling, and it's Alan.
1589480	1592840	Yeah, but that's all.
1592840	1598600	What other classic book should they turn into an 8-bit game?
1598600	1599600	Watership Down.
1599600	1602460	Oh yeah, that'd be a good one.
1602460	1606720	How about Brave New World?
1606720	1611420	How about Atlas Shrugged, and then it would be the most boring, stupid game ever.
1611420	1618840	What's the book, James Joyce, who writes basically gibberish for 400 pages, and it's a classic.
1618840	1621920	I'm liking on the name of the book.
1621920	1622920	Maybe somebody in chat will.
1622920	1625600	Well, we've already had The Inferno.
1625600	1629000	Oh yeah, it's true.
1629000	1632780	By the way, Dark Toa Gak in our chat room, I love this comment, LMAO, we're reading that
1632780	1637280	in English right now, and the teacher brought that game up.
1637280	1639760	I guess that's kind of a cool way to connect with your class.
1639760	1643520	You know what, if I was an English teacher, I would kind of show that game in class to
1643520	1644520	get people interested.
1644520	1648600	Like I think, I don't know, I could go on a very long time about that, but I think if
1648600	1652280	you really want to engage kids, sometimes you have to kind of speak on their level.
1652280	1654760	Here's what I remember of The Great Gatsby.
1654760	1658920	It's in the 20s, they're drinking illegal wine, and they had no air conditioning in
1658920	1659920	New York.
1659920	1663680	I just remember Mia Farrow in the movie and how much she sucks.
1663680	1665040	I don't like her.
1665040	1666040	Anyway.
1666040	1668360	Video games, video games, wow, wow, wow.
1668360	1672880	All right, let's talk about some actual video game news, Loki, help, or we're going to turn
1672880	1674960	into the literary podcast.
1674960	1680520	Yes, let's talk about a video game that's being worked on right now by former Rockstar
1680520	1683800	cut scene directors.
1683800	1688840	I don't even know if that's a credible occupation, but whatever.
1688840	1695240	He's credited as a writer, director, and I guess a voice actor for different games for
1695240	1697360	Rockstar between 2001 and 2005.
1697360	1703760	But anyways, he's working on a game called 1979 The Game, which sounds kind of boring,
1703760	1711880	you know, a game about a year, but no, actually it's about the Iran revolution, and basically
1711880	1719840	he says they're focusing on the takeover of the American embassy and outline the game,
1719840	1723800	saying that they're looking at about eight to 10 different roles or different perspectives
1723800	1727920	that are going to be in the game, different characters, and initially you'll start the
1727920	1735320	game off as an Iranian but American born US State Department translator who is, I guess,
1735320	1740840	coming in with the objective to try to free the US hostages.
1740840	1745320	So interesting subject, I suppose.
1745320	1749240	They're saying that obviously it's going to be a social and political title, and there's
1749240	1754520	going to be some sandbox and strategy elements to the game.
1754520	1761520	I wouldn't doubt that a person that worked on Rockstar Games would do something that's
1761520	1768240	not a sandbox game, but it's interesting, and no word on when this is possibly going
1768240	1773880	to be released or how long it's going to take for development, but I guess it's an interesting
1773880	1774880	subject.
1774880	1781280	Honestly, before I was born, so not really too familiar with all the stuff that happened,
1781280	1785680	but so you're calling us all then, basically, when you make yes, I am calling you.
1785680	1790120	Well, I was one year old when that all went down, and I'm sure that you were.
1790120	1791120	I know, right?
1791120	1795480	Immediately on top of all the political news, but it is still a little weird.
1795480	1796480	I don't know.
1796480	1800560	These whole like games based off real life are kind of strange to me.
1800560	1805680	I don't I can't put my finger on it, but like, wouldn't this game kind of encourage you in
1805680	1808920	some ways to be like changing history?
1808920	1810600	Or like you can change history in it?
1810600	1811680	I don't know.
1811680	1816200	But then again, I love civilization, so I guess I'm being a total hypocrite right now.
1816200	1817200	It's different.
1817200	1819080	I can't explain it.
1819080	1821580	It's different.
1821580	1823320	Is this a game you're interested in playing, Logie?
1823320	1824320	Not really.
1824320	1825320	It doesn't sound that interesting.
1825320	1829920	Even though even with the Grand Theft, no, because it's a guy who was a cutscene director.
1829920	1832000	I mean, so what they directed stuff.
1832000	1834600	It's not the people actually.
1834600	1835600	I don't know.
1835600	1837400	It's it doesn't really count.
1837400	1840440	Do you think that maybe it's kind of funny because I was just mentioning this in our
1840440	1842080	whole little literary discussion.
1842080	1845600	It's not like Rockstar Games is saying, OK, we're going to make a game about the Iran
1845600	1846600	revolution.
1846600	1851400	Then even then, I'd be kind of like, eh, I don't buy everything Rockstar puts out.
1851400	1852400	I mean, come on.
1852400	1853400	Rockstar Table Tennis?
1853400	1854400	No, thanks.
1854400	1855680	I bought Rockstar Table Tennis.
1855680	1856680	All right.
1856680	1860720	Look, I'm sure you're sure you play that game every day.
1860720	1866240	We were just talking about how, you know, if I were a teacher, I would use the great
1866240	1871240	Gatsby game to try and relate the book to kids and make it more interesting.
1871240	1875520	Is this maybe a way because all of us in the room admit we don't we weren't really old
1875520	1878480	enough to understand what was going on at the time.
1878480	1884020	So maybe this is a way to educate us on what happened.
1884020	1885360	I guess it could be.
1885360	1887280	I mean.
1887280	1889280	I just don't care.
1889280	1890280	I don't know.
1890280	1892820	That's just maybe wrong of me, but I don't care.
1892820	1898680	It's just like I wouldn't want to like a game based off of, I don't know, most of history.
1898680	1901680	I just don't really give a crap about history.
1901680	1907480	Well, I'm a history nerd, but I don't think that I would really play a game about history
1907480	1913000	unless it was a time period that I really enjoyed, you know.
1913000	1919320	I mean, I like the historical genre, but if I really want to know about this, I could
1919320	1922360	just go and read everything, which I have.
1922360	1925040	I go back and read history books for fun.
1925040	1928960	The only history I want to learn about is the history that takes place in Command & Conquer
1928960	1929960	Red Alert.
1929960	1935120	Granted, it's not exactly accurate history, but it has lots of guns.
1935120	1936120	Here's the funny thing.
1936120	1941240	Like in Einstein, I, I enjoy these history games like Battle of Olympus, which I know
1941240	1944160	is stretching it a little bit, but that's like going way back, like I remember Battle
1944160	1945160	of Olympus on the NES.
1945160	1946160	That game was awesome.
1946160	1949680	And you did learn a little bit about Greek mythology playing that game.
1949680	1954040	But like if they were to make a video game on like other recent historical things, like
1954040	1958280	let's be honest, if they were to make like a game on 9-11, that's not a game.
1958280	1960360	That's not something I'm interested in playing at all.
1960360	1964080	Like that's just not, like games are, I don't know, they're supposed to be like entertaining.
1964080	1965640	How do you even make a game out of that?
1965640	1966640	I mean, really.
1966640	1972200	Well, hopefully there isn't one, but how do you make a game out of the Iran Contra scandal?
1972200	1973200	I mean, come on.
1973200	1974200	It's weird.
1974200	1975200	Okay.
1975200	1976200	Let me put this though into perspective.
1976200	1977200	Okay.
1977200	1986120	I would say that World War II just ended three months ago and someone wants to put 1942 on
1986120	1989800	the market.
1989800	1991480	It's the same thing.
1991480	1992960	And the first stage is Pearl Harbor.
1992960	1993960	That wouldn't fly.
1993960	1994960	Yeah.
1994960	2000040	Well, ironically enough, how many World War II games exist today?
2000040	2002040	There's zillions and zillions.
2002040	2005840	And I guarantee, well, we've already got games set in the Gulf War.
2005840	2007480	Yeah, I know.
2007480	2012720	So, I mean, hate to say it, if there's a war involved, it sells games.
2012720	2017440	They're just going to leave out certain things that are too recent for people, but you know,
2017440	2022760	maybe 15 years from now, we're going to have a, you know, a rewrite history game where
2022760	2026320	you save the tower or something.
2026320	2028960	They tried that and unfortunately that game sucked.
2028960	2034420	It wasn't necessarily saving the tower, but it was, and I'd see, my mind is already blocked
2034420	2036680	it out because it was such a crappy first-person shooter.
2036680	2041800	It came out last September of 09.
2041800	2046320	And basically you went back in time and you had to save specific people from history.
2046320	2048280	Just like nobody people.
2048280	2052560	But they had the Civil War and stuff like that and everybody's fighting the muskets
2052560	2057780	and you have this laser cannon, you know, just like, oh, you have to reload your musket.
2057780	2059400	Let me blow off your head with this Uzi.
2059400	2063280	You know, it's just time cop shit.
2063280	2068160	If Konami had their Metal Gear Solid team make a game, a sneak or a stealth game where
2068160	2073000	you investigate, where you go to Watergate, the hotel, I'd play that.
2073000	2078400	Return of Time Pilot, maybe, because you remember Time Pilot, the old school shooter?
2078400	2079900	Modernize that.
2079900	2083120	Way off topic here, but he brought it up.
2083120	2087240	Metal Gear Solid, wouldn't it be awesome if they had a Metal Gear Solid style game set
2087240	2090480	in like a high school or something like that and you're just like a high school kid or
2090480	2093400	something and all very sneaky around.
2093400	2094960	Are you shooting people?
2094960	2096680	Because that's not going to go over very well.
2096680	2097680	No, not shooting people.
2097680	2100240	I'm talking about something like more along the lines of bully, but you know.
2100240	2102680	Oh, like gossip.
2102680	2104360	That should be the Mean Girls game.
2104360	2109380	Not this puzzle shit, but you should be like the evil gossip biatch of the school where
2109380	2114160	you eavesdrop on conversations and then like, man, that would be awesome.
2114160	2117800	Imagine Metal Gear Solid mixed with Mass Effect style dialogue.
2117800	2118800	That should be the Mean Girls game.
2118800	2119800	Way too dramatic.
2119800	2127960	You know, just like everything way overdramatized, you know, just a ridiculous amount of drama
2127960	2128960	to the game.
2128960	2131040	It'd be awesome.
2131040	2134600	No one has that kind of sense of humor, but Konami, I can see that you have that sense
2134600	2141960	of humor because you're putting out Rock Revolution and, God, what was that crappy high school
2141960	2144440	dating game that they had on the PSP?
2144440	2147840	Oh, I don't even, I remember the game.
2147840	2149920	I don't remember what it was called.
2149920	2154880	Anyways, see, I think all those things could be fixed with a little bit of Metal Gear Solid
2154880	2159680	thrown in, and hell, if you want to be funny even better, you know, even better if you
2159680	2164740	want to be a little bit more funny, you could have the principal or dean to be actually
2164740	2165740	Old Snake.
2165740	2167680	It'd be hilarious.
2167680	2171040	Or a guy that looks like Old Snake, you know.
2171040	2177720	Alright, let's talk about some non-historical games that are coming out pretty soon, and
2177720	2181880	actually a lot of this has to do with Telltale, who had a big, big, big, big press event this
2181880	2182880	week.
2182880	2188840	They announced a lot of new games that are coming out, and the first is the Fables series.
2188840	2190920	This is the comic book series Fables.
2190920	2195280	That is going to be coming out in the first quarter of 2012, so that's one of the games
2195280	2197800	that they are working on right now.
2197800	2199560	You know, kind of fairy tales.
2199560	2205480	They get, this is interesting, the comic book is based on characters from various fairy
2205480	2208340	tales like Snow White, Pinocchio, and this stuff.
2208340	2212720	They get excommunicated from their realm and forced to live in New York City.
2212720	2216640	So like, if you're thinking like, Fables is like, oh, it's like a Hansel and Gretel.
2216640	2218160	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2218160	2219160	It's very different.
2219160	2223400	I have the first two volumes of the trade paperback of the comic, Vertigo, which is
2223400	2229060	DC's sort of more, I don't want to say adult, but their more serial, like, mature imprint.
2229060	2231800	They put Fables out, I have the two first volumes, and it's awesome.
2231800	2236320	I actually just, um, we've talked about a new issue that came out, which is the Cinderella
2236320	2238800	based one, where she's an assassin.
2238800	2243920	So it's like Enchanted, Enchanted meets Leon Professional.
2243920	2244920	Pretty much.
2244920	2245920	Nice.
2245920	2248520	How do you think it's going to translate into a game, those of you that know the books pretty
2248520	2249520	well?
2249520	2250520	I think it could do it.
2250520	2255520	Yeah, the, it's like, I want to, I mean, they cuss a lot.
2255520	2258960	Snow White, when she gets stressed out, will drop an F bomb in the comic.
2258960	2263600	She's like, you know, because Beauty and the Beast to go see her for marital problems.
2263600	2266420	And she's like, I'm not a caseworker, leave me alone.
2266420	2269520	If they can keep that kind of humor in there, the video game will be great.
2269520	2270520	Why are you asking me?
2270520	2272000	I get banged by seven different dwarves.
2272000	2273000	F off.
2273000	2278360	Oh, don't bring that up, because she will, yeah, no, don't, yeah, they bring that up
2278360	2279360	in the comic.
2279360	2284920	Well, like, I like that in the first issue of the Cinderella one, like, her nemesis is
2284920	2289120	Dorothy Gale, who's a codename Silver Slipper.
2289120	2290120	Nice.
2290120	2292000	Maybe they have the chew thing going on.
2292000	2293280	Can I be honest?
2293280	2296800	I never heard of this series until the news, and now I'm like really interested.
2296800	2298440	I'm gonna have to like borrow your books.
2298440	2300280	That sounds awesome.
2300280	2305260	I like things from my childhood, like really, really messed up.
2305260	2309160	If it wasn't already messed up, like Return to Oz.
2309160	2311240	Most disturbing thing from childhood, yes or no?
2311240	2312240	Yeah.
2312240	2317400	The entire claw, I mean, Baz Luhrmann's shooting his adaptation, The Great Gatsby in 3D, that's
2317400	2318800	gonna make no fucking sense.
2318800	2324120	I mean, seriously, The Great Gatsby was pretty boring, but then I know there's all this symbolism
2324120	2329600	in there, but when Baz Luhrmann gets a hold of anything, it doesn't make any fucking sense.
2329600	2330600	Not to say it's bad.
2330600	2331600	I like Moulin Rouge.
2331600	2332600	Yeah.
2332600	2334440	But I just don't like this 3D orgy, all these movies are having.
2334440	2335440	No, no, I understand that.
2335440	2336440	Everybody's, whatever.
2336440	2341460	I love that Christopher Nolan came out and said, the next Batman's not in 3D.
2341460	2342460	Thank you.
2342460	2343460	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
2343460	2344460	This is why I love him.
2344460	2346400	It's in 40!
2346400	2347400	With the Batman movies.
2347400	2348400	I know.
2348400	2349400	I know.
2349400	2350400	All right.
2350400	2353840	So anyhow, moving on with other news that came out of the Telltale press event, Jurassic
2353840	2355480	Park is one of the other games.
2355480	2357200	We've known they've been working on this for a while.
2357200	2360980	They showed off a little more about the game, and it's gonna be coming out in April.
2360980	2367040	And there's actually a whole little movie that comes with this, but apparently the story
2367040	2371480	involves, they kind of found an opening in the movie of something that was left unresolved,
2371480	2377400	and you can say the book too, of course, although not to get off track, but I always found it
2377400	2378400	interesting.
2378400	2383720	Did you ever read the sequel to the book, the Jurassic Park, the Lost World, the book?
2383720	2387640	Did you know it's a sequel to the movie, not a sequel to the original book?
2387640	2388640	Yeah.
2388640	2391520	Because characters that died in the first book are suddenly unexplainably back because
2391520	2392520	they didn't die in the movie.
2392520	2393800	I always found that fascinating.
2393800	2395840	Well, Crichton was like, millions of dollars?
2395840	2398520	Oh, I'll have this done in two weeks.
2398520	2399520	Exactly.
2399520	2402400	I loved Jurassic Park when I was younger though, and that movie like first came out.
2402400	2406480	I love that, and I love the book, and I even like the sequel.
2406480	2408560	I just didn't care for the third one.
2408560	2411160	But anyway, I'm actually really excited about this.
2411160	2415280	But the loophole, or whatever you want to say, the place they found in the story, is
2415280	2419880	that, remember Nedry, who was played by the guy from Seinfeld?
2419880	2420880	Newman.
2420880	2421880	Newman, yeah.
2421880	2424600	When he escapes, he gets killed, right?
2424600	2426040	But what was he trying to do?
2426040	2427880	He was trying to get out of there with the...
2427880	2430800	The shaving cream of the embryos for the competitor.
2430800	2432000	But it's never recovered.
2432000	2433800	It's always assumed lost.
2433800	2438680	So that's where the game's going to step in, is what happened to that container?
2438680	2439680	Where did it go?
2439680	2440680	Who found it?
2440680	2441680	What did they do with it?
2441680	2448040	So I'm glad they were able to find an opening in a 20-year-old movie, so I'm pretty excited
2448040	2449040	about this.
2449040	2450040	It's going to be pretty awesome.
2450040	2452900	Five episodes, $29.99 pre-order.
2452900	2455580	That's a $5 off the regular price.
2455580	2457160	The Walking Dead.
2457160	2460180	This is a show on, what, AMC that a lot of people are really into?
2460180	2461180	Also a graphic novel.
2461180	2465540	Multi-platform quarter four of this year is when this is going to be out.
2465540	2469920	So are you excited about The Walking Dead being a game?
2469920	2473440	I don't know the show at all, but you know the book, and you know the show.
2473440	2476560	I know it's a book first, and then it became the AMC show.
2476560	2481840	I actually have not been exposed to it at all, so I don't have much of an opinion.
2481840	2489960	Other than I love stuff with zombies, like I never get bored of zombies.
2489960	2492400	Some other quick things that were announced at the Telltale event.
2492400	2495940	There is a Puzzle Agent 2 on the way.
2495940	2500240	Not a whole lot of information outside of that, but that will be on the way.
2500240	2505040	Also Hector, Badge of Carnage will be coming out on the iPad, PC, and Mac.
2505040	2511000	It is a not-for-kids adventure game, so it's a little bit more adult.
2511000	2514400	And then lastly, one thing that they announced, and this is a big bombshell, and this kind
2514400	2520040	of made me go, King's Quest is getting a reboot from Telltale.
2520040	2525180	And this is really like one of those moments where it's like, wow, that was like a fan
2525180	2529560	boy thing that I wanted to happen to this game when it was announced they weren't really
2529560	2530800	going to be making it.
2530800	2533160	Gosh, shouldn't Telltale make a King's Quest game?
2533160	2534280	Wouldn't that be a perfect...
2534280	2535840	And it's like really happening, y'all.
2535840	2539680	Now we kind of know why Activision sent that cease and desist to that other group, because
2539680	2545400	this has probably been in the sort of brainstorm for a while, so now Activision looks less
2545400	2548080	like jerks, and I don't like it when that happens.
2548080	2549080	Exactly.
2549080	2550080	Yeah, I know.
2550080	2552600	I think a lot of us are going, oh, that explains a lot.
2552600	2556480	Well, and the cool thing is, though, the silver lining people are still allowed to do their
2556480	2562480	thing, and they're putting out what, the third game, or they just put out the third episode
2562480	2563560	in their series.
2563560	2566600	So it's cool that that's able to coexist, because you know what?
2566600	2571720	I think it's okay to have two games in the same universe, so to speak.
2571720	2572720	Why not?
2572720	2575320	We have all these, like we were saying earlier, World War II games.
2575320	2576320	We have TV shows.
2576320	2581480	We had two Star Trek shows on at the same time, so why not?
2581480	2586360	And it's cool that one's free, and one is by, please don't take this the wrong way,
2586360	2589520	but one is by professionals, whereas one is by fans.
2589520	2590520	You know what I mean?
2590520	2593240	I don't mean to make the fans not sound like professionals, because I know they're really
2593240	2597680	passionate about what they do, but on one department, you have the same group that made
2597680	2600520	Sam and Max and rebooted Monkey Island.
2600520	2602480	Telltale has a proven track record.
2602480	2604080	They have the pedigree to do this.
2604080	2606800	That's a good word to do it, to say, pedigree.
2606800	2611540	And it's really cool that both are gonna be coexisting and what have you, and I am so
2611540	2614900	excited to see what they put out.
2614900	2618080	I'm surprised, though, that not a peep out of Roberta Williams.
2618080	2622100	I mean, I realize she's, what, living in a fort in the middle of the woods now, and doesn't
2622100	2623400	really do a lot with gaming.
2623400	2624980	They live in Yosemite or something weird, I don't know.
2624980	2627040	They pretty much remove themselves from society, I think.
2627040	2631240	So long as she's getting her royalty checks from this, I'm happy, because I have so many
2631240	2633960	video game memories tied to her and Ken Williams.
2633960	2638320	And they just, like, I don't even think I have to say this, because I think they already
2638320	2642400	know, but Telltale, if they're gonna be rebooting it, we've gotta have something as awesome
2642400	2644440	as Rosella, the fourth game.
2644440	2649440	And I think there will be nods, there'll be winking nods to the old stuff, I believe it.
2649440	2650440	So it'll be cool.
2650440	2655520	Because they didn't say it's a remake, they said it's a reboot, more to be revealed at
2655520	2656520	E3.
2656520	2658520	So, very cool.
2658520	2659980	Very, very cool.
2659980	2663080	So lots of news out of Telltale this week.
2663080	2664560	Let's move on, though, with some other news.
2664560	2665560	DarkStakra.
2665560	2671640	Well, there's a different perspective out on how piracy is going in the PC market.
2671640	2680320	And they're actually saying that according to this one facility, the PCGA research group,
2680320	2685080	that actually PC piracy has gone down.
2685080	2691480	Back in the day, it was that people were actually copying off disks and then downloading a crack
2691480	2694280	file so that they could play the disks.
2694280	2700160	And that now it's because there are so many things that are included in the games now
2700160	2704840	that you have to be a part of that network for, that you have achievements and in-game
2704840	2710040	goodies, that people are discouraged from doing it because they're not gonna get any
2710040	2712700	of the bragging rights that go along with having the game.
2712700	2717680	And a lot of crack codes now are people who are trying to play their game on multiple
2717680	2724160	systems, who they just don't have enough authorization codes or something for it.
2724160	2728320	And the other thing, too, is they're saying that MMOs are the most successful when it
2728320	2734320	comes to anti-piracy because really it's not really that cost-effective to run your own
2734320	2736200	server for a lot of these games.
2736200	2742400	You have to take donations and you also just don't get the updates as quickly unless you're
2742400	2743400	playing Ragnarok Online.
2743400	2746200	Everyone, private servers, Ragnarok Online, fantastic.
2746200	2749120	I digress.
2749120	2751420	But the WoW ones are really jank.
2751420	2753520	It's kind of like one of those you get what you pay for sort of thing.
2753520	2760080	And I like that Sega actually gave some support for when PSO, Phantasy Star Online, went to
2760080	2763240	private servers when they shut down their own that they let people transfer their characters
2763240	2764240	over.
2764240	2768120	Yeah, didn't they release the code or whatever if you want to host your own?
2768120	2769320	Yeah, they did.
2769320	2771340	So that was really cool.
2771340	2775520	And the other thing they're saying is that there's so many free-to-play games now that
2775520	2780880	you can't pirate a free game.
2780880	2783520	It's free anyway, so why not?
2783520	2786880	And it's not like if you want the extra goodies in it, if you're running it on your own server,
2786880	2791180	then you've got to make all the extra goodies for it yourself as opposed to getting the
2791180	2794560	community content like how they did with Second Life.
2794560	2800280	So they're saying that in general, that with the scope of games and with how games are
2800280	2804920	distributed now, that the piracy itself has gone down.
2804920	2805920	Interesting.
2805920	2810440	I mean, when I first kind of heard the title of the story, I'm kind of like, really?
2810440	2814040	It seems like with a lot of the stuff we read about, it's up, especially with Torrance and
2814040	2815040	everything.
2815040	2816040	But that does make sense.
2816040	2820740	And a lot of MMOs really dominate, whether you hate them, you can't deny, they really
2820740	2825680	dominate a lot of the PC gaming market, and you really can't pirate those.
2825680	2829800	I mean, you can, but it's just not, I mean, when you do, you're definitely not getting
2829800	2833640	the same experience that a person who pays for it does, unless it's Ragnarok Online.
2833640	2841600	I like with your first person shooters, that you've got servers set up for online play,
2841600	2847160	and you get all these extra bonuses in online play that you don't get playing by yourself.
2847160	2850480	Or some that have it patched to where your LAN is disabled.
2850480	2856400	If you've got a pirated version, because I've noticed a few of those running about.
2856400	2862000	I've noticed a lot from more recent games, like the huge hits like Fallout 3 or whatever,
2862000	2864600	Modern Warfare 2, Starcraft 2.
2864600	2871320	Even without the cinematics, these games are huge, and I know that at home broadband connections
2871320	2872960	are faster than they've ever been.
2872960	2877480	You can go to Best Buy and pick up a terabyte FireWire drive for like a hundred bucks.
2877480	2882680	But if you want to really commit to pirating a PC game, the torrent's like 60 gigs, 70
2882680	2883680	gigs.
2883680	2887160	And it's like, yeah, all right, leave it running overnight, but it's like, that's just too
2887160	2888160	much.
2888160	2889160	I'd rather just buy it.
2889160	2890160	I don't know.
2890160	2894360	Of course, I think Matt's giving me stink eye right now.
2894360	2895440	We'll see.
2895440	2896440	That's what everyone would like to hear.
2896440	2901580	The thing is that it's really slow, but honestly, it doesn't take much.
2901580	2904080	And there's a lot of communities out there that don't use BitTorrent anymore.
2904080	2911780	They use file sharing sites like MegaUpload or the RapidShare, MediaFire, all that stuff.
2911780	2918700	And they have programs like JDownloader, which will actually allow you to, if you don't have
2918700	2922640	a membership or whatever to those sites, it'll automatically wait the 30 seconds or whatever
2922640	2925960	to download your file, move to the next one, and so on and so forth.
2925960	2930200	Then it's very automatic overnight, and the download speeds are a lot faster.
2930200	2937720	Or there's also Usenet, which newsgroups and stuff like that, you can download a DVD in
2937720	2938720	like an hour.
2938720	2941800	This question's gonna sound totally random, but I think it's worth asking.
2941800	2943880	What about bandwidth caps from providers, though?
2943880	2948920	Like Comcast has a hard cap of 250 gigabytes that you're allowed to transfer a month before
2948920	2951960	they call your house and threaten you.
2951960	2955920	And with these 70 gigabyte games, you're taking a big chunk of that.
2955920	2959840	Well, 70 gigabyte games, I mean, there's no games that are 70 gigabytes.
2959840	2963880	Yeah, I think Salacious Pop might have been exaggerating a little bit, but I wanna say
2963880	2965920	Starcraft 2 is at least 20.
2965920	2969560	Well, like Fallout 3 Game of the Year, if it's not compressed at all, that's the big
2969560	2970560	game.
2970560	2975640	Yeah, but everything's compressed, I mean, you're talking like the most, you're gonna
2975640	2981880	probably have two DVD9 disk images or whatever, you're looking at 18 gigs or something like
2981880	2982880	that.
2982880	2986860	Even still, even if you're pirating a bunch of stuff, it's gonna be very difficult to
2986860	2989360	hit your cap of 250 gigs.
2989360	2993040	And I can tell you this now, I download my episode of Supernatural every week, because
2993040	2996280	I'm at Temple on Friday night, and so I miss it.
2996280	3000980	So I downloaded my episode of Supernatural, and I've just downloaded the first four episodes
3000980	3006680	of Being Human, Season 3, and the first two of the American version of it, like, last
3006680	3011880	night, while I was playing World of Warcraft, and Dan was watching stuff on YouTube.
3011880	3013240	So it's really not that hard.
3013240	3016720	Are you not able to, well, TV shows are kind of a different thing, though, are you not
3016720	3021400	able to watch Supernatural online, like on the official website or anything like that?
3021400	3025680	Well, they don't have the episodes up on the CW website, and they put them up like a week
3025680	3031880	later on Amazon for $1.99, but I just download HD copies.
3031880	3036480	Well, there's a certain channel that I don't get on my cable, but every week I will go
3036480	3041400	on the website and watch the best and funniest show on all of television right now, RuPaul's
3041400	3042440	Drag Race.
3042440	3043440	Every week.
3043440	3047000	I will go on and watch that on Logo's website.
3047000	3050160	Well, I don't think you can watch the Colbert Report and The Daily Show.
3050160	3051160	Yeah, you can watch a lot of stuff online.
3051160	3052160	It doesn't even have to be, like, Hulu or whatever.
3052160	3053160	You can go on the website.
3053160	3055080	Survivor every week is there.
3055080	3058720	Amazing Race is on tonight, and I probably won't get to watch it because I'm doing this
3058720	3062200	show, but I'll watch it on CBS.com tomorrow.
3062200	3064840	Yeah, CW's kind of janky that way with...
3064840	3065840	That's weird.
3065840	3070600	And it's fine because, honestly, I hate commercials because I really think that most television
3070600	3074960	is absolutely stupid, and I think most commercials are absolutely stupid and I don't like being
3074960	3076520	talked down to.
3076520	3081880	So I'll just download the episode of Supernatural and just watch it, and, like, if I'm in the
3081880	3086280	middle of chatting with somebody, I can pause my episode, chat, and then go back and finish
3086280	3092440	watching the episode, or I can, you know, go mining or something.
3092440	3094940	Let me rewind a little bit in the chat room.
3094940	3098240	This is going back to the previous story, but it's worth saying.
3098240	3102440	We were talking about King's Quest, Rickster's in our chat room at chat.orangetontrady.com
3102440	3105000	saying, reboot Space Quest.
3105000	3106000	Yes.
3106000	3110880	Do you think that possibly if King's Quest were to be successful, perhaps Telltale would
3110880	3115200	be interested in rebooting Space Quest and maybe, dare I say it, Quest for Glory?
3115200	3117000	One of the hero's games?
3117000	3121800	The two dudes whose names I knew in junior high school that I can't seem to remember
3121800	3124800	anymore, if they sign off on it, then hell yeah.
3124800	3127280	Al Crow and someone else, I don't know.
3127280	3129760	But sadly, somebody else got Leisure Suit Larry, didn't they?
3129760	3134000	So they wouldn't be able to do a reboot of that one.
3134000	3135000	I don't know.
3135000	3137720	Leisure Suit Larry is one of those things that I more and more believe was probably
3137720	3140060	better left in the past.
3140060	3141060	But I digress.
3141060	3142060	Let's move on.
3142060	3143060	Loki, what do you have for us?
3143060	3151880	Yeah, the last few games in that series have not been great, or good, or worth playing.
3151880	3156400	We talked a little bit about some of the stuff before, how there's been, you know, copycats
3156400	3157400	on the App Store.
3157400	3162680	In fact, there's even been, you know, I mean, no one's gonna say that there's not knockoffs
3162680	3163680	on the App Store.
3163680	3169120	I mean, hell, some companies have made a good business of putting out high-quality knockoffs
3169120	3170440	at different games.
3170440	3175200	But plain theft of actual games.
3175200	3183400	One of the games that's been hit with this is the game The Blocks Cometh by Halfbot.
3183400	3191640	And it was actually a Flash game at one point, but there's a, you know, group of people that
3191640	3200200	actually stole the game, and the assets, and everything else, and put it up on the Apple
3200200	3203040	App Store, and were selling it for quite a long time.
3203040	3204040	I remember this.
3204040	3206560	This came up on the show about a month ago when this first happened.
3206560	3211920	Yes, and it was just like, you know, they were trying to get, you know, people trying
3211920	3216600	to get Apple's attention to get it taken down.
3216600	3222080	Because seriously, the game actually broke into the top 100 as a 99-cent app.
3222080	3229600	It not only made it into the top 100, but they also had it on the new and noteworthy
3229600	3230880	section of the App Store.
3230880	3235840	So it got a lot of attention as the knockoff game.
3235840	3238720	And now it's finally back.
3238720	3243560	The real game is out there now, so that's kind of cool.
3243560	3248480	So that's pretty sweet that they're able to actually get their game on the market.
3248480	3251960	But I mean, a lot of damage has been done, and people already have, like, the old version
3251960	3252960	of the game.
3252960	3254720	So it kind of sucks.
3254720	3255720	What can be done about this, though?
3255720	3258680	It's very interesting, because Apple, you know, their people don't really know how to
3258680	3260600	screen for copyrighted stuff.
3260600	3263760	I mean, I'm sure if somebody tried to put out Super Mario Brothers on the marketplace,
3263760	3264760	they'd kind of get that.
3264760	3267320	But, you know, a game like this, I gotta be honest.
3267320	3270080	I wouldn't have known it was a stolen game, either.
3270080	3271080	No.
3271080	3272760	You don't have time to play everything.
3272760	3273760	Exactly.
3273760	3276400	So how do you stop theft like that?
3276400	3280960	I know Xbox Live, the indie marketplace, does a peer review.
3280960	3281960	Is that the answer?
3281960	3283960	I don't know.
3283960	3286640	It might be the answer, I don't know.
3286640	3289320	But it's not the only game that happened to it.
3289320	3292640	There was another game, I don't remember the hell it's called, but it was some game with
3292640	3293640	fighting animals.
3293640	3301300	It was like a 3D fighter game, and that actually had a version of it, you know, ripped off
3301300	3302300	and put on there.
3302300	3305920	A little bit different situation with that is people that they claimed they were sold
3305920	3310560	the rights to the game and stuff like that, but, you know, the developer said, no, you
3310560	3315680	only have the rights to, you know, this, for, you know, the Flash game or something like
3315680	3316680	that.
3316680	3317680	We have the rights to do this.
3317680	3319040	So there's a big ol' thing about that.
3319040	3321600	Well, that's not so much a blatant ripoff.
3321600	3325360	That's just two people not knowing how to talk to each other by people like companies.
3325360	3326360	Something like that, yeah.
3326360	3331640	Well, that's not the only game that's also kind of in hot water with Apple.
3331640	3334400	Smurfs Village, obviously a game that's out there.
3334400	3337000	It's free to play, sort of.
3337000	3339360	They call it like a freemium game.
3339360	3346960	Well, there's been a lot of complaints from Capcom, or, you know, to Apple, I guess.
3346960	3354560	Apparently Capcom, you know, they don't have good luck with the stuff on the iOS, I swear.
3354560	3360880	Mainly there is a problem that people have been racking up pretty huge bills with this
3360880	3361880	game.
3361880	3366920	Mainly do, I guess, Apple's iTunes protocol means that once you've entered your password
3366920	3372480	or whatever, all subsequent downloads and, you know, paid or free or whatever, don't
3372480	3375420	require a password to be re-entered for 15 minutes.
3375420	3379600	So say someone goes and purchases something on there, gives it to their kid to go play,
3379600	3380880	you know, a game or something like that.
3380880	3384560	He can go on the Smurfs Village and, oh, I'm going to spend $50 over and over and over
3384560	3386400	again and just keep racking up.
3386400	3389560	I'll tell you, it's really easy to buy stuff within a game.
3389560	3391160	It's just a little pop-up box.
3391160	3393720	Click OK to purchase dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
3393720	3394720	It's very easy.
3394720	3395720	Yes.
3395720	3396720	So, you know.
3396720	3397720	What do you want to say, Salish?
3397720	3401920	I was just, I don't even, you know, have kids in my household and I'm usually very protective
3401920	3402920	of my stuff.
3402920	3405520	For Amazon and iTunes, I always shop with a cart.
3405520	3409200	I never use one-click purchase just because that stuff terrifies me.
3409200	3413120	I want to be asked for my password every single time.
3413120	3414120	Yeah.
3414120	3419040	And there's also ways, I mean, if you have kids and, you know, this is something that
3419040	3422960	you're afraid that might happen, there is a way you can also disable.
3422960	3426320	First off, you want to make sure your settings have a parental lock on that as well.
3426320	3428640	You can also disable in-app purchases.
3428640	3429800	And it's opt-out though.
3429800	3432040	It's not opt-in, which is the problem.
3432040	3433040	It's opt-out.
3433040	3435440	So, you need to, you know, make sure you do that.
3435440	3440520	But yeah, apparently, you know, there's, I know we've heard there is, you know, kids
3440520	3444820	racking up thousands of dollars of purchases because they thought, you know, Smurf Berries
3444820	3445820	were free.
3445820	3450080	I hate to break it to you, kids, Smurf Berries are never free.
3450080	3451080	Here's the thing.
3451080	3455920	Like, I get where there's a problem on, I don't think that's really Capcom's fault.
3455920	3460840	I think Apple needs to make it easier to lock these things down and to be honest, I haven't
3460840	3463600	had to, you know, nobody uses my phone but me.
3463600	3464600	So I haven't had to explore.
3464600	3467960	Well, they're basically saying, I mean, yeah, I agree that they should lock it down, but
3467960	3472340	they're also making it seem that it seems like the kids aren't even aware that it's
3472340	3473340	costing money.
3473340	3474480	And then there's my other thought.
3474480	3480680	Why are you giving your phone to kids to play with these games without supervising that
3480680	3481680	somewhat?
3481680	3484520	Or why are you letting them play these games if you know this, well, I guess maybe some
3484520	3485520	parents don't know.
3485520	3489120	They may not know it's a free Smurf game.
3489120	3491960	I still think some onus is on the parents.
3491960	3495440	It is negligence on the parents' part for sure, but.
3495440	3498800	But you're right, you shouldn't mark a game free that's not really free.
3498800	3503000	They're not making it any, I mean, they're making it as easy as possible for it to happen
3503000	3508920	so that, you know, maybe say, you know, a kid rack up, you know, racks up, you know,
3508920	3511360	$30 with the purchases or something like that.
3511360	3517080	The parent might go, shit, but not think to complain to Apple to try to get that refunded,
3517080	3520640	you know, whereas, you know, thousands of dollars, they're complaining and then all
3520640	3523040	of a sudden, you know, Capcom's giving them the money back.
3523040	3527400	But how many times, you know, is this happening that they're not getting their money back
3527400	3529320	or not even trying to get their money back?
3529320	3536280	Yeah, now a lot of these mobile games and Facebook games, when you buy the perks with
3536280	3541440	the real money, the way that it's set up in the application is it doesn't say this costs
3541440	3542800	you $5.
3542800	3546680	It says this costs you 20 fairy dust points.
3546680	3548280	So the kid's like, oh, okay.
3548280	3553160	And when they refill their bucket of whatever, that's when that real money comes in.
3553160	3555280	So the currency within the game is...
3555280	3556920	Oh, like Microsoft points.
3556920	3564200	Yeah, or even Knight of the Clicky, the Squaresoft, you know, the Square Enix party points or
3564200	3565200	whatever.
3565200	3567040	It's not, there's always a layer of...
3567040	3568040	Party points?
3568040	3569640	They haven't even, they didn't do Gil?
3569640	3573080	I don't think, it's not really, I think they're just Gweenix coins or something like that.
3573080	3574080	Yeah.
3574080	3580600	They actually talk about this is money for dollars because a kid might recognize that,
3580600	3582560	but there's that sort of, I don't know.
3582560	3586160	I think it's a very, some of it's very dishonest, kind of sleazy.
3586160	3588520	Some comments from our chat room at chat.orangelandtrady.com.
3588520	3593000	Tiger Claw says, on the iPhone or iPod touch, you can log off your account before giving
3593000	3594760	it to a kid to play.
3594760	3596280	There's a suggestion.
3596280	3599640	Defective Candy says, I see people who let their kid play with the iPhone in the store
3599640	3601560	to keep their kids occupied.
3601560	3604520	I've seen them watching videos and playing games.
3604520	3606280	Xlink says, parents are being stupid.
3606280	3609380	I have two kids and I know about what these games do.
3609380	3610380	And here's a clue.
3610380	3612800	If something is free, there's a catch.
3612800	3616180	So anyways, apparently though, like I was saying that this is a problem.
3616180	3622120	So Apple, according to a well-placed source rumor, I guess, Apple has sold Capcom in no
3622120	3626920	uncertain terms that its freemium children's game has been causing problems with an increasingly
3626920	3631000	significant number of parents who have complained that their children have been racking up large
3631000	3633460	amounts of in-app purchases without their knowledge.
3633460	3638320	In other words, our call center is getting escalated complaint calls because of your
3638320	3639320	game.
3639320	3642940	Fix it.
3642940	3644680	That's basically what that means.
3644680	3647280	Apple's taking all this slack for Capcom's game.
3647280	3652760	Basically from Apple and credit card companies because people are like, oh, hey, I didn't
3652760	3653760	authorize this charge.
3653760	3657560	Yeah, let's do a charge back and then Visa's on their ass or whatever.
3657560	3659240	So yeah.
3659240	3660680	Interesting.
3660680	3664520	I do think though, Apple kind of needs to own some of this as well.
3664520	3665880	They enabled this feature.
3665880	3668020	They made it so easy to do.
3668020	3673240	They need to kind of educate people and they're making money off of it.
3673240	3675140	And they approved Capcom's game.
3675140	3678240	So I think Apple needs to own up to this a little bit.
3678240	3682100	And I'm a loyal iPhone user and I think there's some great stuff, but I think Apple needs
3682100	3683100	to own some of that.
3683100	3686520	And it's not that difficult to, you know, patch this shit.
3686520	3690040	I mean, fuck, there's games that patch themselves, you know, once a week.
3690040	3691040	I mean, come on.
3691040	3692040	Just do it.
3692040	3693040	Just fix it.
3693040	3694040	All right.
3694040	3696040	Well, we'll see what develops with that.
3696040	3699920	Yeah, there should be a big disclaimer saying, parents, you need to fucking pay attention
3699920	3701800	to what's going on with your kids.
3701800	3702800	Seriously.
3702800	3703800	That still wouldn't stop it.
3703800	3704800	All right.
3704800	3706560	Anyhow, I got a quick story for you guys.
3706560	3711160	And this might also be filed under stupid parents because I really don't know who else
3711160	3712500	is buying this game.
3712500	3716080	But Loki, I remember I saw this on Twitter from Loki a couple days before I saw it on
3716080	3717760	all the big gaming blogs.
3717760	3719740	But yes, it is true.
3719740	3723440	They are reprinting the Super Mario All-Stars limited edition.
3723440	3725200	It's called a final shipment.
3725200	3728440	I'm surprised they didn't call it like an encore shipment or something like that.
3728440	3731840	But yeah, if you're trying to pay like 80 bucks for this game on eBay, you might want
3731840	3738240	to stop because on March 13th, 30 bucks will buy you this Super Nintendo game printed on
3738240	3739240	a Wii disc.
3739240	3740240	That's all it is.
3740240	3741240	No extra frills.
3741240	3742240	No nothing.
3742240	3744720	Well, there's a soundtrack thing in there too.
3744720	3745920	Oh, excuse me.
3745920	3746920	Excuse me.
3746920	3748920	Yeah, but I mean, come on.
3748920	3751400	That's basically included in the price.
3751400	3753720	And it's a limited sampler soundtrack.
3753720	3754720	It doesn't have like a full soundtrack.
3754720	3757840	It's just the Super Nintendo NSF files or whatever they're called.
3757840	3758840	No, no, no.
3758840	3762160	It's everything from the original Mario Bros all the way up through Galaxy and stuff.
3762160	3763160	Alright, fine.
3763160	3764560	But no, it's like one song from each game.
3764560	3765560	So who cares?
3765560	3768000	And that stuff's like all on the internet anyways.
3768000	3770040	No, but basically, here's the thing.
3770040	3771440	It's not in large quantities.
3771440	3774000	It's going to be just as limited as it was before.
3774000	3775280	They're just releasing a few more.
3775280	3778680	In fact, it was funny because they told us, you know, oh yeah, get some orders in.
3778680	3782200	Oh, by the way, you're getting exactly the same amount you got last time, which was jack
3782200	3783760	shit basically.
3783760	3787520	So yeah, I mean, it's still going to be limited.
3787520	3791360	But hey, you know, this way you might want to get a copy if you really want one.
3791360	3798440	But honestly, just tell yourself it's $30 for a goddamn game that they did nothing to
3798440	3800200	port it over to the Wii.
3800200	3801200	That's all it is.
3801200	3806740	If you want that soundtrack and you want that book, great, I guess.
3806740	3808720	But I mean, there's better soundtracks out there.
3808720	3811680	I mean, especially if you're looking for music from like Galaxy and stuff.
3811680	3815880	There's just like a multi-disc set that they have for Galaxy's music, and there's a lot
3815880	3819280	of really good stuff out there for it, but it's not this disc.
3819280	3825080	I'm also just saying, like, you could probably go to a flea market and find a Super Nintendo
3825080	3828160	and Mario All-Stars for less than $30.
3828160	3829160	And on top of all that-
3829160	3831360	And if they want more for it, talk them down.
3831360	3835720	And the fact that this game is going for that much money online, and the fact that they're
3835720	3839320	like, oh, well, we're doing you guys a favor and putting out a second printing of it.
3839320	3840320	You know what that means?
3840320	3842640	More of this shit is gonna happen coming soon.
3842640	3847480	I mean, you bet your ass that they're gonna fucking reprint that goddamn- Remember the
3847480	3851640	Legend of Zelda bonus cysts that they had for pre-ordering Wind Waker and shit?
3851640	3852640	How much you want?
3852640	3854680	But they port that shit over to the fucking Wii.
3854680	3857920	They're probably pissed they didn't think of this sooner before they put out like Mario
3857920	3862000	64 on Virtual Console and some of these other games.
3862000	3863960	But they could always do more GameCube games.
3863960	3870000	Don't worry, they can do it for the 3DS, or Mario Kart or whatever.
3870000	3872240	They could easily do it for another system.
3872240	3878120	And Nintendo likes re-releasing games without adding really any features to them, and people
3878120	3879560	are dumb enough to purchase them.
3879560	3880880	But let's also be real.
3880880	3884040	What else is coming out on the Wii?
3884040	3887320	There's that awesome-looking role-playing game in Japan that's not coming out here.
3887320	3888320	We've been doing-
3888320	3891200	There's nothing really from Nintendo other than Mario Sports makes.
3891200	3895060	They haven't announced a new title- Well, Pokemon, but that's not in the Wii.
3895060	3898120	This has to mean a new Wii in the works, right?
3898120	3899120	No.
3899120	3901800	What, they're just gonna stop doing Wii stuff?
3901800	3904240	No, it's not that they're stopping doing Wii stuff.
3904240	3906480	They just haven't announced anything yet.
3906480	3908560	They haven't announced which games are coming out.
3908560	3909800	They still have stuff in the pipeline.
3909800	3912240	They have the new Zelda game that's in the pipeline.
3912240	3913240	Oh yeah.
3913240	3915360	That's fourth quarter, I can tell you right now.
3915360	3920080	They have, you know, stuff coming, and then there may be unannounced stuff, and they may
3920080	3926440	try to pull the new play control crap again, but those are dumb.
3926440	3927440	I don't know.
3927440	3928560	They don't really have a lot.
3928560	3932080	They may just drag their feet until E3 and they announce a bunch of stuff, so who knows?
3932080	3933080	We'll see.
3933080	3936920	In the meantime, more news, Dark Sakura?
3936920	3937920	Yes.
3937920	3938920	I have news.
3938920	3940420	All right.
3940420	3946440	There is a clinical study about depression that was underwritten by PopCap, and this
3946440	3951980	is gonna seem like a big no-duh when I tell you what it is, that casual games can relieve
3951980	3955600	symptoms of mild depression and anxiety.
3955600	3959400	How convenient that that study was underwritten by PopCap.
3959400	3964460	But it was actually performed by East Carolina University's psychophysiology lab and bio-feedback
3964460	3970360	clinic, so it at least has a reputable study that was done about it.
3970360	3977440	They had 60 test subjects that met the criteria for clinical depression, and they played Bejeweled
3977440	3983140	2, Bookworm Adventures, and Peggle, and they all experienced a significant reduction in
3983140	3987080	anxiety and better mood.
3987080	3990680	Does this explain why sometimes, and I don't know how many of y'all do this, but like when
3990680	3995240	I am just like really bored and I'm sitting at home, but I'm just not feeling, you know,
3995240	3999060	it's raining out, and I'm just feeling kind of blah, I'll sit there on Facebook and play
3999060	4001400	that fucking Bejeweled Blitz for like an hour.
4001400	4004280	Like does that tie into this?
4004280	4006980	I will admit something.
4006980	4010720	You know that towards the end of my job period, I was very unhappy.
4010720	4011720	Right.
4011720	4012720	Very unhappy.
4012720	4013720	Right.
4013720	4017200	I would go to the bathroom and play Peggle.
4017200	4021420	I would like play two levels of Peggle and then go back to my desk, and I would always
4021420	4023500	feel better.
4023500	4028640	Just by letting off five minutes of steam playing a game.
4028640	4032900	Or I would, you know, I'd also go out and take a walk too during my breaks, but it was
4032900	4038820	just like that one little bit of distraction was like a little mental breath of fresh air,
4038820	4043160	and I found I could get back to work and do fine.
4043160	4045760	But does it necessarily also have to be a casual game?
4045760	4049760	Like it seems to me like Loki likes to blow off stress by blowing people up in Grand Theft
4049760	4050760	Auto IV.
4050760	4051760	He's been doing it for years.
4051760	4054360	That's not for blowing off stress.
4054360	4057440	I'm not, well I'm not saying Loki- That makes my coworkers more stressful actually.
4057440	4061280	I'm not saying like Loki's depressed or anything, but wouldn't you say that that's kind of your
4061280	4062600	way to relax?
4062600	4064600	It's your way to kind of unwind at work.
4064600	4065600	Right?
4065600	4066600	A little bit?
4066600	4068600	It doesn't really matter.
4068600	4072560	I mean, you can pretty much put any game in there.
4072560	4073560	People like games.
4073560	4074560	I mean there's lots of things.
4074560	4079340	But I couldn't sit and do that with like Final Fantasy II for example, which I was still
4079340	4080760	playing on my phone.
4080760	4083040	Or I couldn't do that with Street Fighter.
4083040	4087720	I can't play a couple of rounds because I just want to finish the game, you know?
4087720	4091160	But with a little game that you can sit and play a couple levels of and then come back
4091160	4096160	to later, it's easier.
4096160	4101040	You don't have a commitment to the game, if that makes sense.
4101040	4104440	That's yeah, and I think that's why I'm kind of drawn to the Facebook games in that regard.
4104440	4106560	And clearly I'm not alone.
4106560	4109280	Do you have a comment?
4109280	4110280	No.
4110280	4111280	Oh sorry, I was looking.
4111280	4114680	S2100 Matt in our chatroom says, I can attest to this.
4114680	4120040	Ever since I was a little kid, video games always chilled me out if I was feeling shitty.
4120040	4124320	Rickster in our chatroom says, maybe it's a bogus story to sell Bejeweled 3's new relax
4124320	4125320	play modes.
4125320	4126320	Interesting.
4126320	4127320	That is true.
4127320	4129440	Bejeweled 3 has a relax mode in it.
4129440	4132680	Maybe this is all some big marketing-ish ploy.
4132680	4138440	I mean, despite the fact I guess they do have a reputable school behind it, but interesting.
4138440	4147280	But I think that I would like to see the study repeated with other games to see if it's really
4147280	4153240	just casual games or if other games are involved in it.
4153240	4158480	But I do see where, just in my own experience, we're going and blowing off a little bit of
4158480	4162480	steam on a couple levels of a game, or you know, playing a couple levels of solitaire.
4162480	4168360	Or like, you know, my friend, she would do Sudoku puzzles to chill out.
4168360	4169360	That stresses the hell out of me.
4169360	4171320	Yeah, Sudoku puzzles make me more stressed out.
4171320	4175200	She's an accounting major now.
4175200	4177080	You gotta have something special to like those puzzles.
4177080	4178080	She loves numbers.
4178080	4184160	New study shows that people with anxiety disorder do not like playing Silent Hill.
4184160	4191840	Actually playing Silent Hill totally helped me with some of my anxiety issues.
4191840	4192880	Because they don't frighten me.
4192880	4195040	The games don't frighten me.
4195040	4196040	People frighten me.
4196040	4199420	Maybe Silent Hill sometimes can scare the hell out of me.
4199420	4205920	I don't find them frightening at all because I like the psychological aspect of them.
4205920	4208280	People freak me out more than the game does.
4208280	4209960	And fake blood freaks me out.
4209960	4214040	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says video games do help you relax until you start kicking
4214040	4216880	and screaming when you can't beat a certain level.
4216880	4219880	They really should repeat this study with Super Meat Boy and see what happens.
4219880	4221760	You know what stresses me the hell out?
4221760	4222760	That'd be awesome.
4222760	4227040	I'm not fighting games with Dan because he's a dick.
4227040	4229640	I love you.
4229640	4231560	He's a jerk when he wins.
4231560	4232560	He's a sore winner.
4232560	4233560	Yeah.
4233560	4238080	All right, well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what
4238080	4240520	games you can buy this week to blow off a little bit of steam.
4240520	4242160	We'll start in the US with Loki.
4242160	4245600	There's actually a pretty good selection of games coming out of this week, which is pretty
4245600	4246600	cool.
4246600	4250200	You know, starting things off, of course, the game I was telling you is playing.
4250200	4254160	Well, I haven't really been playing much during the show because I'm doing the show.
4254160	4259120	But Bulletstorm, they'll be coming out this week in the Epic Edition, which is on Xbox
4259120	4260120	360.
4260120	4264480	That includes an early access to the Gears of War 3 beta.
4264480	4266240	It's actually on the disc, which is kind of funny.
4266240	4274360	And then also the limited edition, which is on PS3 and PC, so you can check those out.
4274360	4278740	Bulletstorm is not your thing and you have a PS3, maybe Killzone 3 is more your game.
4278740	4282960	That's coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
4282960	4287680	Let's see here, Ys I and II Chronicles with the soundtrack.
4287680	4291520	That'll be coming out on the PSP this week.
4291520	4295520	Re-release looks like they're dropping the price of Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice and
4295520	4296720	Disgaea Afternoon Darkness.
4296720	4299680	Actually, I do think I remember seeing Atlus saying that they're marking some of that stuff
4299680	4300680	down.
4300680	4302080	Those are coming out this week as well.
4302080	4309960	The Dreamcast Collection on Xbox 360 with Sega Bass Fishing, Sonic Adventure, Space
4309960	4316160	Channel 5 Part 2, and Crazy Taxi, all for $30.
4316160	4324200	Knight's Contract, a kind of action game from Namco Bandai that's on Xbox 360 and PlayStation
4324200	4325760	3.
4325760	4327480	Track Mania, Built to Race.
4327480	4332320	Track Mania is an awesome game on PC, so you should definitely check it out if you have
4332320	4333320	a Wii.
4333320	4336840	That'll be coming out on Wii, I believe also on DS as well.
4336840	4338760	Such a great racing game.
4338760	4345680	And then, a crappy game called Rec Room, it's coming out on DS, it's a portable Wii game.
4345680	4346680	Party stuff.
4346680	4347680	Fun.
4347680	4356440	DeBlob 2 coming out on DS, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, no PC on that I guess.
4356440	4359600	I remember the original DeBlob, it was kind of one of those sleeper hits.
4359600	4363680	Yeah, not really a lot of people interested in the new one.
4363680	4364680	But if, you know, you have a PlayStation 3.
4364680	4367200	Because people don't remember the first one so well, it was kind of one of those under
4367200	4368200	the radar.
4368200	4376840	Yeah, the PlayStation 3 don't move, you can play it with that, so that's kind of neat.
4376840	4381180	Radiant Historia, that's coming out on DS this week.
4381180	4382180	That's pretty cool.
4382180	4388680	I don't know if this is a new expansion or what, but EverQuest 2, Destiny of Vilious,
4388680	4390080	that's coming out on PC this week.
4390080	4392120	Yeah, probably is another expansion.
4392120	4393440	EverQuest loves their expansions.
4393440	4397920	I'm surprised, that's just, that's kind of interesting that they're doing that.
4397920	4403280	And then, what else, oh, some no name game.
4403280	4408800	Chronicles of Mystery, Secret Tree of Life, if you like those hidden picture type games,
4408800	4411280	that's coming out on DS this week.
4411280	4416280	Um, that's basically it.
4416280	4420440	Alright, let me move over to Japan and talk about some of the releases over there.
4420440	4424600	This week on the Xbox 360, Bulletstorm gets a release in Japan, as well as a game called
4424600	4427560	Moochi Moochi Pork and Pink Sweets.
4427560	4429640	Yes, that's really what it's called.
4429640	4437200	It's from Cave, so, uh, you know what kind of game that is, it's like a cave shooter
4437200	4438200	type game.
4438200	4442480	I think this is like a two-in-one type of thing, so I think that's kind of a cute title
4442480	4443480	though.
4443480	4446320	So, you know, if you like your bullet hell games, there you go, some pink sweets for
4446320	4447320	you.
4447320	4454120	Also, speaking of like cutesy games, The Idolmaster 2 gets its release this week on the Xbox 360,
4454120	4457400	and I don't know if you remember the first one, but that was a big game, um, over in
4457400	4458400	Japan.
4458400	4459400	It never came out here.
4459400	4464240	It was a very, uh, Japanese kind of game, that I guess some of you folks might just
4464240	4465240	have to import.
4465240	4466240	I don't know.
4466240	4470400	Otherwise, we'll move on to some of the other consoles, uh, moving on to the PlayStation
4470400	4474800	3, uh, coming out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4474800	4482360	Also, uh, Bulletstorm Killzone 3 gets a release in Japan this week, and, uh, I don't know
4482360	4490880	how to pronounce this game, Lave Once Mermaid's Tears comes out, and Makai Senke Disgaea 4
4490880	4494720	comes out this week in Japan, speaking of games people are probably going to import.
4494720	4499600	That might also explain, um, some of the re-releases that Loki already went over, uh, Rune Factory
4499600	4505480	Oceans comes out in Japan as well on the PlayStation 3, uh, moving on to the Nintendo Wii real
4505480	4509600	quick to see if there's anything coming out in Japan, uh, yeah, they get Rune Factory
4509600	4515300	Oceans there as well, and then SD Gundam G Generation World, cause you just...
4515300	4518680	Like we really need another Super Deformed Gundam.
4518680	4521720	You know you love your Gundam games, don't lie.
4521720	4527920	Uh, also, it should be said that this is the week that the 3DS is out in Japan, it comes
4527920	4529960	out on February 26th.
4529960	4534120	I seriously thought about, you know, the impulse buyer in me seriously thought about importing
4534120	4536680	that, and I was like, no.
4536680	4541680	So uh, yeah, this is the big week guys, Winning Eleven 3D Soccer comes out on the 3DS, Puzzle
4541680	4550680	Bobble 3D, Super Street Fighter 4 3D Edition, Ridge Racer 3D, Sengoku Musou Chronicle, uh,
4550680	4557560	let's see, Nintendogs plus Cats in French Bulldog, Shiba, and Toy Poodle editions, um,
4557560	4564400	Layton Kojo Toukisuke no Kamen, that's obviously Professor Layton, and uh, Combat of Giants
4564400	4566840	Dinosaur 3D.
4566840	4570480	All of those are games that are coming out on the 3DS this week, so that's Saturday,
4570480	4571480	that's the 26th.
4571480	4574720	So what games are you gonna get on the 3DS when it comes out?
4574720	4578880	I'm probably gonna, I hate to say it, Nintendogs and Cats.
4578880	4581440	Then maybe the Street Fighter game.
4581440	4583440	You make bad decisions.
4583440	4584440	What?
4584440	4586200	Okay, Mr. Salacious Pop.
4586200	4591320	You know what, and I agree with you that it's a terrible decision that I too will probably
4591320	4595540	have to make, because I'll be honest with you, there's a lot of games that are coming
4595540	4598700	out on the 3DS, and not a lot of them interest me.
4598700	4603480	And the ones that did interest me, like Dead or Alive, well actually Dead or Alive didn't
4603480	4607600	really interest me that much, but you know, Street Fighter and whatever, um, but Dead
4607600	4611280	or Alive, not coming out at launch, coming out in May.
4611280	4616560	Dual Pen Sports, the Namco sports game that looked kinda cool, coming out in May.
4616560	4618920	It's not coming out right away, but uh.
4618920	4621280	So why do we all feel the need to buy one at launch?
4621280	4622520	I don't.
4622520	4624240	I'm just gonna wait until May.
4624240	4625240	I think it looks cool.
4625240	4627180	I actually wanna, I don't know.
4627180	4630080	I do this kind of stuff, I can't control it.
4630080	4634040	I'm with you, I just feel like I have to have one.
4634040	4641320	See, some of us in this room are unemployed, and we like to save our money for things like
4641320	4642320	living expenses.
4642320	4647200	I, you know what, if I was in that situation I would probably do the same thing.
4647200	4650240	Even though we've paid off like all our bills.
4650240	4656360	I would sell stuff in the house, that's what, and it's not even any rational reason, I mean
4656360	4657880	it's just like ridiculous stuff.
4657880	4658880	Maybe the pilot wings game.
4658880	4660080	Dan's talking that he wants the Playstation phone.
4660080	4663140	Yeah the pilot games, the pilot wings game looks pretty awesome.
4663140	4664440	If it were coming out at launch.
4664440	4665440	Oh it's not at launch?
4665440	4670360	Well they haven't announced their launch titles, Nintendo's just like, we'll just keep it guessing.
4670360	4673280	Which means they're like, oh we got nothing.
4673280	4677400	Xlink in our chatroom says, Rob can I have your 3DS after a few days when you quit playing
4677400	4678520	it?
4678520	4680840	You can't see this but I'm flipping you off right now.
4680840	4684720	I want you to buy Marvel vs Capcom 3 so you can play it for a week and leave it at my
4684720	4686080	place.
4686080	4687480	You guys are assholes.
4687480	4691400	What should I be buying on the 3DS for you then?
4691400	4693280	Kid Icarus because you don't play portable games at all.
4693280	4694280	It's not coming out at launch.
4694280	4697480	Well that's, yeah, I can wait though, obviously you can.
4697480	4702720	Launch window games is, they're like, I love Nintendo, that's great.
4702720	4708960	Launch window games, it's this, from launch to 3 months after launch, that's not a window.
4708960	4713080	Launch window is that week, that is the launch window.
4713080	4716160	You don't launch for 3 months, that's not a launch.
4716160	4719880	3 months is a quarter, that's the difference between Q2 and Q3.
4719880	4725400	But anyways, if we're gonna say launch window, which games actually look pretty cool, Dream
4725400	4732000	Trigger, it's a shooter music game, which is kinda cool.
4732000	4738240	I hate even wanting to say this but the new Spongebob Squigglepants, the one that's like,
4738240	4741840	hey no no no, it's like WarioWare.
4741840	4744760	It's a WarioWare type game.
4744760	4749000	I got not to get, what was I gonna, not the Spongebob but the other one.
4749000	4754280	I was gonna ask about, oh, music shooter games, do we have a definitive date for Child of
4754280	4755280	Eden yet?
4755280	4756280	I wanna say we have.
4756280	4757280	It's like in June right now.
4757280	4758280	Okay.
4758280	4760000	I don't think it's got a date on it.
4760000	4761000	How about UK release dates?
4761000	4764200	Yeah we'll get there but I never did the PSP ones cause everybody was bitching at me about
4764200	4765200	putting in 3DS.
4765200	4766200	Sorry.
4766200	4771200	So quickly, the PSP dates in Japan, Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on February 24th
4771200	4775400	and SD Gundam G Generation World also on February 24th.
4775400	4777760	Alright, now ma'am we may go to the UK.
4777760	4782880	On the 22nd we have Cities in Motion for PC, the 23rd we have Alien Breed 3 Descent, Bejeweled
4782880	4789600	Blitz Live, on the 24th Speedball Evolution for iPhone, Bulletstorm, we have DeBlob 2,
4789600	4795000	we have Dreamcast Collection for PC and Xbox 360, Gray Matter, Killzone 3, Kirby's Epic
4795000	4801360	Yarn for Wii, Knight's Contract, Men of War Assault Squad for PC, Tactics Ogre Let Us
4801360	4808680	Cling together for PSP, and Two Worlds 2 on Xbox 360 PC and Playstation 3.
4808680	4812200	I'm efficient.
4812200	4814680	Maybe you should just start doing all the release dates.
4814680	4815800	Alright.
4815800	4819040	Just a few more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week and we'll see
4819040	4820680	how efficient she is on that.
4820680	4822920	Alright, Loki.
4822920	4828080	This is kinda odd but I guess Sony really wants to get into that market that Apple's
4828080	4832560	in so what's everybody doing now that the iPad's successful?
4832560	4838840	They're releasing tablets because that worked out well back in the 90s when tablet PCs were
4838840	4840320	first coming around.
4840320	4847400	Hell, my uncle used to sell them and he's out of the job now so that tells you something.
4847400	4854380	Anyways, yeah, they've come a long way but yes, apparently the Xperia Play is not the
4854380	4863000	only device from Sony that's gonna be allowing you to play PSP or I should say, yeah, PSP
4863000	4872280	Playstation Network apps or Playstation 1 classic games but no, they do have the S1 tablet.
4872280	4877120	It's a Playstation Suite certified tablet which means it's gonna be running the Android
4877120	4883480	operating system and they haven't really said what it's gonna look like although there was
4883480	4885800	a rumored design.
4885800	4891040	It was some sort of tablet that actually folds, it has like a screen that actually bends which
4891040	4902020	is kinda funky but cool I guess and that'll be coming out, I don't know, at some point.
4902020	4907140	But I guess at CES, you know, Kazurai said that Sony will launch a line of Sony tablets
4907140	4913360	building upon a video music game and book offerings on their Curiosity and Playstation
4913360	4918800	Network services, developing or delivering a compelling, unique experience to Sony across
4918800	4921800	the...
4921800	4925760	I'm sorry, that put me to sleep.
4925760	4929560	So yeah, they're putting out a tablet that's gonna compete with all the other tablets out
4929560	4932360	in the market and it plays Playstation 1 games.
4932360	4939200	No one, I wouldn't really be that excited about it because it's gonna be a fucking bitch
4939200	4942240	to play a Playstation 1 game on a goddamn tablet.
4942240	4946480	It's just like it would be a bitch to play it on a phone without any sort of...
4946480	4947480	Signs.
4947480	4948480	Agreed.
4948480	4954240	But, and here's the other thing too, why even bother spending the money to buy their stupid
4954240	4958360	tablet when they've already said, hey, you know what, we may just extend this Playstation
4958360	4961600	suite to, you know, the Apple iPad or something like that.
4961600	4965800	And a lot more people I'm sure have the Apple iPad or iPhone or whatever and they can play
4965800	4971040	their games on there but I for one, if this ever were to come out on the iPad or iPhone
4971040	4975080	or iPod or whatever, I wouldn't even play these games because one, it would take up
4975080	4979000	a lot of my storage space, which is a very precious commodity, and two, it would play
4979000	4982880	like shit because touch controls.
4982880	4986000	Here's what I want to know about the Sony tablet is how many pixels will already be
4986000	4991960	dead when I start using it for the first time, right?
4991960	4994840	That's the real question.
4994840	5000120	I don't know, it's just, I mean seriously, if you're looking to get a tablet, just wait.
5000120	5007000	I mean, because there's so many competing tablets out there now, or there will be, these
5007000	5011200	things have got to be dropping in price soon and it's just the longer you wait, the better
5011200	5015120	technology you're going to get in your tablet, the more you're going to get for your money.
5015120	5020920	So just wait it out, I mean seriously, there's no need to rush in to play Playstation 1 games.
5020920	5025560	If you really need to play Playstation 1 games, you can get a Playstation 1, a Playstation
5025560	5033400	2, a Playstation 3, a PSP, or you can emulate them on your computer, you can just wait.
5033400	5036560	I mean, there are plenty ways to do it.
5036560	5038860	Well here's something you shouldn't wait for.
5038860	5042600	If you have an opportunity to buy DC Universe and you're interested in the game, you should
5042600	5044200	buy it new.
5044200	5048780	Don't wait to buy the game used because it will be worthless.
5048780	5053200	Just like other MMOs, and this was probably pretty obvious to the PC audience, the game
5053200	5057320	comes with a unique serial key that you have to put in and use the game.
5057320	5060480	This is nothing new if you play WoW or anything like that.
5060480	5063480	But keep in mind, this is also on the PS3.
5063480	5067600	So if you see this game used anywhere, you don't want to buy this on the Playstation
5067600	5068600	3 used.
5068600	5072640	By the way, just I want to say real quick, Sony Online Entertainment has said, official
5072640	5075800	quote on this, that's why this is news this week because they did make a comment on it,
5075800	5081460	quote, once the PSN key has been consumed with a disk, it cannot be resold or replayed
5081460	5084000	with the second user adding a sub.
5084000	5087560	Only the original consumer can use that account.
5087560	5092000	They say the retail disk and the PSN code, they are one and the same.
5092000	5093840	Once you use it, it is gone.
5093840	5096680	A second hand user cannot obtain a new code.
5096680	5101120	And the only reason this is happening, and just because it's an MMO and because it has
5101120	5105980	a 30 day free trial, otherwise people would just be able to pop it in the different systems
5105980	5109680	or just loan it to friends and have 30 day trials for everybody.
5109680	5115240	Which honestly is not a bad idea, it's a good way to get people hooked on your game, but
5115240	5119640	no, this does not mean that they're going to have all of a sudden codes for every single
5119640	5120880	game out there.
5120880	5124120	I think when they do that, people will be pissed.
5124120	5125400	This is alright.
5125400	5127960	This is expected with an MMO.
5127960	5131480	With an MMO, it's really all about your maintaining your subscription.
5131480	5137560	So once you have that serial ID or that license attached to your recurring, they don't really
5137560	5143520	care where you, like with WoW, since I already have my $39.99 whatever for Cataclysm, if
5143520	5145880	my computer dies, I can just download from the game client.
5145880	5149240	I don't have to go out and buy another disk, because that serial number is attached to
5149240	5150240	my subscription.
5150240	5154920	Yeah, like I bought mine at Fry's because they were cheaper than mine than Blue Blizzard,
5154920	5155920	but they still worked.
5155920	5160520	But would you be able to do that with DC Universe online if you lost your Blu-ray disk?
5160520	5161520	Probably not.
5161520	5164400	But you've already paid for it though.
5164400	5166480	If you lost your disk, it doesn't matter.
5166480	5169520	It's not linked to the disk, it's linked to the game.
5169520	5171360	The game has a code on the back of the box.
5171360	5174120	Yeah, but how would I play DC Universe online without the damn disk?
5174120	5175120	Exactly.
5175120	5177520	Well, you would have to get a replacement disk if you lost your disk.
5177520	5182920	And you shouldn't be such a, you know, a klutz if you're, you know, oh, where'd my disk go?
5182920	5183920	I don't know.
5183920	5184920	I'm just saying.
5184920	5185920	I'm just saying, it's not tied to a disk.
5185920	5188120	The disks are all pressed in mass quantities.
5188120	5190800	It's not actual, each individual disk is tied to a code.
5190800	5197940	It's just the disk packaging has a code printed on it, and that's what's tied to your system.
5197940	5203560	So you know, in theory, say, your friend has the game also, and he lost his disk, and you're
5203560	5206720	a kind soul and wanted to loan him your disk.
5206720	5207720	That is absolutely fine.
5207720	5208800	It will work just fine.
5208800	5212680	It's just that he can't go and say, oh, my friend that doesn't have this game wants to
5212680	5213840	play it.
5213840	5216120	There's no extra code.
5216120	5224000	Although, if they were smart, what they would do is they would have it, oh, okay, I don't
5224000	5226400	have a code for this game, but I have the disk.
5226400	5228120	I want to play, you know, online.
5228120	5232200	Okay, well, you can pay a small fee, and we'll give you a code, and then you can play the
5232200	5233200	game.
5233200	5236480	Well, actually, they wouldn't want that because they're afraid of piracy.
5236480	5240720	But yeah, it's, they should still try to make money off of it.
5240720	5244440	Dartatsuya in our chatroom says, I can't believe they wouldn't let you retire the code if you
5244440	5247080	canceled your subscription.
5247080	5251960	You know what sucks is when I had Final Fantasy XI on the PC, I bought it again on the 360,
5251960	5255800	and I still have a code floating around somewhere out there I never used to actually get in
5255800	5257080	the game and get 30 days free.
5257080	5261400	Well, and here's the other thing, too, about, you know, the DC Universe thing.
5261400	5266600	Let's just say it's not as prone with, as the 360, but let's say your system dies.
5266600	5267600	Crap.
5267600	5271000	Because it's tied to your system.
5271000	5274880	I guess you have to call their customer service.
5274880	5275880	Alright.
5275880	5280800	Well, anyhow, I got one more, uh, no, wait, I lied, that's it, that was my last story.
5280800	5283880	So now is the part of the show where we get into the classic game of the week.
5283880	5289840	Let's stop, let's stop talking about all these newfangled MMOs and playing things online
5289840	5292760	for 30 days for free in serial numbers.
5292760	5298800	Let's go back to a day when we had a single-player game in front of us on the TV and we liked
5298800	5299800	it.
5299800	5302760	Well, this wasn't on the TV in America.
5302760	5304960	A single-player game in the arcade and we liked it.
5304960	5305960	And it was a two-player game.
5305960	5306960	A two-player game in the arcade.
5306960	5308520	What's the fucking classic game of the week?
5308520	5309520	Psycho Soldier!
5309520	5313200	I brought it up last week, so I figured I may as well talk about it, because it's a
5313200	5314200	notable game.
5314200	5321480	Even if it's not a great game, it's a notable game.
5321480	5328160	Yeah.
5328160	5329840	And this is why the game is notable.
5329840	5335520	It is the first arcade game that has a vocal soundtrack.
5335520	5339480	If you want to turn it up a little bit, this is the English one.
5339480	5348320	This reminds me of Lunar on Sega CD.
5348320	5349320	Yeah.
5349320	5351600	Actually, I think the Japanese singer is a little bit better.
5351600	5353480	The other link that I put was the Japanese soundtrack.
5353480	5355480	I'll have to call that up real quick.
5355480	5356480	But, um, huh?
5356480	5357480	It's not very good.
5357480	5358480	Not great.
5358480	5359480	Not great.
5359480	5363960	Um, however, this game, again, like I said, is notable for being the first video game
5363960	5367320	that had an in-game vocal soundtrack.
5367320	5370680	And it's a sequel to SMK's Athena.
5370680	5375640	And this is actually the game that the King of Fighters character, Athena Asumiya, comes
5375640	5378960	from, as well as C. Kento.
5378960	5382840	As that NES game way back in the game, right?
5382840	5383840	Yes.
5383840	5384840	Wow.
5384840	5390720	This game, as far as home versions, came out on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad
5390720	5391720	in 1987.
5391720	5395640	Let me go over to the Japanese soundtrack that you had pressed S for.
5395640	5398960	Oh, and there's her shining crystal bit, the little orbs that surround her.
5398960	5399960	Yep.
5399960	5400960	I see that.
5400960	5401960	Let's play a little bit of that.
5401960	5402960	I'm jamming.
5402960	5417920	A little less screeching in.
5417920	5418920	Yeah.
5418920	5425000	But at any rate, this game, basically in the first, in Athena, you play as Athena, who's
5425000	5428840	bored with hanging out with gods and goes off and runs and all to her adventures.
5428840	5430920	This is her descendant.
5430920	5436720	So basically, she's, well, running around with psychic abilities, and you have, it's
5436720	5440360	a side-scroller, but you have different platform levels that you have to jump to, because you
5440360	5446160	could just run into a wall or into a trap or something that would just completely kill
5446160	5449040	you.
5449040	5453200	So her buddy, C. Kento, is player two.
5453200	5456880	And it's funny, the outfits that they used in this game, which was her winter sailor
5456880	5462920	uniform, and he had some green outfit, they actually showed up in King of Fighters 12
5462920	5464880	as their default outfits, I believe.
5464880	5471720	Or either that or her sailor uniform was her alternate outfit, but they're in the game,
5471720	5472720	anyway.
5472720	5479080	And of course, Team China and then multiple teams that you could build had remixes of
5479080	5480080	this theme.
5480080	5483120	Like, I think I put one in as well.
5483120	5486320	But it's actually kind of a fun little time waster.
5486320	5489940	Like I said, it's a side-scroller, you've got different levels, you have rocks and destructible
5489940	5495720	objects, you can blow them up, and you've got different enemies, and you basically go
5495720	5499840	horizontally across the screen and get past all of these objects, and you can use your
5499840	5504920	psycho energy to get different attacks, either by using a shield of rotating spears, which
5504920	5507520	was one of her moves in King of Fighters.
5507520	5514360	And just real quick, the remix is now playing in the background.
5514360	5520400	And basically, they've got the same ability, there's no real major difference, except the
5520400	5522720	special items happen to be different.
5522720	5529880	Athena gets a phoenix, and Kensou gets a dragon, as they're psycho creatures.
5529880	5535280	But they both have pretty much the same attack, it clears out the enemies in front of them,
5535280	5539000	or rams them into an enemy.
5539000	5546480	The Japanese soundtrack for this was actually done by pop idol Kaori Shimizu, and I don't
5546480	5550400	know who did the English one because she doesn't sing very well.
5550400	5558480	And the song came out on a cassette that was only available for people who purchased the
5558480	5561320	Famicom version of Athena.
5561320	5566400	So it also not only has just the song on there, it had a special vocal version of the ending
5566400	5568200	theme.
5568200	5572360	And the theme song has, like I said, been used in King of Fighters.
5572360	5578440	It was the Psycho Soldier team in 94, and King of Fighters 96, and it was Athena's theme
5578440	5584560	in King of Fighters 97, and King of Fighters 2002.
5584560	5590920	As far as the versions that came out, the ZX Spectrum version was in 87 by Imagine Software.
5590920	5596600	And it kind of got some decent success, it got an 8 out of 10 for one rating, and a 6
5596600	5603360	out of 10 for 77, and 75% for other places, but said it was really slow.
5603360	5607400	Well Athena and Kenso have both been in the King of Fighters series, they've also of course
5607400	5610280	been in SNK vs. Capcom.
5610280	5620440	They were, in King of Fighters 12 Athena was wearing her sailor outfit, and Kenso was in
5620440	5627400	his original outfit as a striker for King of Fighters 2000, as Psycho Soldier Kenso.
5627400	5634680	Also the Psycho Armor and Psycho Shield were both in the game Crystalis on the NES.
5634680	5643680	And that's pretty much it, it's a fun little waste of time, I've got a main ROM of it.
5643680	5648440	There it is, your classic game of the week, Psycho Soldier.
5648440	5649440	You see why it's notable.
5649440	5650440	I do.
5650440	5652920	First in-game vocal soundtrack.
5652920	5653920	I do.
5653920	5654920	Very cool.
5654920	5657520	Alright well we are going to take a quick break here live, but don't go anywhere because
5657520	5660980	we're going to be back with part B of the show tonight, including the Twitter topics,
5660980	5664840	be sure to get those in if you haven't already at twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we're going
5664840	5669880	to get into some rapid news, including some surprising game cancellations, some surprise
5669880	5674400	download content that showed up among some other things, and of course we have some more
5674400	5679000	news development in a lawsuit against Activision, and we'll talk about that.
5679000	5684160	It'll make a lot of you Activision, anti-Activision people very happy to hear that this is proceeding.
5684160	5688040	Of course the mailbag, the FUs of the week, it is all coming up when we come back with
5688040	5695480	more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5695480	5697960	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5697960	5704960	We are live on this February the 20th of 2011 with the 402nd episode of our show.

5716960	5721520	We're going to get back into some gaming news here real quick, some quick, quick topics,
5721520	5726320	but first, before I do the plugs for the other shows, Loki is over there giggling playing
5726320	5728240	this game, Bulletstorm.
5728240	5729240	What's so funny about it?
5729240	5730240	You like this?
5730240	5733760	Just a lot of like, I like the writing in it, I guess, in the very beginning of the
5733760	5739800	game, like the tutorial section of the game, they have you, you know, interrogating this
5739800	5746040	guy or like, you know, he's trying to collect a bounty on you guys and so they kick him
5746040	5750240	in the face and lock him into an airlock and then get him, see he gets sucked out and then
5750240	5751240	there's stuff going on.
5751240	5755120	They're like, okay, let's raid the ship now and then they're trying to open this door
5755120	5762560	which pops up with the three red lights, like the 360, which is pretty funny, and then they
5762560	5768400	turn around and then they see the corpse of the guy near the window with the sticky mine
5768400	5774440	on the window and he's all, it's all, god damn it, and then the thing just explodes.
5774440	5776640	I don't know, it's pretty funny.
5776640	5780520	All right, well, let's get into some plugs for the side shows that we do.
5780520	5784440	Dark Soccer, you want to plug your sideshow real quick for folks that like this show?
5784440	5788000	Comic Insanity on Tuesdays.
5788000	5791640	We actually, we publish on Tuesdays.
5791640	5795160	We are at Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
5795160	5800960	You can find us on Twitter at Comic Insanity, N-S-A-N-I-T-Y.
5800960	5802500	We are awesome.
5802500	5803500	Listen to us.
5803500	5807440	It's me, Maren, Marvel, and Dan Shadow.
5807440	5812320	And if you like World of Warcraft, I suggest you listen to The Best Little Hoard House
5812320	5813320	in Azeroth.
5813320	5817280	It's my little side project about the World of Warcraft that I do with Extifer where we
5817280	5819760	talk about all things WoW but not too seriously.
5819760	5824360	And it's available on iTunes, and there will be a real website coming soon.
5824360	5830260	Meanwhile, let's get back into the video game news with some quick news stories.
5830260	5833160	And then your Twitter topics will be coming up, so this is your very last chance to get
5833160	5834760	those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
5834760	5837640	Loki, why don't you do some rapid news?
5837640	5842360	EA has rejected Mirror's Edge 2.
5842360	5843360	That's sad.
5843360	5849240	So you'll see another Mirror's Edge for sure, it's just a matter of when that time is and
5849240	5850240	what we do with it.
5850240	5855020	We have a small team on it, and I'm excited about what we'll do.
5855020	5857200	I guess it just maybe didn't make enough money for them.
5857200	5863840	Right now DICE is working on Battlefield 3, so I'm sure that's got a lot of time being
5863840	5866600	utilized on that and resources.
5866600	5873760	I'm sure there'll be a Mirror's Edge 2 at some point, but maybe not.
5873760	5877560	And of course EA responded a little bit about it as well.
5877560	5883640	They're saying that Mirror's Edge is an important franchise built by DICE Studio in Stockholm.
5883640	5892800	Of course, DICE is currently working on Battlefield 3, nothing further to announce.
5892800	5896360	Maybe down the line.
5896360	5900920	It was a pretty fun game though, so hopefully there'll be a sequel.
5900920	5904840	One of the best Ridge Racer games is finally coming out in the PlayStation 1 classics.
5904840	5907600	My favorite, Ridge Racer Type 4.
5907600	5908600	Finally making its way out.
5908600	5913640	Of course, no JOGCON support, that's kind of sad.
5913640	5917840	You will be able to play the game though, very soon though, on the PSP and the PlayStation
5917840	5919080	3.
5919080	5926020	And I wonder if it's going to be released around the time that Ridge Racer 3D or Ridge
5926020	5929880	Racer Unbounds is coming out, so that's kind of neat.
5929880	5935760	No word exactly on when it's coming, but soon.
5935760	5945180	March, so probably around the time that the 3D versions come out, neat.
5945180	5949240	And then last but not least, Activision kind of lied a little bit saying that there wasn't
5949240	5956720	going to be any more download content for DJ Hero, however, DJ Hero 2 did get one last
5956720	5960920	little bit of DLC, and it's Pendulum, and it's awesome.
5960920	5966120	So the Pendulum Mix Pack, including Watercolor, Set Me on Fire, and Salt in the Wounds, that
5966120	5971560	is coming out for 640 Microsoft points or $7.99.
5971560	5977240	And of course the tracks can be purchased independently on the Wii for 300 Microsoft
5977240	5978240	points each.
5978240	5983400	I am a little disappointed that they didn't have a whole color or self versus self, my
5983400	5984680	two favorite songs on there.
5984680	5986280	But hey, whatever, it's pretty cool.
5986280	5991360	So definitely check that out, since that's the last content you're getting.
5991360	5997480	So since last week the big to-do was how Guitar Hero was finally put to bed, is it safe to
5997480	5999000	say that DJ Hero is being...
5999000	6000000	Yes.
6000000	6001000	Okay.
6001000	6004720	Because I know it's not as big enough of a title to get that big of a press release,
6004720	6005720	I just sort of...
6005720	6006720	Okay, so...
6006720	6008640	Yeah, as of right now it is.
6008640	6011500	I mean, who knows, they could always change their mind.
6011500	6016240	Just because they say, oh, we're never going to do it again, doesn't mean anything.
6016240	6019920	All right, let's do a couple of other stories here.
6019920	6023460	One of these is very interesting, speaking of the whole Guitar Hero thing.
6023460	6027280	The former CEO of Red Octane, who you might remember kind of started the whole Guitar
6027280	6031320	Hero thing in the first place before they got bought by Activision.
6031320	6036080	Kelly Summer is his name, he was the CEO at one time of Red Octane, basically says that
6036080	6038160	Activision abused the property.
6038160	6041620	Quote, Activision tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly.
6041620	6042880	They abused it.
6042880	6045240	There's no reason why Guitar Hero cannot continue.
6045240	6046460	It's a great product.
6046460	6050320	My gut tells me there is still a significant market for Guitar Hero.
6050320	6054840	Not every game can be a billion dollar franchise, but maybe that's what Activision wants.
6054840	6059280	I'd be surprised if they sold the brand as it proved to the world that there is still
6059280	6062060	a market for this product, and then show them up.
6062060	6064600	Look at how Take-Two has handled GTA.
6064600	6068680	They haven't thrown products out there, they've nurtured it for over 10 years, and it is still
6068680	6071080	a strong franchise.
6071080	6074240	Very strong words there on how Guitar Hero was treated.
6074240	6077760	I do like the comparison there to Grand Theft Auto is that, you know, there's nothing wrong
6077760	6080880	with just putting out one game every couple, or even three or four years.
6080880	6084560	If at least half of the content that they put out for Guitar Hero that was an actual
6084560	6090280	SKU, if they just put it all on the store as DLC, it'd still be around I think.
6090280	6092480	I think so too.
6092480	6097160	I mentioned this earlier in the show, oops, but hey, the third episode of The Silver Lining,
6097160	6098280	it is now out.
6098280	6103460	It's called My Only Love Sprung From My Only Hate, and that is available for you to download
6103460	6108040	on The Silver Lining's official website from Phoenix Online Studios.
6108040	6112360	The episode had been delayed a little bit, but you know what, it's free, and so if they
6112360	6116220	need to take more time to polish things up, then that's what they've got to do.
6116220	6121000	You can download the third episode by itself if you already have the first two episodes,
6121000	6125360	but if you want, you can also just get all three episodes in one big fat download.
6125360	6130320	You do have to register for the Phoenix Online Fan Club in order to download the episode.
6130320	6134640	I guess nothing is really for free, but hey, you know, I don't know about you guys, but
6134640	6140200	I have an email address that I sign up for everything with that's not my regular email.
6140200	6144600	We mentioned this quickly last week, but the Hansel and Gretelbot pack is now out for Little
6144600	6149160	Big Planet 2, so that is out there.
6149160	6154700	I guess there's this whole full story, cut scenes, voice acting, original score, prizes
6154700	6157220	to get, it's all available out there.
6157220	6164720	There is also a patch 1.01 that is on the way, oh I'm sorry, it actually came out last
6164720	6170080	Monday, oops, but they do have a variety of fixes, it sounds like mostly bug fixes, no
6170080	6178320	like huge changes, but there is a more, they say a more accessible reset pod option.
6178320	6182360	If your pod gets broken for whatever reason, you can pause the game, go to the settings
6182360	6189200	menu and select reset pod decoration, so that's kind of a new feature that is available.
6189200	6190760	DarkSakura.
6190760	6199320	Well, and this one is something that I'm sure that my spousal unit is very pleased with.
6199320	6210960	Gran Turismo 5 Mega Patch, ooh, it is going to version 1.06 with lots of fixes, it will
6210960	6218240	have, you can start to monitor your B-Spec races from a browser, even if you're not home
6218240	6222840	and use your AI tweaks and do different stuff, because Dan was really getting pissed off
6222840	6230240	at B-Spec, and there's multi-monitor set up now, you can actually go up to 5 monitors.
6230240	6236380	So Dan the other day was talking about needing 4 more PS3's and monitors and I said, no,
6236380	6241320	you spent $150 on your driving rig plus a little bit extra getting those seats from
6241320	6247760	the pick and pull, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, maybe.
6247760	6253600	That is some crazy minority report matrix craziness with the 5 monitors.
6253600	6257800	It already had 3 monitors, well there's actually a YouTube app of someone playing 5 monitor,
6257800	6264440	5 monitor, duh duh duh duh duh, it was pretty hot actually, but I'm like, no, don't need
6264440	6265440	it.
6265440	6272960	So, Billy Mitchell, he's such a jerk, he just needs to go back to selling his damn BBQ sauce.
6272960	6278400	But he has opened up an arcade called King of Kong Arcade, and it's at the Orlando International
6278400	6288120	Airport, and it looks very Donkey Kong-ish, but there's no Donkey Kong machine in there.
6288120	6291560	Maybe he just doesn't want anybody else beating his high score, because Steve Weeby was still
6291560	6292560	better.
6292560	6297160	And don't forget there's a third guy now, there's the dentist Hank Shen.
6297160	6300440	And you know what else is funny too, apparently that arcade's been there for a while, they
6300440	6303360	just keep rebranding it as something else.
6303360	6304360	Yeah.
6304360	6309040	Well, now we have Step Mania without a pad.
6309040	6311680	It's a Kinect hack, yay.
6311680	6319520	So Maximus basically put out a Kinect hack that lets you play Step Mania without the
6319520	6320520	pad.
6320520	6324520	So you can play where you are, I guess.
6324520	6327640	I'd have to see this in motion, there's a video of it.
6327640	6330480	You can arm flail if you want to play some Step Mania.
6330480	6332480	I guess.
6332480	6336120	Good times.
6336120	6337120	So yeah, that's it.
6337120	6343480	Is, I don't know, is this what people find fun on Kinect hacking, Step Mania?
6343480	6349520	Step Mania thing though, they really only had it working on like the easy beginner mode
6349520	6355080	or whatever, I don't know if it would work for like some more difficult modes where you're
6355080	6360440	not just put my, you know, put my leg out this way, put my leg out that way.
6360440	6365280	It's an interesting concept, they'd really have to do a lot more to make it work in practical
6365280	6367280	use, right?
6367280	6368280	Yeah.
6368280	6371360	Alright, let's get to the Twitter topics tonight.
6371360	6376760	Every week you guys tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and we read your tweets here
6376760	6379600	on the show, and respond to them as appropriate.
6379600	6384600	Let's see, where are we going to start off tonight, we're going to start off with Blue
6384600	6389960	Swim tonight tweets us, did you guys watch any of the Daytona 500 today?
6389960	6392160	Wasn't there a song about a race in Daytona?
6392160	6394080	I think you know where this is going.
6394080	6395440	Uh, no.
6395440	6399840	We actually did watch it today and I have a word for the race, Rob.
6399840	6400840	Lester Fogg.
6400840	6403840	It's just crash after crash.
6403840	6407200	Seriously, that's what it was, because they were doing this thing where they were tailgating
6407200	6410320	the person in front of them to lower their wind resistance.
6410320	6415320	Yeah, but it was great though because they literally, it was like one of those things
6415320	6420040	you totally jinxed the race, you know, they're all, now we've seen some pretty good driving
6420040	6422680	today, all of a sudden, crash.
6422680	6427360	Like right, wasn't it right around when they hit 37 laps left or something?
6427360	6429240	And then it was won by the 20 year old guy.
6429240	6437520	It was like, well with 50 laps down, there were like six cautions already.
6437520	6439560	I didn't even know it was on today.
6439560	6441640	Dan was watching it because it was the Daytona 500.
6441640	6443760	It was on TV when I was visiting my mom's house.
6443760	6446640	He likes that car stuff anyway, obviously he has a whole set up.
6446640	6453040	But the thing that got me was that it was won by a guy who turned 25 days ago.
6453040	6456240	And he must be a very driven young man.
6456240	6460720	Now, is the Daytona 500, is that Formula One?
6460720	6461720	That's the stock car.
6461720	6462720	Stock, okay.
6462720	6463720	It's NASCAR.
6463720	6464720	NASCAR, okay.
6464720	6470280	But I still think that's pretty impressive, but it's just because he was being smart and
6470280	6473560	everybody else is like, oh, follow this guy, huh?
6473560	6474560	So.
6474560	6476000	All right, moving on to some other tweets.
6476000	6477000	This is Chio 100.
6477000	6478000	Matt says there's a couple stories.
6478000	6480480	I guess this is some big news out of New York City.
6480480	6485760	The famed New York City arcade Chinatown Fair is closing down after losing its lease.
6485760	6490080	And sends us a link with more information as to what's going on.
6490080	6491920	Let's see.
6491920	6496120	Several places are reporting, this is a story from, what is this, Gothamist.
6496120	6499520	Several places are reporting the Chinatown Fair, the famed New York City arcade and one
6499520	6504120	of the last of its kind still in the city, is shutting its doors for good very soon.
6504120	6510200	Let's see, according to a Chinatown Fair regular, they lost its lease after decades of being
6510200	6513200	in business and will be closing on the 23rd.
6513200	6515720	Not sure if that's this month or next month.
6515720	6520640	So wow, that's crazy though, because we just had the big news about Arcade Infinity shutting
6520640	6521640	down over here.
6521640	6526320	So that's really sad that, you know, you have the west coast and the east coast, big arcades,
6526320	6527640	just bam, bam, shutting down.
6527640	6529040	I'd heard about that arcade before.
6529040	6533320	I think they were a big place for a lot of the Bomani folks out there to be playing some
6533320	6534320	of the games.
6534320	6536320	So, sad to hear it.
6536320	6540600	That's so weird that that happened in such close proximity to Arcade Infinity too.
6540600	6541780	Weird.
6541780	6543960	Just sad for arcades in general.
6543960	6548360	This is sadly just not the first story we've heard about arcades closing down.
6548360	6550880	I guess they didn't have enough ticket spinning machines.
6550880	6556120	Well, it's just they, you know, they're not a draw for that, you know, shopping center
6556120	6557120	or whatever.
6557120	6559720	So they want to put something else there that's going to draw people into the shopping center
6559720	6566240	so they go spend money at those stores or so people want to put stores in those shopping
6566240	6567240	centers.
6567240	6568240	All right.
6568240	6569240	Tiger Claw says this is a tweet.
6569240	6573080	Can a controller be programmed to speed run Super Mario Brothers?
6573080	6574080	Interesting.
6574080	6579200	Um, it is a link to a story here on Kotaku, which means I have to load this whole framey
6579200	6580200	website thingy.
6580200	6581200	They gotta know.
6581200	6582200	CA.Kotaku.com.
6582200	6584120	Oh, is that like the mobile site or something?
6584120	6588440	No, that's the Canadian site, which they don't care about updating.
6588440	6589440	So it's the old format.
6589440	6590440	All right.
6590440	6593440	Well, apparently what happened, it's a controller that you plug into an NES system and it will
6593440	6598560	auto run speed, sorry, it will auto speed run Super Mario Brothers in just under five
6598560	6599560	minutes.
6599560	6603720	Uh, they are saying that the mod is real, even though some people were calling it a
6603720	6604720	fake.
6604720	6609000	I mean, I get, is this something like, is the point behind this, like, so you could
6609000	6611920	plug this in and say, Hey guys, look what I can do.
6611920	6615760	And then you just like kind of mash the buttons unrealistically and it's actually doing the
6615760	6616840	speed run for you.
6616840	6619200	Like is, that's gotta be the purpose behind this, right?
6619200	6623600	I think that it's just because, Hey, let's see if we can do this as basically.
6623600	6624600	Or that.
6624600	6625600	Or that.
6625600	6629720	Uh, Gamer Girl sends us a tweet saying, just had to say, I've been a member of OLR since
6629720	6630720	2002.
6630720	6631720	Thanks for the awesome show guys.
6631720	6632720	Wow.
6632720	6633720	That's a very long time.
6633720	6635200	Thank you for listening that long.
6635200	6640120	Uh, we have a couple people tweeting us about this, so, uh, I should read this.
6640120	6644880	Both Defective Candy and Tiger Claw tweeted us this story and it's about Mexico State
6644880	6648340	Congress asks for a ban of a video game.
6648340	6650840	It's Call of Juarez, the cartel.
6650840	6654680	And uh, this is because, you know, there's a lot of violence unfortunately going on in
6654680	6655720	Mexico right now.
6655720	6657680	You've probably heard the stories in the news and so forth.
6657680	6659640	It's especially bad like right around the border.
6659640	6663360	Well, apparently, uh, federal authorities, uh, in Mexico want to ban the game Call of
6663360	6668560	Juarez, the cartel, because it is based on drug cartel shootouts in, uh, Ciudad Juarez.
6668560	6671360	Um, what do you guys think?
6671360	6676920	It's just a video game, wham, or yeah, this maybe hits a little too close to home.
6676920	6682360	I wouldn't even bother with it because Call of Juarez doesn't sell that well, so yeah,
6682360	6688560	it sucks it's coming out, but not a lot of people are going to take notice.
6688560	6693160	Yeah, I, uh, I kind of agree it's not that big of a game.
6693160	6694160	Yeah.
6694160	6699360	I don't know, but it has its fans, so it'll probably be some people.
6699360	6702880	You know, and also, and we hear from some, we have some listeners that live in Mexico
6702880	6708360	and you know, it's kind of, they have to rely a lot on getting the games from other countries
6708360	6714320	anyway because not a lot of video game companies kind of have a base in Mexico, so it is always
6714320	6718640	kind of a bummer when things are just held back even more, but that might be something
6718640	6720920	that does hit a little close to home.
6720920	6724420	One more tweet here from Dark Tetsuya, who tweets us saying, so it's a couple months
6724420	6729080	till WonderCon, but this year I should have something for all three days this time.
6729080	6733560	I forgot WonderCon is coming up, that's a pretty big to-do in the Bay Area, right?
6733560	6734840	April 1st through the 3rd?
6734840	6736280	Yes, sorry, I was yawning.
6736280	6739000	Oh, that's alright, it's second only to Comic-Con, right?
6739000	6740000	Yeah.
6740000	6743120	So there might be some game announcements there because that's probably not too long
6743120	6746760	after Game Developers Conference before E3, you never know, sometimes we see some game
6746760	6747760	announcements.
6747760	6750140	It has some panels and some celebrity appearances.
6750140	6754200	I'm used to it being like usually, you said it was in April?
6754200	6755560	April 1st through 3rd.
6755560	6759880	Because usually it's like, usually it's around this time, to be honest, February, Moscone
6759880	6764520	Center are nearby, so they must have bumped it out a little.
6764520	6766040	That's going to do it for Twitter this week.
6766040	6770720	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to follow us and send us some tweets.
6770720	6773520	Let's move on with some more news.
6773520	6782080	Yes, so this is another entry in the long saga that is, you know, people jailbreaking
6782080	6783520	the PlayStation 3.
6783520	6788840	Sony has finally released an official statement on the PlayStation 3 jailbreak, of course,
6788840	6790440	multiple jailbreaks at this point.
6790440	6797280	Of course, the PlayStation blog post warns users, notice unauthorized circumvention devices
6797280	6801240	for the PlayStation 3 system have recently been released by hackers.
6801240	6805600	These devices permit the use of unauthorized or pirated software.
6805600	6811400	Use of such devices or software violates the terms of service of the system software license
6811400	6819480	agreement for the PlayStation 3 system and code of conduct provisions.
6819480	6824120	Contribution of the system software license agreement for the PlayStation 3 system invalidates
6824120	6826780	the consumer's guarantee for that system.
6826780	6831480	In addition, copying or playing pirated software is also a violation of international copyright
6831480	6832920	laws.
6832920	6837640	Consumers using circumvention devices running authorized or pirated software will have access
6837640	6846320	to the PlayStation Network and access to curiosity through services through PlayStation 3 or
6846320	6847600	system terminated permanently.
6847600	6854760	To avoid this, consumers must immediately cease use and remove all circumvention devices
6854760	6860760	and delete all unauthorized or pirated software from their PlayStation 3 systems.
6860760	6867020	Now on top of this, people that they have detected that are doing this, they have sent
6867020	6874480	emails to saying, hey, this is your one chance to stop, you know, stop using this modified
6874480	6882240	software, change your ways or else you can go the right path, the path of the righteousness.
6882240	6887200	You know, that's basically just saying obviously that they don't want people doing that.
6887200	6889480	Or they'll ban you.
6889480	6897080	Unfortunately, there is a PlayStation Network hack that has been put out there, a new hack
6897080	6901820	that claims to worm into the PlayStation Network and allow people to unban themselves.
6901820	6904600	The hack can also be used to ban another console.
6904600	6909360	All they need is access to that console's ID, which would have to be obtained from a
6909360	6919540	refurb warehouse or secondhand seller or some idiot that is willing to give up that information.
6919540	6920540	And it's kind of funny.
6920540	6927000	And then finally, Geo Hot or George Hotz, the guy that's getting sued right now by Sony,
6927000	6932000	has started a new blog and is asking for donations to go towards his legal fund.
6932000	6935320	And that what got him in trouble the first time was the PayPal link?
6935320	6937480	Yeah, but this is not for him.
6937480	6941360	It's going strictly to his, he got his lawyers okay for it.
6941360	6943280	So it must be all right.
6943280	6946080	It says donations here are for legal defense only.
6946080	6948320	I've checked my lawyers before setting this up.
6948320	6953840	If you have another substantial way to donate aside from money, let me know.
6953840	6961320	And basically he says Sony is, they're bullies, they don't care what you did was legal, they
6961320	6963840	don't like it, so they sue.
6963840	6972400	And I guess they try to sue a guy for getting his Ivo to run non-Sony approved tricks, making
6972400	6977760	it apparent that they don't really care about privacy if they care about control.
6977760	6984160	And they also says Sony versus Bleem and all that stuff like that, so he's talking about
6984160	6985160	that.
6985160	6988400	And he said they sued the wrong guy because he's a navigate against mass piracy, he does
6988400	6992880	not distribute any copyrighted work by his own, and he says he's not gonna take this
6992880	6999520	crap laying down, and he's even pro DRM in a sense.
6999520	7004960	Then he says, why should I care about personal, or your personal legal troubles?
7004960	7005960	You shouldn't.
7005960	7011480	And, you know, he says if I was taken to court for some sex crimes in Sweden, I would never
7011480	7014000	ask for donations.
7014000	7018840	I see what that's a dig at, yeah.
7018840	7020960	Let's see here.
7020960	7024920	Well let me ask this real quick while you're kind of skimming the rest of that there, you
7024920	7028680	know, I don't want to beat this issue to death, it's come up on almost every episode for the
7028680	7034800	past few weeks about this whole issue, but it does seem that this is moving faster in
7034800	7038580	a legal sense than these types of stories usually do, because I'm about to get into
7038580	7043160	another legal story about something that's been moving very slowly for almost a year
7043160	7044160	now.
7044160	7047200	Well you've got enough money, you can pay for this stuff to move fast, I guess.
7047200	7049200	You know, that's kind of the worry.
7049200	7052640	And he says, his thing in there, what if Sony tries to settle?
7052640	7057880	It says let's just say I want settlement terms to include other OS on all PS3s and an apology
7057880	7061320	on the Playstation blog for forever removing it.
7061320	7064120	It'd be good PR for Sony and lord knows they could use it.
7064120	7067000	And I want an eyebo.
7067000	7069120	Trust me, they're not all that cracked up to be.
7069120	7076200	Those batteries are fickle as shit.
7076200	7077200	See here.
7077200	7082080	It says don't need to help you, you're the reason I can't play Modern Warfare now.
7082080	7084080	No I'm not.
7084080	7090240	Kakaroto explains this really well, it says I have never played the PS3 online ever and
7090240	7094920	frankly I'm amazed by the apparent ease of which these cheats were created.
7094920	7099520	Security 101 is why, why is the security in the client anyways?
7099520	7104560	I had no idea this would happen, I am in full support of the cheaters being perm-banned
7104560	7106600	from the Playstation network.
7106600	7112320	So long story short, basically he needs money and obviously he feels that he did nothing
7112320	7119540	wrong and he very well may have done nothing wrong, it's just Sony owns your system according
7119540	7125360	to them and that's what he's trying to get changed, saying that you own the console that
7125360	7126880	you purchased.
7126880	7132760	And really the stuff that he did, he didn't enable piracy, he just enabled to run homebrew
7132760	7133760	code on there.
7133760	7136600	Other people created apps to create piracy.
7136600	7137600	It's nothing he did.
7137600	7143400	Granted, that's just like saying oh well, if he invented the gun, well he created murder.
7143400	7145720	I mean that doesn't really work that way.
7145720	7149480	Yeah he may have created something that could have led to something else but he wasn't that
7149480	7152880	person that initiated that something else, I guess.
7152880	7157440	Let me get to this comment from chat, I'm kind of over this story and I just like, let's
7157440	7161920	get to the resolution already because I'm sick of hearing about it every week, however,
7161920	7165160	I think this is a good comment from Dungeon Muster in the chat room, whatever happened
7165160	7169400	when hackers were underground types that let their work speak for themselves and left key
7169400	7171680	gen toons as their only signature?
7171680	7175360	Some of those toons were actually pretty good too.
7175360	7180200	There's still people out there that did that kind of stuff, a lot of people want fame and
7180200	7186800	I think once he hacked the iPod and IOS or whatever to jailbreak stuff and that whole
7186800	7192400	thing became kind of legal now, I think it's gone to his head a little bit.
7192400	7195680	Oh well, let's crack the uncrackable type of thing.
7195680	7199080	But I don't know, I don't know.
7199080	7202560	Alright, well let's move on to another story about legal troubles.
7202560	7205800	This one though, you might, I don't know, there might be people rooting for both sides
7205800	7207460	in this case, I don't know.
7207460	7213960	But this is about, remember this, No Doubt versus Guitar Hero, or should I say Band Hero
7213960	7216480	specifically, it's Activision Blizzard.
7216480	7219240	No Doubt, remember, took them to court some time ago.
7219240	7225000	Well according to a recent report in the LA Times, a panel of judges has agreed with a
7225000	7231460	lower court ruling which will reject Activision Blizzard's appeal to throw out the lawsuit
7231460	7237160	by No Doubt for using their likeness and so forth in Band Hero and you might remember
7237160	7242160	they had come out and said basically we turned into a virtual karaoke circus act because
7242160	7246120	Gwen Stefani and company was up there singing all these songs from Taylor Swift and stuff.
7246120	7250920	It's just like when Courtney Love sued them for having Kurt Cobain's avatars do flava
7250920	7252300	flave or whatever.
7252300	7258240	Which is really funny because almost in a nutshell, these lawsuits could also explain
7258240	7263280	why Guitar Hero went really wrong and it's not the lawsuits.
7263280	7264600	I'm not saying that.
7264600	7272760	I'm saying that this whole lack of care for the material.
7272760	7277760	I don't know if it's even lack of care for the material, but I think it's just that they
7277760	7283200	created characters and they just used these skins and maybe these people didn't read the
7283200	7284600	fine print or whatever.
7284600	7288360	They thought, they assumed that something was going to happen with their characters
7288360	7290400	only singing their own songs and stuff like that.
7290400	7297240	But at the same time, why Activision thought Guitar Hero needed all of these real artists
7297240	7298240	in their games.
7298240	7303100	I mean, Rock Band doesn't have real people in their games.
7303100	7305120	It's your own created characters.
7305120	7307400	Why do you even need these in there?
7307400	7310760	That's more my point actually was kind of what I was getting at.
7310760	7313960	And it's funny because I think I kind of talked about this differently the first time.
7313960	7317520	I think the first time we went over the story, I probably had said something like, you know,
7317520	7321080	well, they should have probably read the fine print, but now looking back on how Guitar
7321080	7326320	Hero has essentially failed at this point, you kind of go, well, maybe this really isn't
7326320	7330040	what the game should have been doing in the first place.
7330040	7334280	No Doubt and Courtney Love, I'm sure, are surrounded by lawyers all the time whenever
7334280	7338220	their image and their license is involved.
7338220	7342120	So the fact that both two separate artists, two completely separate cases are having the
7342120	7347360	same problem, that really kind of makes me think what shady stuff did Activision do when
7347360	7351460	they pitched this in the contract to both of those artists?
7351460	7354520	Like I don't know.
7354520	7356840	Maybe I'm just too inclined to think that Activision is evil.
7356840	7357840	Perhaps, perhaps.
7357840	7358840	Yeah.
7358840	7360680	Gosh, how many lawyers must Courtney Love have?
7360680	7363280	I mean, my gosh, she's got to have a lawyer to deal with everything.
7363280	7365200	She's got paternity ones.
7365200	7366520	She fights with her kid all the time.
7366520	7371500	She probably has a lawyer there, a lawyer for all her drug problems, you know, gosh.
7371500	7375320	Even she has a lawyer for the stuff she says when she's drunk.
7375320	7377720	The lawyer for her Twitter feed.
7377720	7381160	They should make a Pokemon style game out of lawyers for Courtney Love.
7381160	7383360	Gotta catch them all.
7383360	7386520	Real estate attorney, I choose you.
7386520	7390240	Protect my house.
7390240	7392160	Contracting lawyer, I choose you.
7392160	7394680	Fix my air conditioning.
7394680	7396880	I love it.
7396880	7398680	A Pokemon game based around lawyers.
7398680	7400320	I think we're onto something.
7400320	7401760	For now though, how about another news story?
7401760	7404240	Gotta sue them all.
7404240	7406800	Well, I like Sega.
7406800	7409880	I don't know anyone who doesn't like Sega or at least something Sega's done.
7409880	7410880	Me.
7410880	7411880	I hate them.
7411880	7413700	Bite my butt.
7413700	7419440	So there is going to be for the PCs Sega Genesis Classic Collection Gold Edition.
7419440	7427360	That's 46 of the Sega Genesis' games and it will be out on March 15th.
7427360	7433680	Sorry, for the list, we have volume one which has a bunch of stuff and two and three and
7433680	7434680	four.
7434680	7436520	No, seriously, I'll run through the list.
7436520	7440160	There's Golden Axe, Ultra Beast, Comic Zone, Echo the Dolphin, Gang Ground, Shinobi 3,
7440160	7443880	Return of the Ninja Master, Vector Man, Sonic the Hedgehog, Crackdown, and Space Harrier

7464600	7468240	And volume four, Landstalker, Shining Force, Wonder Boy 3, Monster Lair, Dr. Robotnik's
7468240	7472440	Mean Bean Machine, AKA Puyo Puyo, Streets of Rage, Church of Rage 2, Alien Soldier,
7472440	7476920	Light Crusader, Sonic 3D, Blast Gunstar Heroes, whoo hoo, Shining Force 2, Shining in the
7476920	7481880	Darkness, Toejam and Earl, Toejam and Earl, and Panic on Funkatron.
7481880	7482880	Micro Machines.
7482880	7483880	Seriously.
7483880	7484880	Dang.
7484880	7485880	All right.
7485880	7491120	I like Micro Machines, they don't make enough games based on them.
7491120	7492520	John Machine is dead.
7492520	7493520	Here's the thing though.
7493520	7496480	That's because he talked too fast, he got all the words out that you could possibly
7496480	7498360	say in his lifetime.
7498360	7502040	As nice as that collection sounds, I don't know.
7502040	7506000	This Genesis nostalgia, I think they've started to milk it for all it's worth.
7506000	7507680	Aren't you starting to get to that point?
7507680	7512480	Like that Sonic Ultimate Mega Genesis collection or whatever, I don't think, you really don't
7512480	7514520	need much more than that.
7514520	7515520	As far as Genesis nostalgia goes.
7515520	7522240	It's not one of our stories that was for tonight, but the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus,
7522240	7527620	wherever, they were giving you Genesis games as your perk for March.
7527620	7533280	They're not really featured that widely, but on Steam you can find a bunch of Genesis ROMs
7533280	7537240	for one to three bucks a piece, and there's a lot of them up there now, and it's like,
7537240	7541760	this is, I mean, obviously one or two bucks, sure, you got some money to burn, pick up
7541760	7544880	a few, you know, Phantasy Star 2, but it's like, alright, how many of these are they
7544880	7545880	gonna put out?
7545880	7549960	This is gonna run up to, you know, real money if you get enough of them.
7549960	7554680	Well they've got full packs out, you can download different packs of the games, but it's like,
7554680	7561240	in my case it's like, I've got this, and I've got a Genesis, so if I really wanna play it,
7561240	7566800	I'll just hook it up and play it on TV with the controller.
7566800	7570840	Sometimes the games just do not translate well to another platform.
7570840	7576680	And honestly, I mean, technically it's piracy, but I mean, seriously, there's tons of free
7576680	7583960	ROMs out there, I mean, you can download an emulator and a bunch of ROMs in minutes, and
7583960	7589520	I just don't see the point in paying a buck or three dollars for a ROM.
7589520	7595360	I mean, they've clearly made their money back on these things, I mean, dozens and dozens
7595360	7601920	and dozens of times, and I just, I don't feel any remorse for, you know, downloading a ROM
7601920	7606120	that's, you know, twenty years old.
7606120	7612040	Alright, well, let's move on with another story, and we'll get to the mailbag pretty
7612040	7613040	soon here.
7613040	7620520	Well, you know, it may be out for the music genre as far as guitar and DJ games go, but
7620520	7622840	that does not mean that the music genre is dead.
7622840	7628920	Oh no, Dance Games are making their comeback, and Ubisoft is seeing the result of that.
7628920	7636460	They had one hell of a quarter this holiday season, racking in, I guess, 809 million dollars
7636460	7647040	in total software sales, up 21% from 2009, and 60% of that, of course, was in North America.
7647040	7654720	Of course, during the three month period of time, they sold 10.5 million copies of their
7654720	7660120	dance titles, Just Dance, Just Dance 2, Just Dance Kids, and Michael Jackson, The Experience,
7660120	7667280	or Just Dance, Michael Jackson, and Dance on Broadway, Just Dance on Broadway, all pretty
7667280	7669440	similar titles.
7669440	7673320	That's pretty interesting that they've made so much money from that, and I can't believe
7673320	7679280	how well the Just Dance series is actually doing on the Wii, it's just kind of crazy.
7679280	7684880	Of course, next month, Just Dance on, or, let's see, I caught myself saying that, Dance
7684880	7691400	on Broadway on the PS3 will be coming out with move support, or actually, move required
7691400	7693160	I guess, so, be interesting.
7693160	7696280	I'm sure you have that pre-ordered already, don't you?
7696280	7699040	No, no I do not.
7699040	7703320	There is some download content, though, coming out for Just Dance 2 on the Wii, and this
7703320	7713680	is gonna add, I guess, some new duet choreography, and for 300 Wii points, you can download Y.O.Y.
7713680	7722000	by Love Letter, Can't Hurry Love by The Supremes, and American Boy by Estelle and Kanye West.
7722000	7725160	So that's neat.
7725160	7728200	Didn't realize that the game actually had DLC.
7728200	7732640	Another game, not necessarily an Ubisoft Dance title, but Dance Central is getting some more
7732640	7739080	download content, not quite as frequent as Rock Band, but at least they're getting some.
7739080	7746640	The Double Freak DLC came out this week, and with that, of course, Super Freak by Rick
7746640	7753160	James, and Sheik's Le Freak, both out this week.
7753160	7762240	Also of course, Missy Elliott, we run this, and Amaury, Heardemall.
7762240	7764240	Those are each $3.
7764240	7766240	Alright.
7766240	7771240	Lots of stuff going on in the dance game world, apparently.
7771240	7773800	People like to shake their butts.
7773800	7776920	Isn't it funny that last week with the whole Guitar Hero stuff, it's like, music games
7776920	7778200	are dead, and it's like, oh wait, another dance game.
7778200	7784200	I will not be surprised one bit if we see some sort of dance hero game from Activision,
7784200	7791200	because you know, when there's a successful trend going on, they're going to be jumping
7791200	7793320	on that bandwagon.
7793320	7794880	Alright.
7794880	7798960	There's some stuff that was going on with Portal 2 this week.
7798960	7803400	There were rumors going around that Portal 2 was going to support the PlayStation Move,
7803400	7807120	but apparently Valve has come out and clarified that in a press statement saying that Portal
7807120	7810880	2 will not include support for Sony's motion controller.
7810880	7815880	It was apparently a case of mistranslation going from an official German PlayStation
7815880	7818200	blog or something, I don't know, back and forth.
7818200	7821320	But it should be noted that there was this cute little Valentine's video that came out
7821320	7822920	for Portal 2.
7822920	7825920	It's kind of funny, it's out there on YouTube if you check it out, Portal 2, Valentine's,
7825920	7826920	or something like that.
7826920	7828520	It's something as salacious as pop.
7828520	7832600	It's the Aperture Science Employee Guide on romantic relationships at the workplace.
7832600	7834880	That sounds like, it's fantastic, I have to see that.
7834880	7836720	It's really funny and it's worth a look.
7836720	7841120	And basically at the end of the day, they announced, Portal 2 is available for pre-order
7841120	7842120	now.
7842120	7843680	And I was kind of like, well duh.
7843680	7847160	I mean, like if you want to go into GameStop, they'll take your five bucks to pre-order
7847160	7848160	Portal 5.
7848160	7852280	I mean, you know, it seems a little weird that they'd announce that, but maybe through
7852280	7856160	the official Valve channels or what have you, it's available now.
7856160	7859480	I don't really know, so.
7859480	7860480	There you go.
7860480	7866400	Portal 2 coming out soon, and I know I'm excited about it, I can't wait for that to come out.
7866400	7868680	Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag.
7868680	7872920	Alright, we're going to go to the mailbag, you guys send us emails, we answer them here
7872920	7874360	on the show.
7874360	7878360	Dark Soccer's going to dive into the emailbag and find some of her favorite emails to respond
7878360	7881760	to right now.
7881760	7884320	I was just taking care of some business.
7884320	7888560	No problem.
7888560	7891160	So first email, we actually got three.
7891160	7896080	We have one, it says, Greetings, OLR, this is my second email of the week.
7896080	7897080	Quick question.
7897080	7900800	I'm on Steam right now and see Black Ops, Crysis 2, and Bulletstorm for $60 each.
7900800	7902000	What is going on here?
7902000	7905080	Do you think these companies will actually make more money by raising the price of their
7905080	7906080	games?
7906080	7910800	I personally believe that there will be more piracy as well as more people like me willing
7910800	7913080	to wait a year for a good sale on Steam.
7913080	7918000	Your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.
7918000	7920620	I'm sorry, I missed something about the...
7920620	7924320	With Crysis 2 and Black Ops and those games being $60, why are they raising their prices,
7924320	7927360	you know, when more people are going to hold out for sales?
7927360	7932880	Yeah, especially Civ V went on sale over the weekend after I spent money on that about
7932880	7936480	a month ago, but whatever, Civ V's a great game.
7936480	7938080	Huge sale on Steam this weekend.
7938080	7945240	I was going to say, how long have those games been out, because Bulletstorm is new, right?
7945240	7950160	Yeah, Bulletstorm's brand new, but I think PC games, I don't think a lot of them have
7950160	7953040	crossed the $60 barrier, if I'm not mistaken.
7953040	7959840	Most of them are cheaper than their console versions, although certain companies, EA,
7959840	7966120	Activision, have decided, hey, you know what, Call of Duty Black Ops, yeah, we think it
7966120	7969600	warrants a $60 price point.
7969600	7974200	Might I remind you, they did the same thing for Guitar Hero on the Wii and Rock Band on
7974200	7975200	the Wii.
7975200	7980500	They said, oh, it warrants $60, despite the fact that you're getting inferior graphics
7980500	7985200	and support on the download side, so, eh.
7985200	7989480	Yeah, I just figured that the bigger companies, the bigger publishers, are just going to have
7989480	7996320	their MSRP, $59.99, they don't care what platform, even on a digital service like Steam, where
7996320	8000080	it should cost a few bucks less because there's no materials involved, they'll just set their
8000080	8004120	price to whatever they want, keep it uniform.
8004120	8008800	Yeah, I can see where the emailer's probably getting a little bit frustrated, though, that
8008800	8012720	you buy these games and they just go on sale a couple weeks later, but, eh, what can you
8012720	8013720	do?
8013720	8014720	Alright.
8014720	8017680	Let's, let's go on to the next email.
8017680	8023760	Okay, the next email up is this one, hi, LLR, I don't have much to say this week, I'm moving
8023760	8027920	to a new flat and it's all a bit hectic, but I suppose I should make this at least a bit
8027920	8031160	game related, so what do you think about the news of King Quest's return?
8031160	8034840	Sky was saying just the other episode about how it would be nice to have some new games.
8034840	8038040	On a side note, can I plug my new blog?
8038040	8045560	It's Moggy's Musings, M-O-G-G-Y-S-M-U-S-I-N-G-S dot blogspot dot com.
8045560	8046880	So you're around, Catastrophic Moggy.
8046880	8051720	I think there was a really good tweet from that, or it's a really similar name that I
8051720	8055200	liked, I had retweeted it on LLR.
8055200	8058560	Since I kinda already got into it in the show, I don't think I have a whole lot else to add,
8058560	8065120	I think it's gonna be a nice pairing, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes of it.
8065120	8069080	Yeah, I wanna see screenshots of it, but I'm fine with them having a license.
8069080	8075160	I want it to be more illustrated in appearance rather than cel shaded, but other than that,
8075160	8076160	thumbs up.
8076160	8080400	You know, and it's difficult because I don't think anything will ever be as good as the
8080400	8088640	original, but you kinda go, if anything's gonna be good, it'll be this, from the professional
8088640	8089640	angle.
8089640	8092840	I understand there's still the fan game, and of course the game is gonna be in good hands
8092840	8095900	with fans, but, you know.
8095900	8096900	That's different.
8096900	8097900	So.
8097900	8100000	How about the next email?
8100000	8102680	Yes, this is our last email of the night.
8102680	8103680	Alrighty.
8103680	8106560	I would like to point you guys to Reality is Broken.
8106560	8108980	It's a relatively new book about the psychology of gaming.
8108980	8112840	One chapter Rob and Jamie will be especially interested in is chapter 7, where the author
8112840	8116840	goes into detail as to why World of Warcraft is so popular.
8116840	8120200	Listen on the podcast every week, congrats on 400 eps, take care, Wendy.
8120200	8121200	Thank you, Wendy.
8121200	8123960	Hmm, are we sure they're not related to the author of the book?
8123960	8124960	Maybe a cheap plug?
8124960	8125960	I don't know.
8125960	8126960	I'm just kidding.
8126960	8127960	I'm kidding.
8127960	8128960	Yeah.
8128960	8130400	Well, I would definitely check out the book.
8130400	8136520	I'm definitely interested in anything that's some sort of psychological discourse, so.
8136520	8140420	As long as they're not mindlessly bashing on it, I'm curious, sure.
8140420	8144080	I think there's definitely a whole little psychological angle to what goes on in World
8144080	8147480	of Warcraft, so I'd be curious to check it out.
8147480	8151520	All right, that's it for the mailbag, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send
8151520	8152840	in your questions.
8152840	8173520	Meantime, we're going to get to the FUs of the week.
8173520	8182000	My first FU of the evening goes to this damn headache that I have had since, like, noon.
8182000	8188720	So fuck you to my headache, that's really it.
8188720	8189720	Loki?
8189720	8198600	FU to McDonald's having crappy fries later in the evening.
8198600	8203620	My FU of the week goes to being so sore, pain, hurts, ow.
8203620	8207880	My legs just, it hurts to walk from all the running I did yesterday.
8207880	8211320	Just remember to stretch out if you're ever going to do some sudden running or sprinting
8211320	8212320	or whatever.
8212320	8213320	Careful.
8213320	8214320	Slice just popped.
8214320	8215320	Do you have any FUs?
8215320	8216320	Any Yanks?
8216320	8223080	Uh, FU to having to deal with the California unemployment benefits department.
8223080	8225240	All right.
8225240	8229200	That does it for the FUs of the week.
8229200	8231680	Let's move on, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to
8231680	8235080	the phone lines and I'll tell you more about that in just a moment.
8235080	8236080	Loki?
8236080	8237440	Uh, yes.
8237440	8239540	This is kind of interesting, I guess.
8239540	8245960	They were showing off a video at the Mobile World Congress.
8245960	8250900	It was during Steve Ballmer's keynote, they were talking about Windows Phone 7 devices
8250900	8261320	and being able to integrate them with, I guess, some sort of Xbox 360 type control and stuff.
8261320	8267080	For example, they showed a Kinect demo where someone was playing the, I believe it was
8267080	8272400	called Rally Ball, that's one of the Kinect Sport or Kinect Adventure games where you're
8272400	8276600	bouncing balls off of your body and stuff like that.
8276600	8280200	Kind of like what they showed at E3 where you're just trying to hit targets.
8280200	8287440	Well, there's people with Windows Phone 7 devices that were able to see the same screen
8287440	8291920	that that person saw on the TV and they were tapping the screen to create different balls
8291920	8295040	to aim at the player.
8295040	8298800	So you can kind of play against people or play with people that are playing the Kinect
8298800	8300680	and Xbox 360.
8300680	8302840	It's an interesting idea.
8302840	8307000	I mean, if they can implement it, well.
8307000	8308000	Interesting.
8308000	8311120	I guess that's all I can really say about that.
8311120	8314440	Very interesting to see if that all ends up actually being able to work together or what
8314440	8315440	have you.
8315440	8321120	It would be neat, like, you know, they could do something even simple, like, you know,
8321120	8324760	being able to level up your characters or something like that when you're not playing
8324760	8325760	the game.
8325760	8331160	You know, toss stuff back and forth data.
8331160	8334240	It always kind of reminds me for some reason of the PocketStation days.
8334240	8339360	I don't know what it is, but kind of that whole, like, you have it on your TV and then
8339360	8342640	you have it in your pocket and whatever else.
8342640	8344640	I don't know.
8344640	8347360	I wonder where my PocketStation went.
8347360	8348760	Did you actually own one of those?
8348760	8349760	Yeah, I had one.
8349760	8354520	Remember, I used to take it to the arcades for DDR because I could make custom non-stop
8354520	8356200	courses on the fly.
8356200	8358200	Oh, yeah, that's right.
8358200	8359200	I forgot the PocketStation.
8359200	8362640	Because it was cheaper to play a non-stop course because I got, like, four songs versus
8362640	8368440	three songs if I paid, you know, for the fourth mix stuff.
8368440	8373320	So I'd just pop in my custom non-stop courses for whatever I wanted to play and away you
8373320	8374320	go.
8374320	8375320	And plus my edits were on there.
8375320	8376320	So that's fun.
8376320	8377320	All right.
8377320	8381080	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line tonight.
8381080	8384640	And that is about a new announcement for a new coin-op game.
8384640	8385640	This actually makes me very happy.
8385640	8389320	I probably won't play a lot of the game, but I know I'm going to get that soundtrack right
8389320	8390320	away.
8390320	8392920	This is NAMCO NAMGAN Midnight Maximum Tune 4.
8392920	8396360	NAMCO has unveiled a trailer and a website for this.
8396360	8400160	And let's see if there's any cool little, like, techno-y music in the trailer.
8400160	8404200	Of course there is.
8404200	8409640	It's going to be awesome.
8409640	8414640	I hope it's still used over the show and doing all the music.
8414640	8415640	I'm sure it sounds like it.
8415640	8420160	Anyway, apparently it did not make an appearance at the expo that previously happened, AOU
8420160	8421160	in 2011.
8421160	8426400	But Bandai Namco has unveiled a website for the game and it's coming out and they're saying
8426400	8431480	it will be some time before you get to play it, but it will be the Wanggan Maxi of the
8431480	8435880	future and worth the wait.
8435880	8436880	Whatever that means.
8436880	8438840	I'm just excited for the soundtrack.
8438840	8440760	It's been a while since they had a game, right?
8440760	8441760	Yeah.
8441760	8443760	It has been a while.
8443760	8444760	So.
8444760	8446880	All right.
8446880	8448440	Let's get to the Skype line, shall we?
8448440	8450560	We're going to open up the phone and take some calls.
8450560	8456040	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8456040	8459480	So go ahead and give us a call and we'll talk.
8459480	8462880	So while the Skype line is on its way to being open, Loki, did you want to give us any last
8462880	8463880	minute stories tonight?
8463880	8464880	Yeah, sure.
8464880	8466880	We can talk about Pixel 4's Head to Head.
8466880	8472840	It is a 8-bit styled fighting game by Eric Ruth, a guy that brought us all the 8-bit
8472840	8478200	kind of, you know, Left 4 Deads, DJ Hero, Halo, that kind of stuff.
8478200	8482840	Well this one, they've got, you know, brawlers they're seeing from every single fighting
8482840	8489480	game, including like, you know, I believe Ryu from, you know, Street Fighter's on there.
8489480	8496880	They've got, you know, Wolverine from the Marvel games.
8496880	8502680	They've also got Scorpion, I believe, is in there, and 30 different characters you can
8502680	8503680	play as.
8503680	8505320	So that's kind of cool.
8505320	8508440	I want to see if there's someone from like, Castlevania in there as well.
8508440	8510520	Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls.
8510520	8512560	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio, who's this?
8512560	8515160	Hey, hey, it's the local con whore, Rama.
8515160	8517200	Hey Rama, what's on your mind?
8517200	8521960	Not too much, I just got back from Cats of Con, but I didn't call to get my con review,
8521960	8524480	but I have a question for all three of you.
8524480	8525480	Sure, what's up?
8525480	8526480	Okay.
8526480	8532560	Now, if you've said time and time again, if I remember correctly, what makes a console
8532560	8535000	is the games for it, correct?
8535000	8536000	Yes.
8536000	8539720	Alright, now I brought this up with my roommate who's a business guy, and he's like, you're
8539720	8541080	incorrect.
8541080	8542880	It's the marketing behind it.
8542880	8547000	Now, even I find it hard to believe, because I feel that there have been games that have
8547000	8552640	been marketed out like a cheap whore, and it still has failed to get the numbers.
8552640	8558680	So, do you believe more of it's the games or the marketing, and if so, what games failed
8558680	8563160	on the marketing aspect?
8563160	8566320	Where's that, what is that Namco game that came out just at the end of last year, that
8566320	8569800	you brought up on the show like last month, and I was like, where was this game?
8569800	8570800	This game was-
8570800	8571800	Modun and the Forsaken Kingdom.
8571800	8574200	Yes, that would be a good one, because that game looked kind of cool.
8574200	8578760	I had no idea a game like that even existed.
8578760	8583440	To some extent, maybe Rock Band 3, if you want me to go for a bigger title, because
8583440	8585680	I don't know, we just didn't see Rock Band.
8585680	8589300	It wasn't out there as much as the earlier titles, and I don't know if that's just because
8589300	8595200	people were over it, or what the deal is, but yeah, I'd have to say that.
8595200	8600680	Okay, I agree with that, because even I didn't see too much about Rock Band 3 as much as
8600680	8605200	I was anticipating it, and I turned around and I'm like, it's out?
8605200	8607800	I really didn't see any advertising for it.
8607800	8609840	Yeah, right?
8609840	8613380	And for some reason, Kane and Lynch comes to mind, because I think that that game was
8613380	8616280	heavily marketed, but it just kind of collapsed.
8616280	8620760	Wait, didn't Kane and Lynch, or maybe I think Kane and Lynch 2, I thought we had a story
8620760	8623000	last week, that game sold like a million copies or something.
8623000	8626960	Might have been a second, because I thought the first one, there was a lot of advertising
8626960	8630440	behind it, but I don't think, I'm not sure if it really did good or not.
8630440	8631440	Yeah.
8631440	8635040	It's kind of nice when game companies will take a second chance, though, on a game that,
8635040	8639120	you know, doesn't maybe do so hot, but it still kind of deserves a sequel, so it gets
8639120	8640120	one.
8640120	8642800	For some reason, I can't think of anything right away, but I know there's been some in
8642800	8643800	the past.
8643800	8648280	It's strange, though, that Mirror's Edge, you know, was kind of a popular game, at least
8648280	8654440	I always thought, and it's not getting a sequel like we thought it would, so just kind of
8654440	8655440	surprising.
8655440	8662360	All right, but, so, I'm going to assume you still believe that a console is just as good
8662360	8669660	as the games that it comes out for, not the marketing for the games for the console?
8669660	8672040	I think marketing kind of goes a long way.
8672040	8679600	I think that's probably why the Wii did so well, I think was kind of the way it was marketed,
8679600	8686360	but I think marketing can only really enhance or draw attention to what is going to be either
8686360	8688980	a good product or a bad product.
8688980	8694040	And what I mean by that is that, you know, you can put a turd out there and wrap a pretty
8694040	8698360	bow on it and say, hey, look, turd on sale, but at the end of the day, a turd is still
8698360	8699360	a turd.
8699360	8701760	I've heard that plenty of times.
8701760	8707960	I'm inclined to believe that you can market a game like nobody else's business, and it
8707960	8715200	just takes maybe a couple of people to review this title and say, it stinks, and could cause
8715200	8717880	a possible chain reaction?
8717880	8721600	Um, perhaps.
8721600	8723640	Let me ask you this, though, about the 3DS.
8723640	8728040	The 3DS, I find it funny that we always talk about a system is only as good as the games
8728040	8731620	that are on it, yet I still want a 3DS even though I'm not impressed by any of the launch
8731620	8732620	titles.
8732620	8733620	Does this make me a giant hypocrite?
8733620	8735620	No, not necessarily.
8735620	8738120	I think you kind of fall in love with me.
8738120	8745280	You feel your inner child, because these are games that we use and we play a lot, you know?
8745280	8750960	I mean, hell, I picked up Zelda Advance for the GBA, and I still haven't finished it yet.
8750960	8756400	When I first got it, I knocked that game out in about five weeks.
8756400	8759160	I gotta tell you, though, the technology behind that thing is so cool.
8759160	8763800	I actually, actually, one reason I kind of want to get it is for the picture taking and
8763800	8765600	looking at the 3D pictures.
8765600	8767840	Like I do feel a little bit more justified in that feature.
8767840	8769520	I think that's going to be kind of awesome.
8769520	8773040	Just to kind of show it off, too, you know, like, hey, I took these 3D pictures, and I'm
8773040	8778040	hoping Nintendo does the smart thing and lets us share those pictures somehow, some way
8778040	8779440	we can do that.
8779440	8780440	Perhaps.
8780440	8781440	Perhaps.
8781440	8786880	Plus, also, I am looking for something to play music to, so you know how that goes.
8786880	8787880	Yeah.
8787880	8788880	So.
8788880	8789880	All right.
8789880	8790880	Well, anything else on your mind, Rama?
8790880	8791880	No, that's it.
8791880	8792880	All right.
8792880	8793880	Well, take care, Rama.
8793880	8794880	Have a good one.
8794880	8795880	Thanks for the call.
8795880	8796880	You, too.
8796880	8797880	Enjoy.
8797880	8798880	Later.
8798880	8799880	Bye.
8799880	8800880	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnTradio, if you want to give us
8800880	8802880	a call.
8802880	8806880	Brad in the chat room from PodCulture says, no, it makes you a geek.
8806880	8809240	Yeah, I'll take it.
8809240	8812240	It makes me a geek a little bit, I suppose.
8812240	8813240	So.
8813240	8814240	All right.
8814240	8816600	Any other last minute stories while we wait for more calls to come in?
8816600	8818680	Yeah, one last one here.
8818680	8824320	There is an indie game that's out there on the Xbox 360 Indie Marketplace.
8824320	8828080	It is a game called PPPPPPPPPPP.
8828080	8831920	Basically, it's a game that doesn't use controllers.
8831920	8833480	Oh, it's Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.
8833480	8835080	I thought you were saying PPPPPP.
8835080	8836080	No.
8836080	8837080	I was like...
8837080	8839280	That's the full name of the game, yes.
8839280	8840760	Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew Pew.
8840760	8845080	But the actual title on the Indie Marketplace is Peace.
8845080	8850860	Anyways, so it is a game that's played with a vocal input and
8851700	8856020	You can play with either a 360 headset or a rock band mic
8856020	8861820	The title is co-op one player is controlling the hero's jetpack and the other is controlling the gun by making noises
8862020	8864020	like pew pew pew pew pew pew
8864020	8873560	And they have got to love the indie marketplace they have a trailer for it too, which people are playing it
8879540	8883780	Is it is it is there video is that like real video yeah, it looks like
8883780	8890780	It looks we can't hear any of that I know, but I'm just saying it looks very similar actually to the technokitten adventure
8890780	8899780	I mean basically there's walls coming towards you and you have a jetpack and you say pew to destroy the blocks
8899780	8906780	And then you scream into it to like cause a bomb to go off and you get points for shooting the blocks
8906780	8910780	Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future
8910780	8913780	Wave of the future ladies and gentlemen wave of the future
8913780	8917780	Let's go to another call higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8917780	8920780	Hi, this is gamer girl. Hi gamer girl. What's on your mind?
8920780	8924780	Um nothing much. Have you guys um played the game?
8928780	8933780	There's a game called Assassin's Creed like legacy on Facebook
8933780	8937780	No, I have not played the Facebook game. I thought you were gonna say the Assassin's Creed console games
8937780	8943780	What's the what's what's the Facebook game all about? Um, it's kind of like Knights of the clicky. It's pretty cool
8943780	8950780	Yeah, yeah. Um, I've been playing that one and of course Knights of the clicky. It's pretty fun
8950780	8956780	Is it one of those games where it's really easy to spend the fairy dust points and all that stuff? Yeah, it's pretty cool
8956780	8962780	Yeah, yeah. Do you what do you what do you think of Facebook games? Do you think it really is the wave of the future or?
8962780	8968780	Um, it's kind of addicting actually. Yeah, if you if you're not careful
8968780	8972780	You can kind of get like addicted to it. Mm-hmm
8972780	8978780	Yeah, I I was playing that Knights of the clicky game, which is so ridiculous for a while
8978780	8983780	And I don't know one day I just kind of stopped is now kind of ran out of steam with me to see with you
8983780	8988780	I haven't touched it in ages. I haven't touched it in like two weeks. I just I just finally gave up
8988780	8993780	I don't really play any of the Facebook games at all anymore. Do you find do you play the Assassin's Creed console games at all?
8993780	9000780	Yeah, I actually have the first one and I'm still trying to finish that one because I lost my original copy
9000780	9005780	Um when I was moving around I looked in the case and it was actually cracked
9005780	9011780	So so so how did I have to rebuy the other one? How does the Facebook version tie into the real game?
9011780	9017780	Does it actually kind of seem to make you want to go play the console game or does it kind of tie into that story?
9017780	9022780	Or is it just somebody just ripped off Mafia Wars and slapped on the Assassin's Creed 2 graphics?
9022780	9031780	Um, it kind of makes you want to play the original game even though it's a it's not really tied into the game itself
9031780	9034780	The original game it's more like a standalone
9034780	9037780	Right
9037780	9041780	Okay, well I get I want to say somebody I knew is playing that on Facebook
9041780	9046780	Is this been open a long time like about six months or so or did like just recently open?
9046780	9050780	Probably I just found out about it yesterday so
9050780	9053780	Any other Facebook games that you play or you're interested in?
9053780	9058780	Because I'll tell you one Facebook game I really am looking forward to is the whole Civ civilization on Facebook
9058780	9060780	And it had a title I can't remember the full title
9060780	9065780	But I because it seems like it's gonna buck that trend a little bit that it's not Mafia Wars
9065780	9067780	That it might actually be the game of civilization
9067780	9070780	It might be simplified a lot, but I think that might be a lot of fun
9070780	9078780	Um, right now I like playing, you know, um, Knights of the Clicky, um, Chocobos Crystal Tower
9078780	9079780	Oh, yeah
9079780	9081780	The game's kind of confusing, but it's pretty fun
9081780	9082780	Yeah
9082780	9083780	Yeah
9083780	9085780	So, all right
9085780	9089780	Well, gamer girl, any other things you want to say while we got you on the show before we let you go?
9089780	9091780	Do those games make you less depressed?
9091780	9093780	Keep up the good work guys
9093780	9097780	Wait, gamer girl, do those games make you less depressed since they're casual games?
9097780	9106780	Actually, um, I'm more of like, when I get really depressed, I like playing stuff like, you know, shoot em up games like, whatever
9106780	9112780	Um, Call of Duty, um, or like something with zombies in it
9112780	9115780	I made a game with zombies in it
9115780	9118780	I like watching their brains spew out
9118780	9126780	Oh, and then, let's see, I had a game, but I forgot the name of it
9126780	9127780	It's all good
9127780	9128780	Oh, Resident Evil
9128780	9129780	Oh, Resident Evil, there you go
9129780	9130780	Yeah
9130780	9131780	More zombie killing
9131780	9132780	All right
9132780	9133780	Yeah
9133780	9134780	You don't want to end up in a Jill sandwich
9134780	9135780	All right
9135780	9139780	Gamer girl, we're gonna let you go to try and get at least one more call in, but thank you so much for the call
9139780	9140780	You're welcome

9160780	9167780	Uh, Nanostray, developer working on the title for the 3DS
9167780	9170780	Nanostray is kind of a cool 3D game, I guess that's neat
9170780	9173780	Uh, I don't know
9173780	9175780	Maybe we can make some stories up?
9175780	9182780	Well, how about, um, there was the little big Planet 2 glitches that they fixed?

9187780	9189780	Hold on, we're getting another call, woo, saved
9189780	9191780	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9191780	9193780	Hey, this is Amiga777
9193780	9196780	Amiga777, what's on your mind buddy?
9196780	9203780	Hey, um, I know this is a little bit of old news, but I was wondering if you guys heard about that latest
9203780	9210780	Mario sports mix game that was supposed to be coming out, I don't know, like
9210780	9214780	From what I understand, it came out a couple weeks ago
9214780	9219780	I haven't played it myself since the E3 build, but yeah, I'm aware of the game
9219780	9224780	Okay, I don't know, like, um, what were your thoughts on it?
9224780	9232780	Um, to me, I gotta be honest, it does kind of feel like another little cash in to the whole Wii Sports craze
9232780	9238780	It's just that they're using the Mario graphics to make it stand out from the other knock offs games
9238780	9240780	A la, I don't know, Deca Sports or whatever
9240780	9243780	The fact that you slap Mario on the cover kind of makes it stand out from the crowd a little bit
9243780	9249780	Not even, I think what it is is they couldn't figure out which sport to put out this year for the Mario games
9249780	9254780	You know, Mario Tennis, Mario, you know, Soccer, whatever the hell they were calling it
9254780	9256780	Wasn't it a Squeenix game too?
9256780	9259780	Yeah, I was about to ask you that same question
9259780	9263780	Yeah, you know Squeenix doesn't just do role playing games, once in a while they do have the other side
9263780	9267780	Well, especially now that they have the Eidos arm, they definitely aren't just about role playing games
9267780	9270780	But, you know, they always would do kind of these weird one off games
9270780	9274780	I'll tell you, one of my favorite Squeenix games that ever came out was Chocobo Racing
9274780	9278780	Which was like a PS1 Mario Kart rip off with Final Fantasy characters
9278780	9281780	I really wish that would come out on the store
9281780	9285780	Because I think that was a great PS1 game that I don't think a lot of people really got
9285780	9287780	So, yeah, that was awesome
9287780	9291780	But anyway, kind of going back to your original question, you know, I think, yeah, I get what Loki's saying
9291780	9295780	As far as the game itself, it's very Wii Sports-esque
9295780	9301780	So if you like that fun, casual, and I emphasize casual sports game
9301780	9305780	Then yeah, it's cool, especially if you have siblings that you play a lot of video games with
9305780	9307780	Or you have parties where you have people over a lot
9307780	9310780	You know, this would be a game that's a lot of fun at the parties
9310780	9313780	Because people recognize Mario, people recognize Peach
9313780	9317780	But as far as like the hardcore game goes, like if you're just kind of a solo player
9317780	9320780	I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you
9320780	9322780	I think your money might be better spent somewhere else
9322780	9324780	Right
9324780	9329780	Okay, I mean like, I looked at an article online about it
9329780	9331780	I don't know, some time ago
9331780	9336780	And the critics were just ripping it to shreds
9336780	9337780	Yeah, not surprised
9337780	9342780	And let me guess, they were probably just saying it's, you know, yet another sports game on the Wii
9342780	9344780	You know, with a Mario knockoff title
9344780	9347780	It's just very insignificant
9347780	9349780	Doesn't bring anything new to the table
9349780	9350780	I bet all the, I haven't even played the game
9350780	9352780	And I bet that those are what the reviews are saying basically
9352780	9353780	So
9353780	9355780	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room does tell us though
9355780	9357780	It is Mario curling
9357780	9359780	If you've ever wanted a curling game with Mario
9359780	9360780	You can get that
9360780	9363780	I thought Mario curling was not in that
9363780	9368780	But was in the stupid Sonic vs, Mario vs. Sonic Winter Games thing
9368780	9369780	Oh, you might be right
9369780	9371780	I don't think curling is in this new one
9371780	9374780	I'm reading that from chat, so you could be right
9374780	9376780	I mean, I could be wrong
9376780	9381780	I thought they had like volleyball, basketball, tennis
9381780	9386780	Dodgeball, maybe paintball
9386780	9391780	But, you know, it's, whatever
9391780	9394780	I mean, we're not the target audience
9394780	9398780	So, I gotta ask, is this a game that you were thinking of picking up
9398780	9402780	Or were you more calling just to kind of bag on it a little bit too
9402780	9404780	Because of everything you've read
9404780	9410780	Well, I'm not currently actually looking forward to purchasing that
9410780	9413780	As I'm not the owner of a Wii at this time
9413780	9415780	Oh well, then it makes the decision pretty easy
9415780	9421780	But yeah, it was a bit shocking reading that article
9421780	9429780	That Nintendo had practically just outsourced this whole concept
9429780	9432780	To, I guess, Square Enix
9432780	9438780	It was already in some hot water
9438780	9442780	And a number of other things
9442780	9446780	Like, dare I say, Final Fantasy XIV
9446780	9449780	Which hasn't yet made it to consoles yet
9449780	9453780	What's stopping you from getting a Wii, just out of curiosity?
9453780	9457780	Um, I don't know
9457780	9460780	Price games?
9460780	9464780	The games? Oh no, it's fine
9464780	9469780	I just need to, you know, make some decent income in order to get one at this time
9469780	9473780	I gotcha, yeah, that's what a lot of people are saying in this economy
9473780	9474780	Alright
9474780	9475780	It's a bummer
9475780	9479780	Well buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for the call
9479780	9480780	Bye bye
9480780	9483780	Okay, so here's the actual sports that are on there
9483780	9486780	It's a whopping four
9486780	9490780	Hockey, baseball, or I'm sorry, hockey, basketball, volleyball, and dodgeball
9490780	9492780	That's it
9495780	9498780	Yeah, I remember, I didn't think it was a lot of games
9498780	9500780	It wasn't like deca sports, so there was a whole ton of them
9500780	9502780	It was just, you know, a few
9502780	9504780	There you go
9504780	9506780	Alright, well that is gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
9506780	9508780	So sorry to those folks that didn't get through
9508780	9513780	But, you know, you can always send us an email or, you know, contact us in other ways
9513780	9517780	Chat room, Twitter, etc, etc
9517780	9519780	We'll be back to do it again next week
9519780	9522780	But since I believe we did all the final thoughts
9522780	9525780	I'm sorry, not the final thoughts, the last minute stories tonight
9525780	9528780	It's now time to get to the final thoughts for tonight's show
9528780	9531780	So, Salacious Pop, thank you for being here tonight
9531780	9535780	I know you haven't talked a lot this half of the show, but you brought a little wit to the first half
9535780	9537780	As you always do, so thank you for being here
9537780	9538780	Thank you
9538780	9540780	And do you have a final thought for listeners tonight?
9540780	9542780	We didn't nap today and I can feel it
9542780	9546780	Wait a minute, no, I took like a, I remember taking like a 20 minute nap for the show
9546780	9547780	20 minutes is not a nap
9547780	9548780	Ah, it is for me
9548780	9551780	Alright, I'll go ahead and give my final thought
9551780	9556780	My final thought is, man, I wish, sometimes I wish we didn't have a bonus segment to the show
9556780	9558780	I mean, I love the live listeners and everything
9558780	9561780	But if we could end before 10 o'clock, then I could get Pinkberry in time before they close
9561780	9563780	I'm just saying, just saying
9563780	9564780	There's Pasco Robbins around the corner
9564780	9565780	That's true
9565780	9567780	Dark Soccer, your final thought for us tonight?
9567780	9569780	My head hurts so bad
9569780	9571780	Aw, sorry to hear it
9571780	9573780	And last but not least, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?
9573780	9575780	I hope this mod works
9575780	9577780	Oh dear, I wonder what this is
9577780	9579780	What is this mod gonna do, dare I ask?
9579780	9585780	Well, I'm working on doing more map mods, but I'm trying to get like a process to it
9585780	9588780	Because I want to have it so that I can distribute this online
9588780	9593780	And have it so that people can very easily add mods to Grand Theft Auto
9593780	9595780	I'm talking about map mods right now
9595780	9597780	Because I've done map mods before
9597780	9599780	But I have a new method of doing them
9599780	9603780	And the previous way I tried to get it to work didn't work
9603780	9605780	And I've tried this before
9605780	9607780	And I'm trying it again to see if I can get it to work
9607780	9610780	And who knows?
9610780	9613780	Probably won't work again because this game is very stubborn
9613780	9615780	Alright
9615780	9617780	Well, that's gonna do it tonight
