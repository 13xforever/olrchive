00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,020
Tonight, February 6th, 2011, Nintendo disagrees with low app pricing, Halo gets remade this

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:32,080
holiday and has Zelda Skyward Sword been further delayed?

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,760
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,700
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,240
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,520
With me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,880
Greetings and salutations.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,580
How are you Ms. Summers?

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:56,180
My voice is coming and going, I will at points sound like a twelve year old boy, but I'm

10
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,180
doing good.

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,180
I'm happy, excited.

12
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,060
A lot of people I know have been getting sick lately.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,060
It's not just you.

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,060
Something's going around.

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,060
Something's going around.

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,700
But it has stolen my voice.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,400
By the way, I noticed you're wearing like a nerdy Star Trek shirt, but it's a red shirt.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
That's a bad sign.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
But it's engineering.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,220
The engineers are smart enough to stay inside.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,420
It's the security guys that keep getting blown up.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,560
Yes, plus I don't know what it is about that shirt but it is showing off your very adequate

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
bazoom.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Yes.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Thank you.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
So congratulations.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Thank you.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
All right.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,140
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,140
Hi.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,540
How are you, Loki?

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
I'm fine.

34
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,060
He's a man of many words.

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,340
Anything interesting going on for you this week?

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
No.

37
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,340
No?

38
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,340
All right.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,800
It's going to be one of those shows.

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,620
We have some guests in studio, so let me introduce them.

41
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,920
Of course, we always have the ever-present fourth guest with us in our chat room, chat.orange

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
lounge radio.com.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,580
So you can join us in our chat room.

44
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
There are people live.

45
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,300
I do know there's some type of ball game going on right now that people seem to care about,

46
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,820
so I know things are a little bit less than usual.

47
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,840
But thank you so much to the loyalists who have tuned in tonight.

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,420
It is a bit of a special night, but I'll get into that in a minute.

49
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,540
Let me introduce the guest here in studio with us as he is once in a while.

50
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,180
Say hello to the one and only, Salacious Pop.

51
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,180
Hello.

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
How are you?

53
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,180
Good.

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Yeah?

55
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,020
What's happened in the past, I don't know, month or so since you've been here?

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,300
Lots of wow games.

57
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
I don't know.

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Good times.

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Good.

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,220
Because this is a video game show, so you can talk about some of those games.

61
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
All right.

62
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,660
Now, here's what's distracting Loki is that he's playing Galgun.

63
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,780
He brought into studio, and can you, Salacious Pop, how do you describe this game to people?

64
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,420
I don't even know.

65
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,260
Well, you're in obviously a school, high school, and they're little Sailor Moon-looking anime

66
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,100
girls in their little suits.

67
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,060
And it's kind of like, I guess, time crisis where you've just got the cross hairs, and

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,700
you move the cursor over, and you shoot them with hearts.

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,700
And they make noises, which I will not try to repeat.

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Aw, you're no fun.

71
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,220
The volume's turned down.

72
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
Yeah.

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,340
Well, I think it's implied.

74
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,020
But yeah, and then they fall down with their love for you because you shot them with your

75
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
love gun.

76
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Oh, great.

77
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,260
Loki's turned it up, I don't know if it gets picked up on the mic or whatever, but...

78
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,980
Oh, does it come through on our little soundboard now?

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,100
No, I don't think it does.

80
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,540
All right, I thought we were high tech or something.

81
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,540
All right, maybe next time.

82
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Yeah, we've played samples.

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
I know, we've done it before.

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,540
I don't know.

85
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,540
I don't think it's...

86
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,540
We could, but I haven't done it.

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,020
Loki did this very last minute tonight, so...

88
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,220
All right, well, say hello as well to also joining us for this special show.

89
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Say hello to Arcadian42.

90
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Hello out there.

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,220
How are you?

92
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,220
I'm doing good.

93
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,220
I haven't seen you in a while either.

94
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
Not since the last time we did a show.

95
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Well, you know, when you were here.

96
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,220
Last December.

97
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Yes.

98
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,220
So, what's new with you?

99
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,220
Not too much.

100
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,220
Yeah?

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,980
Now I'm into crazy work time, so I don't have much time to play games these days.

102
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,980
Crazy work time?

103
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,100
What do you do for a living without, you know, you don't have to tell us where you work,

104
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
but what kind of work?

105
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,540
Well, I work at two places, and the first place I work five hours a day, every day,

106
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
all year.

107
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,500
The other place, I work eight hours a day, like, six to eight, like, nine months of the

108
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
year.

109
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Wow.

110
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
All right.

111
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Busy, busy.

112
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Yeah.

113
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
All right.

114
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,380
So, I'm going to get around to how is your gaming week, but I should acknowledge that

115
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,580
tonight is a little bit special because it is episode 400 of Orange Lounge Radio.

116
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
Yay.

117
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,020
400 freaking shows.

118
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:29,100
This show started on June 23rd, 2002, and here we are, over 400 weeks, because we're

119
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,000
lazy, we take a lot of weeks off, over 400 weeks later, but 400 shows later, here we

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,460
are at our show.

121
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,460
It's exhausting.

122
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,540
So, what are we doing special tonight?

123
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,260
The same shit we've done for a long time.

124
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,260
No.

125
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
We had something special.

126
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,260
That's true.

127
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,460
We do have one new special thing, but the live listeners don't get to see it.

128
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,220
This is something special for the podcasties.

129
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Meatballs?

130
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Oh.

131
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,580
Well, the listeners don't get meatballs.

132
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,900
No, but we're special.

133
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
We get meatballs.

134
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
All right.

135
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,140
I think originally this was going to be a drunk show, but Loki's got the kid, Rob drives,

136
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,820
Jamie's not going to pay to get us all blitzed, and if we took a shot every time Nintendo

137
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,940
made a bad business decision, we would just die.

138
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
We would be dead.

139
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
Exactly.

140
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,300
And remember, a lot has happened in nine years of the show.

141
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,260
I have my gallbladder out for one, so I have no alcohol tolerance anymore.

142
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Remember when I almost died, y'all?

143
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
That was hilarious.

144
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
You were so skinny, though.

145
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,260
You look so good.

146
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
I know.

147
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,020
God, I want to get pancreatitis again.

148
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,900
So which character should we attempt to rape first?

149
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,020
Oh, the one with the bunny ears.

150
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
The bunny girl.

151
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Got it.

152
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,020
All right.

153
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
What's your name?

154
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,020
I have no idea.

155
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,540
The other thing to keep in mind, since we started this show nine-ish years ago, we were

156
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,180
a lot younger, and things were different then, and we would drink a lot more than we do now.

157
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,500
So if you do drink, drink responsibly.

158
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,820
What do you mean, than I do now?

159
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,980
There's a lot of people drinking today, because there's this brown ball that people throw

160
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
to each other.

161
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,360
It's the Super Bowl of sports ball.

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,660
Men dress up in these big suits and push each other to the ground.

163
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
They wear tights.

164
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,660
They wear tight shorts.

165
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
The whole thing's very homoerotic.

166
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
The whole nation watches it.

167
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,620
They wear tight shorts and pad their chest.

168
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,180
Betty White is in commercials and things.

169
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,060
Ecstasy shot, because you shot her in the crotch.

170
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
Wow.

171
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,420
I love radio about video games.

172
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,420
All right.

173
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,060
Anyhow, let's start off with how was your gaming week?

174
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,620
I almost said, how was your week?

175
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
How was your day?

176
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
How was that for old school?

177
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,620
Yeah.

178
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,140
This show has changed quite a bit, actually.

179
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,540
I don't know how many of you guys have listened to OLR for the entire time, but back when

180
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,180
it was like episode one, obviously, you probably know we were talking about DDR.

181
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
The migraine episode.

182
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,020
The money and all that stuff.

183
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
But we used to kind of start off with how was your week?

184
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,020
How was your day?

185
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,320
We didn't just talk about all video games.

186
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,620
Now we do.

187
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,160
So next thing I'm going to say is I'm going to say the cage match pick goes into rotation

188
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,980
all week long here at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

189
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,220
It goes into rotation in our hearts.

190
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Exactly.

191
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
All right.

192
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
Dark soccer.

193
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
How was your gaming week?

194
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,220
I hit level 85.

195
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Addict.

196
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,220
Dealer.

197
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,220
Congratulations, though.

198
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,220
Thank you.

199
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:09,940
Now I'm kind of bored and I'm working on building reps, so I built my Darnassus rep like in

200
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:19,580
one night and now I have a kitty cat cat and a meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

201
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,940
That's really about it.

202
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,740
Dan got his driving rig, his, his, uh, driving wheel set up for, uh, Gran Turismo five.

203
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,620
He got this sort of stand so that he can put, he can put it away when he's done playing

204
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,340
and he got the seats out of the Honda Prelude, which he is building his driving seat out

205
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,120
of.

206
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,700
And that's what Dan's gaming week has been.

207
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,980
So he actually took seats out of a real car.

208
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
It's in the living room.

209
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
To build a grand theft.

210
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,180
I almost said grand theft.

211
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,380
Gran Turismo five.

212
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
I'll take a picture of it.

213
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Wow.

214
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Yeah.

215
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
You shouldn't put it on the little feed.

216
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Yeah.

217
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
So I'll do that right now.

218
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,380
All right.

219
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,380
You should.

220
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Wow.

221
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
What are you doing?

222
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
That's insanity.

223
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
Just because he can.

224
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Yes.

225
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
He's your husband.

226
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
I don't let him do shit.

227
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,380
He just does it.

228
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,380
Then again, the same goes vice versa.

229
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,620
Does he let you sit in the seat or is he like, nah, this is the captain's chair.

230
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,820
I don't care to sit in the seat.

231
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,300
It's a seat on a milk crate right now.

232
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
It's ghetto.

233
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,540
And I'm taking a picture and showing you all how weird my husband is.

234
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,180
You can see those pictures at www dot orange lounge radio.com.

235
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,700
All right, Loki, you got to pause that game and tell us about your gaming week.

236
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
How was your gaming week?

237
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
My gaming is weird.

238
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,900
This week I didn't play a whole lot.

239
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:38,260
I played just Grand Theft Auto, of course, and a little bit of some iOS games.

240
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,060
I played League of Evil, which I didn't really care for that one.

241
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,500
They're comparing it kind of to Super Meat Boy, and I'm sorry, it's not Super Meat Boy.

242
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,100
It's not even close.

243
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,220
It's just kind of, almost reminds me of Mega Man, but really hard and basic.

244
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,900
It's an iPhone game, so what do you expect?

245
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
So it's the basic bitch of video games.

246
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,500
It's just, eh, kind of lame.

247
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,340
And then there was this other pirate game that was kind of cool with anime people that

248
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,820
I played that was kind of fun.

249
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
And what else did I try?

250
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,220
Oh, I played more Swords and Poker 2 because that game is just awesome.

251
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,220
Really wish it was still in the App Store.

252
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,980
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

253
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Why'd they take it down?

254
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
I don't know.

255
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,980
It's stupid.

256
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,580
They took the first one and the second one down.

257
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,860
They're both excellent games.

258
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
I mean, I've sunk...

259
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Are they violating any copyrights or something?

260
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
No, I don't see how they would.

261
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,020
These are games that really should make it to consoles.

262
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,980
They're really good.

263
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,740
It's just kind of like Puzzle Quest but Poker, and it's a really unique, fun game.

264
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,780
If you have a, you know, jailbroken iPod or iPhone or something like that, I'd recommend

265
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,880
downloading them, even though it is piracy, but they're not in the store.

266
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:05,940
So I mean, I'd say go buy them if you could, but you can't, so pirate them.

267
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,060
I guess it might be okay to advocate piracy in that little circumstance.

268
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,060
But I mean, if they came back in the store, they're only 99 cents.

269
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,820
I mean, I bought the game when it came out, or when I found it on there, but they pulled

270
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:23,140
it eventually, because I had a friend recommend it, and it's just, it's awesome.

271
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,700
Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com, a few comments.

272
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,420
Jim Sallee about the football game says, men in costumes fighting to handle brown balls

273
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,100
in the end zone?

274
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Super Bowl is so gay.

275
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
A little bit.

276
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
A little bit.

277
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
All right.

278
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,120
Also, Spazinator says, if Loki ever goes a week without playing Grand Theft Auto IV,

279
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
the universe will implode.

280
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,380
Did you play Grand Theft Auto IV this week?

281
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,940
Yeah, we play it like almost every day.

282
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Okay, just checking.

283
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,100
We play the modded games.

284
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,340
It's such a shadow of Grand Theft Auto.

285
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:59,220
It's seriously a whole epic game of its own, but yeah, so we're still playing Grand Theft

286
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
Auto.

287
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,220
We will play something else.

288
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,900
I think we will probably go to Saintsboro 3 once that comes out, and then of course,

289
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,340
when the next Grand Theft Auto comes out, we'll be going to that.

290
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,060
Yeah, I was about to say, have you heard those rumors that the next Grand Theft Auto is set

291
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,500
to debut at the big expo in L.A. in June?

292
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,140
It's not going to be for at least another year.

293
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,780
There's not Grand Theft Auto coming out this year.

294
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,500
You think they might do just a little tease?

295
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,060
What does Rockstar have going on right now?

296
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,900
Well, they've got a bunch of stuff coming out.

297
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,620
They've got L.A. Noire, which is coming out in spring, or spring, summer, or second quarter,

298
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,620
if you will.

299
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
Okay.

300
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,460
Then they've got Max Payne 3 coming out at some point.

301
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,180
Probably going to be in the fall.

302
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,900
They had something else too, though, from Take 2 that was supposed to be coming out.

303
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,800
I think Max Payne 2 is probably, you see, because I think they're going to be putting

304
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,420
out L.A. Noire, because that's going to be kind of like their Red Dead Redemption for

305
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,980
the year, and then Max Payne will probably come out maybe fourth quarter.

306
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Grand Theft Auto, I would see maybe, ideally, probably next April would be when I could

307
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,180
see that, but I don't know if that's actually going to happen.

308
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
They have the engine already.

309
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,380
They'll just build it off of the Red Dead Redemption, since it's just an update to the

310
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:23,020
Rage Engine anyways, so yeah, I mean, come on, I'm going to get it day one.

311
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,180
Saints Row 3, though, I'm much of a fan of Saints Row 3 as I am of Grand Theft Auto,

312
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,700
or Saints Row, the series, so I'll be definitely picking that up this fall.

313
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,580
And the problem is, though, is Saints Row, the multiplayer is completely different than

314
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,340
Grand Theft Auto, whereas Grand Theft Auto is more open world, Saints Row is kind of

315
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,180
these little small arenas, and it's really fast paced, and I still kick the crap out

316
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,160
of everybody, and it's really buggy.

317
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,480
It's funny, actually, in Saints Row 2, a little known fact, you can throw the sticky bombs

318
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,460
on people and detonate them, like say if I throw three of them on somebody and detonate

319
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,620
one and kill them, when they respawn, they still have two stuck to them, and you can

320
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,640
detonate it again, and they die.

321
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
It's great.

322
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,660
It's such a glitchy game, but it's awesome.

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
Awesome.

324
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,100
Uh, any interest in Chinatown Wars Part 2?

325
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I hate Chinatown Wars.

326
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I honestly...

327
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,740
I just had a feeling.

328
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,140
It's just, the old top down games were great, but I'm sorry, once, Chinatown Wars, the reason

329
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:23,420
it existed was because that's all that really the DS could handle, I mean, the PSP games

330
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,500
are a perfect example of what they could have done.

331
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
It was great.

332
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,440
The PSP games were, I mean, they control kind of eh, because there's only one analog stick,

333
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
but it was still funny.

334
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,380
We played that, you know, up until Grand Theft Auto, well actually up until Saints Row 2,

335
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,180
or Saints Row 1, we played, you know, the PSP versions of Grand Theft Auto to death.

336
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,780
Those things were really fucking glitchy.

337
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,780
But yeah, I mean, seriously, if there's a new PSP, god, if there's an NGP version of

338
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,100
Grand Theft Auto, I'm gonna have to pick that out, and we may have to all get NGP's to bust

339
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,020
that out, but, uh, I'll be buying every game day one, as long as it's on some crap like

340
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Chinatown Wars.

341
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,860
Alright, let's check in with our guests and see what they've been playing this week.

342
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,740
Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?

343
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,220
Um, pretty good.

344
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,740
Uh, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Knights of the Crystal, which doesn't really count

345
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,740
as a game, and World of Warcraft.

346
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
Lots of World of Warcraft.

347
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,220
What's going on in World of Warcraft for you?

348
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,780
I don't want to get too far into the discussion, but...

349
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:28,180
Yeah, um, I was in a, I guess a more social, casual-centric guild, and I decided to try

350
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,680
and explore a group of people that were more focused on the really hardcore raiding stuff,

351
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,220
to see if I can, you know, handle that.

352
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,180
And they took me on a raid, as a trial, so I got to see some of the new raid content,

353
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,480
did a 25-man.

354
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
They carried me.

355
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,880
I'm pretty much a scrub right now, but it was neat to see.

356
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,580
So you turned your back on your friends to go see more pretty internet dragons?

357
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,380
I'm a traitorous maverick.

358
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,820
I'm just giving you shit, obviously, because it's the same guild I'm in, but I know there's

359
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,700
a lot of people that are excited for you, and you can come back and tell us stories.

360
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,980
And you can come on Horde House and talk all about it.

361
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,380
Yeah, it's more a Horde House conversation.

362
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Alright.

363
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,740
But I, you know, it's still, obviously WoW's a huge game, so, gotta talk about what's going

364
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,740
on there.

365
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,140
So, how's Championship Edition going for you?

366
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,740
I mean, breaking records?

367
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,580
I still only play, like, the one mode.

368
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,260
I've unlocked all the other modes, and I'm like, I just want the five minutes.

369
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
That's me, too.

370
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
I'm the exact same way.

371
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,340
I go through and I unlock everything, and then it's like, okay, I just want to play

372
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,700
this one map over and over, because it's the one that drives the leaderboards.

373
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,260
It's on the main Xbox 360.

374
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,260
I don't know if this is weird or not, but you know how, like, in the Xbox 360 dashboard,

375
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,660
you get to see leaderboards, but they're only for a certain mode in the game.

376
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,700
It's usually, like, the default leaderboard is what you see in.

377
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,840
That's the one I will try the hardest on.

378
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,500
And in this case, it's usually, like, stage one or the default board and settings for

379
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,200
Pac-Man Championship Edition.

380
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,180
And even with the default game style, you can still, you know, on the options before

381
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:01,500
you start up the match, there are eight or nine different visually art, like, you can

382
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,660
have the neon or, like, all green or the 3D model, whatever.

383
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,920
I just leave it on the default.

384
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,540
So visually, all the stuff they put into the game I haven't looked at yet, because there's

385
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
no reason to.

386
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,180
So you just want to hear the pretty music.

387
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,180
All right.

388
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,460
Well, let's move on to Arkadian42.

389
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
How was your gaming week?

390
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,180
The only thing I really had to play this week was Rock Band 3, because I got the cymbals

391
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,260
pack so I could play pro mode.

392
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,540
So I was doing that.

393
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,340
And that's why I got a mic stand so I could sing when I want to sing, but I don't do that

394
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
all that often.

395
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,180
I was going to say, you're kind of a quiet guy, and now here I am hearing about that

396
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,580
you have to get the cymbals and the microphones so that you can rock out and sing all the

397
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
privacy of your own home.

398
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,620
Yeah, I don't really sing that much just because my voice is kind of screwy, and also because

399
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,980
there's people on the other side of the walls, they don't want to bother them because my

400
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,740
voice is probably sort of deep, so it probably goes through the walls, so I don't want to

401
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,260
bug them.

402
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,540
Nice.

403
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,700
So what was the first song you had to play when you got the cymbals?

404
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,300
Because there's always that one song people got to play in Rock Band.

405
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I don't know.

406
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,620
I think it was one of the easier songs just so I could get used to the cymbals.

407
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,420
Just go through the training a little bit.

408
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,140
The training is not that much different from the standard trainer for drums.

409
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,420
It just has pretty much the same training, but with the cymbals added.

410
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,340
Just mainly mostly the, what is it, the ride or whatever, like the hi-hat one you hit most,

411
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,540
so that's pretty much the only one they add, the other one's barely in there for the training.

412
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,020
But once you get to the regular game, then yeah, you play those.

413
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Alright.

414
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Cool, cool.

415
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Sounds like...

416
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Oh, yeah.

417
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,020
I have to make an announcement on behalf of the show.

418
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Uh oh.

419
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Okay.

420
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
Happy birthday to Giovanni.

421
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
That's right.

422
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,400
I saw her angst on Twitter about the whole, some game where people wear these uniforms

423
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,460
and they all have numbers on them.

424
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Well, to quote a conversation that was going on on one of the lesbian's Facebook.

425
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,060
I miss the OLR lesbians.

426
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
How are they these days?

427
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,580
Seem to do well.

428
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,660
For those that lost track, the OLR lesbians, they were on the show what about, probably

429
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,840
about four years ago at this point, they moved together to Wisconsin?

430
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,260
One of them already lived in Wisconsin.

431
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
I see.

432
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,820
That's right, because they were flying back and forth a little bit.

433
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,740
So they now, they now habitate in Wisconsin with their Birkenstocks.

434
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,540
At this game, they use a racket to hit an orange ball into the net, and then they smoke

435
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
the Rose Bowl.

436
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,620
Alright, can I talk about my gaming week?

437
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,100
Oh, one more birthday wish.

438
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,360
Is it his birthday today?

439
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
How funny.

440
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,820
That's ironic.

441
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,340
You would think he was born on Friday, or Friday the 13th or something.

442
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Maybe.

443
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,780
Well, no, because today's February 6th, so you don't wish him a happy birthday today

444
00:18:53,780 --> 00:19:00,300
if he was born February 13th.

445
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,300
I was thinking of a Friday.

446
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Oh, okay.

447
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
That's alright.

448
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,220
Alright, let's move on.

449
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,220
My gaming week.

450
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,660
I played, I made an effort to play some indie games this week.

451
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,180
So I played a few indie games on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

452
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,060
I basically handed the controller to Alan, and I was like, pick games that look fun.

453
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,700
So he picked a few games for me, and probably my favorite out of the bunch that I played

454
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,320
was Radian Games Ballistic.

455
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,060
It's a indie game on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

456
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,700
Very Geometry Wars-esque, and a very slick, high-definition kind of interface.

457
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,460
It's one of those, you know, dual thumbstick control-y type of games, just like Geometry

458
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,860
Wars, and you know, little power-ups that you can put on, and you can kind of hit a

459
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,860
button to go into more like Uber mode, where you fire more bullets, but you move a little

460
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
bit slower.

461
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,900
So, you know, for people that are thinking, you know, their life is lacking, Geometry

462
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,340
Wars, especially with the sad news about, you know, bizarre creations shutting their

463
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:00,020
doors, it's a nice little, you know, way to hold you over, and it's not that expensive.

464
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,460
So it's, and the demo's very generous.

465
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,160
So there's no reason you can't check out the demo, which is out there.

466
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
So I liked Ballistic.

467
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
That was cool.

468
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,620
Some of the games I didn't like so much.

469
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm gonna butcher the name of this game, but it was something like Maid-Chan's Cave Adventure.

470
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,980
I don't, was that the name of its license, Pop?

471
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,620
Do you remember what the name of the game was?

472
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,700
Something like Maid?

473
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
It was Maid-San.

474
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Maid-San.

475
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,900
It was like, like, crazy cave adventure, wild cave adventure, but yeah.

476
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Yeah, it was dumb.

477
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,140
I mean, it was funny for a minute, but it's a really weird mechanic.

478
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,700
Like, it's kind of like, okay, it's, I guess it's like side-scroller-y, puzzle-y.

479
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,340
Yes, you play a maid who explores caves.

480
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
That really is what you do.

481
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Yeah.

482
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,780
And, you know, you think, oh, this is really funny.

483
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,700
But you go to collect stars and things, but you have to, the main mechanic of the game

484
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,020
is that you duck to avoid the little zombie dudes.

485
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
The ogres.

486
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
The baseball bats.

487
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,020
Yeah.

488
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,420
And when the maid got hit with a baseball bat, I laughed out loud.

489
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,580
It's worth downloading the demo just to see that, because it's really, like, not that

490
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,380
I advocate violence against maids, but it was kind of funny the first time.

491
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,280
Yeah, because the ogre sees you and says, you know, something in Japanese and marches

492
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,220
towards you, and then here comes the club thud, and just the way they do it is.

493
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Right.

494
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,060
Now, you can hide by crouching, but the longer you crouch, your field of vision gets narrower

495
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,760
and narrower and narrower.

496
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,260
So you have to kind of crouch while you wait for the guys to pass you, which is a really

497
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,380
weird mechanic.

498
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:25,220
So, yeah, it was okay, but I don't think I would have paid money for it, but the demo

499
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
was fun.

500
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Pro tip.

501
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,620
If you're going to check out the demo for this game, go into the options, change it

502
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,920
to English, unless you read and understand Japanese thoroughly, then good on you.

503
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,860
But the first time I played through, I was like, oh, this game's only in Japanese.

504
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Great.

505
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,300
Because I don't understand it at all.

506
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,620
So I'm just like, I see a Y, like the Y button, so I'll hit that and see what it does.

507
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,460
Oh, the game must have just told me that Y does a high jump.

508
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,700
So yeah, turn it into English, you'll be doing yourself a favor.

509
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,100
Very harsh scoring, by the way, too.

510
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,680
I was very upset.

511
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,180
It's all about speed and precision.

512
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,660
Those of you people that like your speed runs might find something here for you.

513
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,020
So the third game, I don't even know what it was called.

514
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
It was crap.

515
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,020
It was total crap.

516
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,540
Beach Bubble Boo Bobble.

517
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
I don't know.

518
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,180
Beachy Booby Anime Chick Games, which, of course, Alan downloaded because he saw the

519
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,580
anime chicks in bikinis, and he was like, oh, it kind of looks like Bubble Bobble.

520
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,200
No, here's the game.

521
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,500
You fly around and you collect colored balls.

522
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,340
Doesn't matter what color they are.

523
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,440
You just clear the screen.

524
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,340
It's like Pac-Man, but crap.

525
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,220
And you want to dodge these little things that are floating around.

526
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:36,260
And if you successfully clear the level, then a little piece of the picture in the background

527
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,100
will unveil, and you might get to see some drawn boobies.

528
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,540
Some little anime babe boobies in the background.

529
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,340
You can play it with one hand very easily, because you're just clearing the screen of

530
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,660
the stuff.

531
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,940
That's all I'm going to.

532
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,700
You can infer the rest.

533
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,900
And seriously, though, if you're going to pay money to download this for your one hand

534
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,820
entertainment, like go buy a nudie mag.

535
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,860
It's money better spent.

536
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,860
This game was stupid.

537
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,980
So just go buy a nudie mag.

538
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
Or you know what?

539
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,980
Go on the internet.

540
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,860
There's titties for free everywhere.

541
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,020
Just go to nationalgeographic.com.

542
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
And if you go to the...

543
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,660
Why do you need to go to the nationalgeographic.com?

544
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It's a joke.

545
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
I'm just curious.

546
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
It's a joke.

547
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,660
All right.

548
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
So even...

549
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
Because that's where we all saw titties.

550
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Well, I don't know.

551
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,780
That's where I saw titties for the first time was in the National Geographic magazine.

552
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,060
I don't know about you guys, but...

553
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,540
Were you not breastfed?

554
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,580
And you're gay now, so that's a cautionary tale rather than advice.

555
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
So...

556
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,580
What are you trying to say?

557
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,140
There's nothing wrong with it.

558
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,140
So even...

559
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
I am who I am.

560
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
I am proud of who I am.

561
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,300
So even though we've butchered the name of the game, if you go to the Xbox Live Indie

562
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,060
Marketplace and look up new, even without even knowing the name of the game, just scan

563
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,140
through the tiles, and you will immediately know what game we're talking about just by

564
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
the image.

565
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Yeah.

566
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
Booby Beach Bubble Bobble Boobies.

567
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Yeah.

568
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,720
For the record, I love boobs.

569
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,020
You don't have to be straight or whatever.

570
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
Boobs are awesome.

571
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,020
We can all agree on that.

572
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
Right, Jamie?

573
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
Boobs are...

574
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm very fond of mine.

575
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
There you go.

576
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Everybody can agree.

577
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
And others.

578
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,500
One, two, three, four, five.

579
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,940
Five OLR people agree.

580
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
Boobies are great.

581
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Right, Alan?

582
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Boobies are great?

583
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Yes.

584
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Yes.

585
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,940
Thank you.

586
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,260
And I did see the Make a Baby game on there, but I didn't download it for you.

587
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,620
I already had the Make a Baby game.

588
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,620
Okay.

589
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,820
They have a sequel, by the way.

590
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Do they?

591
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Yes, they do.

592
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
That's the one I saw.

593
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
I haven't heard of the sequel.

594
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,300
Something about evil babies or something.

595
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Evil babies?

596
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I don't know.

597
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Like Rosemary's Baby?

598
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
I don't know.

599
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Alright.

600
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Other than that, more of the same.

601
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
More wow.

602
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,500
Super Meat Boy, which Alan loves to watch me play.

603
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Super Meat Boy.

604
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,200
Because I am not the mild man or radio host when I play Super Meat Boy.

605
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,780
But I had to check out the internets.

606
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,020
All those new levels and things that are on there, which I didn't realize, not all of

607
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,680
the levels are Super Meat Boy.

608
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,220
Like some of them are some of the other characters.

609
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,860
Like you have to play the other characters.

610
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,220
So yeah, good times.

611
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
So yeah.

612
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,660
I have that on PC, Super Meat Boy, but I haven't unlocked the headcrab yet.

613
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,900
And I'm a huge Half-Life fan.

614
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,500
So the fact that I can play as a headcrab, I need to get on that and unlock that.

615
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,020
Because that was the Valve Steam edition.

616
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Alright.

617
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:15,500
Anyhow, let's move on with some housekeeping tonight.

618
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,220
There's actually a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

619
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,220
As you might have heard, it's our 400th episode of the show.

620
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,220
And we are unveiling on the podcast this week, which yes, is up to date now.

621
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Thank you very much.

622
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,900
And we'll hopefully continue to be up to date.

623
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,540
I have some new ideas on how we're going to do that.

624
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,740
But the most important thing is that there is some brand new art for the show that we're

625
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,540
unveiling tonight, which is fun.

626
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,360
So Dark Sakura did it.

627
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
And it's nice.

628
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,540
It's nice to have a change of pace once in a while.

629
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,980
Yeah, I got creative.

630
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,060
It's not as orange as the art before.

631
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
There's orange in it.

632
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
There's orange in it.

633
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,180
No, which you know, the show is called Orange on its Radio for fuck's sake.

634
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
But it's nice.

635
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
I like what you do with it.

636
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,220
There's like a Mario theme going on, then a Charlie's Angels thing with the shadows,

637
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
which I like.

638
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
So check that out.

639
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
That'll be on the podcast feed.

640
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,100
It'll also show it's going to show up everywhere because it's going to switch the old art as

641
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,660
much as we love that picture and everything.

642
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,180
It is about five years old here.

643
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,660
Isn't that color anymore?

644
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,980
Well, you can't see the color anyways.

645
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,820
Your hair is orange in the picture because everything is my hair at the time was fuchsia.

646
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,020
Yeah.

647
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,380
That very like Mistress Tia took that picture and bitch moved to New York City like five

648
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
years ago.

649
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,340
So she's had like she's since had a child.

650
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Yes.

651
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,340
That's how old that photo was.

652
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
So now we have a new thing.

653
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Check that out.

654
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,460
And then lost a divorce worth of, you know, weight.

655
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Yeah.

656
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Oh yeah.

657
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Oh yeah.

658
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,460
So I miss her by the way.

659
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Very good job Miss Tia.

660
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,660
I know none of our listeners probably know her anymore because she was on the show forever

661
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
ago.

662
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,260
She was on the very last live OLR, if I remember right.

663
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Yeah.

664
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,060
Or it was the first OLR when we married the two shows.

665
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,580
When OLR was a live show and then separately a podcast, I think she was on the very last

666
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,980
live only OLR.

667
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Yeah.

668
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
So miss her.

669
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,780
Anyhow, reminiscing about things in the past.

670
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Other things that are going on.

671
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,940
So not only do we have new artwork to represent the show, which will hopefully spread everywhere

672
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,100
because we're replacing our old stuff.

673
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,660
The other thing is that I want to give a plug for dead pixel live, which runs on all games

674
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,380
radio Monday through Thursday at seven o'clock Eastern four o'clock Pacific.

675
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,500
I was on the show earlier this week.

676
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
So check that out.

677
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,660
It was Thursday's episode.

678
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,940
So if you want to go back in his podcast feed and look at dead pixel live.com, you can check

679
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
that out.

680
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
And you're on for a while too.

681
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
Oh God.

682
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,980
He was like on for like an hour.

683
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,220
He was nice enough.

684
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,820
Derek over at dead pixel live has been doing his show a really long time as well.

685
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,100
And he's daily.

686
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,500
So he passed 400 episodes a long time ago because he's doing like four of them a week.

687
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,400
I think for a while he might've been doing five.

688
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,580
So he passed 400 a long time ago and you know, so we had a lot to talk about as, as much

689
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,080
as how do you stay motivated to do a show.

690
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
So it was cool.

691
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,980
Cause we just kind of, you know, BS back and forth for a little while.

692
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,460
And then he had me on for the news and we talked a little bit about NGP and some of

693
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
that other stuff.

694
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
So it was fun.

695
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
It was a fun time.

696
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
So I just want to give a plug for that.

697
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,020
And if you want to hear, um, another great show, I think that's really it.

698
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,500
As far as housekeeping goes, um, add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch

699
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,460
radio, or you can always add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR lots of tweets this

700
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
week.

701
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,100
Cause we've been asking people about the show and I'll read some of those tweets a little

702
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,740
later on in the show, but for now, let's start off episode 400 as we always do with a little

703
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,340
bit of gaming news.

704
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,980
So Loki, what's going on in the world of gaming?

705
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,880
Um, same old stuff, I guess, you know, when people run out of ideas for consoles, what's

706
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,660
the first thing that happens actually, it's not even really consoles or games or anything

707
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:44,700
related to that, but, uh, even in the movie industry remakes, Hey, if it was good the

708
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,580
first time, it'll be good the second time.

709
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
Right?

710
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Yeah.

711
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
Yeah.

712
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Maybe.

713
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,220
Um, so Microsoft is rumored to be coming out, uh, well actually it's not so much a rumor

714
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
anymore.

715
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:01,140
Um, they're going to be remaking the original Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved, uh, it's coming

716
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,540
out this holiday for the Xbox 360, you'll be getting a, uh, kind of a graphical facelift.

717
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,340
Uh, they're expecting a 1080p resolution, uh, and also possibly 3D support.

718
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,020
Um, of course, uh, the thought is they're going to be remaking it using the reach engines,

719
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,220
so it'll look, you know, all fancy and stuff.

720
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,300
And uh, apparently it's being developed by, um, Saber Interactive, the company that was

721
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:38,180
behind, uh, Timeshift and, uh, Namco's, I guess, upcoming game Inversion, so, um, neat.

722
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,100
And uh, they said the game is expected to, uh, come out on November 15th, which is basically

723
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,380
ten years after the original Halo game, alongside the original Xbox.

724
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,340
It's kind of interesting, though, to go along with that, though, and maybe possibly one

725
00:29:52,340 --> 00:30:01,460
of the features of the game, uh, connecthalo.com was registered by Microsoft, um, of course,

726
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,140
this is a URL that was registered to Microsoft back in June of 2010.

727
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,500
It could be, not necessarily that it's going to be a Connect Halo game, but maybe they

728
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,660
were just, you know, registering before people, uh, cyber-squatted on it, so.

729
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,340
Oh, good point, good point.

730
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
Who knows?

731
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,460
And the only thing that the Kinect will recognize is when you dip your knees down, so that you

732
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
can teabag.

733
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
Yes.

734
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Nice.

735
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,900
Um, you know, honestly, though, I, I, I think it wouldn't be so bad if they had Kinect support,

736
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,260
but not necessarily in the fact that you have to, you know, stand up and, you know, play

737
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,580
the whole game that way, but, like, head tracking would be awesome.

738
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Okay.

739
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,420
I don't, I, I see, you know, they said, oh yeah, we can do, you know, Kinect and controller

740
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,420
games.

741
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,420
Why don't they do head tracking?

742
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,540
Head tracking would be the easiest thing to support in, like, most of these games, you

743
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,140
know, you just have it where it tracks your head a little bit, and so it kind of gives

744
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,580
you a little bit more of immersion, and you don't necessarily need to do it, and, you

745
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,820
know, and it would be pretty awesome for any first-person shooter.

746
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,980
Now, backing up a little bit before we get into this whole Kinect theory, I think you

747
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,140
said, you know, this whole thing about the game, this was not an official Microsoft announcement,

748
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
right?

749
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,020
Like, somebody just blew the lid on their big E3 surprise, right?

750
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
Yes.

751
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,100
Like, is this some type of, like, insider leak, or, because they went on down to the

752
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
date.

753
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
That's something else.

754
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,140
Well, they're, I think they're guessing on the date.

755
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,300
They're saying, you know, it makes sense because it's ten years from the original, so, you

756
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
know.

757
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Okay, fair enough.

758
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,820
Because, I mean, if you, let's see here, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna just pull this up here

759
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,900
real quick, because sometimes dates don't necessarily jive.

760
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Right.

761
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,340
The fifteenth would be a Tuesday, so that is a release date, that's usually the typical

762
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,100
release date for a lot of these games nowadays.

763
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,860
Which is great, because they're finally getting along the lines with the movie industry.

764
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,660
They all released them on the same date.

765
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,460
Not if you're Nintendo, you sometimes do Sundays if you're Nintendo.

766
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,580
They've been doing less Sundays than they would have in the past, so.

767
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,340
But yeah, Nintendo, they had to be special.

768
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,600
Now, I gotta admit, this news isn't totally surprising, because I think Microsoft kind

769
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,940
of teased this idea when they shut down Halo 2 that, well, you never know, these games

770
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
might come back.

771
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,900
So, this news isn't, like, totally surprising, but, uh, you know, I think a lot of us thought,

772
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,460
oh, it would be an Xbox Live Arcade game, or they're not gonna go back and redo the

773
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
whole damn thing.

774
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,820
I mean, Halo is a pretty good looking game anyway.

775
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,060
They probably never said it wasn't gonna be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

776
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,060
Good point.

777
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
I guess anything's possible there.

778
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,060
But if they do all this Kinect stuff, and who knows, I think they're gonna release it

779
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
as a retail.

780
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
It's gonna be retail.

781
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,060
They can charge sixty bucks before they're gone.

782
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Exactly.

783
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Go ahead.

784
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,820
I was gonna say, it just seems weird to me that we're already gonna see a trend of remaking

785
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,340
games that, cause, like, the graphics on the PS2 and the Xbox original aren't really bad

786
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,500
enough to warrant a remaking, it's like remaking, I don't know, a ten year old movie, like American

787
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Pie.

788
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,000
And plus, they upscaled that stuff anyways for, you know, if you played on the Xbox 360,

789
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,740
it does upscale those old games a little bit.

790
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,820
I mean, it's not terrible.

791
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,060
But we're already seeing this on the Playstation 3 a lot.

792
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,500
I mean, it's just like, all of a sudden, they're like, oh hey, got a word collection sold well,

793
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,380
let's remake everything, let's just update everything and port it onto the PS3.

794
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,580
Because none of that PS2 backwards compatibility is coming anytime soon.

795
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,660
Or so we think, and then all of a sudden, boom, look, oh, you know how you can play

796
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,540
those games that you just bought on the PS3.

797
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,060
I don't mind a lot of the remakes, actually.

798
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,980
A lot of them are pretty good, and they bring some bonus stuff to the table.

799
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,500
I know that might sound really weird, like the Hollywood remakes I could do without.

800
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,620
Most of those are poop.

801
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,700
But like, for instance, Square Enix, we have a show, a story later in the show about Final

802
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,020
Fantasy IV coming on the PSP.

803
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
It looks badass.

804
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,340
I can't wait to get it.

805
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,540
I mean, granted, that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy games they ever made, but I

806
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,500
mean, those Final Fantasy remakes in general, one and two on the PSP and then the ones on

807
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,980
the DS, were all awesome, and all of them were worth having.

808
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,500
Isn't that, isn't that some kind of a head scratcher too, because, you know, for the

809
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,180
longest time on the PSP, and then, granted, there's a Kingdom Hearts game here and there

810
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,220
and stuff like that, but there isn't really a lot of games I'm really interested in, and

811
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,300
all of a sudden it's like, oh, by the way, now we're gonna put out Final Fantasy IV on,

812
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,060
you know, and the after years on the PSP.

813
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,300
It's like, whoa, hey, that's pretty cool.

814
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,780
You know, I gotta pick up that.

815
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,860
Oh, hey, Earth Defense Force II is coming out on the PSP in Japan, but, you know, eventually

816
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
they'll come out over here.

817
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,860
Hey, that's pretty cool, and then, there was one other one.

818
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,260
I can't remember what it was, so, but like, I mean, you know, there's Third Birthday,

819
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,780
a new Desida game, and it's just a lot of cool stuff coming out.

820
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,260
Anyhow, go ahead.

821
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,040
I just think with games it's very easy to blur the line between what is a remake and

822
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,540
what is a port with new menus, and depending on how, you know, sleazy the company is, they

823
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,060
can call it one when it's really the other.

824
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,060
I don't know.

825
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
True.

826
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,460
One game I totally left out of my gaming week that I meant to talk about, I actually downloaded

827
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,980
on the PlayStation 3 this week the PlayStation 1 version of Mega Man 2, which they'd released,

828
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,420
I think, just last week.

829
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,540
I think these games were really new to the PlayStation Marketplace, which is cool.

830
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
I love Mega Man 2.

831
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,160
It's one of my favorite Mega Mans they ever did, and it's really just the NES version,

832
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,900
but the way they market it on the Marketplace, and I should have known this because it's

833
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:11,100
just a port of the PlayStation 1 version, but it's really just the NES game on the PS1

834
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,140
with some fancy menus, and I think the PocketStation game is in there, too.

835
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,060
I can't understand a lick of the menus because they are all in pretty intense Japanese, like,

836
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,100
it's not easy to navigate around the game.

837
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,380
I mean, you just kind of figure start, start, start, eventually will get you in the game,

838
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,380
and it does.

839
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:32,260
But unfortunately, total lack from Sony, even in the online manual, if you go into the online

840
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,860
manual on the PS3, I don't even know if a lot of you guys know this, but if you pause

841
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,500
your game on the PlayStation 3 if you're playing a PS1 game, you can go in and look at the

842
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
original manual.

843
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
It's all in there, like a PDF that you navigate around.

844
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,820
PSP has that, too, when you play a PS1 game on a PSP.

845
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
Exactly.

846
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
Same feature.

847
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,460
But, yeah, they didn't bother to translate the manual, either.

848
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,100
So it's just Japanese, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese.

849
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Great if you speak Japanese.

850
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,100
I don't.

851
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,140
Way to go, Capcom.

852
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,140
You suck.

853
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
So anyway.

854
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,580
Let's look for Roku instead of Mega.

855
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,900
Well it's just, you know, whereas I support this whole Japanese release of games, I mean,

856
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,260
I understand if they don't have the manpower to go in and translate the original ROM.

857
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,260
That is a little bit of work.

858
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,260
What they need to do is they need to give it the same treatment that it would as the

859
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Asian regions.

860
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,220
Like, for example, I imported Wangan Midnight.

861
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,340
Granted, the game's all in Japanese, the manual's all in Japanese, but they have one sheet in

862
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,380
there that's in English that basically gives you the controls of the game.

863
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Perfect.

864
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Awesome.

865
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Perfect.

866
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
That's all I need to do to, you know, play the game.

867
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,340
A few basic menus it translates for you, and the rest you have to figure it out yourself.

868
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,840
That's all you need to do.

869
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,380
That takes like one person to do that.

870
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,420
I mean, seriously, you don't even need to translate this stuff, you just kind of figure

871
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,700
it out, write it down, create a graphic, boom.

872
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Done.

873
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
What?

874
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
That's maybe a day's worth of work.

875
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,180
Oh, but that's way too much for Capcom.

876
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,580
They're too busy implementing DRM and shit, so whatever.

877
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,860
Alright.

878
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,820
Somehow we got way off base of the original Halo Connect thing.

879
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,860
But as you were talking about with Mega Man stuff, and I made the comment that was pretty

880
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:05,740
funny before the show, and you said save it for the show, so I'll just repeat it on the

881
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,740
show.

882
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,740
Sure.

883
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,700
We were talking about rehashes and stuff, and I was bitching about the Super Mario All-Stars

884
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,060
limited edition, basically a port of a Super Nintendo game onto the Wii.

885
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,460
And hey, guess what, they could have charged $8 for it on Virtual Console, but no, they're

886
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,900
going to make you pay $30 for it.

887
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,620
It's basically like Nintendo taking a giant shit in your mouth, and of course all the

888
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,620
fans will eagerly gobble it up, because it's a Nintendo.

889
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,500
And you know, shit in your mouth now also available in teal blue, so you have that option

890
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
as well.

891
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Hooray!

892
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,780
Looking at some comments from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, I'm having

893
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,820
to scroll back here a little bit because they said these a while ago, but Dark Tetsuya says,

894
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,540
See, I had a feeling Microsoft would remake the older games since the Xbox originals can't

895
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,860
connect to Live anymore.

896
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,900
Kind of the same thing I was thinking with Halo 2.

897
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,140
But Halo 1 didn't have multiplayer, I don't know if you guys remember that.

898
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,420
It had, excuse me, it didn't have Xbox Live.

899
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,540
It had like LAN support.

900
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,580
The first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception, true story.

901
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,780
And they had a LAN thing all set up with the original Halo, it was neat.

902
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,220
And then Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I'm a Halo fan, but jeesh, unless it's continuing

903
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,340
the storyline, not doing the stupid past, but I'm not into this crap anymore.

904
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,300
Well technically, Halo 1 is a sequel to Halo Reach.

905
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Technically.

906
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,300
I guess.

907
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,780
So they could say, hey, it's a sequel to Halo Reach.

908
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,980
Halo 1.

909
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,860
Because Halo 1 lacked Xbox Live, I can see where they want to do this again.

910
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,700
And they can kind of get away with it.

911
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,620
Because it would be bringing something new to the table that the original Halo didn't

912
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
have.

913
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
You know what I mean?

914
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,100
You know, maybe while they're at it, instead of straight porting it over, maybe they can

915
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,260
tweak a few things.

916
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Add some maps.

917
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Add some little...

918
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Throw the Halo 2 maps in there, durr.

919
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Add some like...

920
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,180
They need to add in red versus blue mode.

921
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,980
They're not going to add any Halo 2 maps in there, because you know why?

922
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,340
Because they're going to release Halo 2 in HD, so yeah.

923
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,900
Well then charge 1600 Microsoft points for it or something.

924
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,540
I mean, I know, wishful thinking, right, but who knows.

925
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Anyhow.

926
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,580
All right, let's move on to some other stories.

927
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,140
And yeah, this is kind of along those same lines about rehashes and so forth.

928
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,360
Although not really.

929
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
This is more of a dud.

930
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,220
This is about a game coming out on the 3DS.

931
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,740
New Super Mario Brothers was somewhat announced for the 3DS.

932
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,920
I mean, come on, people.

933
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,660
Of course there's going to be a Mario game on the 3DS.

934
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,220
But it's nice to hear a little bit of a confirmation that it is being worked on, because that tells

935
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,500
you this game is probably coming out a little sooner rather than later.

936
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,060
In fact, in my mind, this kind of says it's probably one of their E3 games this year,

937
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,500
because you know they've got to unveil some big things on the 3DS this year.

938
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Anyhow.

939
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Come on.

940
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,700
Come up with a new damn game.

941
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,700
I understand.

942
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,820
Ooh, it's New Super Mario Brothers, and we're porting it through all the different systems.

943
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Well...

944
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
Come up with a new game.

945
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,820
You don't call it...

946
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,820
First off, don't call it New Super Mario Brothers.

947
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,460
That's a stupid name for a game.

948
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,460
Well, that...

949
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,460
Okay, where to begin?

950
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
First off, that's not...

951
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
You know, they haven't confirmed that that's named.

952
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,180
Let me tell you what's been said, because we're reading a lot into this.

953
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm just saying that they have New Super Mario Brothers Wii, and they have New Super Mario

954
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,580
Brothers, you know.

955
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,140
The New Super Mario Brothers Wii is the most ironic thing ever, because it's not new.

956
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
It's just a...

957
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,660
But let's be honest, Loki.

958
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,620
The New Super Mario Brothers DS and the New Super Mario Brothers Wii are both probably

959
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,820
at least in the top ten games on those respective consoles, easily, if not the top five.

960
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,140
Okay, and so that gives them the excuse to come up with crappy names for their games.

961
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
That's awesome.

962
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Super...

963
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,980
Super Take a Dump, you know, it's the, you know, Zelda sequel.

964
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:40,980
Oh, but...

965
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980
So your problem is the name.

966
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
I don't want to see that in 3D.

967
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
My name...

968
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,740
Yeah, my problem is the name of the game.

969
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,700
It's just like New Super Mario Brothers.

970
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Wow!

971
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,340
Thank you for putting all that effort in there.

972
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,980
Well, what are we going to call this New Super Mario Brothers game?

973
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,980
That's genius!

974
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Well, now calling it Luigi's Mansion didn't really work out for them.

975
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,540
Well, that was a different game entirely, you know.

976
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,020
Come up with something new.

977
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,820
Stop porting shit over because you have casual people and playing these systems and stuff.

978
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,260
It had Super Princess Peach.

979
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,940
I don't think that did so hot either.

980
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,140
Well, that's because Princess Peach can't hold her own fucking game unless it was cooking

981
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,780
or doing makeup or something.

982
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Wow!

983
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,580
Dark Sakura, Rebuttal?

984
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
She's doing her nails?

985
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Dude, it's Princess Peach.

986
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,860
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you.

987
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,940
I was actually cutting out a very painful hangnail.

988
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Oh, okay.

989
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,020
But I have something sharp in my hand.

990
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,420
And this is home turf.

991
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,660
Dude, it's Princess Peach, though.

992
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,140
It's not like we're fucking talking about, like, Lara Croft or some shit like that.

993
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,540
It's Princess Prissy Peach, okay?

994
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,300
Hey, I love Princess Peach.

995
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Shut your mouth.

996
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Who's Daisy in the bad house?

997
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,780
The special abilities are her fucking emotions.

998
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
I'm anger now!

999
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
Ooh, I'm happy!

1000
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,300
I used to joke in Mario Brothers 2 that when she floated in her pink dress, it's because

1001
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,300
she had gas.

1002
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,300
And she'd go psssh.

1003
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,220
Fucking bipolar Princess Peach to the rescue.

1004
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,420
I will take you on in Super Smash Brothers, and I will whoop your ass with Peach.

1005
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
She's awesome.

1006
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
No, no, no.

1007
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,060
It's all about Zelda in cheek mode.

1008
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,460
Ah, yes.

1009
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,660
Zelda is pretty awesome.

1010
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Anyhow.

1011
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,260
Zelda cosplaying as a gay man.

1012
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,980
Can I read the damn quote that led us to this whole thing in the first place?

1013
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
Yes.

1014
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
What are we talking about again?

1015
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
Halo.

1016
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
Miyamoto.

1017
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,980
That's right.

1018
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
Yes, Halo on the 3DS.

1019
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,980
Excellent.

1020
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
Alright.

1021
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Look, Miyamoto says, yes.

1022
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,940
So in the interest of adopting a new technology for the Super Mario Brothers tradition, I

1023
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,960
am now making a new Super Mario Brothers game for the Nintendo 3DS system.

1024
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,140
By the way, this is out of a Q&A from Iwata on Nintendo's site.

1025
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,980
Iwata says, the next stage for the Super Mario Brothers Preservation Society's activities

1026
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,620
is the Nintendo 3DS.

1027
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,580
Miyamoto, yes, laughs.

1028
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,620
Because he's thinking about money.

1029
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,140
Miyamoto then stripped naked and landed in a kiddie pool of money and just cried and

1030
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
laughed and screamed.

1031
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Like, $50 is going to be fucking New Super Mario Brothers 3D.

1032
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,060
That is going to be the fucking title of the game.

1033
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,900
Seriously, that is going to be it.

1034
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,060
New Super Mario Brothers 3D.

1035
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,060
That's it.

1036
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
There's the title.

1037
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
You mad?

1038
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,060
Alright.

1039
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,060
I'm just saying that...

1040
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,780
Can I finish the quote?

1041
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Can I finish?

1042
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Can I finish?

1043
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,780
Fine.

1044
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Go ahead.

1045
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,300
I want to show everyone as soon as possible what the New Super Mario Brothers will be

1046
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,980
like on the Nintendo 3DS.

1047
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,460
I'm finished.

1048
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,100
I'm just saying.

1049
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,980
I want to show you what it's going to be like.

1050
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:28,980
Turn on the Wii.

1051
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,980
Turn on the DS.

1052
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,980
Done.

1053
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:42,180
But, by the way, the fact that he says, as soon as possible, do you think that expo in

1054
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,500
June in LA will be the place to see it?

1055
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,740
You know what as soon as possible is?

1056
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,940
That's Nintendo time we're talking here, okay?

1057
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,020
As soon as possible means we're going to announce it as soon as possible, but it may not come

1058
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,700
out for a couple years.

1059
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:02,460
It all depends on how quickly they can port Mario 64 3D.

1060
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:08,580
AlphaKananagram in our chatroom says, I remember Miyamoto saying he wanted to remake Super

1061
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,940
Mario World, I think.

1062
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,540
I like Super Mario World.

1063
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,080
That was like one of the greatest video games ever made was the original Mario World.

1064
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,380
By the way, the new album art kind of pays homage to that, actually.

1065
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,380
Kind of funny how that works.

1066
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,260
That was the first decent high res picture of a low res image I could find.

1067
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,260
It worked out, man.

1068
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Yeah.

1069
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,260
That's a great game.

1070
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,260
I like it, especially since a bullet bill's eating your head.

1071
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,780
Even the hater over here has to admit that it's one of the better games that they ever

1072
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,620
made as he goes back to playing Galaga.

1073
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,060
I realized after I did it that a bullet bill was eating your head.

1074
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,060
That's all right.

1075
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,060
Yeah.

1076
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
All right.

1077
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,060
How about something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo?

1078
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,060
How about it?

1079
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,060
It does have to do with Nintendo.

1080
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,060
God damn it.

1081
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,060
But not really.

1082
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,060
Well, it's on the 3DS.

1083
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,540
I'll leave it that way.

1084
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,380
Three imaginings for Pac-Man and Galaga on the 3DS.

1085
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,100
We will have Pac-Man Tilt and Galaga 3D Impact.

1086
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,100
And they are in the same pack, which is Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions that are going to be

1087
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,020
out on the 3DS.

1088
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,260
Pac-Man Tilt sort of is a gyroscope type game, so he's in Rainbow Land.

1089
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,420
Look, he paused the game.

1090
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
I'm waiting.

1091
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,260
With Championship Edition style.

1092
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,960
And it's just very Tilty.

1093
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,140
You have to watch out because you may injure yourself.

1094
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,580
I do not like Tilty games for the record.

1095
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,500
I don't want to do that on the subway, because I'll hit someone.

1096
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,240
I love this picture, by the way, of the guy moving the 3DS around and moving it above

1097
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
his head.

1098
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
There's a little picture there.

1099
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,460
Oh, Loki, did you have a comment?

1100
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:45,340
I was just going to say that, I mean, I know Pac-Man is your staple franchise, Namco.

1101
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,540
It's just like Konami trying to shove fucking Frogger down our throats.

1102
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,020
Seriously, I don't give a shit about Pac-Man anymore.

1103
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,020
I think a lot of people don't give a shit about Pac-Man.

1104
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
Grab Pac-Man.

1105
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
No, no, no.

1106
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
Hold on.

1107
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Stop.

1108
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
Stop.

1109
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
Shut up.

1110
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,020
Okay.

1111
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,020
Stop it.

1112
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,020
Real quick.

1113
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,020
Granted, Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty awesome.

1114
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,020
Thank you.

1115
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,020
Because it is like the original Pac-Man.

1116
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,100
I don't give a shit about Tilty Pac-Man.

1117
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,460
I don't give a shit about Pac-Man in a go-kart.

1118
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,580
I don't give a shit about Pac-Man at a party.

1119
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,340
I don't give a shit about multiplayer Pac-Man.

1120
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,060
I mean, it's just, Pac-Man's cool.

1121
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,900
If you want to port it 8 billion times like you've already done, fine, you know, because

1122
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,900
people just need to own Pac-Man again.

1123
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,220
But stop trying to force Pac-Man down my throat.

1124
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:39,620
That's like, I mean, seriously, it's just, okay, well, can I finish my story, please?

1125
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,060
Do people keep buying it?

1126
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,900
Because they're stupid.

1127
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,900
Because it's cheap.

1128
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,800
Because they put it out in the iPod and stuff for 99 cents.

1129
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,020
Because people buy anything for 99 cents.

1130
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,020
My sensibilities are being offended.

1131
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,020
Yes, Dark Sakura.

1132
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,620
I'm going to finish my story now, please.

1133
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,340
Go ahead.

1134
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,380
And besides that, Pac-Pix did kind of suck.

1135
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,380
Seriously.

1136
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,380
Terrible.

1137
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,340
The Galaga is going to be completely reimagined as a rail shooter, by the way.

1138
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,280
I don't know how I feel about that.

1139
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,540
The thought that I might enjoy it makes me feel a little dirty.

1140
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,540
I'd look at that.

1141
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,540
I'd check that out.

1142
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,540
It'd be awesome.

1143
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,540
You'd hit that?

1144
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,540
What?

1145
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,540
You'd hit that?

1146
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Yeah.

1147
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,660
Let's do a Space Invaders rail shooter in the time crisis engine, since we're aborting

1148
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,180
on all these franchises.

1149
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:34,980
Hey, because Yars' Revenge is going to be awesome as a rail shooter with anime chicks.

1150
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,020
I think I'm done.

1151
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,300
No interest in the battle royale game, that new arcade table.

1152
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,380
That looks kind of cool.

1153
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,380
No interest?

1154
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,380
No, it's stupid.

1155
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,860
I mean, because if you play that game with one person, you're playing the original Pac-Man.

1156
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,380
Well maybe, Loki, maybe you need to evaluate.

1157
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,140
Why don't I have any friends?

1158
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Could it be?

1159
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

1160
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,020
I don't want to be friends because I don't want to play multiplayer Pac-Man with them.

1161
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,020
Well those aren't friends I want.

1162
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:07,900
Why won't you play multiplayer Pac-Man with me, man?

1163
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,900
What's wrong?

1164
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,420
Why won't you play with me?

1165
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,420
Because you never let me be Pinky!

1166
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,620
Because you like crappy games!

1167
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:24,060
No, it's... seriously though, I mean, I had to laugh though with just that arcade cabinet

1168
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,540
because it's so expensive and it's meant to look like a cocktail cabinet.

1169
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,280
Like people still remember what cocktail cabinets are.

1170
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,020
Especially kids nowadays don't know what the fuck a cocktail cabinet is, and that shit's

1171
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:44,500
gonna get broken so fast, and, really, I don't see a big draw to Pac-Man in the arcade.

1172
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,260
People don't go to the fucking arcades to play Pac-Man, they can play Pac-Man on everything

1173
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,300
because Namco's hoarded out to everything.

1174
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,620
Including Google.

1175
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,820
Exactly!

1176
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,960
So why do I need to go to the arcade to play Pac-Man when I can play it anywhere?

1177
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,180
So how does Ultracade manage to make any money then?

1178
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,100
Because it seems like they've done a great job by cashing in on them.

1179
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,780
There's always someone on the damn Ultracade machine at Dave & Buster's.

1180
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,780
Always!

1181
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Easy!

1182
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,580
Because their cabinets are cheap to reproduce.

1183
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,060
Basically it's a cheap monitor, they have a cheap computer inside there that's running

1184
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,700
on an arcade board, they license everything, and it gives a good option for arcade owners

1185
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:24,300
because you have multiple games in one small cabinet instead of having a full arcade full

1186
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,300
of games.

1187
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,680
It's basically, you know, drop it in and you make money because everybody has a game that

1188
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,680
they like on there.

1189
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,860
And you can kick the machine!

1190
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
It's fun.

1191
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,140
Ah, moving on.

1192
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:41,860
AlphaKananagram says, how much is that battle royale cabinet?

1193
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,420
I don't remember the exact cost but I believe it's like $5,000 which is ridiculous.

1194
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,340
And it's only because there's a stupid touch screen, you know, HDTV in there.

1195
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,140
And honestly the game is-

1196
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,140
Sounds pretty.

1197
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,580
Great!

1198
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,580
You know what?

1199
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:02,920
They should just make it, port it to the Microsoft Surface because that's just, it has no software

1200
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,920
for it.

1201
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,920
I remember those.

1202
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,920
That was fun.

1203
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,100
That was at PAX that one year in that hotel that we weren't even staying at.

1204
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,900
Because we were in the other hotel down the street but for some reason, who's hotel was

1205
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,900
that?

1206
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,900
Was that Bobby's hotel?

1207
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
It was Bobby's.

1208
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
We were just camped in front of the Microsoft Surface.

1209
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,900
Actually we had a lot of fun though.

1210
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,900
That was a fun time.

1211
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,900
We were playing with the fish.

1212
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,900
We were.

1213
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,900
Google Maps.

1214
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,900
Anyhow, sorry.

1215
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,900
Reminiscing.

1216
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,900
Yeah.

1217
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:35,460
So move server is coming to PC is apparently maybe revealed at a game developer's conference.

1218
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:40,940
Now what move server is is actually kind of a software development kit for porting move

1219
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,500
controls over to the PC so you can use the, you know, move on the PC.

1220
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,700
Not to be outdone by the Kinect or anything.

1221
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,180
Neat idea I guess.

1222
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:56,900
They already have kind of move type controllers anyways for the PC.

1223
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,580
But I guess if you, you know, really want to find another use for your move controller

1224
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,180
then you can go ahead and use it on your PC.

1225
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,740
I'd imagine though you would need a Bluetooth adapter and, well obviously the stuff for

1226
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,640
the move, the camera and everything.

1227
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,340
Obviously no software supports it yet but, you know, it's set to be announced possibly

1228
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,420
on March 2nd.

1229
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,340
Am I the only one that doesn't really understand the need for the Kinect and the move stuff

1230
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,340
on the PC?

1231
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,500
I don't know about you guys, but my PC is in my bedroom and it's kind of in a space

1232
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,900
where I don't really want to move around.

1233
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,060
Like that's my place to get fat is I sit my butt in that chair and I have my feet up on

1234
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,580
the desk and I'm playing World of Warcraft.

1235
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,740
Click click click click click.

1236
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,740
Yeah.

1237
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,580
I don't play Kinect in my bedroom.

1238
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,660
Here's the thing for the move stuff.

1239
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,660
Who would do that?

1240
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,660
Well.

1241
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,660
Maybe a paraplegic.

1242
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,860
The Kinect, I mean, I think is going to entice people more to hook it up to the PC because

1243
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,140
of all the cool, neat things you can do with it.

1244
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,000
The move is really just another controller.

1245
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's like the Wii.

1246
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,700
And honestly, the move wasn't that exciting when it came out on the PlayStation 3.

1247
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,760
I mean, it's a decent controller, but it, and I know that they're really pushing hard

1248
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,220
for it to be like a first person shooter and a hardcore accessory.

1249
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,260
But honestly, the hardcore players out there, they see right through this shit and they're

1250
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,300
not going to just go buy their stupid looking machine gun looking thing to plug this thing

1251
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:25,740
into just because it's supposed to, it doesn't make you more accurate in these first person

1252
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,740
shooter games.

1253
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,860
It's just kind of weird.

1254
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,660
But I don't think that you're going to see a lot of super innovative stuff with this.

1255
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,500
I mean, the same type of stuff that you would see with this, you can do already on the Wii

1256
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,380
remote with a Bluetooth adapter.

1257
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,220
So I don't know, I'm just kind of scratching my head with it.

1258
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,740
But hey, whatever, you know, they can go, hey, look, we're on PC too, yay.

1259
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,460
You know, I just kind of saw this as trying to beat Microsoft to the punch in kind of

1260
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,660
officially supporting them because they clearly, Sony sees, oh, great, people want to have

1261
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,300
these motion controllers on their PCs.

1262
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,300
That's awesome.

1263
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,700
But the thing is, though, is it, I mean, what are you going to be able to do with it?

1264
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,340
That's my thing is what are you going to be able to do with it?

1265
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,900
I mean, the controller, it's pretty accurate and stuff, but it doesn't do all the cool

1266
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,420
nifty like, you know, 3D scan stuff that you can do with the Kinect.

1267
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,180
It's just, you know, good.

1268
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,260
Now I have the vision camera support or whatever in, or not the vision camera, the PlayStation

1269
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,260
Eye.

1270
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:32,500
You know, big deal, now I can, I have a webcam, whoo, I mean, it's just, I don't see the point.

1271
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,940
I would be kind of curious, though, I don't know if you actually need the eye camera.

1272
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:41,420
I wonder if you can just use normal web cameras to, kind of as like the eye, that'd be kind

1273
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,420
of neat.

1274
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,420
See if you could do that.

1275
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,260
But, I don't know, whatever, I guess it's good that they have another option.

1276
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,420
I just don't see a lot of, you know, unless it's other than indie games and stuff like

1277
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,260
that, I don't see a lot of people, like, adding support for this for their games.

1278
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,900
I just don't think that's going to happen.

1279
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Again, I don't, if you have to buy all this other stuff to make it work, like the Bluetooth

1280
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,740
adapter or whatever, well, I guess computers haven't built in nowadays, right?

1281
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,180
A lot of computers have them, I mean, laptops and stuff have them built in.

1282
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,900
Not so much, you know, actual PCs and stuff like that.

1283
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,860
But I mean, that stuff's cheap.

1284
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,380
It's not too expensive to add a Bluetooth adapter.

1285
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,220
If you're really interested in this stuff, and hey, you may have one for like a headset

1286
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,540
or something like that, so, great, but, I don't know, I guess it's neat to have the

1287
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,140
option, but I just don't see a lot of people using this.

1288
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,260
I think that the Kinect is going to be a lot more popular when it comes to stuff.

1289
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,900
I mean, you'll see a lot of, you know, cool move hacks and stuff, and I mean, granted,

1290
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,780
they could have come up with, I mean, it's Bluetooth, they could have come up with custom

1291
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:48,260
drivers and stuff for the, the move controllers and everything, but you don't see anyone doing

1292
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,380
that because no one cares.

1293
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,660
It's just like, I don't think anyone's going to really care when this comes out for PC.

1294
00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:01,260
Alright, well, let's move on, since Loki is such a fan of Nintendo tonight, I just have

1295
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,380
to get his opinion on this story.

1296
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,580
One of the big games that Nintendo was hawking at last year's E3 was Zelda Skyward Sword.

1297
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,880
Well, it looks like that they might be kind of pushing that game again at the expo this

1298
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,940
year because it looks like Skyward Sword is going to be a little while before it comes

1299
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,940
out.

1300
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,760
It's clearly the first quarter of the year, it's not happening.

1301
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,800
Second quarter of the year is looking a little grim because they have said that The Legend

1302
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,880
of Zelda Ocarina of Time has been in the process of being remade for Nintendo 3DS, and this

1303
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,140
Nintendo 3DS version is expected to hit the market earlier than Skyward Sword.

1304
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,500
And that's what Satoru Iwata says in a recent financial report piece.

1305
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Come on, folks.

1306
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,980
I mean, remade.

1307
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,820
All they're doing is just porting the assets to the fucking 3DS, that's all they're doing.

1308
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:47,820
Ooh, remade.

1309
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,700
I thought at one point Nintendo was touting how easy it was to port games over to 3DS.

1310
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Exactly!

1311
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
That's why there's so many-

1312
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,700
Anything with a Z-axis.

1313
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,940
It's just all, all it is is just, you know, some core engine stuff that they're rebuilding

1314
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,340
and then all the assets and stuff, they're just porting on over.

1315
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,700
I don't think that they're really up-resing a lot of the stuff that's on there.

1316
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,820
They're just kind of straight porting it over and then, you know, tweaking the engine a

1317
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,300
little bit to have it all run in.

1318
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,860
That's all they're doing.

1319
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,700
The Skyward Sword stuff, I'm not surprised.

1320
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,340
I mean, look at how long, you know, Metroid Other M was delayed.

1321
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:24,220
I mean, it was just kind of getting pushed back and back and back, you know, for a while.

1322
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,460
And same with a lot of the other games.

1323
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,020
And I would not be surprised if something like this, you know, doesn't come out.

1324
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,260
I mean, because a lot of times I think that they're, they promise a lot of games that

1325
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,180
come out and then they just don't have them.

1326
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,380
And so they're like, okay, well crap, what's it going to be our holiday game or something

1327
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,380
like that?

1328
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,620
And then it'll get pushed to, you know, November or something like that.

1329
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,180
Because really they haven't announced a lot of stuff.

1330
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:52,860
I mean, sure, there's gonna be stuff at E3, but I don't know.

1331
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,420
It's just, they're going to be looking for that big holiday title and sell more systems

1332
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,420
for the Wii.

1333
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,420
That's kind of my thought too.

1334
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,780
You know, Miyamoto, they say in this that Miyamoto's team is entering the final completion

1335
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,100
stage of the Wii title, whatever that means.

1336
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,860
But this kind of makes me think that maybe part of the reason for this delay is so that

1337
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,060
they have something to show on the Wii this year at that big expo.

1338
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:13,060
You know what I mean?

1339
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,820
Like maybe, uh, there's not a lot else scheduled to be coming out on the Wii.

1340
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,820
Maybe just Dance 3?

1341
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,820
I don't know.

1342
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:26,220
I mean, I think what, well, some things I could see them doing, like, uh, you know,

1343
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,100
New Super Mario Brothers 2, you know, I could see them doing something like that just because

1344
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,620
they already have the engine built and it's basically just building new levels for it.

1345
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:38,100
Maybe tweaking and adding some new things on their new abilities or some shit like that

1346
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,460
and everyone will go buck wild over it.

1347
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,620
Um, uh, they've been promising Pikmin forever, so they'll make me a new Pikmin game.

1348
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:50,740
But honestly, I mean, I just can't get too excited about Pikmin, I'm sorry.

1349
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:56,460
Um, I mean, I think this year there's going to be a lot of 3DS games, um, you know, you

1350
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,460
may see...

1351
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,460
Of course.

1352
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,940
You're going to see a lot of stuff that they've already announced that's not coming out, like

1353
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:06,500
the Kid Icarus game, again, is going to be another focus of, you know, E3 because it's

1354
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,460
probably going to be their, I'd be willing to bet that's one of their holiday titles

1355
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,460
for the 3DS.

1356
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,940
Um, I don't know, it's just, it's more of the same.

1357
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,380
I mean, that's all it really is, it's just, you know, what franchise haven't they put

1358
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,380
out for a while?

1359
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,220
I mean, okay, that's probably going to be the game coming.

1360
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,660
Alright, let's go to Dark Soccer with another story for us, then we'll get to release dates.

1361
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,020
We are just Nintendo focused today, aren't we?

1362
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,740
Oh, we go where the news is.

1363
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,400
Well, Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

1364
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,820
He has a problem with mobile gaming.

1365
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,520
I have a problem with mobile gaming.

1366
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,700
He has a problem with how cheap mobile games are, like, you know, for iPhone and this type

1367
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,700
of app games.

1368
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:54,740
He's basically, um, quoted saying that one of the biggest risks in the industry is inexpensive

1369
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,940
games that are disposable from a consumer standpoint.

1370
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:03,100
As in, oh crap, 99 cents, I'm fine with it, I'm done with it.

1371
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:08,540
And basically it removes the idea of, you know, value from the game because now you're

1372
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:14,900
so saturated with things that are so cheap that you expect everything to be so cheap.

1373
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,380
What an amazing fucking metaphor for the state of games on the Wii.

1374
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,380
Yeah.

1375
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,700
I mean, here's the problem though.

1376
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,700
Irony much?

1377
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,140
You know, the problem with that thought though is that, what if those cheap games are really

1378
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,140
good?

1379
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,660
Well, see, that's what he said.

1380
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,060
Well, now that's not possible.

1381
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:36,080
He used Angry Birds as an example of the diamond in the rough, you know, that every so often

1382
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,580
you come up with something that's exceptional, but for the most part, they're all just cookie

1383
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:41,580
cutter crap.

1384
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,560
Well, hey, you know, guess what, Nintendo?

1385
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,620
You have this thing called the DSiWare service, why don't you start cutting, you know, coming

1386
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:55,120
up with some really cheap concept games, sell them for, you know, a buck, and make some

1387
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,180
money instead of bitching about how other people are being successful.

1388
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,420
Waaah!

1389
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,500
People are selling games and making money.

1390
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,420
Why didn't I think of that?

1391
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,420
Waaah!

1392
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:10,420
Why isn't my, you know, twenty dollar copy of Let's Go Cook Some Shit in My Kitchen,

1393
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,180
you know, not selling well?

1394
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,180
Why?

1395
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,100
What, people don't like math tutor games?

1396
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,100
What's wrong with them?

1397
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,700
Why isn't this selling?

1398
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,700
I mean, come on.

1399
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:24,580
Because Nintendo has to put forward this illusion of quality with things that they put out,

1400
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:32,540
and yeah, I agree, a lot of it's crap, however, they do have their corporate image to uphold.

1401
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,580
It's part of who they are, part of their branding.

1402
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:39,340
They give, they stop caring about quality when that fucking seal left their goddamn

1403
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,340
boxes.

1404
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,340
And you know how many years ago that was?

1405
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,900
A long time ago.

1406
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:49,140
They don't give a shit, it's all about, what can we port, what will people want to buy?

1407
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,580
What can we make them want to buy?

1408
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:55,540
Oh hey, let's uh, let's port some GameCube games over and add Wii controls to them.

1409
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,500
For the record, I do see people buying that shit.

1410
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Exactly.

1411
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
They're making money.

1412
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Exactly.

1413
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,500
They're making money.

1414
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,740
They're literally bitching about somebody using a different business strategy to make

1415
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,740
money.

1416
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,740
Oh, I know.

1417
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,740
Because they didn't think of it first.

1418
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,020
If they didn't think of it first, and because it's competing with their market, and now

1419
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:19,500
they're saying, well, how do we justify these games that are, you know, possibly crap like

1420
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:24,540
this for $20 when these people are selling something similar that may be better than

1421
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,740
our product for a dollar?

1422
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,500
They can't.

1423
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,340
You know, I gotta say though, to some extent, I think he has a point, because a lot of the

1424
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,380
mobile games on the iOS system are pieces of shit.

1425
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,740
Like a lot of them are truly terrible games.

1426
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,740
Yeah.

1427
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,740
Go ahead.

1428
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:46,060
A friend of mine once said that trying to find a good app game at that price point is

1429
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:50,060
like trying to get honest nutrition from a vending machine.

1430
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,180
More often than not, you're getting a melted Snickers.

1431
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,180
Sort of weird metaphor.

1432
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,180
But I like it.

1433
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,180
It's true.

1434
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,140
First five minutes.

1435
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:06,580
But you know, and to some extent, I'm willing to pay 30, 40 bucks for a great game if I'm

1436
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:10,460
going to get that value out of it, you know?

1437
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,380
Sometimes if I get a really good game for a dollar, it does kind of feel like a steal.

1438
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:16,620
Hence like Steam sales.

1439
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,620
That's another big thing.

1440
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,900
I get great games for $4, $10.

1441
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,160
I find it hard to, you know, excuse the fact that people are saying, well, there's a lot

1442
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,900
of crappy games out there on the iOS.

1443
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,260
Yes, there are.

1444
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,260
And you know what?

1445
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,180
If you do some research and before you, you know, purchase your games, you don't have

1446
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,980
to buy all those crappy games.

1447
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,300
Same with, you know, the more expensive games.

1448
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,820
If you do your research, you don't have to buy the expensive games.

1449
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:42,580
But at the same time, he's basically saying, well, these games are cheap and there's no

1450
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:44,280
good cheap games out there.

1451
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,280
That's not true.

1452
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,140
The difference being is that in the case of some of these games that are on there for

1453
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:53,580
dirt cheap, they're made by like a couple of guys who are just hanging out and like,

1454
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,580
oh, let's put a buck on it.

1455
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,820
We have to put something on it.

1456
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:56,820
Let's do a dollar.

1457
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,500
They just do it for fun.

1458
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,140
You know, those little games come out, sometimes there'll be a company behind it.

1459
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,380
With most of Nintendo's stuff, you're looking at basically developers, people who have to

1460
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:10,300
pay employees to develop this, you know, bigger companies.

1461
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,060
You're dealing with a corporate structure.

1462
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,820
The other thing to look at too is that, you know, yeah, they have the DSiWare, but most

1463
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,780
of their games are still physical games.

1464
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,780
You have to pay for materials.

1465
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,420
You have to pay for packaging.

1466
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,840
There's a designer that goes into designing the box.

1467
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,420
You've got someone doing the manual.

1468
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,220
You have a technical writer writing everything that goes in the manual.

1469
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,980
You have someone documenting the game mechanics.

1470
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,060
You've got however many programmers.

1471
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,540
You're actually having to pay more people for the product.

1472
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:44,460
Therefore the price point is going to go up and they have to make a profit on it.

1473
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,720
So you're dealing with corporate business as opposed to a couple of people just putting

1474
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,860
out a game for shits.

1475
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,860
But I'm a consumer.

1476
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:52,860
I don't give a crap about that.

1477
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:53,860
And that's the thing.

1478
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:59,300
If they have this option to release a game for $10 instead of say $30 just because they

1479
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,900
can avoid all those costs, why don't they do that?

1480
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,980
Because if they market it well enough, they will have no problem selling that.

1481
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,520
I guarantee if there is a good game that came on DSiWare, there's blogs that cover that

1482
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,900
shit every week of what comes out.

1483
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,100
People will be aware of it.

1484
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,260
People will buy it and that's it.

1485
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,180
I mean it's same with like Xbox Live Arcade.

1486
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,300
There's tons of stuff that's $10, $20.

1487
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,380
I mean there's great games.

1488
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:25,420
For the most part, if they put out something that's going to be half the price to market

1489
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:29,220
and they raise the price of it $10, chances are they're actually going to end up making

1490
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,740
more money that way.

1491
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,740
Here's a question.

1492
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:37,700
You bring up a good point about like really everything that goes into making a video game.

1493
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,420
But as the industry kind of moves towards this digital distribution thing, I think as

1494
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,180
a whole, I think in the next generation of consoles, you're going to see more direct

1495
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,540
downloads of games and you know, hence why we see GameStop starting to already come up

1496
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,740
with their plan B, so to speak.

1497
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,860
Should these people in the middle kind of be worried?

1498
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,780
Well no, I see things definitely going that way.

1499
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,260
But for right now, with what they have now, I think that, and keep in mind Nintendo, for

1500
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:06,900
all the innovations that they like to bring in, they are very reluctant to change.

1501
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,100
How long do they stick with a cartridge?

1502
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,140
I mean really.

1503
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:16,740
They do have that reluctance to embrace something new as far as marketing and distribution strategy

1504
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,820
is concerned.

1505
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:24,300
But I think that, you know, they're probably going to be another 10 years late like they

1506
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,340
were before, but they're going to eventually catch up to it.

1507
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,580
Right now, that's not in the way that they operate.

1508
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,460
That's not in how they do business.

1509
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,460
And they can't really see anything outside of their own box.

1510
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:38,860
They may think that they're innovating in the way games are played and the way things

1511
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:39,860
are doing.

1512
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:46,440
They're looking at the way we can innovate what we have now within this little cube.

1513
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,020
Not meaning to bring up the GameCube, of course.

1514
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:55,780
But they've always been about their own proprietary hardware and their own proprietary way of

1515
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,760
delivering the games.

1516
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,980
They've been about doing things the Nintendo way.

1517
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,900
And if you look over the course of the years, their business model really hasn't changed.

1518
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,300
There hasn't been any real change in their strategy.

1519
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,020
They've still kept things.

1520
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,220
They want tight control over everything.

1521
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,420
They want things to be to the Nintendo standard.

1522
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:22,060
Even if the game is suck, all of the releasing of that game is done to Nintendo standard.

1523
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,180
So I think it's also another way that they, you know, I mentioned their branding before.

1524
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:30,500
I think it's actually a way that they protect their corporate identity too, is by having

1525
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,900
such tight control over how everything goes out.

1526
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,500
Unfortunately, that's money out of their pocket.

1527
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
That's the way it goes.

1528
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:42,480
That's how they can't see outside of their own business model to see a way that another

1529
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,460
business model could work for them.

1530
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:46,820
All right.

1531
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,820
They're afraid to change.

1532
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,820
I think they're afraid to take a risk.

1533
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,900
I kind of agree and I don't want to go too far off track, but you know, companies afraid

1534
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,900
to take risks.

1535
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:55,900
That's something we've covered before.

1536
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,180
And that is why Konami is not making the most profitable guitar game.

1537
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,180
Although they could have.

1538
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,180
They could have.

1539
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,180
They wanted to take some risks.

1540
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,180
They had it.

1541
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,180
They had it.

1542
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,180
I had it in my hand.

1543
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:07,180
All right.

1544
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,180
Anyhow, let's move on.

1545
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:11,220
We got to travel the world and talk about release dates of games that are coming out

1546
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,220
very soon.

1547
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,220
Let's start in the US.

1548
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:18,500
This week, taking some serious risks on Nintendo Wii.

1549
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,900
Mario Sports Mix.

1550
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:27,180
It's a sports game with Mario and other people and some Square Enix characters as well.

1551
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,820
People love their Mario games.

1552
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,540
Brain and Body Connection.

1553
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,940
This is a game that's kind of similar to the Brain Age game that was on the Wii.

1554
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:39,200
That was on Xbox 360 supporting the Kinect, or I should say requiring the Kinect.

1555
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,220
Press Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 this week.

1556
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,940
Junior Brain Trainer 2 on Nintendo DS.

1557
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,820
This is pretty awesome.

1558
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:57,140
Finally making its comeback, You Don't Know Jack on DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360

1559
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,140
this week.

1560
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,140
Oh my god, that's this week?

1561
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,140
That's this week.

1562
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,140
Holy crap, yay!

1563
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:02,940
Is there like a demo or anything for this?

1564
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:03,940
I don't know if there's a demo.

1565
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,940
Actually, I heard there's probably a video on some website.

1566
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:11,780
But I've heard if you pre-order it, it's $30 and it's going to be like $40 after pre-orders.

1567
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,780
Something like that.

1568
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:13,780
That's not right.

1569
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,780
I don't think so.

1570
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,580
That's just what someone said on the message board.

1571
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:22,620
They dropped the price on it, so they probably told people to make some more pre-orders.

1572
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:26,300
Trinity Souls of Zillow on PlayStation 3.

1573
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:34,900
That's from, looks like Tecmo.

1574
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:38,480
And Zuzu Princess, yay!

1575
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,480
Another hamster game.

1576
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:51,860
And then about a week from today, Dragon Quest VI, Realms of Revelation.

1577
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,860
Realms of Revalency.

1578
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:57,180
Sorry, can I look at this preview real quick for You Don't Know Jack here in studio?

1579
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,180
Sure.

1580
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,100
I just kind of want to check this out because I used to love this game so much.

1581
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,300
So THQ is making this game.

1582
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,740
Wow, that's an old logo.

1583
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:08,740
Jellyvision.

1584
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:09,740
Yay.

1585
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:13,220
You don't know Jack.

1586
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:19,620
The Trivia Party video game is back and all new for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo

1587
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,060
DS, and PC.

1588
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,740
Everybody's favorites are still there.

1589
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,820
Twisted trivia questions, the dis or dat, screw your neighbor, and the Jack Attack.

1590
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:31,020
Plus all new face-melting features and surprises, including online play.

1591
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:37,020
From socialism to social networks, from bigamy to bigfoot, from wargames to drinking games,

1592
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,060
it's You Don't Know Jack.

1593
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,340
Yeah, I gotta buy it.

1594
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:43,340
Damn it.

1595
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,060
I'm trying to save money, but I need this.

1596
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,060
I need it.

1597
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,060
When?

1598
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:52,540
Will your liver explode if you don't have that, Rob?

1599
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:53,540
Possibly.

1600
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,940
My spleen will be painin'.

1601
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
It's only 30 bucks, though.

1602
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,940
That's not that bad.

1603
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,940
Does it make your liver quiver?

1604
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:58,940
It's only 30 bucks.

1605
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,940
You heard the man.

1606
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,940
It's half the price.

1607
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,580
It's half the price of what I paid for that crappy Tron game.

1608
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,660
Anyhow, anything else this week, Logie?

1609
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,660
No, that's it.

1610
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,660
All right.

1611
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:13,900
Let's move over to Japan and talk about what is coming out over there in Japan this week.

1612
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,780
On the 8th of February, the Asia regions are getting test drive unlimited too.

1613
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,120
Sometimes the Asia dates sneak their way onto my list.

1614
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:27,780
But on the 10th of February, actually in Japan this week, Entaku no Saito, Students of Round,

1615
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:28,780
comes out this week.

1616
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,580
I'm not sure what that is.

1617
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,100
It's an RPG game on the Xbox 360.

1618
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,660
Looks like, kind of neat, looks like you can have like a party of six people and you can

1619
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:45,120
kind of use your D-pad to use like, you know, attacks or spells or items.

1620
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,140
This looks like it might be very old school RPG.

1621
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,840
It doesn't look like it has kind of all the newfangled stuff in it, so.

1622
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,680
It's called Entaku no Saito, Students of Round, is what it's called, Logie?

1623
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Students of Round.

1624
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,680
Yes.

1625
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,680
Students of Round.

1626
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
And Final Fantasy VII.

1627
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:04,540
Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare finally makes its way to Japan this week as well.

1628
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,540
So if you are in Japan and you like yourself some Red Dead Redemption, check it out.

1629
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,540
PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, LittleBigPlanet 2 finally makes it your way, as well as Red

1630
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:18,340
Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare, and Sengoku Musou 3Z comes out in a regular and like a

1631
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,280
special limited edition.

1632
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:26,320
So if you are a fan of these games, this is the third one in the series from Koei.

1633
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,820
I think it's like a Dynasty Warriors-esque kind of game.

1634
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,540
It's more Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1635
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,540
Oh yes.

1636
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,020
And you like choose between all these different characters.

1637
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:34,020
It looks like there's like 20 different characters.

1638
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:37,540
Basically, if you see Sengoku in the name, that's what it is.

1639
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:45,060
Alright, moving on to some of the other consoles, going to the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou 3

1640
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,300
Moshuden, which means scale down version.

1641
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,780
I just made that up, but seeing as it's on the Wii, it probably is a little bit different.

1642
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,780
Something legend.

1643
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,780
Side story.

1644
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:02,020
Nothing on the DS this week, obviously, because they're still warming up for the 3DS out there.

1645
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:09,060
So the only other system that I would really mention is the PSP, which has Tales of the

1646
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,500
World Radiant Mythology 3 coming out this week from Bandai Namco.

1647
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,100
So check that out.

1648
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,700
Music game fans, DJ Max Portable 3 is out next week.

1649
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,380
Thought I'd throw that out there.

1650
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:24,560
This looks a little bit like that Final Fantasy Crisis Core, kind of, but a different set

1651
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,020
of characters, this whole Tales of the World.

1652
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:33,100
I wonder if that's the Tales of Blank series, kind of on the PSP.

1653
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,060
Don't know.

1654
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
How about Europe?

1655
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:44,860
Well, for Europe, we have on the 8th EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velious on PC, and Explodemum

1656
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:49,300
Demon, Explodemon on PlayStation 3.

1657
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,640
On the 11th, we have Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and Dr. Kawashima's

1658
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,900
Body and Brain Training on Xbox 360.

1659
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:04,140
We also have Edna and Harvey the Breakout on PC, Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, and Trinity

1660
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,100
Zil-ol-zero for PS3 by Koei.

1661
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,740
All right.

1662
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,500
Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we got the classic game of the week,

1663
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,280
and it's a good one for episode 400.

1664
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,260
People are going to be tingly in their special places.

1665
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,260
I hope so.

1666
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,100
Let's move on with a couple quick stories before that.

1667
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:27,100
We talked last week about how Sony announced the PlayStation suite, which will bring PlayStation

1668
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,500
1 emulation to the Android platform.

1669
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:39,140
Well, there's rumors that they may be expanding the suite to cover other operating systems,

1670
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:45,140
including the iOS format, as well as Windows at a later date.

1671
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:49,060
So it might make it kind of cool to have an official PlayStation 1 emulator.

1672
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:53,620
I can't imagine how that won't be cracked, but okay.

1673
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:59,420
I actually already have plenty of emulators out there, now that I think of it.

1674
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:07,660
They're even saying that it's possible that other Sony products, like Sony Internet TV

1675
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:11,620
powered by Google, might also get some support for it.

1676
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,780
That might be kind of neat, I guess.

1677
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:19,660
Make some really cheap PlayStation 1 players, I guess.

1678
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,660
Yeah.

1679
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:26,740
So they have a completely open stance to it, they say.

1680
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,740
So that's pretty neat.

1681
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:33,860
I can totally see them doing that.

1682
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,880
I guess wherever the money can be made, right?

1683
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,300
That's the old rule of thumb.

1684
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
Exactly.

1685
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:43,500
And honestly, I think porting it to a PC platform would probably be a little bit better, seeing

1686
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,860
as, you know, you have buttons.

1687
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,740
And as they stress, you know, buttons are important.

1688
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,060
Except on these certain mobile phones, we'll make do without them.

1689
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:59,860
Speaking of mobile phones, and especially the whole crossover, and this is kind of ironic

1690
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:03,780
considering the story that DarkSakura was talking about a little earlier, Angry Birds

1691
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,980
is apparently making its way onto the 3DS.

1692
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,980
That's right.

1693
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,160
Rovio, who makes Angry Birds, they're trying to bring Angry Birds to just about every platform

1694
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
that's out there.

1695
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,220
And of course, that would include the 3DS.

1696
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:21,420
They spoke with 3DS Focus, and they are saying that they're going to bring out their games

1697
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:26,420
on the 3DS's download titles later this year, including Angry Birds Rio.

1698
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,020
There you go.

1699
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:31,980
So they're gonna be in awe-inspiring 3D.

1700
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:35,300
Angry Birds is also out for the PS3 and the PSP, if you're curious.

1701
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,300
Come on!

1702
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,600
It's Angry Birds, a 2D game.

1703
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
Does that really need to be a 3D?

1704
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,060
Maybe you can, like, be behind the bird while you shoot things.

1705
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,060
I don't know.

1706
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,060
That's dumb.

1707
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,580
It is a little dumb.

1708
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,580
Alright.

1709
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:58,060
Uh, let's get into a segment we like to do on the show here where we walk into the vault

1710
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,060
and pick a game.

1711
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,540
It's the classic game of the week.

1712
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:07,100
It's DarkSakura's opportunity to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be worshipping

1713
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,100
this game.

1714
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,880
Or at least check it out.

1715
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,500
It's the classic game of the week.

1716
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,660
This is another game that we should introduce by menu, Rob.

1717
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:15,660
I will try.

1718
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,740
Not everybody's gonna recognize it, you know.

1719
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,740
I know.

1720
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,540
But the people who do will get special brownie points.

1721
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:21,540
Here we go.

1722
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:24,540
Let's fire it up here and look at some of the music.

1723
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:28,740
Or at least some of the ambience from this game.

1724
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:34,220
Ah, memories.

1725
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:41,260
Best menu music ever.

1726
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,260
Alright.

1727
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,260
What is it, DarkSakura?

1728
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,260
I'm dying.

1729
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,260
It's B-Mania.

1730
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,260
Yay.

1731
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,380
It is the game that started it all.

1732
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,500
This gave us the whole Bimani thing.

1733
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,700
This gave us Orange Lounge Radio.

1734
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:00,380
Gee, Konami, what were you thinking?

1735
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:08,860
But it started off in 1997 and really got big in 98.

1736
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:14,900
I remember back in the day having the emulator BM98 on my computer so I could play B-Mania

1737
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,620
stuff at home.

1738
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:21,100
That was my first Bimani experience with BM98.

1739
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:28,580
And from there we've had B-Mania 2 DX, we've had B-Mania 3, we've had DDR, Para Para, Dance

1740
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,780
of Maniacs.

1741
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,780
So many.

1742
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,780
So many.

1743
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:36,000
But let's go ahead and focus on the original B-Mania.

1744
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:44,460
You had five keys and a turntable and everybody was right-side pride back in the day.

1745
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:49,620
And so basically the little platforms would scroll down on your screen and you had to

1746
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:55,140
hit the corresponding button or scratch at the right time or a combination of buttons

1747
01:17:55,140 --> 01:18:00,180
with a very interesting kind of low-quality video playing in the background that was typically

1748
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,520
just repeated scenes over and over again.

1749
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,060
It was the PlayStation 1 after all.

1750
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:07,900
Well I'm talking about the arcade one too, shoot.

1751
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:13,940
But yeah we had, it came out on the PlayStation, they had the really nice controller and the

1752
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:18,660
dinky controller and I started off with the dinky controller and then bought a nice controller.

1753
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,660
And we had all kinds of versions.

1754
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:26,500
But we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about B-Mania's second mix and B-Mania which was

1755
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,140
the first one that came out on the PlayStation.

1756
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:35,900
We had practice mode where you could practice, free mode and expert, expert plus and easy.

1757
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,680
That was actually available in third mix.

1758
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:45,860
Expert plus was offered in sixth mix and of course boss battle where you would, that was

1759
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:51,540
just so much fun watching the, actually you'd also have your tutorial mode too where they

1760
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,540
would tell you how to play.

1761
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,540
B-Mania 3 had that too.

1762
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:57,320
B-Mania 3 had an effector pedal which I don't think I played a single song on that game

1763
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,020
that actually used the pedal, but it did also have the effector sliders which was really

1764
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:03,020
neat.

1765
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:08,380
And the cabinets were, there was a standard cabinet and a mini cabinet.

1766
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:13,580
The standard I'm sure is the one that most everyone's seen which is the 29 inch screen.

1767
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:18,740
The mini cabinet had the 20 inch screen and basically I think one was space saver or the

1768
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,740
other.

1769
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:24,820
But the mini cabinet they didn't get too many released in the US.

1770
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:30,460
If you can find an American beatmania that's made of the mini cabinet, probably kind of

1771
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,980
worth some money I think.

1772
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:37,420
However you can go buy old beatmania machines for like what, 300 bucks at the metronome?

1773
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,420
Seriously.

1774
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:46,180
But I remember back in the day when we would get new bit money games and would trek across

1775
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:54,180
California to you know go to Milpitas or Sunnyvale or I remember going for when DDR Max came

1776
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:58,980
out going to San Diego and looking for one there while I was already there.

1777
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,940
But yeah we've got also all kinds of different versions that have come out.

1778
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:11,020
We've had beatmania, actually the US beatmania which is actually beatmania 2DX, the 7 key

1779
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:18,500
with the switchable turntable had a beatmania mode in it which basically was just 5 keys

1780
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,820
but I'm not gonna pick on that.

1781
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:25,260
There were versions for the Game Boy Color and the WonderSwan Color which we knew somebody

1782
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:29,580
who had that, an ex roommate of yours.

1783
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:33,580
It was really hard, the little scratching table was like it attached to the WonderSwan

1784
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:40,020
and it didn't quite work on the WonderSwan Color quite right.

1785
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:43,420
And they also had little keychain beatmania games too.

1786
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,820
It was a huge fad for a while.

1787
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:47,500
Very big.

1788
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,700
And Konami, oh Konami.

1789
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,460
They were kinda late to jump on the beatmania bandwagon in the US.

1790
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:59,020
They didn't listen to their fans, well a couple of them listened to their fans but nobody

1791
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,220
listened to them for quite a while until they were like oh I see you're importing it, let's

1792
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,220
bring it out.

1793
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:09,220
Gee DDR is suddenly selling over there, maybe we should have got on that a while ago.

1794
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:15,940
The first official beatmania game in the US you guys was a port of 2DX night style, sorta.

1795
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:21,300
It kinda used that interface and had a mishmash of games.

1796
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,820
Oh yeah the crappy, I don't even acknowledge that.

1797
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,820
But it is beatmania.

1798
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,820
Yeah that's true, that's true.

1799
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:32,940
And it came out relatively early enough and we had one of those at RVGL.

1800
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:39,180
And it was, let me just go back into the list of the games and keep in mind I probably have

1801
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,180
most of these.

1802
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:44,940
I remember when I went hunting down a club mix cause that in my opinion is the best.

1803
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:48,420
Can you play salamander beatcrush mix or?

1804
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,100
Yeah I can play salamander beatcrush mix, hold on.

1805
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,460
I didn't see what you were playing, oh you're playing overdoser?

1806
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:56,940
No you had some video of it.

1807
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:57,940
Let me actually do this video.

1808
01:21:57,940 --> 01:21:59,820
The only cool part of this one is the beginning of it.

1809
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:03,140
I don't think this is somebody filming their TV, I think this is actual, oh they are filming

1810
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:04,140
their TV.

1811
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,140
Oh wow.

1812
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:10,300
Oh there's this one actually, this is an actual.

1813
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:20,180
There we go, yeah.

1814
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,860
Which really only at the beginning sounds like salamander music.

1815
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,860
Right.

1816
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:29,100
But I mean they did have all kinds of remixes from their old games in that too but here's

1817
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,420
all the different versions.

1818
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:35,860
As far as arcade releases we had beatmania, beatmania second mix, third mix complete mix

1819
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:39,700
which was hip hop mania over here, we got that as hip hop mania.

1820
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,460
We had fourth mix the beat goes on, fifth mix time to get down which actually had a

1821
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,460
lot of good music.

1822
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:49,060
There was complete mix 2, now take that back, that was the one that we had because it had

1823
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:52,060
3, 2, 1 stars in it, remember.

1824
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,100
Anyway, club mix, beatmania featuring dreams come true which was a little j-pop band back

1825
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:04,160
then, beatmania core remix, there was sixth mix UK underground musics, seventh mix keep

1826
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,740
an evolution and beatmania the final.

1827
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:10,780
And in korea there was beatstage, beatstage third mix, beatstage complete mix, beatstage

1828
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,580
fourth mix, the beat goes on, fifth mix time to get down and in north america we had hip

1829
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,220
hop mania complete mix and complete mix 2.

1830
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,220
Geez.

1831
01:23:18,220 --> 01:23:25,020
On the playstation, I'm gonna read them all, it's episode 400 and I can, beatmania, beatmania

1832
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:30,460
append yebisu mix which I have, third mix mini, append third, yeah these are all appends

1833
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,820
which basically if you had the first game you bought the appends and you'd swap them

1834
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:40,380
which made it a pain in the ass if you were on an american system trying to get them to

1835
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:45,460
play and having to do the disc swaps and all this crap which I found my way around.

1836
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:50,980
You get a little thing that plugs into the back, there was go to mix, fourth mix, fifth

1837
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:58,580
mix best hits, dreams come true, go to mix 2 going global which was actually pretty cool,

1838
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:04,060
club mix, the sound of tokyo which was also fun, sixth mix and beatmania europe.

1839
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:10,820
For gameboy colors there was beatmania gb, gb2 gotcha mix and gb2 gotcha mix 2.

1840
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:15,060
Wonder swan, there was beatmania for wonder swan, there was a bajillion bemoni pockets

1841
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:20,180
which I was talking about little monochrome lcb screens and they were little but the fun

1842
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:26,060
thing about that is there was an anime song mix that was all stuff from anime by go nagai

1843
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:32,500
which is like cutie honey and mazinger z and you know, there was a toki meki memorial

1844
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:40,020
version because you know konami own toki meki memorial, a bunch of anime, there was a hello

1845
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:46,460
kitty mix, there was enjoy georgia's signature, there was tiger's version, kawaii version

1846
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:51,900
which means cute but it had to do with magazine, toki meki 2 love stories, kona mix best hits

1847
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:56,500
2000 and tiger's version 2 which was for the hanshin tiger's baseball team.

1848
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,460
Baseball is a big deal.

1849
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,420
And that's it.

1850
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,020
If there were more, I ain't reading them.

1851
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:06,260
Right, it was a lot to begin with but it just shows you like how big and it was so weird

1852
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:11,100
that this game just didn't really, it was a cult thing here, it really was, so like

1853
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,380
under the radar.

1854
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:14,540
We were weird for liking this game.

1855
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:19,620
I just remember and this is actually literally how I got into it.

1856
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:28,540
It was probably february of 98 on, I think we were actually on the old penny and two,

1857
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,860
the overclocked 60 to 120 computer dan had.

1858
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:36,420
One of my friends saying, hey there's this game out in japan but we can't get it but

1859
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,460
here's an emulator.

1860
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:40,460
And it was bm 98.

1861
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:41,460
Nice.

1862
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:44,460
And then it went from there.

1863
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
Right.

1864
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,300

So we're going to give that away when we come back with more of orange lounge radio.

1880
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:50,020
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio we are live on this sunday evening february

1881
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:56,260
the 6th of 2011 at allgames.com for our 400th episode of our show.

1882
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:02,260
So welcome you guys and loki is in the house he's playing gal gun tonight and he's been

1883
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,000
playing it pretty much during the entire show and he's not ranting about something nintendo.

1884
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,940
So loki what do you think so far?

1885
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:11,340
Like right now he's in like a music room something I don't know shooting girls with love.

1886
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,220
It's a weird game I don't know I don't really know what's going on but I know that they

1887
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:20,420
have this like focus mode where you're doing something to parts of girls and then they

1888
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:25,300
orgasm and it causes the other girls to orgasm or whatever they faint with love what it's

1889
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:34,780
an orgasm okay so hot infectious orgasm strange fun all right yeah I could see why they got

1890
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,420
rid of the panty shots though because I mean it would have been porn pretty much yeah is

1891
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:42,700
that now we were talking earlier about one-handed games do you think algun could be a one-handed

1892
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:51,660
game with a special controller maybe I mean because you'd have to you'd have it's hard

1893
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:55,620
because you have to aim with the left analog stick and then you have the flashlight attachment

1894
01:27:55,620 --> 01:28:00,260
issue with the a button I was gonna say if it had an auto auto fire then yeah because

1895
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:04,820
then you could just auto fire maybe and they have like a zoom you probably do with like

1896
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:09,300
some sort of like special like remappable like nunchuck type controller or something

1897
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:13,380
where you have a shoot button as a trigger and maybe you could do it one-handed then

1898
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:20,380
but no it's not a one-handed game all right well I love this new video capture card thing

1899
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:25,020
it's awesome we're gonna get into some rapid-fire news here in just a little bit but first we

1910

very fat and sassy I got her to play this morning you got her to play what wow no I

dangled a string oh she's like bat that was fun good times my cats used to lose their

1913
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:42,660
mind over the laser pointer and now the best that they'll do is if you wiggle the laser

1914
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:47,340
dot they'll do the with their arms they're like I'm gonna reach for it but that's it

1915
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:52,020
I'm not chasing that shit anymore I'm too old so bat bat did I tell you that when I

1916
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,420
got Shermy one of those she hated what you do know she looked at the little dot and then

1917
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:04,800
she looked right up at the pointer realized how it worked and didn't try anymore sure

1918
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,380
we just don't care all right she's smart when she's trying to be lazy another spin-off show

1919
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:13,260

1922
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:30,320
podcast engine you use just look for horde house h-o-r-d-e-h-o-u-s-a by the way speaking

1923
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,460
of World of Warcraft I understand a lot of my guildies are listening at least that's

1924
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:40,020
what excellent just told me so hi guild grats on level 9 why aren't you in chat beating

1926
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:49,300
hit level 9 we were really close and everybody's doing their alts right now it looks like so

1927
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:54,420
you get lots of guild leveling from that all right but we'll save the rest of the wow chatter

1928
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:00,380
for the best little horde house in Azeroth which usually releases Thursdays ish depending

1929
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:05,040
on our taping schedule which is really erratic although I will say this extra for told me

1930
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,620
he loved the live show love the live show and kind of wants to do it again so you never

1931
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:15,260
know what might happen we might have to storm the OLR studios more than once a week all

1932
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:22,220
right anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news and lots and lots of news that we just

1933
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:25,820
don't have time to talk a whole long time about because you know we've got to fit in

1934
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:32,740
Nintendo rants for Loki so Loki armored core 5 was announced and it's kind of cool it's

1935
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:36,540
been announced for a while but they announced that it's going to have team based online

1936
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:43,060
multiplayer which is pretty cool it's expected to come out over here I guess they're saying

1937
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:50,780
it's 2012 in North America and Europe and late 2011 in Japan but the game looks pretty

1938
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:56,420
awesome kind of reminds me a little bit of the like the crossing oh god chrome hounds

1939
01:31:56,420 --> 01:32:02,500
with armored core 4 which is pretty cool because that chrome hounds kind of had that team based

1940
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:08,080
co-op stuff and chrome hounds kind of had like that cultish following to it but unfortunately

1941
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,740
not strong enough following to necessitate a second game right yeah it was kind of like

1942
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:19,980
think their version of like a North American armored core just stick with armored core

1943
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:25,460
the problem with chrome hounds was it was slow just slow mechs slow everything whereas

1944
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:32,820
armored core is just kind of fast and fast-paced lots of missiles and yeah so um that'll be

1945
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:38,300
kind of cool and expect that next year I guess uh Namco announced that yes guess what we're

1946
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:42,860
gonna do another Ridge Racer this current generation I'm gonna wait for another console

1947
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:51,340
to come out Ridge Racer yes Ridge Racer unbounded and that's gonna be on Xbox 360 PlayStation

1948
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:58,060
3 and PC in 2012 the game had a little teaser trailer for it of course no actual gameplay

1949
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:05,060
but it basically kind of resembles burnout and it's actually being developed by Bugbear

1950
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:10,620
Entertainment who of course put out the game flat out so they kind of know something about

1951
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:17,540
destructible racing games and I don't know it looks kind of neat I like burnout Ridge

1952
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:22,980
Racer is kind of cool so Ridge Racer drifting with burnout which of course what story about

1953
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:35,020
Ridge Racer would be incomplete without damage it's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer PlayStation yes

1954
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:41,900
and then this is not too unexpected but Project Dark which was a working title for of course

1955
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:47,980
this new game Dark Souls was announced in the latest Famitsu magazine it's basically

1956
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:56,460
gonna be the kind of a successor to Demon's Souls but not in a way they're actually saying

1957
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:04,420
that they're making the game harder and they said I guess similar it's gonna be similar

1958
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:09,980
in style but not necessarily a sequel to Demon's Souls and players will be able to create their

1959
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:15,660
own characters though they're no longer I guess different job classes I guess just tweaks

1960
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:20,860
to the world design as well the world is no longer divided into levels instead being one

1961
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:25,700
large area and there's gonna be cooperative and competitive players will it be as fucking

1962
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:33,540
hard because oh my it's gonna be harder oh god seriously Demon's Souls is awesome couldn't

1963
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:39,340
tell you much about it though because I keep getting killed horrifically over and over

1964
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:46,580
again it's not a forgiving game and let's see what else well they're cool tidbits did

1965
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:52,580
they have about it of course they said that the online system will be returning and it's

1966
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:59,620
been highly enhanced to allow users to share experience and they said grow together in

1967
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:03,380
the world although I'm sure that means going to other people's games and trying to kill

1968
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:10,380
the other people like you could in the original neat I know the first game is pretty cool

1969
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:15,220
it's kind of a sleeper hit so it should be good all right moving on to some other stories

1970
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:19,140
you know earlier in the show we talked about this and Final Fantasy 4 the complete collection

1971
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:24,060
on the PSP I am so excited for this because I love one and two on the PSP and this looks

1972
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,340
amazing it's gonna be coming out April 19th at the complete collection so and that is

1973
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:33,000
the North American release day wow that's right it is so you're getting an awesome game

1974
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,900
as a present for your birthday from Squeenix it's gonna retail for $30 and of course if

1975
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:42,460
you haven't heard this is the original Final Fantasy 4 and the after years which came out

1976
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:46,500
originally on mobile gaming over in Japan and later on the Wii I played about I don't

1977
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:50,380
know half of it on the Wii but there was a lot of download episodes you had to do and

1978
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:54,980
I beat like two of them but yeah it'll be nice to have the entire collection on the

1979
01:35:54,980 --> 01:36:01,500
PSP this story almost makes me a little sad because I have Final Fantasy 4 for the DS

1980
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:06,140
the 3d one that they did played the first hour of it gorgeous love it my favorite Final

1981
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:10,380
Fantasy and now it's like I feel that I shouldn't play that and finish that because this is

1982
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:14,540
coming out even though that the art design is totally different you know I really liked

1983
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:20,700
the 3d Final Fantasies which is weird because I was I'm usually not like into the 3d stuff

1984
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:25,940
but I just I love the art style on the PSP ones like it's just so sharp and they've just

1985
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:29,900
retouched those sprites and it's that this this is the same look that they gave Final

1986
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:33,820
Fantasy 1 and 2 and apparently there's supposed to be like new effects with the magic and

1987
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:37,780
everything and there's you know there's some videos out there too it looks great have you

1988
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:41,540
seen the trailer I haven't it looks pretty cool let me see if I can do I know it's supposed

1989
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:45,620
to be rapid fire news let me see if I can do a quick quick quick shot of the trailer

1990
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:53,500
here which was available somewhere let me see if I can find it I might have to search

1991
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:58,100
YouTube for it so maybe I'll show you later remind me after the show all right let's move

1992
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:03,020
on though with other releases tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad new school

1993
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:07,340
tapper not the old school tapper yep that's right it's a brand new tapper game that's

1994
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:12,580
going to be coming out you know root beer tapper if you never played the old school

1995
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:16,780
one that's actually beer which most people I don't think ever played the beer one so

1996
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:22,540
I remember it root beer tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad all those iOS it's

1997
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:27,440
going to be called tapper world tour it is not a port of the original game I mean obviously

1998
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:31,980
it's that same same kind of feel but it's all new graphics and this is what's kind of

1999
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:37,260
cool the new graphics it's all hand drawn graphics courtesy of you ready for this dark

2000
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:41,920
Sakura Don Bluth is doing all the drawing for this game and if you don't know who that

2001
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,700
is he did the dragon's lair games back in the day and he's kind of like a legend in

2002
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:50,340
the animation circles so that's awesome actually like at first I was kind of like I love tapper

2003
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:54,100
it's like a farce old school games go but when I heard about this I was like oh yeah

2004
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,460
yeah another yeah this would be like yards revenge turning in her first person shooter

2005
01:37:57,460 --> 01:38:00,220
that'll be great but then I heard like Don Bluth's doing all the art and I'm like oh

2006
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:05,140
now it just went like the 80s awesome again yeah to bring it back to Don Bluth he did

2007
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:12,340
the secret of NIMH movie and Xanadu oh god and all dogs go to heaven and I want to say

2008
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:21,880
Fern Gully was that him or no I think perhaps IDK anyway that guy he's awesome alright moving

2009
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:27,540
on to a story about Castlevania you know Castlevania harmony of despair is one of those games is

2010
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:34,300
available on Xbox Live Arcade well there is a new stage that's available for 240 Microsoft

2011
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:42,140
points it's based on an original Famicom Konami title Getsufuma den so there you go 160 points

2012
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:47,340
if you want to actually play as the character Getsufuma it has 8-bit graphics though and

2013
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:52,180
I guess it's kind of old school sorry I didn't mean to do the loud but this is kind of what

2014
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:59,500
it looks like here in the game see if I can kind of kind of neat those almost look like

2015
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:11,440
little metroids that you're fighting there so there you go that's coming out soon moving

2016
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:17,500
on Dark Sakura some quick stories for us and the Twitter topics is twitter.com slash olr

2017
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:24,180
well we talked about Pac-Man in part A Ms. Pac-Man is going to be coming out for iPad

2018
01:39:24,180 --> 01:39:31,140
and then there will be a free Valentine's Day update for Pac-Man on the iPhone it's

2019
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:38,900
a more Namco love in the form of Pac-Man so that's cute and then this makes me happy Puyo

2020
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:44,220
Puyo will be on Virtual Console in Japan and it will have online multiplayer so I guess

2021
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:49,060
Nintendo sort of getting it but not really well hold on you said Virtual Console and

2022
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:54,740
online multiplayer yes in Wow I don't know what those words mean when they're put together

2023
01:39:54,740 --> 01:40:01,100
I know it's not that I are you sure Puyo Puyo I love Puyo Puyo the original have online

2024
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:08,380
multiplayer you could play two people it was on like the Sega Genesis right I know but

2025
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:13,300
Nintendo never adds anything to their game so it must have been on the original I'm glad

2026
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,700
I've foreseen the internet and you know there were four player versions though that came

2027
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:23,140
out on Nintendo 64 and Saturn I'm glad a landmark game such as Puyo Puyo yeah it's like Puyo

2028
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:29,340
Puyo is amazing but of all the games like why I don't understand but they like to keep

2029
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,180
us confused that's maybe they're waiting to see how this does and then they're gonna go

2030
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:39,180
back and do everything else and re-release it for eight more dollars with online multiplayer

2031
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:44,540
and all that shit that we should have had the first time right Dark Sakura yes it was

2032
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:50,620
such a fun game such a fun game and then we have a little bit of something else we have

2064
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:41,260
get to 1000 episodes let's see if it took us almost 10 years to get to 400 we'll be

2073
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:36,340

2074
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,820
don't have the pictures anymore i feel like there needs to be a sock puppet to accompany

2075
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:46,140
that there kind of was okay you have to understand ddr on the pc had downloadable characters

2076
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:50,840
it was kind of this neat thing and one of the characters was like this full-on bondage

2077
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:57,140
guy in outfits named mr spanky and so i used to do an impersonation basically sounds like

01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:03,100
this guy they find it okay to be able to jailbreak ps3s or whatever in those it's gonna matter

2109
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,780
anyway but they're fine they're trying to take down as many people as possible or mainly

2110
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:13,820
just to scare people i guess whatever well it's like when the ria takes a random housewife

2111
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:19,300
or grandma and says all right you have four songs from kesha on your computer so we're

2112
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:24,020
suing you for like 30 million dollars and your appeals will get denied it's the same

2113
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:31,460
thing i didn't mean to download the kesha it just infected my computer i think i slept

2114
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:44,060
with someone and suddenly i got a kesha infection that sounds like a disease i'm sorry i i caught

2115
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:48,900
kesha oh and then and then here here's here's something better if if you want to kind of

2116
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:54,580
follow up with that you know sony is hunting everybody down lennox has been brought back

2117
01:48:54,580 --> 01:49:00,620
to firmware 3.41 uh nothing public yet but they've brought it back and not only is it

2118
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:05,940
brought back but now it has full access to all the uh resources of the playstation 3

2119
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:15,260
so it's lennox better i guess it's super lennox lennox evolved lennox evolved it knows

2120
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:22,780
uh big thanks to all the people that are tweeting about our 400th episode really appreciate

2124
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:43,980
catch crabs i didn't catch kesha all right tiger claw says it's a tweet one tweet tells

2125
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:46,820
me he wasn't listening to part a he must have been watching that football game because we

2126
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:51,060
talked about that story already but i'll read this other one mad cats is making a replacement

2127
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:55,100
fight stick panel for mortal combat this is a tweet from our pal tiger claw who always

2128
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:59,380
promotes our show we appreciate him uh he says uh or i'm sorry this story says that

2129
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:04,540
there is a mortal combat tournament edition arcade stick um but i guess it has kind of

2130
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:09,440
like a unique layout to it so uh mad cats came out and says there's going to be a replacement

2131
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:14,020
panel for the current tournament edition fight sticks that will let you have the arcade perfect

2132
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:18,760
controls here's the deal remember like street fighter has like six buttons but mortal combat

2133
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:22,580
has like well it also has six if you count the run button but they're in like a different

2134
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:27,620
arrangement it's like an x you know it's all pump it up style high low punch high low kick

2135
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:31,620
block exactly block is in the middle and kind of makes an x and then run is kind of like

2136
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:35,960
awkwardly off to the side so there you go so that's kind of cool they're making a new

2137
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:41,220
overlay for that that's kind of awesome actually uh all right and sturlock is um sending us

2138
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:45,360
a tweet about uh what we can do in the next few episodes of orange lounge radio just keep

2139
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:49,900

2140
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:56,820
four hundred episodes of awesome oh you guys are awesome uh sj100 matt says we need t-shirts

2141
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:05,260
within the next 400 episodes we probably do all right that's it for twitter topics tonight

2142
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:09,060
except i have to point this out uh salacious pop you know how i told you the guildies were

2143
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:14,460
listening to tonight's show yeah i just got a i got a text there from uh one of our guildies

2144
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:24,440
there spike raging at kesha hate which by the way have you seen that toy that they sell

2145
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:29,140
in targets this little uh dancing a little uh like valentine's day doll that you can

2146
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:36,860
give somebody speaking of which

2147
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:43,820
almost sounds like the real thing look at that all right moving on how about some actual

2148
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:49,940
gaming news back to more video games more video games less kesha sorry uh loki all right

2149
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:55,700
um this is kind of cool um well the game's kind of cool what they're doing not quite

2150
01:51:55,700 --> 01:52:01,940
cool uh bionic commando rear arm 2 just came out on the playstation network and on xbox

2151
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:09,140
live arcade you may remember back uh final fight double impact uh where there was kind

2152
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:17,660
of this unannounced uh drm in place basically you had to be connected to the internet in

2153
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:22,060
order to play the game so if you downloaded it and say you want to play it offline or

2154
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:27,780
if your internet cut out that sucks and then of course you know capcom apologized you know

2155
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:31,460
for it and stuff but really what they're apologizing for is that they didn't tell you about it

2156
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:36,220
up front because bionic commander 2 rear armed has the same drm in place you have to be connected

2157
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:41,460
to the internet in order to play this game they've done that because um they don't want

2158
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:45,240
people sharing the game apparently there is a way you know you could share the game up

2159
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:51,940
to five times by recovering your accounts and stuff like that and um so people buy a

2160
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:57,740
copy and then they share with you know four other friends and stuff um and so now they

2161
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:01,500
have a note on the game listing it says no you must log into the playstation network

2162
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:06,660
each time you play the game uh this is while final fight double impact um i guess they

2163
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:13,180
had like a online co-op mode rear arm does not have an online co-op mode or an online

2164
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:21,260
mode at all it's an offline game so it's just kind of a dick move if you ask me well distributing

2165
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:25,640
their game is also a dick move yeah but you know what though the thing is is this is pissing

2166
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:31,420
a lot of people off in the you know some people may not care about it and will purchase the

2167
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:35,820
game but some people actually are just not purchasing the game regardless of they didn't

2168
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:40,700
even care about sharing the xbox one at the same requirement i don't think they do interesting

2169
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:44,240
you know i could see where people like you can't share the game back and forth because

2170
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:48,680
what if like you have to uh you know what if you're just ps3 isn't hooked up to go online

2171
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:53,520
but then i think well you got to go online to get the game so i guess not having an internet

2172
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,400
connection okay let's let's play devil's advocate here say you take your ps3 to a friend's house

2173
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,100
and say oh i really want this game you go to the friend's house hook it up to your internet

2174
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:05,860
connection download the game and then you take it home you're like crap can't play it

2175
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:09,740
i i realize things are different now but like i know back in the day like especially with

2176
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:14,260
the dreamcast i used to have to run a gigantic cord across the entire house and hook it into

2177
01:54:14,260 --> 01:54:19,940
my dreamcast if i wanted to play so you know it wasn't always online and i think some people

2178
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:24,320
are still kind of doing that with ps3 even though it has built-in wi-fi just some people

2179
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:28,860
in some places are a little bit behind the times you know it happens especially if you're

2180
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:34,560
on wi-fi wi-fi can be sketchy sometimes true you get drops every now and then um have they

2181
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:37,460
said what happened what happens if like you you know you start up the game and then your

2182
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:41,220
wi-fi just cuts out because i've had problems with my internet connection i think you get

2183
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:45,660
kicked out of the game oh my gosh that that's just like the ubisoft one that they got torn

2184
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:51,500
a new one over yeah interesting this is capcom the new face of capcom they do cool shit and

2185
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:59,180
then they start you know copying games and doing drm schemes it's like who are you capcom

2186
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:05,860
seriously i don't even know you anymore all right well this story has been making a lot

2187
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:10,900
of rounds this week uh this is about you know e3 big expo in june and i've talked a lot

2188
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:13,640
about how this year is definitely going to be either like one of the best shows ever

2189
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:18,540
or one of the worst well it's definitely going to be a different show uh e3 it was announced

2190
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:23,140
this week uh has been declining a lot of media badges a lot of the people that have got in

2191
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:27,340
in years past they're not getting in this year why aren't they getting in because now

2192
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:33,740
e3 is seeing how much traffic you get and they're using websites like compete.com zenu

2193
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:38,820
returns.com is that a Scientology thing oh forget it uh quantcast.com and Alexa they're

2194
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:42,460
using these sites and some of the rejection letters that they're sending to sites go something

2195
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:48,100
like this uh e3 expo 2011 show management has placed caps on this year's media badge

2196
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:53,160
assignments due to the tremendous number of requests for media badges etc etc we require

2197
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:56,900
that sites be fully launched operational for six months and that the website receives a

2198
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:03,620
minimum of 8 000 monthly unique impressions as a baseline for each media badge issued

2199
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:08,380
quantcast.com for example currently has your site listed at approximately 10 000 monthly

2200
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:13,560
uniques for the month of december 2010 based on the above we can approve two media badges

2201
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:19,560
for site that provided this info at this time wait a second for every 8 000 though but they

2202
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:25,060
only have 10 000 that's not 16 000 so i don't maybe they're being nice or maybe maybe they

2203
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:30,080
hit the cap for one and then i don't i don't know so but there's a lot of people out there

2204
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:35,100
that are really upset about this and you know to be honest uh if olr wanted to go we probably

2205
01:56:35,100 --> 01:56:38,720
wouldn't be able to under these conditions because i looked up our site on one of these

2206
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:43,940
i think we have like 800 hits or something but that's like really wrong like i don't

2207
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:47,260
know what these sites use to measure maybe you know more about this stuff salacious pop

2208
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:51,100
some of them some of the websites that you do the tracking you actually have to put an

2209
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:56,360
embed code or whatever some sort of code that's in your ridiculous web pages so yeah i mean

2210
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:03,180
come on our podcast gets downloaded more than that exactly plus we're a podcast we don't

2211
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:08,140
i mean we don't have really a website that uh you know caters to i mean you know there's

2212
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:13,060
people that work very hard on our website but mostly the website is a place for our

2213
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:17,480
show to be delivered and occasionally a little story that kind of kicks it back to old school

2214
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:23,640
lr about old school songs or whatever you know so these sites would not measure our

2215
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:28,180
download shows now granted i haven't asked for an e3 pass i haven't you know so i haven't

2216
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:32,400
had an official rejection so it's hard to say i almost wonder if maybe i should register

2217
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:37,140
as broadcast media if i want to go but at the same time like seriously all the other

2218
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:42,600
indie shows i know are getting like told no or they're getting like one batch and i'm

2219
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:47,660
kind of like well if no one's freaking going to e3 this year then fuck it i'll read about

2220
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:51,540
it on the internet you know part of the fun of going e3 is kind of getting to see everybody

2221
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:58,260
it was you know seriously it was fun going to e3 but honestly last year you know i didn't

2222
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:03,100
miss it i mean i watched all the press conferences which it's great i got to watch the press

2223
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:06,620
conferences that's better than going to e3 because i didn't get to watch the press conferences

2224
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:12,180
when i went to you know e3 because i didn't get invited to the press conferences so you

2225
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:17,260
had to watch some streamed and honestly streaming it was great i got to watch that i got all

2226
01:58:17,260 --> 01:58:21,420
the coverage i possibly wanted to you know absorb in there didn't have to wait in lines

2227
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,300
for games so granted yeah i didn't get to play demos i didn't get to try out the 3ds

2228
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:31,320
and stuff but eh whatever you know i i don't really care there's two ways you can kind

2229
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:35,940
of look at this and one is that you know at the big sites are getting bigger and the small

2230
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:42,100
sites are getting smaller like how are independents and startups supposed to compete if e3 is

2231
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:46,220
not going to let them in because they're not already a big site i mean this is just letting

2232
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:53,020
one up and ign have more quote-unquote exclusives to mix in with the stories they copy from

2233
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:58,260
small sites let's be real where do they get their information they either get granted

2234
01:58:58,260 --> 01:59:02,940
exclusives because they're big sites or they scour the internet up and down and get them

2235
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:07,860
from the little sites we know because we've had stories taken from our site and put on

2236
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:13,100
these sites before oftentimes without credit i'm just saying how did they get to be so

2237
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:17,340
big you know because they have all that type of manpower etc etc corporate funding blah

2238
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:23,660
blah blah so on that end it's kind of bullshit but on the other hand i understand why e3

2239
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:27,760
kind of needs to clamp down because there are a lot of people getting in that probably

2240
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:32,980
should be yeah but especially as media okay i was gonna say yeah but there's a lot of

2241
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:38,940
you know like sales associates and stuff like that over you know at retail stores and stuff

2242
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:43,900
like that that are getting in that maybe don't really necessarily need to be there but i

2243
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:48,700
don't know at the same time it's just like but where do you draw the line where do you

2244
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:52,800
draw the line i think if you meet the qualifications of having the business license and everything

2245
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:56,740
like that you've obviously established yourself as a legitimate thing you should at least

2246
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:02,820
get one or two but i understand like if you know joe's podunkgameblog.com tries to get

2247
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:07,940
20 badges i get why that's a problem especially with these stories about people are selling

2248
02:00:07,940 --> 02:00:11,700
their badges and everything way to go few bad apples for ruining the barrel for the

2249
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:18,000
rest of us truth be told if you really wanted to go to e3 this goes to anybody if you really

2250
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,260
wanted to go to e3 you could still you know how you have to do it you pay 400 and you

2251
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:26,220
just get one of the badges it's not really an advertised thing but you can totally go

2252
02:00:26,220 --> 02:00:29,840
on there and they they say like industry or whatever you could say you're a student or

2253
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,620
whatever i'm i'm if you're willing to throw four hundred dollars at them they're gonna

2254
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:40,460
let you in why wouldn't they you know what i mean so again despite the traffic our site

2255
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:47,140
gets if i really wanted to go i could pay four hundred dollars and go but and and and

2256
02:00:47,140 --> 02:00:53,260
honestly media badges even if you have a media badge yeah and you're not an ign or one up

2257
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:56,900
or something like that right you're just gonna get treated like shit so it's it's it's seriously

2258
02:00:56,900 --> 02:01:01,260
it's they're like oh who are you oh no i'm sorry we're not giving you an interview you

2259
02:01:01,260 --> 02:01:08,300
you may get a few um you know scheduled meetings with some of the uh i think the largest ones

2260
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:14,660
we got into like uh like sony bethesda or and stuff like that but you know sony online

2261
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:20,260
not so many computer entertainment um but like they really don't give a shit about most

2262
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:25,380
of the press especially unless you're a big site because that's where the traffic is yeah

2263
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:29,580
you won't be invited to the closed door presentation where they're only allowing ten people to

2264
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:35,420
see cooking mama five gladiator acts battle you know so you you don't get those hush hush

2265
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:41,620
meetings by the way there's another problem i have with this um i kind of think it's a

2266
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:46,340
little bit i mean it's the way they're measuring is also kind of the part that peeves me a

2267
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:51,580
little bit because it's really unfair to podcasters and so forth and plus like i said the webs

2268
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:56,660
that website tells you we get 800 hits unique hits i could whip up stats that tell you the

2269
02:01:56,660 --> 02:02:01,720
number is much higher like astoundingly higher and look i'm not trying to have an ep conversation

2270
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:06,980
here or what have you i just i have facts to back it up we have the number to get everybody

2271
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:12,760
in this room in e3 if they would take our stats which are i believe more accurately

2272
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:20,100
measured than any of this stuff but you know whatever anyhow so this isn't a me me poor

2273
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:23,680
me because if this is the way it is you know e3 it's a private show they can do what they

2274
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:33,460
want but if nobody's going then at the same time what do we owe e3 i mean these companies

2275
02:02:33,460 --> 02:02:38,700
are making announcements at a show in los angeles why should we continue to post about

2276
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:42,800
e3 expo and all this stuff and let it get more google hits and all this other stuff

2277
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,340
you know why are we inflating them if they won't help inflate us maybe that's something

2278
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:52,860
the indie folks need to be asking themselves maybe the time during this expo this year

2279
02:02:52,860 --> 02:02:58,820
is maybe time we should be highlighting games that are in our boat can't afford a big booth

2280
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:03,020
at this show they can't afford to compete with the big guys maybe this is a week for

2281
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:11,220
the indie shows to celebrate the indie games and maybe maybe that's something we'll have

2282
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:20,020
to consider for this year so uh also i wanted to say this i kind of don't want to spend

2283
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:24,220
400 to go to e3 or whatever whatever it is i mean again to be fair i haven't even tried

2284
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:28,060
yet i haven't got told no yet if none of my friends are going i'm just gonna fucking go

2285
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:32,900
to packs like that's where it's at you know that's where all the gaming people are and

2286
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:37,060
you know packs at this point is you get to see a lot of the same demos that are already

2287
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:43,140
at e3 and it's more of a nerd convention and so forth there you go packs is way more fun

2288
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:50,660
than e3 mm-hmm so i kind of miss what they did like in 2006 i think is what it was during

2289
02:03:50,660 --> 02:03:55,600
e3 where it was like hey guess what you know uh we have this awesome demo on the show for

2290
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:00,060
philosophy and guess what it's also on xbox light marketplace go check it out you don't

2291
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:03,140
have to go to e3 you can check out some of the demos that are gonna be on the show floor

2292
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:10,120
right here you know just get a chance to play them that's awesome we will see what develops

2293
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:16,100
in this story because speaking of develops what what's that you know uh i still have

2294
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:24,020
a dev console that still has access to uh a certain net that are partnered with different

2295
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:32,860
uh publishers out there a lot of e3 demos pop up on too i bet we hear more information

2296
02:04:32,860 --> 02:04:37,500
on this before the show actually hits because again it's it's uh you go look at some twitter's

2297
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:41,580
out there there's a lot of negative buzz on it right now so i don't think e3 is gonna

2298
02:04:41,580 --> 02:04:45,820
like all that negative buzz they don't give a shit because guess what the end of the day

2299
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:49,540
they get their coverage on all the big sites and you know what that's what they don't give

2300
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:56,660
a shit indy blogs might be little but they're loud besides if all the big boys are getting

2301
02:04:56,660 --> 02:05:00,500
their stories from the indie blogs anyway at some point they're gonna pick up on this

2302
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:06,600
something to think about they don't care by the way when i say big blogs i don't mean

2303
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:10,820
all of them there are a few really good ones out there but unfortunately you know just

2304
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:16,380
like we're in this boat a few dicks ruin it for everybody all right moving on dark sakura

2305
02:05:16,380 --> 02:05:21,060
you got some news for us here that's a little bit happier hopefully definitely happier um

2306

game accessories you don't need that we'll leave that open to interpretation and not

2411

a match and my answer was he sold the psp yesterday to buy some meat which unfortunately

2412
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:23,680
is also not a match because you had meatballs earlier so he had to buy the meat all right

2484
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:19,800
from loki hope you guys enjoyed match game yes uh thq is talking a little bit about their sales of

2485
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:24,440
the udraw tablet their peripheral that kind of resembles something that you might see with mario

2486
02:25:24,440 --> 02:25:32,200
paint um they've sold 1.2 million udraw units in the third quarter um of their fiscal year of

2487
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:38,600
course and of course they want more udraw games uh they're actually looking to kind of change up

2488
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:48,280
their business strategy a bit trying to step away from some of the kids and um i guess uh movie

2489
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:55,560
cartoon based stuff that they have coming out um thq does a lot they have like nintendo license

2490
02:25:55,560 --> 02:26:02,840
so they do a lot of spongebob and um you know crap at nicktoons and all sorts of stuff that

2491
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:08,840
comes out with that um which would be good because i don't like selling it each year

2492
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:13,240
have you ever made anything that's been really good for for everyone the you don't know jack

2493
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:19,400
the you don't know jack game for everyone right yeah it is them but but uh i mean saints row red

2494
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:25,240
faction a lot of the you know volition stuff you know through them is pretty cool ufc i mean people

2495
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:31,080
like ufc so they do have the mature stuff but like as far as casual family stuff yeah i just remember

2496
02:26:31,080 --> 02:26:36,920
like back in the day like 15 years 10 15 years ago they were putting all these crap games that

2497
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:45,080
no one no one seemed to like like like like some what was that movie like home alone like some

2498
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:53,080
sort of home alone oh god it was terrible yeah the games were not fun all right well uh those

2499
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:57,400
udraws seem to be doing pretty well i mean i see them all over now yeah they do they're doing

2500
02:26:57,400 --> 02:27:01,000
pretty well and uh be nice when there's more software out there if they did like a mario

2501
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:05,800
paint game that used to udraw that pretty awesome do you think uh it might be something nintendo

2502
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:11,080
tries to show off at the big big expo later this year i think it would be nice i don't know if

2503
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:16,920
that's actually going to be the case all right well this is pretty cool i like this uh castle

2504
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:21,160
crashers you know this game's kind of old at this point but a lot of people are still loving it and

2505
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:25,880
what better to kind of reinvigorate the game a little bit than adding a new character and what

2506
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:30,360
better to add a new character than to add a new character for charity that's right there is a

2507
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:36,360
brand new pink knight available in castle crashers there is a pink knight uh the pink knight comes

2508
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:42,040
with a lollipop and pink armor and joins the red blue yellow and green knights in the adventures

2509
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:47,560
uh you do have to buy the pink knight if you want it in castle crashers it's in the playstation

2510
02:27:47,560 --> 02:27:52,840
network version and it's gonna cost you a dollar 99 to get the character now before you get all

2511
02:27:52,840 --> 02:27:58,440
po that you're gonna have to buy this character it is going towards a good cause uh the money

2512
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:02,920
that they raise from this character will be donated to charities devoted to breast cancer

2513
02:28:02,920 --> 02:28:06,840
research and that is according to the behemoth because obviously february is breast cancer

2514
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:11,560
awareness month and you see a lot of pink ribbons that people wear so what better than a pink knight

2515

02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:17,080
i only regret that i haven't listened to more olr than i have lately and tonight i've been hard at

2527
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:23,080
work on snake 361 the sequel is snake 360 in fact i'm working on it as you read this and can't wait

2528
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:27,960
to show you guys what i've done with it but enough about that for now i also do need to congratulate

2529
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:37,000
him on his fantastic grammar i i just say i love the name snake 361 as a title and it's very clever

2530
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,800
i want to hey if you can't listen to all uh 400 episodes of olr i don't have time to play 359

2531
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:50,200
other snake games okay one of my favorite things about olr something you all say along every gamer

2532
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:55,160
has a voice anyone can post on the internet but with olr this is true in both a figurative and

2533
02:29:55,160 --> 02:30:00,600
literal sense colin's are frequent fun and memorable when is a chat room not just a chat room

2534
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:04,760
when it's a conversation with a great community of gamers and when it can steer the show at any

2535
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:09,960
moment in any way imaginable it transforms olr into more than the sum of its parts into something

2536
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:15,400
unique enough that the 400th episode feels just as fresh as the fourth episode which i wasn't here

2537
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:20,040
for that's true no i think no i was here for the fourth episode you came back for the fourth you

2538
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:25,720
were gone like the second that was the harry potter closet yes anyhow okay memories was that

2561
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:31,560
cannot pinpoint when exactly i started listening sometime in 2006 my favorite memories include a

2562
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:36,760
wonderful discussion about uno on xbox live as the words draw for bitch have graced every game

2563
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:42,120
i have played ever since keep up the amazing word i remember that i remember saying because it was

2564
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:47,320
on xbox live and it was like hardcore uno drop for bitch that's from defective candy love it

2565

rabid angry fanboys and they are attacking the studio and i need to do my part to ward them off

2571
02:33:56,200 --> 02:34:04,440
um i didn't think it was possible for fanboys to find studios that's um

2572
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:12,040
i think we need to find a new location i don't even want to remember this happened

2577
02:34:37,320 --> 02:34:43,640
it's subject 3ds i was extremely happy to hear the final fantasy 4 might be getting a re-release

2578
02:34:43,640 --> 02:34:49,480
on the 3ds it would be the main reason to get a 3ds for me it has always been a three-way tie

2579
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:55,560
for me between seven six and four for my favorite final fantasy every console i have bought was to

2580
02:34:55,560 --> 02:35:02,440
play a final fantasy playstation for seven ps2 for 10 and a ps3 for 13 i just hope that squeenix

2581
02:35:02,440 --> 02:35:08,520
will finally will fix the shitstorm known as 14 i played it and it has potential just not in its

2582
02:35:08,520 --> 02:35:14,680
current form the story is just as awesome as 11 but everything else is what it holds back

2583
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:20,920
it might have been adequate pre-wow but now it's either clone well or don't even try thanks for

2607
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:52,360

2608
02:37:56,360 --> 02:38:07,000

f you to political correctness i said it f you to people getting offended over shit

2610
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:13,800

2611
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:24,520
all right moving on loki you're a few of the week f you not being able to read japanese so

2612
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:29,720

2613
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:35,720
level again my a few of the week goes to the fact that this weekend just flew by like yesterday i

2614
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:41,800
m at work it feels like and now it's all i gotta do it all again tomorrow so whatever at least i

2615
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:47,400
like my job so you know but it's just uh i missed the weekend slaysh is actually good arcadian

2616

2617
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:58,840
itunes it makes fun every so often it wants to make my ipod forget it has anything on it and

2618
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:04,360
have to restore it just done it like three times piece of shit and then fuck you kind of nostalgia

2619
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:10,040
because i don't have time to go back and play this the games i feel like playing go ahead because i

2620
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:15,080
was looking at like my actually putting together a new road mix because i lost it with my new

2621
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:20,600
computer so putting it together and her old songs from games that i want to go back and play

2622
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:27,240
anime to watch and shit like that that i have no time for and salacious pop sort of a boring

2623
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:32,680
answer but just f you to the economy hey i think a lot of people are with you there all right

2624
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:38,760
there it is the f us of the week let's move on to just a couple more stories for you guys and then

2625
02:39:38,760 --> 02:39:42,920
the skype line which is going to be interesting tonight all right we'll we'll do the skype line

2626
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:47,080
as long as we can tonight uh we might have to put a time limit on calls tonight just so you know

2627
02:39:47,080 --> 02:39:50,600
because if the match game was any indication we got a lot of people wanted to call in tonight

2628
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:55,160
so we might have to do a little time limit all right uh loki if you uh sorry not if you news

2629
02:39:55,160 --> 02:40:00,600
story uh the movie site first showing is reporting that there's a zombies ate my neighbors film in

2630
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:07,960
development yay apparently based on the uh old 16-bit game which i forgot is actually uh developed

2631
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:15,480
by lucasarts that would be awesome if lucas starts to put that out that game was great they said uh

2632
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:19,400
there needs to be trampoline levels it's a flick being described as a horror comedy more

2633
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:27,000
specifically john hughs meets judd apatow meets george a romero honestly i think it'd be an

2634
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:31,160
excellent movie the whole thing was a parody on kind of the horror genre anyways and it was

2635
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:37,160
absolutely ridiculous with like 50-foot tall babies and zombies and werewolves and i think

2636
02:40:37,160 --> 02:40:41,560
there were aliens in there as well that's the game that i should have played but just missed

2637
02:40:41,560 --> 02:40:45,000
completely and i still have no idea why but i definitely remember the hype around it it's on

2638
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:49,080
virtual console it's awesome i don't have a way but wait did you just pimp nintendo's virtual

2639
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:55,240
console i think you did well they put out some games they just stopped now i i think they

2640
02:40:55,240 --> 02:41:00,360
just stopped now i i had to call you on it i'm sorry well fine download the rom fuck paying them

2641
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:07,240
money there you go now there's the low-key answer i was looking for i think you can make a cool

2642
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:12,040
movie i think you know if they kind of don't try to keep it as the video game i think the name has

2643
02:41:12,040 --> 02:41:16,280
enough recognition just keep the story don't you don't even bother you know i think there's enough

2644
02:41:16,280 --> 02:41:21,480
people that just would have no idea there was even a game that exists that would go see the movie and

2645
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:26,040
then you would get the game again because it would tie into the movie but of course movie tie-in

2646
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:30,360
games always suck and here's the thing though about it though is you don't even need to like

2647
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:34,760
have game times because the whole thing is just basically a spoof of like the horror genre

2648
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:42,360
it's basically it's like monster squad actually a little bit because it's all the the shit horrible

2649
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:47,080
things that can happen in like uh horror movies all happening at once there's zombies attacking

2650
02:41:47,080 --> 02:41:51,800
there's evil dolls there's werewolves there's giant babies there's i think there were giant

2651
02:41:51,800 --> 02:41:58,200
ants and stuff like uh all sorts of crazy shit going down all at once that's what you need

2652
02:42:00,520 --> 02:42:05,640
well it seems like the theme of it was all of the um all of the really awful horror movies that

2653
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:09,320
came out in the 50s that were all kind of metaphors for communism the giant ants and

2654
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:17,640
whatever yeah exactly yeah right all right i played through that whole game that had like

2655
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:20,520
i think there was like over 100 levels in the game it was ridiculous

2656
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:29,480
all right one more story for you guys and it's about the battles or at least one of them ringo

2657
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:39,400
star one of the ones that still left and still kicking uh ringo star hi i apparently has um

2658
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:45,560
registered a trademark that indicates that his name has been trademarked ringo his name has

2659
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:51,240
been trademarked for downloadable computer games via the internet and wireless devices

2660
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:58,360
toys namely toy vehicles plush toys pet toys and skateboards so i have no idea if ringo is going

2661
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:03,160
to start getting into skateboarding daddy i want the ringo vehicle i which seems a little odd to

2662
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:07,640
me like i would understand if there was like a ringo music game or something coming like a

2663
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:12,760
drumming on your ipad type of thing but uh skateboards and pet toys clearly he's trying

2664
02:43:12,760 --> 02:43:17,960
to protect the name from something that's what this strikes me as is that you know ringo could

2665
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:22,920
kind of be like uh i don't know like a new ring toss game or something i don't know roll with me

2666
02:43:22,920 --> 02:43:27,000
here it could be some new game and maybe he doesn't want to lose that you know on his name

2667
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,440
so maybe that's why he trades market but then again are you allowed to trademark something

2668
02:43:30,440 --> 02:43:34,920
if you don't have a plan to use it i guess so there's a lot of squatters and so forth

2669
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:40,520
by the way of course the attorney has been asked on why ringo star trademarked the name

2670
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:48,200
and no comment no comment the last time ringo was heard in a video game news story it was uh with

2671
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:52,440
the beatles rock band he was talking to jimmy fallon about it and said the graphics are great

2672
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:59,960
i love the game i love the music but it's for young folk his 15th studio album came out last

2673
02:43:59,960 --> 02:44:09,160

2674
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:15,560

2765
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:23,480

probably um fuck fart poop and ass speaking of finance you only get four lanes through um the

2767
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:41,000
four heroes of light he made the main hero dipshit and named the princess gonorrhea he's at the scene

2768
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:48,440
where the king tells him dipshit go find my gonorrhea right now i do that immature shit

2769
02:53:48,440 --> 02:53:53,560
all the time it's great my character like the most amazing game i can think of uh was uh white

2770
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:59,640
knight chronicles that i've been playing and uh i made i made a character named sassy and she's like

2771
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:04,200
a black chick with flowing hair and she's very fierce she's very pangaroo you know what i found

2772
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:12,200
my derby owner's club because remember he had one named um uh paula terry and i had one called

2773

horse poop and we had a kiriyamaoka but i mean we've named our horses interesting things i had

2774
02:54:18,920 --> 02:54:27,000
a horse named glue yeah i think i think oregon trail is the first game of people of this generation

2775
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:32,440
that really were able to do that with the names but in final fantasy 7 if you give eris or erith

2776
02:54:32,440 --> 02:54:38,200
in particular the most raunchiest name you could think of lols for days you will get your money's

2777
02:54:38,200 --> 02:54:45,320
worth it seems like the trend is like you get the lols of off of any of the final fantasy games like

2809
02:58:19,720 --> 02:58:24,120
what i thought you can name your party members after facebook friends and then spam their walls

2810
02:58:24,120 --> 02:58:29,720

2836
03:01:31,160 --> 03:01:38,680
it's like i know that's the hill where where we fell off the earth actually we're that far past

2837
03:01:38,680 --> 03:01:43,080
the hill i don't know i don't know what to tell you and you notice how i i was like i was gonna

2838
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:48,280
call in next and then ron mccalled and so i let somebody else go in between because i know i can't

2839
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:55,320
follow that up uh-huh uh-huh well rama always brings a certain something special to the show

2840
03:01:55,320 --> 03:02:01,160
i don't know uh what else to say but i will say i also own a melodica do you oh god yes

2841
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:06,680
well now we might have this whole week we need a duet we're gonna have this week off in june

2842
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:11,320
where we're not doing anything so maybe we need to have melodica con i i used to i used to know

2843
03:02:11,320 --> 03:02:17,720
how to play um the uh the whole opera thing from final fantasy 6 that's what i was trying to

2844
03:02:17,720 --> 03:02:24,920
remember how to play except it's in a bizarre key so i was like i don't remember well what what's

2845
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:29,320
funny with the melodica which is i had no clue that we were going to go in this direction but

2846
03:02:29,320 --> 03:02:35,000
if you go to any of the events that the game audio network guild goes to they all have melodicas

2847
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:39,320
instead of they'll have like maybe like one drum person it's like a drum circle but they all have

2848
03:02:39,320 --> 03:02:46,280
melodicas i love and they're all just doing like improv with their melodicas i i love them i got

2849
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:54,360
a 32 keys i think of soprano melodica from um marissa who has been with me when i've gone to

2850
03:02:54,360 --> 03:03:01,400
several music stores looking for melodicas so you know what's next on the list an auto harp

2851
03:03:02,760 --> 03:03:06,360
or theremin i was gonna say we need to get there i mean i thought you wanted a theremin i do want

2852
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:11,080
a theremin but i can afford another i know that bobby is one of the biggest band nerds i know

2853
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:14,680
but i don't think he called in to talk about melodicas tonight what's on your mind bobby

2854
03:03:15,320 --> 03:03:19,880
i was i just i got home from from where i went tonight and uh you know wanted to wish you guys

2855
03:03:19,880 --> 03:03:24,840
happy 400 because i didn't create any audio like i said i would because i'm a bad person

2856
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:30,840
that's i forgot to do audio for the last fng so it's all good so well they thank you so much for

2857
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:36,840
the call and of course a big thank you bobby you know um this show almost died a few years

2858
03:03:36,840 --> 03:03:43,080
ago actually and uh when live 365 kind of uh kind of made it impossible for us to keep continuing to

2859
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:46,920
do a radio station with kind of the new unrealistic rates that they were going to charge for our

2860
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:53,800
audience and uh you were obviously really the the person i mean other folks might try to take credit

2861
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:58,680
for it but you were the guy that brought us to all games radio a couple years before and helped kind

2862
03:03:58,680 --> 03:04:03,720
of facilitate uh us coming on in a more you know kind of permanent way where our live show is now

2863
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:10,200
kind of exclusively here so for that we and the rest of the olr listeners really thank you for

2864
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:14,520
helping this show reach 400 because otherwise it probably would have ended around 278 so

2865
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:18,840
you're welcome and and you guys are keeping me on because all your listeners tune in early

2866
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:23,720
to me and so i can use that as my numbers even though they're not really listening to me

2867
03:04:23,720 --> 03:04:27,240
yeah so it's awesome it works both ways well bobby i hate to say it but sadly we don't even

2868
03:04:27,240 --> 03:04:31,640
have 8 000 people tuning in so i don't know what you're gonna do or what i'm gonna i haven't gotten

2869
03:04:31,640 --> 03:04:38,840
my rejection letter yet you're waiting bobby i'm prepared bobby yes we are your fan club

2870
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:45,320
we are your fan club it's it's not an e3 without bobby either it's just in you know i i can really

2871
03:04:45,320 --> 03:04:49,320
mean that because dude's gone to like what the last what 15 in a row or something like that

2872
03:04:49,320 --> 03:04:54,760
this would be my 15th this would be your 15th yes and they are going to say no to this man possibly

2873
03:04:55,400 --> 03:05:00,680
because yeah we don't know yet we see the way like i got the optimistic reading of the emails

2874
03:05:00,680 --> 03:05:08,360
that if you have below eight thousand that's still one right it's over eight thousand to get the second

2875
03:05:08,360 --> 03:05:15,080
one but those are all blogs and stuff and i wonder because they do note make the distinction in the

2876
03:05:15,080 --> 03:05:21,960
application form of podcast oh interesting so you know it wasn't like i said i'm an online writer i

2877
03:05:21,960 --> 03:05:27,080
said i'm online i do podcasts and i said here's where i've been here's how long i've been doing

2878
03:05:27,080 --> 03:05:32,200
it here's here's me on e3 coverage.com here's me at all games here's me at bobbyblackwolf.com

2879
03:05:32,200 --> 03:05:38,760
so maybe it's a different rule set for me because no but i could get 8 000 people to listen and you

2880
03:05:38,760 --> 03:05:44,120
could get 8 000 people to listen but they're not going to orangelandradio.com exactly and and

2881
03:05:44,120 --> 03:05:48,920
hopefully most of our audience is smart enough not to have spyware toolbars installed on their

2882
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:52,920
computer exactly it is a little bit the way they're measuring it is kind of janky but you

2883
03:05:52,920 --> 03:05:56,120
know again and we said this earlier and i know you were at your party so you probably didn't hear

2884
03:05:56,120 --> 03:06:00,760
this but you know it's it's mostly a case of a few bad apples ruining the barrel you know and i see

2885
03:06:00,760 --> 03:06:06,440
why e3 feels like they need to take this step but it's just kind of like the wrong step like you

2886
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:10,520
should have gone left instead of right you know what i mean well i mean i'm already told i'm not

2887
03:06:10,520 --> 03:06:14,760
allowed at gdc anymore too so it's like e3 was really all i had left other than packs

2888
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:22,200
because gdc took this step two years ago i did there there there is neatness i'd like getting

2889
03:06:22,200 --> 03:06:26,920
to hang with the developers and get to see some of this stuff you know when i've played warhammer

2890
03:06:26,920 --> 03:06:30,680
online for the first time i was getting to talk to developers and stuff it was kind of cool but

2891
03:06:30,680 --> 03:06:38,520
you know so but you know if if somebody's really serious about getting into e3 in terms of if they

2892
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:42,840
get rejected by the press pass there's still a way in it's just going to cost you a little bit

2893
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:47,640
of money that's right four hundred dollars yeah but you can get in and if you already have contacts

2894
03:06:47,640 --> 03:06:53,320
when you with the industry you can still get you know you can still get appointments and all that

2895
03:06:53,320 --> 03:06:57,800
stuff i mean like you guys didn't even have appointments so you could with an exhibits only

2896
03:06:57,800 --> 03:07:02,360
badge you really could have done the exact same thing you did last year you didn't need a press

2897
03:07:02,360 --> 03:07:07,640
badge well now we have bobby i'll tell you this i'll tell you this even with my exhibits only i

2898
03:07:07,640 --> 03:07:13,560
got into press events yeah yeah as long as you they know you it doesn't matter what your badge

2899
03:07:13,560 --> 03:07:19,880
says all i had to do was flash them a card that says i do this podcast and they're like we want

2900
03:07:19,880 --> 03:07:26,280
you exactly it was so i think it'll be fine if you really really want to go and yes i really

2901
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:32,440
really want to go um you know thankfully i got a refund from my taxes so if i do get the dear

2902
03:07:32,440 --> 03:07:35,880
john letter it's not going to be the end of the world well keep me posted because i sure as hell

2903
03:07:35,880 --> 03:07:41,080
ain't going if bobby ain't going because now i i would not have my usual travel buddy to go with

2904
03:07:41,080 --> 03:07:44,280
so i don't know what's gonna well i'm planning on going because i'm just gonna write them and say

2906
03:07:51,480 --> 03:07:56,680
able to do with that so yeah so i mean i didn't get mine the other year and i think it's because

2974
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:47,960
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this legend of zaku what's on your mind my friend

2975
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:56,600
first of all happy 400th to you guys happy 400th to us thank you happy 400th to you too zaku

2976
03:14:56,600 --> 03:15:04,760
you've been here for a lot of it so thank you yeah at least a good 80 you know like 75 of it

2977
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:09,880
but yeah good enough all right let me see i'm trying to think because i've been out of like

2978
03:15:09,880 --> 03:15:14,200
the whole you know i've been out of like the recent gaming news aside for that new psp announced

2979
03:15:14,840 --> 03:15:19,960
but i mean from what i heard a lot of the devs are just like you know they're they're

2980
03:15:19,960 --> 03:15:25,080
creaming in their pants over how it's like you know genera like a generation ahead of the current

2981
03:15:25,080 --> 03:15:31,720
smartphones out there which got which just which you know the way i see it they're just

2982
03:15:31,720 --> 03:15:37,640
taking a lot of lip service so i mean that's the whole point is it because right now there has to

2983
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:42,840
have to be nimble against not only apple but whoever else is releasing any new android tabs

2984
03:15:42,840 --> 03:15:49,480
that could just rival what but sony's gonna end up releasing i mean we'll give them the benefit

2985
03:15:49,480 --> 03:15:56,360
of that we really don't know how the the new ngps will perform when it releases but i can tell you

2986
03:15:56,360 --> 03:16:03,720
this i mean you know dual core phones are on are going to be here in a little bit so you're going

2987
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:08,440
to have all these game developers aside from the ones that are not targeting the psp the ones that

2988
03:16:08,440 --> 03:16:14,280
have targeted the iphone and high-end android phones they're there they're capitalizing it

2989
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:20,280
so that way you know they have you know they have like a known new release in particular games that

2990
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:25,160
not only target ngp but are capable of running on these other newer smartphones you know what

2991
03:16:25,160 --> 03:16:29,720
there's ipad 2 is going to be out any day now they're they're probably going to announce that

2992
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:33,080
so although i think that was supposed to come out in january and then of course now that iphone is

2993
03:16:33,080 --> 03:16:39,960
on verizon that's just going to further apple's grip on you know what's going on in the ios world

2994
03:16:39,960 --> 03:16:46,600
with iphone 5 i'm sure a kind of like a hybrid thing for at&t and verizon on its way in the

2995
03:16:46,600 --> 03:16:54,280
summer so i mean it's just crazy times sorry that um verizon only got like the really got the you

2996
03:16:54,280 --> 03:16:59,960
know the hand-me-downs per se it's like at&t still has an ex it has like a ton of exclusive now

2997
03:17:00,680 --> 03:17:05,400
whatever new phone whenever your iphone comes out it'll have you know verizon will get it

2998
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:12,920
months afterwards well too early to tell but so far that's the indication that i've been

2999
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:18,520
i've seen so far that you know at&t will still have it it doesn't have it's like you know full

3000
03:17:18,520 --> 03:17:23,320
exclusivity like it's the only carrier where you can buy it but it'll probably have what you know

3001
03:17:23,320 --> 03:17:29,720
they have like a compromise like a timed exclusive but you do realize that you know as i said google

3002
03:17:29,720 --> 03:17:36,280
is already is already you know already has like android 3.0 out which is like their tablet version

3003
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:42,360
which is supposed to like herald in the the era of like three you know 300 tablets that

3004
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:47,560
that pretty much rival the ipad right or match up to so wait let me let me ask you this then

3005
03:17:47,560 --> 03:17:51,960
obviously there's all this competing technology coming out we know that what is the ngp what is

3006
03:17:51,960 --> 03:17:58,360
it that they have to do to stand out from the crowd they just have to bring something that

3007
03:17:58,360 --> 03:18:05,320
that you can't really get on an iphone or high-end android phone basically something that not only

3008
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:11,400
surpasses ps2 but just like barely touches ps3 graphics something that melts faces with awesomeness

3009
03:18:12,760 --> 03:18:18,120
exactly well you need something that has like you know it's kind of a hybrid in between the ps2

3010
03:18:18,120 --> 03:18:25,640
and you know the 360. if you get that on a small package like a like an ngp then you pretty much

3011
03:18:25,640 --> 03:18:30,600
you're pretty much like a step ahead of the competition last question zaku do you think

3012
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:31,880
do you think they'll succeed

3013
03:18:34,440 --> 03:18:40,760
sony i mean on the way i see it is that remember they didn't they never had this much heat i mean

3014
03:18:40,760 --> 03:18:48,360
from from anyone outside of nintendo because now that apple's like creeping up you know apple and

3015
03:18:48,360 --> 03:18:53,320
and the other manufacturers are creeping up they have to like you know they have to make sure they

3016
03:18:53,320 --> 03:18:59,480
have to hit another home run all right the psp so really well but you know more there are more

3017
03:18:59,480 --> 03:19:03,720
iphones out there than psps and that's a fact you know there are more android phones out there

3018
03:19:04,280 --> 03:19:09,640
there's a lot more like high-end smartphones than people have psp all right one of them well we will

3019
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:15,640
see buddy i gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your call all right take care

3043
03:21:24,600 --> 03:21:30,760
final thoughts tonight for our listeners i'm eagerly anticipating our trip to the noodle house

3044
03:21:30,760 --> 03:21:37,240
after this are you hungry yeah all right that's all right uh arcadian thank you for being here

3045
03:21:37,240 --> 03:21:41,400
appreciate your support as always you've kind of been there since day one as well all way back in

3046
03:21:41,400 --> 03:21:47,240
the arvigal days so you've watched us grow up right in front of your eyes oh yeah any final

3047
03:21:47,240 --> 03:21:52,120
thoughts for our listeners tonight i'll go over what my game of 2010 was and that was near has

3048
03:21:52,120 --> 03:21:58,040
very good story very good characters and very good music and even though the game has a little

3049
03:21:58,040 --> 03:22:02,920
flaws to it that they could iron it out but generally they're not bad been big enough to

3050
03:22:02,920 --> 03:22:08,280
make it what the game experience that it was and i think it used but i think it would interest you

3051
03:22:08,280 --> 03:22:12,600
i've considered picking it up but i've read not so nice things about it don't listen to them okay

3052
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:17,320
well because you're right they fuck it up a lot yeah because there's a controversy or something

3053
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:21,320
but that's just something you wouldn't even figure out unless you read something really

3054
03:22:21,320 --> 03:22:26,600
deep into it a lot of people hated lost odyssey too and i thought it was fabulous so yeah and and

3055
03:22:26,600 --> 03:22:32,040
one thing about it that the the female character swears almost every scene she's in that and i

3056
03:22:32,040 --> 03:22:35,720
think it's something that appealed more to older players than younger players younger players

3057
03:22:35,720 --> 03:22:41,880
probably wouldn't like the story as much or some of the characterizations probably wouldn't really

3058
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:46,600
ring true to them or wouldn't really kind of mix with their experience but like older people will

3059
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:51,800
probably think would like a lot more all right so noted um that's a hell of a final thought but i'll

3060
03:22:51,800 --> 03:22:59,160
have to check that game out uh my final thought is um gosh uh um a i could use some pink berry

3061
03:22:59,160 --> 03:23:06,040
but sadly they're closed and um b thank you guys for listening for the past 400 episodes or
