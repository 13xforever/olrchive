00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:23,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, February 6, 2011, Nintendo disagrees with low app pricing, Halo gets remade this holiday, and has Zelda Skyward Sword been further delayed?

2
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:39,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:40,568
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Rob Roberts.

4
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,069
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours.

5
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,170
[SPEAKER_18]: With me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings and salutations.

7
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,510
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Ms.

8
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:48,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Summers?

9
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,911
[SPEAKER_10]: My voice is coming and going.

10
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

11
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I will at points sound like a 12-year-old boy.

12
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:54,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,713
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm doing good.

14
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:57,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy, excited.

15
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:59,955
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of people I know have been getting sick lately.

16
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:00,696
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not just you.

17
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:01,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's going around.

18
00:01:01,656 --> 00:01:02,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's going around.

19
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:04,458
[SPEAKER_18]: But it has stolen my voice.

20
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,981
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, I noticed you're wearing like a nerdy Star Trek shirt, but it's a red shirt.

21
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:08,981
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a bad sign.

22
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,722
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's engineering.

23
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:10,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

24
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,424
[SPEAKER_10]: The engineers are smart enough to stay inside.

25
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:15,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the security guys that keep getting blown up.

26
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:15,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

27
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:21,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Plus, I don't know what it is about that shirt, but it is showing off your very adequate bazoom.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,630
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

29
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:22,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

30
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:24,177
[SPEAKER_18]: So congratulations.

31
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:24,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

32
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:24,817
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

33
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:27,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

35
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,462
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you, Loki?

36
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:31,063
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm fine.

37
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,284
[SPEAKER_18]: He's a man of many words.

38
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:34,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything interesting going on for you this week?

39
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:37,188
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

40
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:37,809
[SPEAKER_18]: No?

41
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:41,448
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, it's going to be one of those shows.

42
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:44,428
[SPEAKER_18]: We have some guests in studio, so let me introduce them.

43
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:51,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we always have the ever-present fourth guest with us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can join us in our chat room.

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,311
[SPEAKER_18]: There are people live.

45
00:01:52,771 --> 00:02:00,053
[SPEAKER_18]: I do know there's some type of ball game going on right now that people seem to care about, so I know things are a little...

46
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:01,414
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots of WoW games, I don't know.

48
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,024
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:02,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're no fun.

50
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,004
[SPEAKER_03]: The volume's turned down.

51
00:03:04,624 --> 00:03:06,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can, I think it's implied.

52
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:11,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and then they fall down with their love for you because you shot them with your love gun.

53
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:13,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, great.

54
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki's turned it up.

55
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,370
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it gets picked up on the mic or whatever, but.

56
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:19,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, does it come through on our little soundboard now?

57
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,894
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:47,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so what's new with you?

59
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, not too much.

60
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:49,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

61
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:52,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I'm into crazy work time, so I don't have much time to play games these days.

62
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:53,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Crazy work time?

63
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,574
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you do for a living without, you know, you don't have to tell us where you work, but what kind of work?

64
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:01,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I work at two places, and the first place I work five hours a day, every day, all year.

65
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:05,539
[SPEAKER_15]: The other place, I work eight hours a day, like six to eight, like nine months of the year.

66
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:06,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

67
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:07,439
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

68
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:07,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Busy, busy.

69
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,180
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

71
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,120
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:18,121
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're going to get around to How Is Your Gaming Week, but I should acknowledge that tonight is a little bit special because it is episode 400 of Orange Lounge Radio.

73
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:21,682
[SPEAKER_18]: 400 freaking shows.

74
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:29,364
[SPEAKER_18]: This show started on June 23, 2002, and here we are over 400 weeks because we're lazy.

75
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:30,284
[SPEAKER_18]: We take a lot of weeks off.

76
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:35,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Over 400 weeks later, but 400 shows later, here we are at our show.

77
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:36,226
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exhausting.

78
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:38,208
[SPEAKER_18]: So what are we doing special tonight?

79
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,112
[SPEAKER_18]: The same shit we've done for a long time.

80
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:42,734
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we had something special.

81
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:43,154
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

82
00:04:43,174 --> 00:04:45,417
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have one new special thing, but the live listeners don't get to see it.

83
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,979
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something special for the podcasties.

84
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:48,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Meatballs?

85
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:49,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

86
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,735
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the listeners don't get meatballs.

87
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:53,895
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but we're special.

88
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:54,556
[SPEAKER_10]: We get meatballs.

89
00:04:55,196 --> 00:05:07,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think originally this was going to be a drunk show, but Loki's got the kid, Rob drives, Jamie's not going to pay to get us all blitzed, and if we took a shot every time Nintendo made a bad business decision, we would just die.

90
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:08,499
[SPEAKER_03]: We would be dead.

91
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:09,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

92
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:12,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, a lot has happened in nine years of the show.

93
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,781
[SPEAKER_18]: I have my gallbladder out for one, so I have no alcohol tolerance anymore.

94
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember when I almost died, y'all?

95
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,344
[SPEAKER_18]: That was hilarious.

96
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,848
[SPEAKER_18]: You were so skinny, though.

97
00:05:20,868 --> 00:05:21,489
[SPEAKER_18]: You look so good.

98
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:22,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,572
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I want to get peccary eyes again.

100
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,956
[SPEAKER_08]: So which character should we attempt to rape first?

101
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:28,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the one with the bunny ears.

102
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:28,740
[SPEAKER_08]: The bunny ears.

103
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

104
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:29,862
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

105
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:32,421
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your name?

106
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,222
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea.

107
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:33,842
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

108
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:34,722
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you mean that I do now?

109
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Xtasy shot because you shot her in the crotch.

110
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

111
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I love radio about video games.

112
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:59,086
[SPEAKER_18]: but uh we used to kind of start off with how was your week how was your day we didn't just talk about all video games now we do so next thing i'm going to say is i'm going to say the cage match pick goes into rotation all week long here at orange launch radio.com it goes into rotation in our hearts exactly all right uh dark soccer how is your gaming week i hit level 85 like yesterday addict dealer

113
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:03,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations, though.

114
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

115
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:10,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'm kind of bored, and I'm working on building reps, so I built my Darnassus rep, like, in one night.

116
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I have a kitty cat.

117
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:13,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Cat.

118
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:14,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a kitty cat.

119
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:15,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And a meow, meow, meow, and a meow, meow, meow.

120
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:17,727
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

121
00:07:20,794 --> 00:07:26,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan got his driving wheel set up for Gran Turismo 5.

122
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,206
[SPEAKER_10]: He got this sort of stand so that he can put it away when he's done playing.

123
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:37,553
[SPEAKER_10]: And he got the seats out of the Honda Prelude, which he is building his driving seat out of.

124
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,582
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's what Dan's gaming week has been.

125
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:42,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, so he actually took seats out of a real car?

126
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:43,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in the living room.

127
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:47,104
[SPEAKER_18]: To build a Gran Theft, I almost said Gran Theft, Gran Turismo 5?

128
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:48,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll take a picture of it.

129
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, yeah, you should and put it on the little feed.

130
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:52,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll do that right now.

131
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,346
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, you should.

132
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, that's dedication.

133
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:56,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Why is he doing this?

134
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:57,447
[SPEAKER_18]: That's insanity.

135
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:58,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because he can?

136
00:07:58,247 --> 00:07:58,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

137
00:07:58,707 --> 00:07:59,227
[SPEAKER_10]: You let him.

138
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:00,328
[SPEAKER_18]: He's your husband.

139
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:01,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't let him do shit.

140
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: He just does it.

141
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again, the same goes vice versa.

142
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Does he let you sit in the seat or is he like, no, this is the captain's chair?

143
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care to sit in the seat.

144
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a seat on a milk crate right now.

145
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:14,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ghetto.

146
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm taking a picture and showing you all how weird my husband is.

147
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:24,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you can see those pictures at www.orangeloungeradio.com Alright, Loki, you gotta pause that game and tell us about your gaming week.

148
00:08:24,658 --> 00:08:25,318
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your gaming week?

149
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,879
[SPEAKER_18]: My game is weird.

150
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,840
[SPEAKER_08]: This week I didn't play a whole lot.

151
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I played just Grand Theft Auto, of course.

152
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:34,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

153
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:39,151
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of some iOS games I played.

154
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:43,534
[SPEAKER_08]: League of Evil, which I didn't really care for that one.

155
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:47,397
[SPEAKER_08]: They're comparing it kind of to Super Meat Boy, and I'm sorry, it's not Super Meat Boy.

156
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:48,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even close.

157
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:55,842
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of almost reminds me of Mega Man, but really hard and basic.

158
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,744
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's an iPhone game, so what do you expect?

159
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,465
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's the basic bitch of video games.

160
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just kind of lame.

161
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:11,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was this other pirate game that was kind of cool with anime people that I played that was kind of fun.

162
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:16,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And what else did I try?

163
00:09:16,937 --> 00:09:19,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I played more Swords & Poker 2 because that game is just awesome.

164
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wish it was still in the App Store.

165
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:24,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Puzzle Quest, Poker

166
00:09:45,675 --> 00:10:03,296
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's really unique fun game if you have a you know gel broken iPod or iPhone or something like that I recommend downloading them even though it is piracy but they're not in the store so I mean I'd say go buy them if you could but you can't so pirate them

167
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:06,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Superbowl is so gay

168
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,954
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit, a little bit.

169
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:42,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, Spazinator says, if Loki ever goes a week without playing Grand Theft Auto 4, the universe will implode.

170
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you play Grand Theft Auto 4 this week?

171
00:10:45,236 --> 00:10:49,180
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

172
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:16,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I was about to say, have you heard those rumors that the next Grand Theft Auto is set to debut at the big expo in LA in June?

173
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be for at least another year.

174
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,853
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not Grand Theft Auto coming out this year.

175
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,254
[SPEAKER_18]: You think they might do just a little tease?

176
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:24,755
[SPEAKER_18]: What does Rockstar have going on right now?

177
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they've got a bunch of stuff coming out.

178
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:27,577
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got L.A.

179
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Noire, which is coming out in spring.

180
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:31,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Spring, summer, second quarter, if you will.

181
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:38,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they've got Max Payne 3 coming out at some point, probably going to be in the fall.

182
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,390
[SPEAKER_08]: They had something else too that was from Take-Two that was supposed to be coming out.

183
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

184
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:50,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Max Payne 2 is probably... I think they're going to be putting out L.A.

185
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:53,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Noire because that's going to be kind of like their Red Dead Redemption for the year.

186
00:11:54,328 --> 00:11:56,989
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Max Payne will probably come out in the fourth quarter.

187
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto, I would see maybe a...

188
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:08,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally, probably next April would be when I could see that.

189
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,159
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if that's actually going to happen.

190
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,119
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the engine already.

191
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:17,484
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll just build it off of the Red Dead Redemption since it's just an update to the Rage engine anyways.

192
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:21,462
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:45,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really fast-paced, and I still kick the crap out of everybody.

194
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:46,818
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really buggy.

195
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:52,964
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny, actually, in Saints Row 2, little-known fact, you can throw the sticky bombs on people and detonate them.

196
00:12:53,124 --> 00:12:59,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, say if I throw three of them on somebody and detonate one and kill them, when they respawn, they still have two stuck to them, and you can detonate it again and they die.

197
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

198
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a glitchy game, but it's awesome.

199
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:03,753
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

200
00:13:04,934 --> 00:13:06,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Any interest in Chinatown Wars Part 2?

201
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,239
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate Chinatown Wars.

202
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a feeling.

203
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:14,265
[SPEAKER_08]: The old top-down games were great, but I'm sorry.

204
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:20,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Chinatown Wars, the reason it existed was because that's all the DS could handle.

205
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:20,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

206
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:25,094
[SPEAKER_08]: The PSP games are a perfect example of what they could have done.

207
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:26,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

208
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:31,419
[SPEAKER_08]: The PSP games were... I mean, they controlled kind of eh because there was only one analog stick, but it was still funny.

209
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:38,144
[SPEAKER_08]: We played that up until Grand Theft Auto... Well, actually, up until Saints Row 2 or Saints Row 1.

210
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:41,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We played the PSP versions of Grand Theft Auto to death.

211
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things were really fucking glitchy.

212
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:44,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

213
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:51,471
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I mean, seriously, if there's a new PSP... God, if there's an NGP version of Grand Theft Auto, I'm going to have to pick that out.

214
00:13:51,631 --> 00:14:01,614
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to all get NGPs to bust that out, but... I'll be buying every game day one, as long as it's not some crap like Chinatown Wars.

215
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,778
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's check in with our guests and see what they've been playing this week.

216
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:06,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?

217
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

218
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:14,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Knights of the Crystal, which doesn't really count as a game, and World of Warcraft.

219
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of World of Warcraft.

220
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,203
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going on in World of Warcraft for you?

221
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:20,264
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to get too far into the discussion, but...

222
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:35,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was in a, I guess a more social casual centric guild and I decided to try and explore a group of people that were more focused on the really hardcore raiding stuff to see if I can, you know, handle that.

223
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took me on a raid as a trial.

224
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:45,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to see some of the new raid content, did a 25 man, they carried me, I'm pretty much a scrub right now.

225
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:46,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But

226
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,160
[SPEAKER_18]: It was neat to see.

227
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,584
[SPEAKER_18]: So you turned your back on your friends to go see more pretty internet dragons.

228
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a traitorous maverick.

229
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just giving you shit, obviously, because it's the same guild I'm in.

230
00:14:56,972 --> 00:15:00,634
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know there's a lot of people that are excited for you, and you can come back and tell us stories.

231
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:02,855
[SPEAKER_18]: You can come on Horde House and talk all about it.

232
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's more a Horde House conversation.

233
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:05,816
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

234
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:11,119
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, it's still, obviously, WoW's a huge game, so got to talk about what's going on there.

235
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So how's Championship Edition going for you?

236
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, breaking records?

237
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I still only play, like, the one mode.

238
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I've unlocked all the other modes.

239
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:49,573
[SPEAKER_18]: and I'm like I just want the five minute that's me too I'm the exact same way I go through and I unlock everything and then it's like okay I just want to play this one map over and over because it's it's the one that drives the leaderboards it's on the main Xbox 360 I don't know if this is weird or not but you know how like in the Xbox 360 dashboard you get to see leaderboards but they're only for a certain mode in the game it's usually like the default leaderboard is what you see in that's the one I will try the hardest on and in this case it's usually like stage one or the default board and settings for Pac-Man Championship Edition

240
00:15:50,129 --> 00:16:04,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with the default game style, you can still, you know, on the options before you start up the match, there are eight or nine different visually art, like, you can have the neon or like all green or the 3D model, whatever.

241
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:05,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I just leave it on the default.

242
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So visually all the stuff they put into the game, I haven't looked at yet.

243
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,121
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

244
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's no reason to.

245
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,002
[SPEAKER_18]: So you just want to hear the pretty music.

246
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:13,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

247
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:19,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well let's move on to Arcadia N42 How was your gaming week?

248
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:41,552
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing I really had to play this week was Rock Band 3 Because I got the symbols pack so I could play pro mode So I was doing that And also I got a mic stand so I could sing when I want to sing But I don't do that that often I was going to say, you're kind of a quiet guy And now here I am hearing about that you have to get the symbols and the microphones That you can rock out and sing all in the privacy of your own home

249
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:56,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really sing that much just because my voice is kind of screwy and also because there's people on the other side of the wall so I don't want to bother them because my voice is probably sort of deep so it probably goes through the walls so I don't want to bug them.

250
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:57,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.

251
00:16:58,506 --> 00:17:02,569
[SPEAKER_18]: So what was the first song you had to play when you got the cymbals?

252
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there's always that one song people got to play in rock band.

253
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:06,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

254
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:11,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's one of the easier songs just so I could get used to the cymbals.

255
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Just go through the training a little bit.

256
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:21,690
[SPEAKER_15]: The training is not that much different from the standard trainer for drums.

257
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,813
[SPEAKER_15]: It just has pretty much the same training but with the cymbals added.

258
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy Birthday to Giovedea!

259
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:59,044
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, I saw her angst on Twitter about the whole, some game where people wear these uniforms and they all have numbers on them.

260
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:05,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, to quote a conversation that was going on on one of the lesbians' Facebook.

261
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:06,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, I miss the OLR lesbians.

262
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,931
[SPEAKER_18]: How are they these days?

263
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:09,364
[SPEAKER_10]: seem to do well.

264
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:14,985
[SPEAKER_18]: For those that lost track, the OLR lesbians, they were on the show, what, about probably about four years ago at this point.

265
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,526
[SPEAKER_18]: They moved together to Wisconsin.

266
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,226
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them already lived in Wisconsin.

267
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:19,646
[SPEAKER_18]: I see.

268
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:22,107
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, because they were flying back and forth a little bit.

269
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,888
[SPEAKER_18]: So they now they now habitate in Wisconsin with their Birkenstocks.

270
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:33,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently at this game, they use a racket to hit an orange ball into the net and then they smoke the Rose Bowl.

271
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:36,090
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

272
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I talk about my gaming week?

273
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:41,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I was sleeping on a Friday That's alright

274
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:04,592
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

275
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on.

276
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,154
[SPEAKER_18]: My gaming week.

277
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I made an effort to play some indie games this week.

278
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So I played a few indie games on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

279
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:18,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I basically handed the controller to Alan and I was like, pick games that look fun.

280
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:20,359
[SPEAKER_18]: So he picked a few games for me.

281
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:24,741
[SPEAKER_18]: And probably my favorite out of the bunch that I played was Radiant Games Ballistic.

282
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,502
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an indie game on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

283
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:29,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

284
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:58,569
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, for people that are thinking, you know, their life is lacking geometry wars, especially with the sad news about, you know, bizarre creations shutting their doors, it's a nice little, you know, way to hold you over.

285
00:19:58,589 --> 00:19:59,910
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not that expensive.

286
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,091
[SPEAKER_18]: And the demo is very generous.

287
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,113
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's no reason you can't check out the demo, which is out there.

288
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:05,954
[SPEAKER_18]: So I liked Ballistic.

289
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:06,434
[SPEAKER_18]: That was cool.

290
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,395
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the games I didn't like so much.

291
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,059
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to butcher the name of this game, but it was something like Maid Chan's Cave Adventure.

292
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that the name of it, Salacious Pop?

293
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you remember what the name of the game was?

294
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Maid... It was Maid San.

295
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:19,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Maid Sans.

296
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:23,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, like, crazy cave adventure, wild cave adventure, but yeah.

297
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:23,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was dumb.

298
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:27,207
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it was funny for a minute, but it's a really weird mechanic.

299
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it's kind of like... Okay, I guess it's like side-scrollery, puzzle-y.

300
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:33,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you play a maid who explores caves.

301
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,130
[SPEAKER_18]: That really is what you do.

302
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

303
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,291
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, you think, oh, this is really funny.

304
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:40,634
[SPEAKER_18]: But you go to collect stars and things, but you have to...

305
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:47,076
[SPEAKER_18]: The main mechanic of the game is that you duck to avoid the little zombie dudes that have baseball bats.

306
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:51,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, by the way, the first time the maid got hit with a baseball bat, I laughed out loud.

307
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:53,618
[SPEAKER_18]: It's worth downloading the demo just to see that.

308
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:59,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I advocate violence against maids, but it was kind of funny the first time.

309
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because the ogre sees you and says something in Japanese and marches towards you.

310
00:21:03,822 --> 00:21:05,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here comes the club thud.

311
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:06,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the way they do it is...

312
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:14,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Now you can hide by crouching, but the longer you crouch, your field of vision gets narrower and narrower and narrower.

313
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,177
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have to kind of crouch while you wait for the guys to pass you, which is a really weird mechanic.

314
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,703
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, it was okay, but I don't think I would have paid money for it.

315
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,684
[SPEAKER_18]: But the demo was fun.

316
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:31,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Pro tip, if you're going to check out the demo for this game, go into the options, change it to English.

317
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless you read and understand Japanese thoroughly, then good on you.

318
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:37,775
[SPEAKER_18]: But the first time I played through, I was like, oh, this game's only in Japanese.

319
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

320
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:39,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't understand it at all.

321
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm just like, I see a Y, like the Y button, so I'll hit that and see what it does.

322
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:47,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, the game just told me that Y does a high jump.

323
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,225
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.

324
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:48,885
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Beach, Bubble, Boob, Bobble.

326
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:08,077
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

327
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:17,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Beachy, booby, anime chick games, which of course Alan downloaded because he saw the anime chicks in bikinis and he was like, oh, it kind of looks like Bubble Bobble.

328
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,772
[SPEAKER_18]: No, here's the game.

329
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,996
[SPEAKER_18]: You fly around and you collect colored balls.

330
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:23,256
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

331
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm going to.

332
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:50,608
[SPEAKER_03]: You can infer the rest.

333
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:15,180
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go to the... Why do you need to go to the NationalGeographic.com?

334
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,901
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a joke.

335
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:18,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that's where we all saw titties.

336
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I don't know.

337
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:24,789
[SPEAKER_18]: That's where I saw titties for the first time was in the National Geographic magazine.

338
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,991
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about you guys, but... Were you not breastfed?

339
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:30,634
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're gay now, so that's a cautionary tale rather than advice.

340
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,996
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you trying to say?

341
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,318
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing wrong with it.

342
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I am who I am.

343
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:37,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I am proud of who I am.

344
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:50,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we've butchered the name of the game, if you go to the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace and look up new, even without even knowing the name of the game, just scan through the tiles and you will immediately know what game we're talking about just by the image.

345
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:53,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobie Beach Bubble Bobble Boobies.

346
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,962
[SPEAKER_18]: For the record, I love boobs.

347
00:23:56,662 --> 00:23:58,603
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to be straight or whatever.

348
00:23:58,843 --> 00:23:59,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Boobs are awesome.

349
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:00,783
[SPEAKER_18]: We can all agree on that.

350
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:01,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, Jamie?

351
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very fond of mine.

352
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,024
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

353
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody can agree.

354
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:04,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And others.

355
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:07,972
[SPEAKER_18]: One, two, three, four, five.

356
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:09,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Five OLR people agree.

357
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Boobies are great.

358
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:11,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, Alan?

359
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:12,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Boobies are great?

360
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:12,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

361
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

362
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did see the Make a Baby game on there, but I didn't download it for you.

363
00:24:19,336 --> 00:24:20,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I already had the Make a Baby game.

364
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:20,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

365
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:22,558
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a sequel, by the way.

366
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:23,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they?

367
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.

368
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:24,158
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the sequel?

369
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:24,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's the one I saw.

370
00:24:25,018 --> 00:24:26,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't heard of the sequel.

371
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:35,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Evil Babies Rosemary's Baby Super Meat Boy I didn't realize not all of the levels are Super Meat Boy Some of them are some of the other characters You have to play the other characters Good times

372
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:55,834
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.

373
00:24:56,114 --> 00:25:00,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that on PC, Super Meat Boy, but I haven't unlocked the headcrab yet.

374
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:05,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a huge Half-Life fan, so the fact that I could play as a headcrab, I need to get on that and unlock that.

375
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was the Valve Steam edition.

376
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:10,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

377
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:12,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyhow.

378
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:15,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on with some housekeeping tonight.

379
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:16,944
[SPEAKER_18]: There's actually a little bit of housekeeping tonight.

380
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:18,952
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:44,903
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

382
00:26:09,394 --> 00:26:09,894
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

383
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:31,850
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

384
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

385
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:32,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah.

386
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:34,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I miss her, by the way.

387
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good job, Miss Tia.

388
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,917
[SPEAKER_18]: I know none of our listeners probably know her anymore because she was on the show forever ago.

389
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:43,841
[SPEAKER_18]: She was on the very last live OLR, if I remember right.

390
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:44,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

391
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,564
[SPEAKER_18]: Or it was the first OLR when we married the two shows.

392
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:50,566
[SPEAKER_18]: When OLR was a live show and then separately a podcast.

393
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I think she was on the very last live only OLR.

394
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:53,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

395
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:54,230
[SPEAKER_18]: So, miss her.

396
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow.

397
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:57,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Reminiscing about things in the past.

398
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:58,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Other things that are going on.

399
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:03,438
[SPEAKER_18]: So not only do we have new artwork to represent the show, which will hopefully spread everywhere because we're replacing our old stuff.

400
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:14,067
[SPEAKER_18]: The other thing is that I want to give a plug for Dead Pixel Live, which runs on All Games Radio Monday through Thursday at 7 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Pacific.

401
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,289
[SPEAKER_18]: I was on the show earlier this week.

402
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:17,230
[SPEAKER_18]: So check that out.

403
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,631
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Thursday's episode.

404
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:22,434
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to go back in this podcasty feed and look at deadpixellive.com,

405
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:40,918
[SPEAKER_18]: you can check that out and you were on for a while too oh god yeah I was like on for like an hour he was nice enough Derek over at Dead Beasts Alive has been doing his show a really long time as well and he's daily so he passed 400 episodes a long time ago because he's doing like four of them a week I think for a while he might have been doing five

406
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:44,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So he passed 400 a long time ago.

407
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:48,924
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had a lot to talk about as much as how do you stay motivated to do a show.

408
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:52,007
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was cool because we just kind of BS back and forth for a little while.

409
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:52,907
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he had me on for the news.

410
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:54,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And we talked a little bit about NGP and some of the other stuff.

411
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:55,930
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was fun.

412
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,570
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a good time.

413
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,911
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to give a plug for that.

414
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,493
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you want to hear another great show.

415
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:17,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's really it as far as housekeeping goes add us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or you can always add us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR lots of tweets this week because we've been asking people about the show and I'll read some of those tweets a little later on in the show

416
00:28:18,277 --> 00:28:23,799
[SPEAKER_18]: But for now, let's start off episode 400 as we always do with a little bit of gaming news.

417
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,160
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki, what's going on in the world of gaming?

418
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Same old stuff, I guess.

419
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:35,023
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when people run out of ideas for consoles, what's the first thing that happens?

420
00:28:35,243 --> 00:28:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's not even really consoles or games or anything related to that, but even in the movie industry.

421
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:42,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Remakes!

422
00:28:43,746 --> 00:28:46,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if it was good the first time, it'll be good the second time, right?

423
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:47,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, maybe?

424
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:54,688
[SPEAKER_08]: So Microsoft is rumored to be coming out... Well, actually, it's not so much a rumor anymore.

425
00:28:55,708 --> 00:29:00,350
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be remaking the original Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved.

426
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:02,491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out this holiday for the Xbox 360.

427
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:07,654
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be getting a kind of a graphical facelift.

428
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:14,097
[SPEAKER_08]: They're expecting a 1080p resolution and also possibly 3D support.

429
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:22,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the thought is they're going to be remaking it using the Reach engines, so it'll look all fancy and stuff.

430
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:32,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently it's being developed by Saber Interactive, the company that was behind Timeshift and Namco's upcoming game Inversion.

431
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:36,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So, neat.

432
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:48,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said the game is expected to come out on November 15th, which is basically 10 years after the original Halo game alongside the original Xbox.

433
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:53,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting, though, to go along with that, though, and maybe possibly one of the features of the game.

434
00:29:54,408 --> 00:29:58,349
[SPEAKER_08]: ConnectHalo.com was registered by Microsoft.

435
00:29:59,169 --> 00:29:59,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

436
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:00,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

437
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:04,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, this is a URL that was registered in Microsoft back in June of 2010.

438
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:14,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be not necessarily that it's going to be a Kinect Halo game, but maybe they were just registering before people cybersquatted on it.

439
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:16,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good point.

440
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:16,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

441
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:22,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that the Kinect will recognize is when you dip your knees down so that you can teabag.

442
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:22,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

443
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:25,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

444
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

445
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:38,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, though, I think it wouldn't be so bad if they had Kinect support, but not necessarily in the fact that you have to stand up and play the whole game that way, but head tracking would be awesome.

446
00:30:39,266 --> 00:30:39,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

447
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:45,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I see they said, oh, yeah, we can do Kinect and controller games.

448
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:47,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they do head tracking?

449
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:49,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I think head tracking would be the easiest thing to support.

450
00:30:49,976 --> 00:31:01,446
[SPEAKER_08]: and like most of these games you know you just have it where it tracks your head a little bit and so it kind of gives you a little bit more of immersion you don't necessarily need to do it and you know and it would be pretty awesome for any first person shooter

451
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:10,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, backing up a little bit before we get into this whole Kinect theory, I think you said, you know, this whole thing about the game, this was not an official Microsoft announcement, right?

452
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:13,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, somebody just blew the lid on their big E3 surprise, right?

453
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:14,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

454
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:16,737
[SPEAKER_18]: So, is this some type of, like, insider leak?

455
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,379
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they went on down to the date.

456
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,381
[SPEAKER_18]: That's something else.

457
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:22,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think they're guessing on the date.

458
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:25,725
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying, you know, it makes sense because it's ten years from the original, so...

459
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, fair enough.

460
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:29,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

461
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:35,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to just pull this up here real quick because sometimes dates don't necessarily jive.

462
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:38,256
[SPEAKER_08]: The 15th would be a Tuesday.

463
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:40,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a release date.

464
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: That's usually the typical release date for a lot of these games nowadays.

465
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:48,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is great because they're finally getting along lines with the movie industry.

466
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,727
[SPEAKER_08]: They all release them on the same date.

467
00:31:51,628 --> 00:31:52,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Not if you're Nintendo.

468
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,970
[SPEAKER_18]: You sometimes do Sundays if you're Nintendo.

469
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,071
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been doing less Sundays than they have in the past.

470
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:01,512
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, Nintendo, they have to be special.

471
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:11,734
[SPEAKER_18]: I gotta admit, this news isn't totally surprising because I think Microsoft kind of teased this idea when they shut down Halo 2 that, well, you never know, these games might come back.

472
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So this news isn't totally surprising.

473
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:22,401
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, I think a lot of us thought, oh, it would be an Xbox Live Arcade game, or they're not going to go back and redo the whole damn thing.

474
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,923
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Halo is a pretty good looking game anyway.

475
00:32:25,024 --> 00:32:27,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they never said it wasn't going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.

476
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Good point.

477
00:32:30,972 --> 00:32:31,994
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess anything's possible there.

478
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:35,778
[SPEAKER_18]: But if they do all this Kinect stuff, I think they're going to release it as a retail.

479
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:36,780
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be retail.

480
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,201
[SPEAKER_18]: They can charge $60 for it.

481
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:39,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

482
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:40,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

483
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems weird to me that we're already going to see a trend of remaking games that...

484
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

485
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:01,629
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit.

486
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:03,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not terrible.

487
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,152
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're already seeing this on the PlayStation 3 a lot.

488
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:10,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just like all of a sudden they're like, oh, hey, got a work collection sold well.

489
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's remake everything.

490
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:14,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just update everything and port it onto the PS3.

491
00:33:15,098 --> 00:33:19,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Because none of that PS2 backwards compatibility is coming anytime soon.

492
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:20,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Or so we think.

493
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:25,186
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden, boom, look, now you can play those games that you just bought on the...

494
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:29,009
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't mind a lot of the remakes, actually.

495
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:32,032
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of them are pretty good, and they bring some bonus stuff to the table.

496
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,153
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that might sound really weird.

497
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, the Hollywood remakes I could do without.

498
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of those are poop.

499
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:38,157
[SPEAKER_18]: But, like, for instance, Square Enix.

500
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:42,041
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a story later in the show about Final Fantasy IV coming on the PSP.

501
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,822
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks badass.

502
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,143
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't wait to get it.

503
00:33:44,403 --> 00:33:46,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, granted, that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy games they ever made.

504
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:51,990
[SPEAKER_18]: But, I mean, those Final Fantasy remakes in general, 1 and 2 on the PSP, and then the ones on the DS...

505
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:54,051
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all awesome, and all of them are worth having.

506
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:55,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that stuff kind of a head-scratcher, too?

507
00:33:55,773 --> 00:34:04,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, for the longest time on the PSP, and granted, there's a Kingdom Hearts game here and there and stuff like that, but there isn't really a lot of games I'm really interested in.

508
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:10,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it's like, oh, by the way, now we're going to put out Final Fantasy IV and the After Years on the PSP.

509
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:11,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, whoa, hey, that's pretty cool.

510
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:12,766
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've got to pick up that.

511
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, Earth Defense Force 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.

512
00:34:16,108 --> 00:34:17,570
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, eventually it'll come out over here.

513
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's pretty cool.

514
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was one other one.

515
00:34:20,932 --> 00:34:21,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember what it was, so...

516
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:31,200
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, I mean, you know, there's, uh, third birthday, you know, new, uh, Dissida game, um, and it's just a lot of cool stuff coming out.

517
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:33,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, go ahead.

518
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:56,589
[SPEAKER_18]: which is cool.

519
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:57,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Mega Man 2.

520
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:14,691
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of my favorite Mega Mans I ever did and it's really just the NES version but the way they market it on the marketplace and I should have known this because it's just a port of the PlayStation 1 version but it's really just the NES game on the PS1 with some fancy menus and I think the Pocket Station game is in there too.

521
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:17,252
[SPEAKER_18]: PSP has that too when you play a PS1 game on PSP

522
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:45,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly, same feature.

523
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,305
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, they didn't bother to translate the manual either.

524
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:49,986
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's just Japanese, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese.

525
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Great if you speak Japanese, I don't.

526
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:53,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Way to go, Capcom, you suck.

527
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:54,669
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway.

528
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:57,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look for Roku instead of Mega.

529
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:07,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's just, you know, whereas I support this whole Japanese release of games, I mean, I understand if they don't have the manpower to go in and translate the original ROM.

530
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:08,118
[SPEAKER_18]: That is a little bit of work.

531
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:12,101
[SPEAKER_08]: What they need to do is they need to give it the same treatment that they would as the Asian regions.

532
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:12,941
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

533
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That takes like one person to do that.

534
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:37,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, you don't even need to translate the stuff.

535
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:41,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You just kind of figure it out, write it down, create a graphic, boom, done.

536
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:42,263
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

537
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:44,444
[SPEAKER_08]: That's maybe a day's worth of work.

538
00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:47,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but that's way too much for Capcom.

539
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:50,369
[SPEAKER_08]: They're too busy implementing DRM and shit.

540
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:51,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So, whatever.

541
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:53,722
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

542
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:58,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Somehow we got way off base of the original Halo Connect thing.

543
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:05,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But as you were talking about with Mega Man stuff, and I made the comment that was pretty funny before the show, and you said say before the show, so I'll just repeat it on the show.

544
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

545
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:16,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about rehashes and stuff, and I was bitching about the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition, basically a port of a Super Nintendo game onto the Wii.

546
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:18,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, guess what?

547
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:23,122
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have charged $8 for it on Virtual Console, but no, they're going to make it.

548
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:24,803
[SPEAKER_08]: pay $30 for it.

549
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:32,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically like Nintendo taking a giant shit in your mouth and of course all the fans will eagerly gobble it up because it's Nintendo.

550
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And shit in your mouth now also available in teal blue.

551
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:37,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have that option as well.

552
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:46,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at some comments from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I'm having to scroll back here a little bit because they said these a while ago.

553
00:37:46,503 --> 00:37:53,407
[SPEAKER_18]: But DarkTetsuya says, See, I had a feeling Microsoft would remake the older games since the Xbox originals can't connect to live anymore.

554
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of the same thing I was thinking with Halo 2.

555
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,489
[SPEAKER_18]: But Halo 1 didn't have multiplayer.

556
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,750
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if you guys remember that.

557
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,991
[SPEAKER_18]: It had, excuse me, it didn't have Xbox Live.

558
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,793
[SPEAKER_18]: It had, like, LAN support.

559
00:38:03,493 --> 00:38:06,295
[SPEAKER_18]: The first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception.

560
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:07,175
[SPEAKER_18]: True story.

561
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:10,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had a LAN thing all set up with the original Halo.

562
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:11,718
[SPEAKER_18]: It was neat.

563
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:21,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I'm a Halo fan, but jeesh, unless it's continuing the storyline, not doing the stupid past, but I'm not into this crap anymore.

564
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, technically...

565
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:23,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

566
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:24,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo 1.

567
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:41,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Halo 1 lacked Xbox Live, I can see where they want to do this again.

568
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:46,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And they can kind of get away with it because it would be bringing something new to the table that the original Halo didn't have.

569
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:47,678
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

570
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:51,940
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, maybe while they're at it, instead of straight porting it over, maybe they can tweak a few things.

571
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Add some maps.

572
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:55,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Throw the Halo 2 maps in there.

573
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:58,946
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to add in red versus blue mode.

574
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,970
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to add any Halo 2 maps in there because you know why?

575
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're going to release Halo 2 in HD.

576
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:08,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Well then charge 1600 Microsoft points for it or something.

577
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,681
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I know, wishful thinking, right?

578
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:11,222
[SPEAKER_18]: But who knows.

579
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:12,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow.

580
00:39:13,544 --> 00:39:15,325
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's move on to some other stories.

581
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:19,006
[SPEAKER_18]: And yeah, this is kind of along those same lines about rehashes and so forth.

582
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Although not really.

583
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,247
[SPEAKER_18]: This is more of a dud.

584
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:23,508
[SPEAKER_18]: This is about a game coming out on the 3DS.

585
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:28,769
[SPEAKER_18]: New Super Mario Brothers was somewhat announced for the 3DS.

586
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:29,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, come on, people.

587
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, there's going to be a Mario game on the 3DS.

588
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:39,373
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's nice to hear a little bit of a confirmation that it is being worked on because that tells you this game is probably coming out a little sooner rather than later.

589
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:48,235
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, in my mind, this kind of says it's probably one of their E3 games this year, because you know they've got to unveil some big things on the 3DS this year.

590
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:49,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow.

591
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, come up with a new damn game.

592
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:56,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand, ooh, it's New Super Mario Brothers, and we're porting it through all the different systems.

593
00:39:56,616 --> 00:39:58,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Well... Come up with a new game.

594
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't call it, first off, don't call it New Super Mario Brothers.

595
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:02,998
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a stupid name for a game.

596
00:40:03,018 --> 00:40:04,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that, okay, where to begin?

597
00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:07,359
[SPEAKER_18]: First, that's not, you know, they haven't confirmed that that's a name.

598
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me tell you what's been said.

599
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:09,459
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

600
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:29,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably at least in the top ten games on those respective consoles.

601
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:30,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Easily, if not the top five.

602
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:33,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and so that gives them an excuse to come up with crappy names for their games.

603
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,282
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

604
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Super take a dump, you know.

605
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:39,927
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Zelda sequel.

606
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:41,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So your problem is the name.

607
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see that in 3D.

608
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,633
[SPEAKER_08]: My problem is the name of the game.

609
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like...

610
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,515
[SPEAKER_08]: New Super Mario Bros.

611
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:48,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

612
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:51,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for putting all that effort in there.

613
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:53,400
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to call this New Super Mario Bros.

614
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:53,560
[SPEAKER_08]: game?

615
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,541
[SPEAKER_08]: That's genius!

616
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:58,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now calling it Luigi's Mansion didn't really work out for them.

617
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was a different game entirely.

618
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:02,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Come up with something new.

619
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:08,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop porting shit over because you have casual people and playing these systems and stuff.

620
00:41:08,873 --> 00:41:10,254
[SPEAKER_18]: They had Super Princess Peach.

621
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:11,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think that did so hot either.

622
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:18,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because Princess Peach can't hold her own fucking game unless it was cooking or doing makeup or something.

623
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

624
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:20,810
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, rebuttal?

625
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,612
[SPEAKER_18]: She's doing her nails.

626
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:25,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, it's Princess Peach.

627
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you doing your nails.

628
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:28,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually cutting out a very painful hangnail.

629
00:41:29,137 --> 00:41:29,517
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

630
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:31,539
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have something sharp in my hand.

631
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is home turf.

632
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:36,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, it's Princess Peach, though.

633
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:40,686
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like we're fucking talking about, like, Lara Croft or some shit like that.

634
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Princess Prissy Peach, okay?

635
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:43,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

636
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I love Princess Peach.

637
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut your mouth.

638
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,592
[SPEAKER_08]: The special abilities are her fucking emotions.

639
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm anger now!

640
00:41:52,453 --> 00:41:53,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I'm happy!

641
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:55,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to joke in Mario Bros.

642
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:58,995
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 that when she floated in her pink dress it's because she had gas.

643
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking bipolar Princess Peach.

644
00:42:02,297 --> 00:42:05,098
[SPEAKER_18]: I will take you on in Super Smash Bros.

645
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:06,898
[SPEAKER_18]: and I will whoop your ass with Peach.

646
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:07,979
[SPEAKER_18]: She's awesome.

647
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:08,779
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

648
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:10,540
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all about Zelda in chic mode.

649
00:42:11,346 --> 00:42:11,766
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, yes.

650
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:13,367
[SPEAKER_18]: Zelda is pretty awesome.

651
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda cosplaying as a gay man.

652
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:20,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I read the damn quote that led us to this whole thing in the first place?

653
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:22,912
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we talking about again?

654
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:23,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo.

655
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,593
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

656
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:26,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Halo on the 3DS.

657
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:26,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.

658
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:27,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, look.

659
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:33,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Miyamoto says, yes, so in the interest of adopting a new technology for the Super Mario Bros.

660
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,998
[SPEAKER_18]: tradition, I am now making a new Super Mario Bros.

661
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,919
[SPEAKER_18]: game for the Nintendo 3DS system.

662
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:42,360
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, this is out of a Q&A from Iwata on Nintendo's site.

663
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Iwata says, the next stage for the Super Mario Bros.

664
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:48,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Preservation Society's activities is the Nintendo 3DS.

665
00:42:48,663 --> 00:42:51,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Miyamoto, yes, laughs because he's thinking about money.

666
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:51,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

667
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:56,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Miyamoto then stripped naked and landed in a kiddie pool of money and just cried and laughed and screamed.

668
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I will bet you $50 is gonna be fucking New Super Mario Bros.

669
00:42:59,762 --> 00:42:59,942
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D.

670
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:01,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That is gonna be the fucking title of the game.

671
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:03,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, that is gonna be it.

672
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:05,846
[SPEAKER_08]: New Super Mario Bros.

673
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: 3D.

674
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:07,287
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

675
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,067
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the title.

676
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:08,688
[SPEAKER_08]: You mad?

677
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:09,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

678
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:13,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying... Can I finish the quote?

679
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:14,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I finish?

680
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:15,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I finish?

681
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:16,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine, go ahead.

682
00:43:17,836 --> 00:43:21,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to show everyone as soon as possible what the new Super Mario Bros.

683
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: will be like on the Nintendo 3DS I'm finished I'm just saying I want to show you what it's going to be like Turn on the Wii Turn on the DS Done

684
00:43:37,116 --> 00:43:44,360
[SPEAKER_18]: But by the way, the fact that he says as soon as possible, do you think that expo in June in LA will be the place to see it?

685
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,421
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what as soon as possible is?

686
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,903
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Nintendo time we're talking here, okay?

687
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:53,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon as possible means we're going to announce it as soon as possible, but it may not come out for a couple years.

688
00:43:54,659 --> 00:44:01,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It all depends on how quickly they can port Mario 64 3D.

689
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:09,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Alpha Cananogram in our chatroom says, I remember Miyamoto saying he wanted to remake Super Mario World, I think.

690
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:11,387
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Super Mario World.

691
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:14,709
[SPEAKER_18]: That was like one of the greatest video games ever made was the original Mario World.

692
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:18,411
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, the new album art kind of pays homage to that, actually.

693
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:20,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Kind of funny how that works.

694
00:44:21,332 --> 00:44:23,294
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

695
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:41,813
[SPEAKER_10]: How about something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo?

696
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:42,494
[SPEAKER_10]: How about it?

697
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:43,534
[SPEAKER_10]: It does have to do with Nintendo.

698
00:44:43,574 --> 00:44:44,314
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it!

699
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:45,414
[SPEAKER_10]: But not really.

700
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:46,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's on the 3DS.

701
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:47,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it that way.

702
00:44:48,475 --> 00:44:51,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Reimaginings for Pac-Man and Galaga on the 3DS.

703
00:44:52,296 --> 00:44:56,036
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have Pac-Man Tilt and Galaga 3D Impact.

704
00:44:56,917 --> 00:45:02,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are in the same pack, which is Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions that are going to be out on the 3DS.

705
00:45:03,938 --> 00:45:08,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Tilt sort of is a gyroscope type game, so he's in Rainbowland.

706
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki paused the game.

707
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:11,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm waiting.

708
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:17,847
[SPEAKER_10]: With championship edition style and it's just very tilty.

709
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:20,068
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to watch out because you may injure yourself.

710
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:23,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not like tilty games for the record.

711
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to do that on the subway because I'll hit someone.

712
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:31,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I love this picture, by the way, of the guy moving the 3DS around and moving it above his head.

713
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:33,099
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a little picture there.

714
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Loki, did you have a comment?

715
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:36,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say that, I mean...

716
00:45:39,162 --> 00:45:43,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Pac-Man is your staple franchise, Namco.

717
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:48,193
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like Konami trying to shove fucking Frogger down our throats.

718
00:45:48,613 --> 00:45:51,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I don't give a shit about Pac-Man anymore.

719
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:53,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people don't give a shit about Pac-Man.

720
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,262
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, hold on.

721
00:45:56,282 --> 00:45:56,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

722
00:45:56,743 --> 00:45:57,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

723
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:57,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

724
00:45:57,864 --> 00:45:58,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, stop it.

725
00:45:58,685 --> 00:45:59,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick.

726
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty awesome.

727
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it is like the original Pac-Man.

728
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:07,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit about Tilty Pac-Man.

729
00:46:08,156 --> 00:46:10,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit about Pac-Man in a go-kart.

730
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit about Pac-Man at a party.

731
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:14,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit about multiplayer Pac-Man.

732
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just... Pac-Man's cool.

733
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,606
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to port it 8 billion times like you've already done, fine.

734
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:25,909
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because people just need to own Pac-Man again, but...

735
00:46:28,197 --> 00:46:29,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man was great.

736
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:30,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I finish my story, please?

737
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:34,298
[SPEAKER_08]: My sensibilities are being offended.

738
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:54,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, DarkSakura.

739
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:55,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to finish my story now, please.

740
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:55,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

741
00:46:57,261 --> 00:46:58,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And besides that, pack picks did kind of suck.

742
00:46:59,924 --> 00:47:00,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

743
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:01,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Terrible.

744
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:06,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Galaga is going to be completely reimagined as a rail shooter, by the way.

745
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:10,383
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how I feel about that.

746
00:47:11,224 --> 00:47:13,345
[SPEAKER_10]: The thought that I might enjoy it makes me feel a little dirty.

747
00:47:13,465 --> 00:47:14,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd look at that.

748
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:14,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd check that out.

749
00:47:15,526 --> 00:47:19,008
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd hit that.

750
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:22,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do a Space Invaders rail shooter in the Time Crisis engine.

751
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:26,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're aborting on all these franchises.

752
00:47:26,472 --> 00:47:30,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, because Yars Revenge is going to be awesome as a rail shooter with anime chicks.

753
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:35,857
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm done.

754
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:40,064
[SPEAKER_18]: No interest in the Battle Royale game, that new arcade table?

755
00:47:40,144 --> 00:47:41,144
[SPEAKER_18]: That looks kind of cool.

756
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:41,944
[SPEAKER_18]: No interest?

757
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:43,324
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's stupid.

758
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:47,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because if you play that game with one person, you're playing the original Pac-Man.

759
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:53,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe you... Loki, maybe you need to evaluate.

760
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:54,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't I have any friends?

761
00:47:55,007 --> 00:47:56,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Could it be... Oh, I'm sorry.

762
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any friends because I don't want to play multiplayer Pac-Man with them?

763
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:00,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, those aren't friends I want.

764
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:07,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Why won't you play multiplayer Pac-Man with me, man?

765
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:08,783
[SPEAKER_17]: What's wrong?

766
00:48:08,843 --> 00:48:10,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Why won't you play with me?

767
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:12,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you never let me be Pinky.

768
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:14,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you like crappy games.

769
00:48:17,214 --> 00:48:20,179
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's... Seriously, though, I mean... I...

770
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:27,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to laugh though with just that arcade cabinet because it's so expensive and it's meant to look like a cocktail cabinet.

771
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Like people still remember what cocktail cabinets are.

772
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:37,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially kids nowadays don't know what the fuck a cocktail cabinet is and that shit's gonna get broken so fast.

773
00:48:37,603 --> 00:48:41,345
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, I don't see a big draw to...

774
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Pac-Man in the arcade people don't go to the fucking arcades to play Pac-Man they can play Pac-Man on everything because Namco's hoarded out to everything including Google exactly so why do I need to go to the arcade to play Pac-Man when I can play it anywhere

775
00:48:58,945 --> 00:49:01,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So how does Ultracade manage to make any money then?

776
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:07,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it seems like they've done a great job by cashing in on the... There's always someone on the damn Ultracade machine at Dave & Buster's.

777
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:07,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Always.

778
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:08,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy.

779
00:49:08,632 --> 00:49:10,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Because their cabinets are cheap to reproduce.

780
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:12,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it's a cheap monitor.

781
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:16,016
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a cheap computer inside there that's running on an arcade board.

782
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,017
[SPEAKER_08]: They license everything.

783
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:21,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And it gives a good option for arcade owners because you have multiple games in one...

784
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Small Cabinet instead of having a full arcade full of games.

785
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:29,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically drop it in and you make money because everybody has a game that they like on there.

786
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:31,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can kick the machine.

787
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:32,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

788
00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:35,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

789
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:41,697
[SPEAKER_08]: and Alpha Cananogram says, how much is that Battle Royale cabinet?

790
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:46,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the exact cost, but I believe it's like $5,000, which is ridiculous.

791
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:50,084
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's only because there's a stupid touchscreen, you know, HDTV in there.

792
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:52,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, the game sounds pretty.

793
00:49:55,071 --> 00:49:56,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, you know what?

794
00:49:56,272 --> 00:50:03,217
[SPEAKER_08]: They should just port it to the Microsoft Surface because that just has no software for it.

795
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:04,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember those.

796
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:05,379
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fun.

797
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,322
[SPEAKER_18]: That was at PAX that one year in that hotel that we weren't even staying at.

798
00:50:10,943 --> 00:50:14,585
[SPEAKER_18]: Sony's Move server is coming to PC It may be revealed at a Game Developers Conference

799
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:42,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Move Server is a software development kit for porting Move controls over to the PC.

800
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:50,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat idea, I guess.

801
00:50:51,816 --> 00:51:04,104
[SPEAKER_08]: They already have kind of Move-type controllers anyways for the PC, but I guess if you really want to find another use for your Move controller, then you can go ahead and use it on your PC.

802
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:11,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd imagine, though, you would need a Bluetooth adapter and, well, obviously, the stuff for the Move, the camera and everything.

803
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, no software supports it yet, but it's set to be announced possibly on March 2nd.

804
00:51:19,426 --> 00:51:24,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Am I the only one that doesn't really understand the need for the Kinect and the Move stuff on the PC?

805
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:31,016
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about you guys, but my PC is in my bedroom, and it's kind of in a space where I don't really want to move around.

806
00:51:31,136 --> 00:51:38,403
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my place to get fat, is I sit my butt in that chair, and I have my feet up on the desk, and I'm playing World of Warcraft.

807
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:39,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Click, click, click, click, click.

808
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:43,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't play Kinect in my bedroom at the PC.

809
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:44,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Who would do that?

810
00:51:45,849 --> 00:51:48,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well... Maybe a paraplegic.

811
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:54,694
[SPEAKER_08]: The Kinect, I mean, I think is gonna entice people more to hook it up to the PC because of all the cool, neat things you can do with it.

812
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,755
[SPEAKER_08]: The Move is really just another controller.

813
00:51:56,935 --> 00:51:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the Wii.

814
00:51:57,795 --> 00:52:01,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, the Move wasn't that exciting when it came out on the PlayStation 3.

815
00:52:01,757 --> 00:52:09,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a decent controller, but it... And I know that they're really pushing hard for it to be like a first-person shooter and a hardcore accessory...

816
00:52:11,102 --> 00:52:38,298
[SPEAKER_08]: but honestly the hardcore players out there they see right through this shit and they're not going to just go buy their stupid looking machine gun looking thing to plug this thing into just because it's supposed to it doesn't make you more accurate in these first person shooter games it's just kind of weird but I don't think that you're going to see a lot of super innovative stuff with this I mean the same type of stuff that you would see with this you can do already on the Wii Remote with a Bluetooth adapter so um

817
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:43,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I'm just kind of scratching my head with it.

818
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:44,374
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, whatever, you know.

819
00:52:45,658 --> 00:52:47,403
[SPEAKER_11]: They can go, hey, look, we're on PC too.

820
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:47,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

821
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:59,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of saw this as trying to beat Microsoft to the punch in kind of officially supporting the... Because they clearly, Sony sees, oh, people want to have these motion controllers on their PCs.

822
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:04,352
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome, but the thing is, though, is it... I mean, what are you going to be able to do with it?

823
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:06,213
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my thing, is what are you going to be able to do with it?

824
00:53:06,554 --> 00:53:14,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the controller, it's pretty accurate and stuff, but it doesn't do all the cool, nifty, like, you know, 3D scan stuff that you can do with the Kinect.

825
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, good.

826
00:53:17,181 --> 00:53:20,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I have the Vision Camera support or whatever.

827
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:22,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not the Vision Camera, the PlayStation Eye.

828
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:25,343
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, big deal.

829
00:53:25,423 --> 00:53:27,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I can have a webcam.

830
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:30,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just, I don't.

831
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:32,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see the point.

832
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:33,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be kind of curious though.

833
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:36,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you actually need the eye camera.

834
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:41,102
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if you can just use normal web cameras to kind of ask like the eye.

835
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:41,822
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be kind of neat.

836
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:42,822
[SPEAKER_08]: See if you could do that.

837
00:53:43,343 --> 00:53:45,424
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

838
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:45,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

839
00:53:46,284 --> 00:53:48,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's good that they have another option.

840
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:52,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't see a lot of, you know, unless it's other than indie games and stuff like that.

841
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see a lot of people like adding support for this for their games.

842
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:57,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think that's going to happen.

843
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:06,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, if you have to buy all this other stuff to make it work, like the Bluetooth adapter or whatever, well, I guess computers haven't built in these days, right?

844
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:08,013
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of computers haven't.

845
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, laptops and stuff haven't built in.

846
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:14,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Not so much actual PCs and stuff like that.

847
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:16,094
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, that stuff's cheap.

848
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not too expensive to add a Bluetooth adapter.

849
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:23,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're really interested in this stuff, and hey, you may have one for a headset or something like that.

850
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:25,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So, great, but...

851
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:26,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

852
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:31,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's neat to have the option, but I just don't see a lot of people using this.

853
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the Kinect is going to be a lot more popular when it comes to this stuff.

854
00:54:34,582 --> 00:54:37,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you'll see a lot of cool move hacks and stuff.

855
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:40,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, they could have come up with... I mean, it's Bluetooth.

856
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:49,412
[SPEAKER_08]: They could have come up with custom drivers and stuff for the move controllers and everything, but you don't see anyone doing that because no one cares.

857
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:54,015
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, I don't think anyone's going to really care when this comes out for PC.

858
00:54:56,236 --> 00:55:00,918
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, let's move on since Loki is such a fan of Nintendo tonight.

859
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,638
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have to get his opinion on this story.

860
00:55:03,398 --> 00:55:08,320
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the big games that Nintendo was hawking at last year's E3 was Zelda Skyward Sword.

861
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:17,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it looks like that they might be kind of pushing that game again at the Expo this year because it looks like Skyward Sword is going to be a little while before it comes out.

862
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,264
[SPEAKER_18]: It's clearly the first quarter of the year.

863
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:20,124
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not happening.

864
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:35,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Second quarter of the year is looking a little grim because they have said that The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has been in the process of being remade for Nintendo 3DS and this Nintendo 3DS version is expected to hit the market earlier than Skyward Sword.

865
00:55:36,154 --> 00:55:40,436
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what Satoru Iwata says in a recent financial report piece.

866
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:41,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, folks.

867
00:55:41,497 --> 00:55:42,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, remade.

868
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:45,760
[SPEAKER_08]: All they're doing is just porting the assets to the fucking 3DS.

869
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,480
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all they're doing.

870
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, remade.

871
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:52,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought at one point Nintendo was touting how easy it was to port games over the 3DS.

872
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:54,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything with the Z-axis.

873
00:55:55,267 --> 00:56:03,394
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just all it is is just some core engine stuff that they're rebuilding and then all the assets and stuff they're just porting on over.

874
00:56:03,454 --> 00:56:06,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that they're really up-resing a lot of the stuff that's on there.

875
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:12,221
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just kind of straight porting it over and then tweaking the engine a little bit to have it all run in.

876
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:15,945
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skyward Sword stuff, I'm not surprised.

877
00:56:15,965 --> 00:56:19,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look at how long Metroid Other M was delayed.

878
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:23,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was just kind of getting pushed back and back and back for a while.

879
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:25,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And same with a lot of the other games.

880
00:56:25,594 --> 00:56:28,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would not be surprised if something like this doesn't come out.

881
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:31,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because a lot of times I think that they're...

882
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,031
[SPEAKER_08]: They promise a lot of games that come out, and then they just don't have them.

883
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they're like, okay, well, crap.

884
00:56:37,612 --> 00:56:40,813
[SPEAKER_08]: What's it going to be our holiday game or something like that?

885
00:56:40,873 --> 00:56:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it'll get pushed to November or something like that.

886
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:47,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Because really, they haven't announced a lot of stuff.

887
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:48,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, sure, there's going to be stuff at E3, but...

888
00:56:51,997 --> 00:56:52,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

889
00:56:52,758 --> 00:56:55,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just they're going to be looking for that big holiday title.

890
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:57,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Sell more systems for the Wii.

891
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,061
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of my thought too.

892
00:56:59,242 --> 00:57:04,625
[SPEAKER_18]: They say in this that Miyamoto's team is entering the final completion stage of the Wii title, whatever that means.

893
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:11,729
[SPEAKER_18]: But this kind of makes me think that maybe part of the reason for this delay is so that they have something to show on the Wii this year at that big expo.

894
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:12,610
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

895
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:17,673
[SPEAKER_18]: Like maybe there's not a lot else scheduled to be coming out on the Wii.

896
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:18,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe Just Dance 3?

897
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:19,014
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

898
00:57:19,194 --> 00:57:20,475
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean...

899
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:27,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some things I could see them doing, like New Super Mario Bros.

900
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:40,706
[SPEAKER_08]: 2, I could see them doing something like that, just because they already have the engine built, and it's basically just building new levels for it, maybe tweaking and adding some new things on their new abilities or some shit like that, and everyone will go buck wild over it.

901
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:46,189
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been promising Pikmin forever, so they'll make me a new Pikmin game, but honestly...

902
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just can't get too excited about Pikmin, I'm sorry.

903
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:54,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think this year is going to be a lot of 3DS games.

904
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

905
00:57:57,472 --> 00:58:10,843
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to see a lot of stuff that they've already announced that's not coming out, like the Kid Icarus game again is going to be another focus of E3 because it's probably going to be their... I'd be willing to bet that's one of their holiday titles for the 3DS.

906
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:10,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

907
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,430
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

908
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,483
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a problem with mobile gaming.

909
00:58:41,503 --> 00:58:47,490
[SPEAKER_10]: He has a problem with how cheap mobile games are, like for iPhone and this type of app games.

910
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:57,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically quoted saying that one of the biggest risks in the industry is inexpensive games that are disposable from a consumer standpoint.

911
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:27,451
[SPEAKER_10]: as in oh crap 99 cents I'm fine with it I'm done with it and basically it removes the idea of you know value from the game because now you're so saturated with things that are so cheap that you expect everything to be so cheap what an amazing fucking metaphor for the state of games on the Wii yeah I mean here's the problem irony much you know the problem with that thought though is that what if those cheap games are really good

912
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:29,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, see, that's what he said.

913
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now that's not possible.

914
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:34,610
[SPEAKER_10]: He used Angry Birds as an example of the diamond in the rough.

915
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:41,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Every so often you come up with something that's exceptional, but for the most part, they're all just cookie cutter crap.

916
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:43,129
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

917
00:59:59,069 --> 01:00:00,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

918
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,152
[SPEAKER_08]: People are selling games and making money.

919
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Why didn't I think of that?

920
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:05,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow!

921
01:00:05,274 --> 01:00:11,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't my $20 copy of Let's Go Cook Some Shit in my kitchen not selling well?

922
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:12,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

923
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:14,601
[SPEAKER_08]: What, people don't like math tutor games?

924
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:16,202
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with them?

925
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:18,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't this selling?

926
01:00:18,764 --> 01:00:19,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

927
01:00:19,445 --> 01:00:24,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Nintendo has to put forward this illusion of quality with things that they put out.

928
01:00:24,528 --> 01:00:25,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I agree.

929
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:26,790
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of it's crap.

930
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,531
[SPEAKER_10]: However...

931
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:32,152
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have their corporate image to uphold.

932
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:34,393
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of who they are, part of their branding.

933
01:00:34,533 --> 01:00:39,954
[SPEAKER_08]: They stopped caring about quality when that fucking seal left their goddamn boxes.

934
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:41,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know how many years ago that was?

935
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:43,435
[SPEAKER_08]: A long time ago.

936
01:00:43,856 --> 01:00:44,736
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't give a shit.

937
01:00:44,796 --> 01:00:46,997
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about what will people want to buy?

938
01:00:49,048 --> 01:00:50,431
[SPEAKER_08]: What can we make them want to buy?

939
01:00:50,712 --> 01:00:51,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey!

940
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's port some GameCube games over and add Wii controls to them.

941
01:00:55,502 --> 01:00:57,747
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, I do see people buying that shit.

942
01:00:58,627 --> 01:00:59,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

943
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:00,108
[SPEAKER_10]: They're making money.

944
01:01:00,489 --> 01:01:00,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

945
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:01,710
[SPEAKER_08]: They're making money.

946
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:07,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Then why are they bitching about somebody using a different business strategy to make money?

947
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:09,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they didn't think of it first.

948
01:01:09,816 --> 01:01:25,589
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't think of it first and because it's competing with their market and now they're saying, well, how do we justify these games that are possibly crap like this for $20 when these people are selling something similar that may be better than our product for $1?

949
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:27,170
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't.

950
01:01:28,471 --> 01:01:36,273
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I got to say, though, to some extent, I think he has a point because a lot of the mobile games on the iOS system are pieces of shit.

951
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Like a lot of them are truly terrible games.

952
01:01:38,714 --> 01:01:39,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

953
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:48,497
[SPEAKER_03]: A friend of mine once said that trying to find a good app game at that price point is like trying to get honest nutrition from a vending machine.

954
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,158
[SPEAKER_03]: More often than not, you're getting a melted Snickers.

955
01:01:54,082 --> 01:01:55,503
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:15,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Hence like Steam sales.

957
01:02:16,178 --> 01:02:17,419
[SPEAKER_18]: That's another big thing.

958
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:19,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I get great games for $4 or $10.

959
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:25,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it hard to excuse the fact that people are saying, well, there's a lot of crappy games out there on the iOS store.

960
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:26,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there are.

961
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:27,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

962
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:33,663
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do some research and before you purchase your games, you don't have to buy all those crappy games.

963
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with the more expensive games.

964
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:38,544
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do your research, you don't have to buy the expensive games.

965
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:43,785
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, he's basically saying, well, these games are cheap and there's no good cheap games out there.

966
01:02:44,085 --> 01:02:44,505
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true.

967
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:54,487
[SPEAKER_10]: The difference being is that... In the case of some of these games that are on there for dirt cheap, they're made by a couple of guys who are just hanging out and like, oh, let's put a buck on it.

968
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:56,467
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to put something on it, so let's do a dollar.

969
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:57,967
[SPEAKER_10]: They just do it for fun.

970
01:02:58,468 --> 01:02:59,688
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, those little games come out.

971
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:01,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes there'll be a company behind it.

972
01:03:01,128 --> 01:03:05,009
[SPEAKER_10]: With most of Nintendo's stuff, you're looking at basically developers.

973
01:03:05,429 --> 01:03:08,889
[SPEAKER_10]: People who have to pay employees to develop this.

974
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:10,230
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, bigger companies.

975
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,130
[SPEAKER_10]: You're dealing with a corporate structure.

976
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:20,719
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing to look at, too, is that, you know, yeah, they have the DSiWare, but most of their games are still physical games.

977
01:03:20,739 --> 01:03:22,081
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to pay for materials.

978
01:03:22,101 --> 01:03:23,122
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to pay for packaging.

979
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:27,447
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a designer that goes into designing the box.

980
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:29,410
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got someone doing the manual.

981
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,773
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a technical writer writing everything that goes in the manual.

982
01:03:32,133 --> 01:03:33,274
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

983
01:03:50,822 --> 01:03:51,483
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm a consumer.

984
01:03:51,503 --> 01:03:52,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a crap about that.

985
01:03:52,723 --> 01:03:53,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the thing.

986
01:03:54,144 --> 01:04:01,490
[SPEAKER_08]: If they have this option to release a game for $10 instead of, say, $30 just because they can avoid all those costs, why don't they do that?

987
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:04,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if they market it well enough, they will have no problem selling that.

988
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:11,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee if there's a good game that came on DSiWare, there's blogs that cover that shit every week of what comes out.

989
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,779
[SPEAKER_08]: People will be aware of it.

990
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:13,600
[SPEAKER_08]: People will buy it.

991
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

992
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:16,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with Xbox Live Arcade.

993
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:17,444
[SPEAKER_08]: There's tons of stuff that's $10, $20.

994
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:19,987
[SPEAKER_08]: There's great games.

995
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:29,939
[SPEAKER_10]: For the most part, if they put out something that's going to be half the price to market and they raise the price of it $10, chances are they're actually going to end up making more money that way.

996
01:04:31,653 --> 01:04:32,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's a question.

997
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:37,518
[SPEAKER_18]: You bring up a good point about really everything that goes into making a video game.

998
01:04:37,578 --> 01:04:46,805
[SPEAKER_18]: But as the industry kind of moves towards this digital distribution thing, I think as a whole, I think in the next generation of consoles, you're going to see more direct downloads of games.

999
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:52,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Hence why we see GameStop starting to already come up with their plan B, so to speak.

1000
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Shouldn't these people in the middle kind of be worried?

1001
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:57,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I see things definitely going that way.

1002
01:04:57,668 --> 01:05:06,692
[SPEAKER_10]: But for right now, with what they have now, I think that, and keep in mind Nintendo, for all the innovations that they like to bring in, they are very reluctant to change.

1003
01:05:06,872 --> 01:05:08,213
[SPEAKER_10]: How long do they stick with a cartridge?

1004
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:09,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really?

1005
01:05:10,694 --> 01:05:17,437
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have that reluctance to embrace something new as far as marketing and distribution strategy is concerned.

1006
01:05:18,577 --> 01:05:26,845
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I think that, you know, they're probably going to be another 10 years late like they were before, but they're going to eventually catch up to it.

1007
01:05:27,246 --> 01:05:29,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, that's not in the way that they operate.

1008
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:30,729
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not in how they do business.

1009
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And they can't really see anything outside of their own box.

1010
01:05:35,454 --> 01:05:39,057
[SPEAKER_10]: They may think that they're innovating in the way games are played and the way things are doing.

1011
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:39,878
[SPEAKER_10]: They're looking at...

1012
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:45,640
[SPEAKER_10]: The way we can innovate what we have now within this little cube.

1013
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Not meaning to bring up the GameCube, of course.

1014
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:56,803
[SPEAKER_10]: But they've always been about their own proprietary hardware and their own proprietary way of delivering the games.

1015
01:05:57,663 --> 01:05:59,684
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been about doing things the Nintendo way.

1016
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:04,825
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look over the course of the years, their business model really hasn't changed.

1017
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:34,297
[SPEAKER_10]: there hasn't been any real change in their strategy they've still kept things they want tight control over everything they want things to be to the Nintendo standard even if the game is suck all of the releasing of that game is done to Nintendo standard so I think it's also another way that they you know I mentioned their branding before I think it's actually a way that they protect their corporate identity too is by having such tight control over how everything goes out unfortunately that's money out of their pocket

1018
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:37,185
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way it goes.

1019
01:06:37,366 --> 01:06:46,631
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't see outside of their own business model to see a way that another business model could work for them.

1020
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:47,451
[SPEAKER_10]: They're afraid to change.

1021
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,532
[SPEAKER_10]: They're afraid to take a risk.

1022
01:06:49,428 --> 01:07:13,043
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of agree and I don't want to go too far off track but you know companies afraid to take risks that's something we've covered before and that is why Konami is not making the most profitable guitar game although they could have they could have wanted to take some risks they had it they had it in I had it in my hand all right anyhow let's move on we got to travel the world and talk about release dates of games that are coming out very soon let's start in the US Loki

1023
01:07:14,085 --> 01:07:19,749
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, taking some serious risks on Nintendo Wii, Mario Sports Mix.

1024
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:24,392
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sports game with Mario and other people and some Square Enix characters as well.

1025
01:07:27,014 --> 01:07:28,074
[SPEAKER_08]: People love their Mario games.

1026
01:07:28,695 --> 01:07:29,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Brain and Body Connection.

1027
01:07:30,496 --> 01:07:33,338
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a game that's kind of similar to the Brain Age game that was on the Wii.

1028
01:07:33,878 --> 01:07:38,281
[SPEAKER_08]: That was on Xbox 360 supporting the Kinect, or I should say requiring the Kinect.

1029
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:43,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 this week.

1030
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:46,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Junior Brain Trainer 2 on Nintendo DS.

1031
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:49,865
[SPEAKER_08]: This is pretty awesome.

1032
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:56,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally making its comeback, You Don't Know Jack on DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.

1033
01:07:57,408 --> 01:07:58,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, that's this week?

1034
01:07:58,748 --> 01:07:59,549
[SPEAKER_18]: That's this week.

1035
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:00,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap, yay!

1036
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:02,750
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there like a demo or anything for this?

1037
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:03,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if there's a demo.

1038
01:08:04,011 --> 01:08:06,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I heard there's probably a video on some website.

1039
01:08:06,313 --> 01:08:10,596
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've heard if you pre-order it, it's $30 and it's going to be like $40 after pre-orders.

1040
01:08:11,676 --> 01:08:12,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Something like that.

1041
01:08:12,837 --> 01:08:13,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

1042
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:15,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just what someone said on the message board.

1043
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,340
[SPEAKER_08]: They dropped the price on it.

1044
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,302
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably told people to make some more pre-orders.

1045
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:25,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Trinity, Souls of Zillow on PlayStation 3.

1046
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from... Looks like a Tecmo.

1047
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:32,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1048
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:37,111
[SPEAKER_08]: and Zuzu Princess.

1049
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1050
01:08:38,312 --> 01:08:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Another hamster game.

1051
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:46,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And then about a week from today, Dragon Quest 6.

1052
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:49,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Dragon Quest 6, Realms of Revelation.

1053
01:08:51,762 --> 01:08:53,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Realms of Revelancy.

1054
01:08:54,284 --> 01:08:57,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, can I look at this preview real quick for You Don't Know Jack here in studio?

1055
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:00,548
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of want to check this out because I used to love this game so much.

1056
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:02,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Back in 2012, you see.

1057
01:09:04,878 --> 01:09:07,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, that's an old logo.

1058
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Jellyvision.

1059
01:09:08,584 --> 01:09:08,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

1060
01:09:11,894 --> 01:09:12,995
[SPEAKER_01]: You Don't Know Jack!

1061
01:09:13,175 --> 01:09:15,437
[SPEAKER_01]: The trivia party video game is back!

1062
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:20,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And all new for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC!

1063
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's favorites are still there!

1064
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:26,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Twisted trivia questions, the dis or dat, screw your neighbor, and the jack attack!

1065
01:09:26,764 --> 01:09:30,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus all new face-melting features and surprises, including online play!

1066
01:09:30,907 --> 01:09:38,853
[SPEAKER_01]: From socialism to social networks, from bigamy to Bigfoot, from war games to drinking games, it's... You Don't Know Jack!

1067
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:41,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I gotta buy it.

1068
01:09:42,705 --> 01:09:43,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn it.

1069
01:09:43,886 --> 01:09:45,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to save money, but I need this.

1070
01:09:46,368 --> 01:09:46,788
[SPEAKER_18]: I need it.

1071
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Will your liver explode if you don't have that, Rob?

1072
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:52,192
[SPEAKER_18]: Possibly.

1073
01:09:53,152 --> 01:09:54,513
[SPEAKER_18]: My spleen will be painin'.

1074
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:55,814
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only 30 bucks, though.

1075
01:09:55,914 --> 01:09:56,354
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not that bad.

1076
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:57,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it make your liver quiver?

1077
01:09:57,775 --> 01:09:58,576
[SPEAKER_18]: It's only 30 bucks.

1078
01:09:58,936 --> 01:09:59,997
[SPEAKER_18]: You heard the man.

1079
01:10:00,277 --> 01:10:01,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it make your heart fart?

1080
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:03,919
[SPEAKER_18]: It's half the price of what I paid for that crappy Tron game.

1081
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:07,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow, anything else this week, Logie?

1082
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:13,281
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's move over to Japan and talk about what is coming out over there in Japan this week.

1083
01:10:13,882 --> 01:10:18,266
[SPEAKER_18]: On the 8th of February, the Asia regions are getting Test Drive Unlimited 2.

1084
01:10:18,706 --> 01:10:20,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes the Asia dates sneak their way onto my list.

1085
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:28,495
[SPEAKER_18]: But on the 10th of February, actually in Japan this week, Entakuno Saito, Students of Round, comes out this week.

1086
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,477
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure what that is.

1087
01:10:31,497 --> 01:10:33,499
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an RPG game on the Xbox 360.

1088
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, looks like, um, kind of neat.

1089
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:44,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Looks like you can have, like, a party of six people, and you can kind of use your, uh, D-pad to use, like, you know, attacks or spells or items.

1090
01:10:45,063 --> 01:10:48,083
[SPEAKER_18]: This looks like it might be very old-school, uh, RPG.

1091
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:50,744
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't look like it has kind of all the newfangled stuff in it, so.

1092
01:10:51,604 --> 01:10:55,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it's called Entaku no Saito, Students of Round, is what it's called, Loki.

1093
01:10:56,245 --> 01:10:57,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Students of Round.

1094
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:57,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1095
01:10:58,186 --> 01:10:59,686
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Summoned in Final Fantasy VII.

1096
01:11:00,366 --> 01:11:04,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare finally makes its way to Japan this week as well.

1097
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:08,031
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you are in Japan and you like yourself some Red Dead Redemption, check it out.

1098
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:10,172
[SPEAKER_18]: PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

1099
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,915
[SPEAKER_18]: LittleBigPlanet 2 finally makes it your way as well as Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare.

1100
01:11:14,295 --> 01:11:20,098
[SPEAKER_18]: And Sengoku Musou 3Z comes out in a regular and like a special limited edition.

1101
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:25,282
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you are a fan of these games, this is the third one in the series from Koei.

1102
01:11:26,142 --> 01:11:28,083
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's like a Dynasty Warriors-esque kind of game.

1103
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:29,204
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1104
01:11:29,604 --> 01:11:30,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes.

1105
01:11:31,145 --> 01:11:33,125
[SPEAKER_18]: You can choose between all these different characters.

1106
01:11:33,145 --> 01:11:34,246
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks like there's like 20 different characters.

1107
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:36,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, if you see Sengoku in the name, that's what it is.

1108
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:38,708
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1109
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:40,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on to some of the other consoles.

1110
01:11:40,888 --> 01:11:47,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Going to the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Mosou 3, Moshuden, which means scaled-down version.

1111
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:51,532
[SPEAKER_18]: I just made that up, but seeing as it's on the Wii, it probably is a little bit different.

1112
01:11:51,552 --> 01:11:52,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Something legend.

1113
01:11:53,873 --> 01:11:54,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Side story.

1114
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,034
[SPEAKER_18]: That's Gaiden.

1115
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:01,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing on the DS this week, obviously, because they're still warming up for the 3DS out there.

1116
01:12:01,959 --> 01:12:12,189
[SPEAKER_18]: So the only other system that I would really mention is the PSP, which has Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 3 coming out this week from Bandai Namco.

1117
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:14,150
[SPEAKER_18]: So check that out.

1118
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:17,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Music Game Fans, DJ Max Portable 3 is out next week.

1119
01:12:18,274 --> 01:12:19,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Thought I'd throw that out there.

1120
01:12:20,293 --> 01:12:25,057
[SPEAKER_18]: This looks a little bit like that Final Fantasy Crisis Core, kind of, but a different set of characters.

1121
01:12:25,557 --> 01:12:27,359
[SPEAKER_18]: This whole Tales of the World.

1122
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:32,583
[SPEAKER_18]: I wonder if that's the Tales of blank series, kind of on the PSP.

1123
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:34,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't know.

1124
01:12:34,985 --> 01:12:35,486
[SPEAKER_18]: How about Europe?

1125
01:12:36,427 --> 01:12:44,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for Europe, we have on the 8th, EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius on PC, and Explodemon on PlayStation 3.

1126
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:57,289
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 11th, we have Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and Dr. Kawashima's Body and Brain Training on Xbox 360.

1127
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:08,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have Edna and Harvey the Breakout on PC, Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, and Trinity Zil-O-Zero for PS3 by Koei.

1128
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:09,979
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1129
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1130
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we got the classic game of the week.

1131
01:13:15,441 --> 01:13:16,582
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a good one for episode 400.

1132
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:19,143
[SPEAKER_10]: People are going to be tingly in their special places.

1133
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:19,823
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope so.

1134
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on with a couple quick stories before that.

1135
01:13:22,324 --> 01:13:27,766
[SPEAKER_08]: We talked last week about how Sony announced the PlayStation suite, which will bring PlayStation 1 emulation.

1136
01:13:28,246 --> 01:13:30,887
[SPEAKER_08]: to the Android platform.

1137
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:44,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's rumors that they may be expanding the suite to cover other operating systems, including the iOS format, as well as Windows at a later date.

1138
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:49,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So it might be kind of cool to have an official PlayStation 1 emulator.

1139
01:13:49,052 --> 01:13:53,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine how that won't be cracked, but okay.

1140
01:13:53,913 --> 01:13:57,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we have plenty of emulators out there now that I think of it.

1141
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:11,219
[SPEAKER_08]: They're even saying that it's possible that other Sony products like the Sony Internet TV powered by Google might also get some support for it.

1142
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,700
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be kind of neat, I guess.

1143
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Make some really cheap PlayStation 1 players, I guess.

1144
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:23,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so they have a completely open stance to it, they say.

1145
01:14:26,704 --> 01:14:27,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty neat.

1146
01:14:28,318 --> 01:14:29,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I can totally see him doing that.

1147
01:14:33,968 --> 01:14:34,809
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1148
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:06,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Angry Birds is apparently making its way onto the 3DS.

1149
01:15:06,854 --> 01:15:07,294
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

1150
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:15,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Rovio, who makes Angry Birds, they're trying to bring Angry Birds to just about every platform that's out there, and of course that would include the 3DS.

1151
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:26,631
[SPEAKER_18]: They spoke with 3DS Focus, and they are saying that they're going to bring out their games on the 3DS as download titles later this year, including Angry Birds Rio.

1152
01:15:27,372 --> 01:15:27,912
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1153
01:15:27,972 --> 01:15:28,893
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're going to be in Rio.

1154
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Aw-inspiring 3D.

1155
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:34,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Angry Birds is also out for the PS3 and the PSP if you're curious.

1156
01:15:35,117 --> 01:15:36,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on!

1157
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:39,259
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Angry Birds, a 2D game.

1158
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that really need to be in 3D?

1159
01:15:41,941 --> 01:15:45,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you can be behind the bird while you shoot things.

1160
01:15:45,163 --> 01:15:45,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1161
01:15:46,784 --> 01:15:47,445
[SPEAKER_18]: That's dumb.

1162
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:48,905
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a little dumb.

1163
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:49,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1164
01:15:51,487 --> 01:15:57,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get into a segment we like to do on the show here where we walk into the vault...

1165
01:15:58,174 --> 01:15:58,954
[SPEAKER_18]: and pick a game.

1166
01:15:59,014 --> 01:16:00,855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the classic game of the week.

1167
01:16:01,496 --> 01:16:07,839
[SPEAKER_18]: It's DarkSakura's opportunity to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be worshipping this game.

1168
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:09,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Or at least check it out.

1169
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:10,841
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the classic game of the week.

1170
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:13,922
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another game that we should introduce by menu, Rob.

1171
01:16:14,843 --> 01:16:15,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I will try.

1172
01:16:15,383 --> 01:16:16,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Not everybody's going to recognize it, you know.

1173
01:16:16,924 --> 01:16:20,445
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but the people who do will get special brownie points.

1174
01:16:20,505 --> 01:16:20,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

1175
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:26,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's fire it up here and look at some of the music or at least some of the ambience from this game.

1176
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:37,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, memories.

1177
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Best mini music ever.

1178
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:41,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1179
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:42,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?

1180
01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:43,282
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm dying.

1181
01:16:43,362 --> 01:16:44,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Beatmania!

1182
01:16:45,242 --> 01:16:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1183
01:16:46,743 --> 01:16:49,563
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the game that started it all.

1184
01:16:50,243 --> 01:16:52,304
[SPEAKER_10]: This gave us the whole Bimani thing.

1185
01:16:52,384 --> 01:16:54,745
[SPEAKER_10]: This gave us Orange Lounge Radio.

1186
01:16:56,565 --> 01:16:58,106
[SPEAKER_10]: G. Konami, what were you thinking?

1187
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:08,614
[SPEAKER_10]: But it started off in 1997 and really got big in 98.

1188
01:17:08,975 --> 01:17:15,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember back in the day having the emulator BM-98 on my computer so I could play Beatmania stuff at home.

1189
01:17:16,522 --> 01:17:18,624
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my first Beatmania experience with BM-98.

1190
01:17:20,946 --> 01:17:32,035
[SPEAKER_10]: and from there we've had Beatmania 2DX, we've had Beatmania 3, we've had DDR, Parapara, Dance Maniacs, so many, so many.

1191
01:17:33,036 --> 01:17:35,899
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's go ahead and focus on the original Beatmania.

1192
01:17:35,959 --> 01:17:40,422
[SPEAKER_10]: You had five keys and a turntable and everybody was right side pride.

1193
01:17:41,924 --> 01:17:42,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the day.

1194
01:17:44,346 --> 01:17:52,593
[SPEAKER_10]: And so basically the little platforms would scroll down on your screen and you had to hit the corresponding button or scratch at the right time.

1195
01:17:53,054 --> 01:17:54,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a combination of buttons.

1196
01:17:55,055 --> 01:18:01,942
[SPEAKER_10]: With a very interesting kind of low quality video playing in the background that was typically just repeated scenes over and over again.

1197
01:18:02,522 --> 01:18:03,943
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the PlayStation 1 after all.

1198
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Well I'm talking about the arcade one too, shoot.

1199
01:18:06,526 --> 01:18:06,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1200
01:18:07,836 --> 01:18:11,257
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, we had... It came out on the PlayStation.

1201
01:18:11,497 --> 01:18:14,737
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the really nice controller and the dinky controller.

1202
01:18:14,777 --> 01:18:17,478
[SPEAKER_10]: And I started off with the dinky controller and then bought a nice controller.

1203
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:20,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had all kinds of versions.

1204
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:28,400
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about Beatmania's second mix in Beatmania, which was the first one that came out on the PlayStation.

1205
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,841
[SPEAKER_10]: We had practice mode, where you could practice...

1206
01:18:32,401 --> 01:18:35,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Free Mode, and Expert, Expert Plus, and Easy.

1207
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: That was actually available in third mix.

1208
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Expert Plus was offered in sixth mix.

1209
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:52,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, Boss Battle, where you would... That was just so much fun, watching the... Actually, you'd also have your tutorial mode, too, where they would tell you how to play.

1210
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:53,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania 3 had that, too.

1211
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:58,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania 3 had an effector pedal, which I don't think I played a single song on that game that actually used the pedal.

1212
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:01,098
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did also have the effector sliders, which was really neat.

1213
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:31,234
[SPEAKER_10]: and the cabinets were there was a standard cabinet and a mini cabinet the standard I'm sure is the one that most everyone's seen which is the 29 inch screen the mini cabinet had the 20 inch screen and basically I think one was space saver and the other but the mini cabinet they didn't get too many released in the US if you can find an American Beatmania that's made of the mini cabinet probably kind of worth some money I think

1214
01:19:31,994 --> 01:19:36,735
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you can go buy, you know, old Beat Mania machines for like, what, 300 bucks at Metreon?

1215
01:19:37,436 --> 01:19:37,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1216
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:57,982
[SPEAKER_10]: But I remember back in the day when we would get new Bitmoney games and would trek across California to, you know, go to Milpitas or Sunnyvale or I remember going for a DDR, for when DDR Max came out, going to San Diego and looking for one there while I was already there.

1217
01:19:58,963 --> 01:20:02,866
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, we've got also all kinds of different versions that have come out.

1218
01:20:02,906 --> 01:20:09,652
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had Beatmania, actually the US Beatmania, which is actually Beatmania 2DX.

1219
01:20:10,212 --> 01:20:20,221
[SPEAKER_10]: The 7 key with the switchable turntable had a Beatmania mode in it, which basically is just 5 key, but I'm not going to pick on that.

1220
01:20:20,801 --> 01:20:25,926
[SPEAKER_10]: There were versions for the Game Boy Color and the Wonderswan Color, which we knew somebody who had that.

1221
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:28,790
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1222
01:20:47,377 --> 01:20:49,958
[SPEAKER_10]: and Konami Ho Konami.

1223
01:20:50,678 --> 01:20:53,879
[SPEAKER_10]: They were kind of late to jump on the Beatmania bandwagon in the U.S.

1224
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:55,780
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't listen to their fans.

1225
01:20:56,260 --> 01:21:02,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a couple of them listened to their fans, but nobody listened to them for quite a while until they were like, oh, I see you're importing it.

1226
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:03,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's bring it out.

1227
01:21:03,722 --> 01:21:05,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Gee, DDR is suddenly selling over there.

1228
01:21:05,582 --> 01:21:06,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should have got on that a while ago.

1229
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:07,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1230
01:21:08,724 --> 01:21:15,109
[SPEAKER_18]: The first official Beatmania game in the US, you guys, was a port of 2DX Nights Tile.

1231
01:21:15,489 --> 01:21:15,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorta.

1232
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:19,092
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of used that interface and had a mishmash of games.

1233
01:21:19,113 --> 01:21:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we actually had Hip Hop Mania.

1234
01:21:21,535 --> 01:21:23,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, the crappy, I don't even acknowledge that in the arcades.

1235
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:25,118
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is Beatmania.

1236
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:26,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's true, it's true.

1237
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:30,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And it came out relatively early enough, and we had one of those at our VGL.

1238
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:37,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was... Let me just go back into the list of the games.

1239
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:39,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And keep in mind, I probably have most of these.

1240
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:41,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when I went hunting down a Club Mix.

1241
01:21:42,354 --> 01:21:45,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that, in my opinion, is the best.

1242
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:46,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you play Salamander Bee Crush Mix?

1243
01:21:46,676 --> 01:21:49,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can play Salamander Bee Crush Mix.

1244
01:21:49,898 --> 01:21:50,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold on.

1245
01:21:50,178 --> 01:21:51,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see which one you were playing.

1246
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:52,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you were playing Overdoser?

1247
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:53,719
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you had some video of it.

1248
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:54,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1249
01:21:56,877 --> 01:21:57,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me actually do this video.

1250
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,718
[SPEAKER_10]: The only cool part of this one is the beginning of it.

1251
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,579
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this is somebody filming their TV.

1252
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:03,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is actual... Oh, they are filming their TV.

1253
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:06,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

1254
01:22:07,901 --> 01:22:08,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there's this one, actually.

1255
01:22:08,921 --> 01:22:10,662
[SPEAKER_18]: This is an actual... There we go.

1256
01:22:10,702 --> 01:22:11,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that...

1257
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:38,679
[SPEAKER_10]: which really only at the beginning sounds like salamander music right but I mean they did have all kinds of remixes from their you know old games in that too but here's all the different versions um as far as arcade releases we had Deep Mania, Deep Mania second mix, third mix, complete mix which was Hip Hop Mania over here we got that as Hip Hop Mania

1258
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We had 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, Time To Get Down, which actually had a lot of good music.

1259
01:22:44,482 --> 01:22:45,302
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Complete Mix 2.

1260
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:46,662
[SPEAKER_10]: No, take that back.

1261
01:22:46,722 --> 01:22:47,622
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the one that we had.

1262
01:22:48,283 --> 01:22:50,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it had 321 Stars in it, remember?

1263
01:22:51,244 --> 01:22:52,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

1264
01:22:52,424 --> 01:22:57,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Club Mix, Beatmania featuring Dreams Come True, which was a little J-pop band back then.

1265
01:22:58,386 --> 01:22:59,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania Core Remix.

1266
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:02,507
[SPEAKER_10]: There was 6th Mix, UK Underground Music.

1267
01:23:02,707 --> 01:23:06,048
[SPEAKER_10]: 7th Mix, Keepin' Evolution, and Beatmania The Final.

1268
01:23:06,668 --> 01:23:22,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Korea, there was BeatStage, BeatStage 3rd Mix, BeatStage Complete Mix, BeatStage 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, How To Get Down And in North America, we had Hip Hop Maniac Complete Mix and Complete Mix 2 On the PlayStation, I'm gonna read them all It's episode 400 and I can't

1269
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:45,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania, Beatmania Append, the Ebisu Mix, which I have, Third Mix Mini, the Append Third, these are all Appends, which basically, if you had the first game, you bought the Appends and you'd swap them, which made it a pain in the ass if you were on an American system trying to get them to play and having to do the disc swaps and all this crap, which I found my way around.

1270
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,111
[SPEAKER_10]: You get a little thing that plugs into the back.

1271
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:56,439
[SPEAKER_10]: There was GoToMix, 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Best Hits, Dreams Come True, GoToMix 2, Glowing Global, which was actually pretty cool.

1272
01:23:58,521 --> 01:24:00,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Club Mix, The Sound of Tokyo, which was also fun.

1273

[SPEAKER_10]: 6th Mix, and Beatmania Europe.

1274
01:24:04,025 --> 01:24:09,529

1275
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:29,708
[SPEAKER_10]: WonderSwan, there was Beatmania for WonderSwan, there was a bajillion Baymoni pockets which I was talking about little monochrome LCD screens and they were little but the fun thing about that is there was an anime song mix that was all stuff from anime by Go Nagai which is like Cutie Honey and Mazinger Z and you know

1276
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:58,912
[SPEAKER_10]: there was a Tokimeki Memorial version because you know Konami owns Tokimeki Memorial a bunch of anime, there was a Hello Kitty mix there was Enjoy Georgia's Signature there was Tiger's version, Kawaii version which means cute but it had to do with magazine Tokimeki 2, Love Stories, Konamix Best Hits 2000 and Tiger's version 2 which was for the Hanshin Tigers baseball team baseball's a big deal and that's it

1277
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:01,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1278
01:25:14,663 --> 01:25:37,276
[SPEAKER_10]: I just remember, and this is actually literally how I got into it, is probably February of 98, on, I think we were actually on the old Pentium 2, the overclocked 60 to 120 computer Dan had, and one of my friends saying, hey, there's this game out in Japan, but we can't get it, but here's an emulator.

1279
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:39,017
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was BM98.

1280
01:25:39,037 --> 01:25:39,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1281
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:40,218
[SPEAKER_18]: And then...

1282
01:25:43,299 --> 01:25:46,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to download BM98 again.

1283
01:25:47,222 --> 01:25:49,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Your classic game of the week.

1284
01:25:50,084 --> 01:25:50,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Beatmania.

1285
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:57,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Available in the arcade or on many, many, many, many, many different home releases on the PlayStation.

1286
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:58,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, love to be.

1287
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:00,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.

1288
01:26:01,505 --> 01:26:06,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that does it for your Classic Game of the Week and it also brings Part A of the show to a close.

1289
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:07,467
[SPEAKER_18]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1290
01:26:07,867 --> 01:26:09,487
[SPEAKER_18]: In Part B tonight, we've got a lot.

1291
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:11,208
[SPEAKER_18]: It's probably going to be a very long Part B tonight.

1292
01:26:11,228 --> 01:26:13,949
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got your Twitter topics, of which there's a lot to get to tonight.

1293
01:26:14,009 --> 01:26:15,209
[SPEAKER_18]: So get your Twitter topics in.

1294
01:26:15,749 --> 01:26:19,010
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll get those and we'll get the FUs of the week, of course.

1295
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,911
[SPEAKER_18]: The Skype line as well and...

1296
01:26:21,371 --> 01:26:21,791
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

1297
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,672
[SPEAKER_18]: We figured it's episode 400.

1298
01:26:23,153 --> 01:26:24,314
[SPEAKER_18]: We got a lot of people in the house.

1299
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:26,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do a match game tonight.

1300
01:26:26,295 --> 01:26:28,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, well, our match game returns tonight.

1301
01:26:28,557 --> 01:26:32,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And we actually have a legitimate prize to give away tonight.

1302
01:26:32,701 --> 01:26:33,862
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's pretty cool.

1303
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:38,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to give that away when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1304
01:26:45,194 --> 01:26:47,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1305
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:55,997
[SPEAKER_18]: We are live on this Sunday evening, February the 6th of 2011 at allgames.com for our 400th episode of our show.

1306
01:26:56,197 --> 01:26:57,157
[SPEAKER_18]: So welcome you guys.

1307
01:26:57,697 --> 01:26:59,938
[SPEAKER_18]: And Loki is in the house.

1308
01:26:59,978 --> 01:27:01,498
[SPEAKER_18]: He's playing Gal Gun tonight.

1309
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:05,579
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's been playing it pretty much during the entire show and he's not ranting about something Nintendo.

1310
01:27:05,939 --> 01:27:07,800
[SPEAKER_18]: So Loki, what do you think so far?

1311
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Like right now he's in like a music room or something.

1312
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, shooting girls with love.

1313
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:11,841
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a weird game.

1314
01:27:11,881 --> 01:27:12,241
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1315
01:27:12,481 --> 01:27:13,341
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really know what's good.

1316
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:23,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know what's going on, but I know that they have this focus mode where you're doing something to parts of girls, and then they orgasm, and it causes the other girls to orgasm, or whatever.

1317
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:24,667
[SPEAKER_08]: They faint with love.

1318
01:27:25,227 --> 01:27:26,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an orgasm, okay?

1319
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:27,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot.

1320
01:27:27,828 --> 01:27:29,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Infectious orgasm game.

1321
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:30,610
[SPEAKER_08]: It's strange.

1322
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Fun!

1323
01:27:32,651 --> 01:27:37,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can see why they got rid of the panty shots, though, because it would have been porn, pretty much.

1324
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:41,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, we were talking earlier about one-handed games.

1325
01:27:41,135 --> 01:27:42,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you think Galgun could be a one-handed game?

1326
01:27:42,796 --> 01:27:42,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh...

1327
01:27:45,461 --> 01:27:49,120
[SPEAKER_08]: with a special controller, maybe I mean, because you'd have to

1328
01:27:51,327 --> 01:27:57,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard because you have to aim with the left analog stick and then you have to shoot with the A button.

1329
01:27:57,170 --> 01:28:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, if it had an auto-fire, then yeah, because then you could just... Auto-fire maybe, and they have a zoom.

1330
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:15,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You could probably do it with some sort of special remappable nunchuck type controller or something where you have a shoot button as a trigger and maybe you could do a one-handed then, but no, it's not a one-handed game.

1331
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:21,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well... I love this new video capture card thing, it's awesome.

1332
01:28:21,534 --> 01:28:28,158
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna get into some rapid fire news here in just a little bit, but first we'd like to do little plugs for our side projects, of which we have a couple of them.

1333
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:31,740
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura does a comic book podcast every week with her pals.

1334
01:28:32,113 --> 01:28:32,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Comic Insanity

1335
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:54,042
[SPEAKER_18]: When do we get an OLR app for Android?

1336
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:56,284
[SPEAKER_10]: When someone makes it for us.

1337
01:28:57,144 --> 01:28:58,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't know how to do that crap.

1338
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:01,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't either, but you got it for Comic Insanity.

1339
01:29:01,367 --> 01:29:02,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't do it.

1340
01:29:02,428 --> 01:29:04,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we need to talk to your peoples.

1341
01:29:05,349 --> 01:29:07,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have my people contact us people.

1342
01:29:07,611 --> 01:29:08,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, would chatters like that?

1343
01:29:08,852 --> 01:29:10,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, what would we do on an iPhone or Android?

1344
01:29:10,893 --> 01:29:15,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter and Facebook connection and links to the forums.

1345
01:29:15,396 --> 01:29:18,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe like exclusive content, like topless pictures of Shermie?

1346
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy's always topless.

1347
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:22,124
[SPEAKER_10]: She's such a whore.

1348
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:23,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not really.

1349
01:29:24,127 --> 01:29:26,290
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't know, by the way, Shermie is, of course, DarkSakura's cat.

1350
01:29:26,831 --> 01:29:27,953
[SPEAKER_18]: She's very fat and sassy.

1351
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:29,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I got her to play this morning.

1352
01:29:30,837 --> 01:29:31,839
[SPEAKER_18]: You got her to play what, WoW?

1353
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:34,763
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I dangled a string, and she's like, bat.

1354
01:29:35,623 --> 01:29:36,303
[SPEAKER_10]: That was fun.

1355
01:29:36,963 --> 01:29:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1356
01:29:37,844 --> 01:29:47,366
[SPEAKER_03]: My cats used to lose their mind over the laser pointer, and now the best that they'll do is if you wiggle the laser dot, they'll do the, with their arms, they're like, I'm gonna reach for it, but that's it.

1357
01:29:47,386 --> 01:29:48,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not chasing that shit anymore.

1358
01:29:48,907 --> 01:29:49,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too old.

1359
01:29:50,147 --> 01:29:51,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So, bat, bat.

1360
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:53,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I tell you about when I got Shermie one of those?

1361
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:54,929
[SPEAKER_03]: She hated what she did.

1362
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:57,931
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she looked at the little dot and then she looked right up at the pointer.

1363
01:29:58,731 --> 01:30:01,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Realized how it worked and didn't try anymore.

1364
01:30:04,695 --> 01:30:05,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Shermie just don't care.

1365
01:30:06,536 --> 01:30:07,937
[SPEAKER_10]: She's smart when she's trying to be lazy.

1366
01:30:08,702 --> 01:30:37,411
[SPEAKER_18]: another spinoff show if you're a fan of World of Warcraft or even if you're not and you like really obscene chat join me and my pal Extifer for the best little horde house in Azeroth or horde house for short we're too poor for a website but you can find us on iTunes or whatever podcast engine you use just look for horde house H-O-R-D-E H-O-U-S-E by the way speaking of World of Warcraft I understand a lot of my guildies are listening at least that's what X-Link just told me so hi guild Grats on level 9

1367
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:39,512
[SPEAKER_18]: Why aren't you in chat?

1368
01:30:39,652 --> 01:30:40,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Beijing, level 9.

1369
01:30:41,913 --> 01:30:42,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Slash's Pop just perked up.

1370
01:30:42,994 --> 01:30:43,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Whoa, hey.

1371
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:44,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow News.

1372
01:30:44,895 --> 01:30:45,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, they just hit level 9.

1373
01:30:46,236 --> 01:30:49,178
[SPEAKER_18]: We were really close, and everybody's doing their alts right now, it looks like.

1374
01:30:49,258 --> 01:30:51,579
[SPEAKER_18]: So you get lots of guild leveling from that.

1375
01:30:52,199 --> 01:31:03,026
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, but we'll save the rest of the WoW chatter for the best little horde house in Azeroth, which usually releases Thursdays-ish, depending on our taping schedule, which is really erratic.

1376
01:31:03,366 --> 01:31:06,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I will say this, Extover told me he loved the live show.

1377
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:09,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Loved the live show and kind of wants to do it again.

1378
01:31:09,192 --> 01:31:11,654
[SPEAKER_18]: So you never know what might happen.

1379
01:31:11,814 --> 01:31:14,757
[SPEAKER_18]: We might have to storm the OLR studios more than once a week.

1380
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,510
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1381
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:27,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow, let's move on to some rapid fire news and lots and lots of news that we just don't have time to talk a whole long time about because, you know, we've got to fit in Nintendo rants for Loki.

1382
01:31:27,141 --> 01:31:27,842
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki.

1383
01:31:29,043 --> 01:31:31,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Armored Core 5 was announced and it's kind of cool.

1384
01:31:32,226 --> 01:31:33,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's been announced for a while.

1385
01:31:34,048 --> 01:31:38,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But they announced that it's going to have team-based online multiplayer, which is pretty cool.

1386
01:31:38,692 --> 01:31:40,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It's expected to come out over here.

1387
01:31:41,874 --> 01:31:49,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're saying it's 2012 in North America and Europe and late 2011 in Japan.

1388
01:31:49,898 --> 01:31:51,218
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game looks pretty awesome.

1389
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:58,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of reminds me a little bit of the Crossing Chromehounds with the Armor Core 4, which is pretty cool.

1390
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:11,140
[SPEAKER_18]: Chromhounds had that cultish following to it, but unfortunately not a strong enough following to necessitate a second game, right?

1391
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:11,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1392
01:32:13,201 --> 01:32:18,783
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of like their version of a North American armored core.

1393
01:32:18,963 --> 01:32:19,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stick with armored core.

1394
01:32:20,184 --> 01:32:22,305
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem with Chromhounds was that it was slow.

1395
01:32:24,008 --> 01:32:44,679
[SPEAKER_08]: slow mechs, slow everything whereas Armored Corps is just kind of fast and fast paced, lots of missiles and yeah so that'll be kind of cool and expect that next year I guess Namco announced that yes, guess what, we're going to do another Ridge Racer this current generation not going to wait for another console to come out Ridge Racer!

1396
01:32:45,339 --> 01:32:51,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer Unbounded and that's going to be on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC in 2012

1397
01:32:53,303 --> 01:32:55,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The game had a little teaser trailer for it.

1398
01:32:55,945 --> 01:33:01,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, no actual gameplay, but it basically kind of resembles Burnout.

1399
01:33:01,768 --> 01:33:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's actually being developed by Bugbear Entertainment, who of course put out the game flat out.

1400
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:12,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So they kind of know something about destructible racing games.

1401
01:33:12,815 --> 01:33:15,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

1402
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Burnout.

1403
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Race is kind of cool.

1404
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer drifting with Burnout.

1405
01:33:21,758 --> 01:33:26,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Which of course, what story about Ridge Racer would be incomplete without It's Ridge Racer!

1406
01:33:28,145 --> 01:33:29,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Ridge Racer!

1407
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:46,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is not too unexpected, but Project Dark, which was a working title for, of course, this new game, Dark Souls, was announced in the latest Famitsu magazine.

1408
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:53,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically going to be kind of a successor to Demon's Souls, but not in a way.

1409
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,677
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually saying that they're making the game harder.

1410
01:33:58,837 --> 01:34:02,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, I guess...

1411
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:07,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Similar, it's going to be similar in style, but not necessarily a sequel to Demon's Souls.

1412
01:34:08,322 --> 01:34:14,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And players will be able to create their own characters, though they're no longer, I guess, different job classes.

1413
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:17,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess just tweaks to the world design as well.

1414
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:21,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The world is no longer divided into levels, instead it's being one large area.

1415
01:34:22,251 --> 01:34:24,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's going to be cooperative and competitive play as well.

1416
01:34:24,853 --> 01:34:26,114
[SPEAKER_18]: Will it be as fucking hard?

1417
01:34:26,174 --> 01:34:26,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Because oh my god.

1418
01:34:26,714 --> 01:34:27,435
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be harder.

1419
01:34:27,855 --> 01:34:28,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god.

1420
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:28,756
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh god.

1421
01:34:31,212 --> 01:34:32,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, Demon's Souls is awesome.

1422
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:36,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Couldn't tell you much about it, though, because I keep getting killed.

1423
01:34:37,233 --> 01:34:37,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Horrifically.

1424
01:34:38,774 --> 01:34:39,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Over and over again.

1425
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a forgiving game.

1426
01:34:43,696 --> 01:34:44,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1427
01:34:44,276 --> 01:34:47,297
[SPEAKER_08]: What other cool tidbits did they have about it?

1428
01:34:48,418 --> 01:34:59,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they said that the online system will be returning and it's been highly enhanced to allow users to share experience and they said grow together in the world.

1429
01:35:00,402 --> 01:35:05,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm sure that means going to other people's games and trying to kill the other people like you could in the original.

1430
01:35:08,426 --> 01:35:09,527
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my birthday.

1431
01:35:30,325 --> 01:35:31,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, that's right, it is.

1432
01:35:31,545 --> 01:35:35,046
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're getting an awesome game as a present for your birthday from Squeenix.

1433
01:35:35,967 --> 01:35:37,067
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to retail for $30.

1434
01:35:37,507 --> 01:35:45,349
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, if you haven't heard, this is the original Final Fantasy 4 and the After Years, which came out originally on mobile gaming over in Japan and later on the Wii.

1435
01:35:45,729 --> 01:35:49,970
[SPEAKER_18]: I played about, I don't know, half of it on the Wii, but there was a lot of download episodes you had to do.

1436
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:51,371
[SPEAKER_18]: And I beat like two of them.

1437
01:35:51,691 --> 01:35:55,252
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, it'll be nice to have the entire collection on the PSP.

1438
01:35:55,732 --> 01:36:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: this story almost makes me a little sad because I have Final Fantasy 4 for the DS the 3D one that they did played the first hour of it gorgeous love it my favorite Final Fantasy and now it's like I feel that I shouldn't play that and finish that because this is coming out

1439
01:36:11,172 --> 01:36:13,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the art design is totally different.

1440
01:36:13,174 --> 01:36:23,502
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I really liked the 3D Final Fantasies, which is weird because I'm usually not into the 3D stuff, but I love the art style on the PSP ones.

1441
01:36:23,963 --> 01:36:30,588
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just so sharp, and they've just retouched those sprites, and this is the same look that they gave Final Fantasy 1 and 2.

1442
01:36:31,228 --> 01:36:34,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And apparently there's supposed to be new effects with the magic and everything, and there's some...

1443
01:36:35,872 --> 01:36:49,378
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's supposed to be rapid fire news, but let me see if I can do a quick, quick, quick shot of the trailer here, which was available somewhere.

1444
01:36:49,398 --> 01:36:51,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see if I can find it.

1445
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:55,181
[SPEAKER_18]: I might have to search YouTube for it, so maybe I'll show you later.

1446
01:36:55,221 --> 01:36:56,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Remind me after the show.

1447
01:36:56,482 --> 01:36:59,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's move on though with other releases.

1448
01:36:59,406 --> 01:37:02,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad.

1449
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:05,133
[SPEAKER_18]: New school Tapper, not the old school Tapper.

1450
01:37:05,514 --> 01:37:08,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, that's right, it's a brand new Tapper game that's going to be coming out

1451
01:37:08,878 --> 01:37:09,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Root Beer Tapper

1452
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:25,520
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.com

1453
01:37:52,478 --> 01:37:54,639
[SPEAKER_18]: But when I heard about this, I was like, oh, yeah, another.

1454
01:37:54,919 --> 01:37:57,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, this would be like Yara's Revenge turning into a first-person shooter.

1455
01:37:57,359 --> 01:37:57,859
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be great.

1456
01:37:58,139 --> 01:38:02,201
[SPEAKER_18]: But then I heard, like, Don Bluth doing all the art, and I'm like, oh, now it just went, like, 80s awesome again.

1457
01:38:02,501 --> 01:38:06,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to bring it back to Don Bluth, he did The Secret of NIMH movie.

1458
01:38:07,222 --> 01:38:08,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And Xanadu.

1459
01:38:09,042 --> 01:38:09,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1460
01:38:09,762 --> 01:38:13,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And All Dogs Go to Heaven, and I want to say Ferngully.

1461
01:38:13,543 --> 01:38:14,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that him or no?

1462
01:38:14,484 --> 01:38:15,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I think...

1463
01:38:16,843 --> 01:38:17,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps?

1464
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:18,384
[SPEAKER_18]: IDK.

1465
01:38:18,524 --> 01:38:19,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that guy.

1466
01:38:19,364 --> 01:38:19,804
[SPEAKER_18]: He's awesome.

1467
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:23,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on to a story about Castlevania.

1468
01:38:23,826 --> 01:38:28,928
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Castlevania Harmony of Despair is one of those games that's available on Xbox Live Arcade.

1469
01:38:29,288 --> 01:38:34,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, there is a new stage that's available for 240 Microsoft points.

1470
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:37,472
[SPEAKER_18]: It's based on an original Famicom

1471
01:38:38,072 --> 01:39:04,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Konami title, Getsu Fuma Den so there you go, 160 points if you want to actually play as the character Getsu Fuma it has 8-bit graphics though and I guess it's kind of old school sorry I didn't mean to do the loud but this is kind of what it looks like here in the game kind of neat those almost look like little Metroids that you're fighting there so there you go

1472
01:39:07,799 --> 01:39:09,542
[SPEAKER_18]: That's coming out soon.

1473
01:39:11,305 --> 01:39:11,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

1474
01:39:12,607 --> 01:39:14,049
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura has some quick stories for us.

1475
01:39:14,069 --> 01:39:16,373
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the Twitter topics is twitter.com slash OLR.

1476
01:39:17,319 --> 01:39:20,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we talked about Pac-Man in Part A. Ms.

1477
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:29,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man is going to be coming out for iPad, and then there will be a free Valentine's Day update for Pac-Man on the iPhone.

1478
01:39:31,046 --> 01:39:36,249
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more Namco love in the form of Pac-Man, so that's cute.

1479
01:39:37,289 --> 01:39:42,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, this makes me happy, Puyo Puyo will be on Virtual Console in Japan, and it will have online multiplayer.

1480
01:39:43,552 --> 01:39:46,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess Nintendo's sort of getting it, but not really.

1481
01:39:48,075 --> 01:39:50,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Virtual Console and Online Multiplayer

1482
01:40:03,113 --> 01:40:04,775
[SPEAKER_10]: You could play two people.

1483
01:40:05,155 --> 01:40:07,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It was on the Sega Genesis, right?

1484
01:40:07,298 --> 01:40:12,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but Nintendo never adds anything to their games, so it must have been on the original.

1485
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:15,970
[SPEAKER_08]: They must have foreseen the internet long ago.

1486
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,135
[SPEAKER_10]: There were four-player versions, though, that came out on Nintendo 64 and Saturn.

1487
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:27,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad a landmark game such as Puyo Puyo... Yeah, it's like, Puyo Puyo is amazing, but of all the games, I don't understand.

1488
01:40:28,743 --> 01:40:30,063
[SPEAKER_03]: But they like to keep us confused.

1489
01:40:30,143 --> 01:40:40,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe they're waiting to see how this does, and then they're going to go back and do everything else and re-release it for eight more dollars with online multiplayer and all that shit that we should have had the first time.

1490
01:40:41,806 --> 01:40:42,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, DarkSakura?

1491
01:40:43,206 --> 01:40:43,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1492
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:45,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's such a fun game.

1493
01:40:45,527 --> 01:40:46,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Such a fun game.

1494
01:40:46,868 --> 01:40:50,289
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, we have a little bit of something else.

1495
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:52,550
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Back to the Future on PS3.

1496
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:53,470
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a date.

1497
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:57,551
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be February 15th on the US PlayStation Network.

1498
01:40:58,292 --> 01:41:03,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be $20, $19.99, and you get all five episodes on launch day.

1499
01:41:04,354 --> 01:41:05,894
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest are going to be staggered, of course.

1500
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:07,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty cool.

1501
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Good voice acting.

1502
01:41:09,215 --> 01:41:10,656
[SPEAKER_10]: That dude sounds really dead on.

1503
01:41:11,657 --> 01:41:12,197
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I hear.

1504
01:41:12,217 --> 01:41:14,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched an interview with him not too long ago.

1505
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:15,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty cool.

1506
01:41:15,419 --> 01:41:15,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1507
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:16,540
Yeah.

1508
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,021
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1509
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:18,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to the tweets.

1510
01:41:20,043 --> 01:41:22,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

1511
01:41:22,545 --> 01:41:23,986
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're not following us, why not?

1512
01:41:25,171 --> 01:41:25,411
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1513
01:41:25,972 --> 01:41:37,179
[SPEAKER_18]: We asked some questions earlier this week, kind of, you know, since we're coming up on our 400th episode, and, you know, lots of people are saying, yay, Gratz on 400, because I don't know what other video game podcasts that are weekly have gotten as high as 400.

1514
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:38,180
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure.

1515
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:39,661
[SPEAKER_18]: If they're out there, I don't know of them.

1516
01:41:39,681 --> 01:41:40,401
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have to tell me.

1517
01:41:41,182 --> 01:41:45,184
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, we're excited, and we have no plans to quit anytime soon, so who knows?

1518
01:41:45,224 --> 01:41:45,865
[SPEAKER_18]: We might just make 500.

1519
01:41:46,645 --> 01:41:46,986
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1520
01:41:47,366 --> 01:41:51,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow, we were asking folks, what was your favorite moment of the past 400 episodes?

1521
01:41:51,188 --> 01:41:52,749
[SPEAKER_18]: We asked that question on Twitter earlier this week.

1522
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:54,791
[SPEAKER_18]: The Seg said, when I was on the show.

1523
01:41:55,691 --> 01:42:22,508
[SPEAKER_18]: of course, Deekman said Rob coming out to the OLR to go fans, I don't even remember that actually, I mean it had to happen at some point but I don't know, I was just kind of always the gay one, Rob boycotting the Xbox, I think that's when I got really mad at my Xbox, red ringing of death like three days after I bought it and then I think it red ringed again, I was really mad Loki's Mac rant that's like every week E3 2006 I think it was, my first show, sorry no dates

1524
01:42:23,468 --> 01:42:25,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Alpha Cananagram says, one of them wasn't to go.

1525
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:26,710
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Pizza Man.

1526
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:27,811
[SPEAKER_18]: Do-do-do-do-do.

1527
01:42:28,131 --> 01:42:28,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember that?

1528
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:29,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Good times.

1529
01:42:29,572 --> 01:42:30,873
[SPEAKER_18]: That was one of the older shows.

1530
01:42:31,574 --> 01:42:34,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Tetsuya says, Karaoke Revolution, 69 and 120.

1531
01:42:35,056 --> 01:42:36,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the episodes number that's happening.

1532
01:42:37,397 --> 01:42:41,960
[SPEAKER_18]: The April Fool's Day pre-show 2007 with the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show.

1533
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:42,561
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember that one?

1534
01:42:43,201 --> 01:42:46,363
[SPEAKER_18]: And the death of the soundboard table in episode 307.

1535
01:42:46,423 --> 01:42:49,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember when intern Drew knocked the whole damn table over?

1536
01:42:50,426 --> 01:42:50,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1537
01:42:50,906 --> 01:42:51,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I remember that too.

1538
01:42:51,967 --> 01:42:52,588
[SPEAKER_18]: That was awesome.

1539
01:42:53,688 --> 01:43:19,204
[SPEAKER_18]: they've still never found his body then we asked what should happen in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio you know what should happen in the next 400 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio ZakuPilot256 said dance party come on that happens every week it's just after we've gone off the air KidmanProject says the inauguration of President Cat Blade3 says I want to see Rob get married and Jamie and Dan have a little demon baby that plays video games at age 1.5

1540
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:21,992
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll happen.

1541
01:43:22,412 --> 01:43:24,393
[SPEAKER_18]: A demon baby will happen.

1542
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:29,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Actdeft says, what I hope happens is that you get to 1,000 episodes.

1543
01:43:30,398 --> 01:43:32,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Congrats for making it this far and here's for 600 more.

1544
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:44,929
[SPEAKER_18]: But at 1,000, guys, it's seriously over because by the time we get to 1,000 episodes, let's see, if it took us almost 10 years to get to 400, we'll be getting close to like 45 by the time 1,000 comes out.

1545
01:43:45,009 --> 01:43:45,629
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, close to 50.

1546
01:43:46,130 --> 01:43:46,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1547
01:43:47,952 --> 01:43:52,076
[SPEAKER_18]: The holodeck ought to be out by then and then there's really no more need for OLR.

1548
01:43:54,918 --> 01:43:56,780
[SPEAKER_18]: The OLR will cease to exist.

1549
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,041
[SPEAKER_18]: We won't be able to drag Rob out of the holodeck.

1550
01:43:59,062 --> 01:43:59,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1551
01:44:00,162 --> 01:44:01,964
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be playing one-hand games in the holodeck.

1552
01:44:04,997 --> 01:44:07,099
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you want to see in the next 400 episodes of OLR?

1553
01:44:07,179 --> 01:44:10,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Alpha Cananigram says some on-air smack talk from Loki's kid.

1554
01:44:11,563 --> 01:44:12,063
[SPEAKER_18]: It could happen.

1555
01:44:12,103 --> 01:44:15,106
[SPEAKER_18]: If we go another 10 years, the kid could come in here and say something.

1556
01:44:15,706 --> 01:44:16,087
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1557
01:44:16,887 --> 01:44:17,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1558
01:44:18,228 --> 01:44:19,930
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTetsuya says three words.

1559
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:21,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki as Tingle.

1560
01:44:22,532 --> 01:44:25,193
[SPEAKER_18]: or at very least the return of Rob's Mr. Spanky.

1561
01:44:26,033 --> 01:44:28,734
[SPEAKER_18]: See, people wouldn't understand the Mr. Spanky joke anymore.

1562
01:44:29,774 --> 01:44:34,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Spanky was really funny when he was a character in DDR.

1563
01:44:35,096 --> 01:44:36,176
[SPEAKER_18]: But now it doesn't make sense.

1564
01:44:36,356 --> 01:44:37,437
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the pictures anymore.

1565
01:44:37,497 --> 01:44:40,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there needs to be a sock puppet to accompany that.

1566
01:44:40,458 --> 01:44:41,218
[SPEAKER_18]: There kind of was.

1567
01:44:42,018 --> 01:44:46,220
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to understand, DDR on the PC had downloadable characters.

1568
01:44:46,260 --> 01:44:47,280
[SPEAKER_18]: It was kind of this neat thing.

1569
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:53,362
[SPEAKER_18]: and one of the characters was like this full-on bondage guy in outfits named Mr. Spanky.

1570
01:44:53,882 --> 01:44:55,663
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I used to do an impersonation of Mr. Spanky on the show.

1571
01:44:55,683 --> 01:44:57,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Voldo, basically, sounds like.

1572
01:44:57,284 --> 01:44:57,644
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that?

1573
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he was dressed like Voldo.

1574
01:45:00,225 --> 01:45:01,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, kind of.

1575
01:45:01,485 --> 01:45:05,967
[SPEAKER_18]: But he was like Folsom Street Fair, big, burly, like, bear guy.

1576
01:45:06,047 --> 01:45:07,148
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know.

1577
01:45:07,188 --> 01:45:09,688
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like half Mexican wrestler, half pornography.

1578
01:45:09,728 --> 01:45:10,429
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what to tell you.

1579
01:45:11,369 --> 01:45:15,792
[SPEAKER_18]: RedTheHaze says, next 400 episodes?

1580
01:45:16,293 --> 01:45:23,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone gets into a coma, Evil Twin steps in and steals the show, Robs then steps out of the shower, and it was all a dream.

1581
01:45:25,659 --> 01:45:28,321
[SPEAKER_18]: It was all just a dream, just a horrible, horrible dream.

1582
01:45:30,863 --> 01:45:37,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, that tweet though makes me think that maybe I should give you guys a preview of the new theme song of OLR.

1583
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:41,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me load it here.

1584
01:45:41,509 --> 01:45:42,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me see if I can get it.

1585
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:43,550
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

1586
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:45,611
[SPEAKER_18]: So the new theme song for OLR.

1587
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:46,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Here you go.

1588
01:45:52,834 --> 01:45:53,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Get it?

1589
01:45:53,114 --> 01:45:54,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it was all a dream?

1590
01:45:54,595 --> 01:45:55,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Get it, anyone?

1591
01:45:56,876 --> 01:45:57,356
[SPEAKER_18]: We're old.

1592
01:45:57,756 --> 01:45:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that you were going to just put on the Daytona song.

1593
01:45:59,657 --> 01:46:01,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember who shot JR?

1594
01:46:04,939 --> 01:46:06,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, do you remember who shot JR?

1595
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:08,801
[SPEAKER_18]: His sister.

1596
01:46:08,921 --> 01:46:09,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1597
01:46:10,811 --> 01:46:11,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's his sister?

1598
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:12,692
[SPEAKER_18]: And who killed Laura Palmer?

1599
01:46:13,613 --> 01:46:13,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1600
01:46:13,893 --> 01:46:14,574
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't watch Twin Peaks.

1601
01:46:14,714 --> 01:46:16,955
[SPEAKER_18]: It was her dad possessed by Bob.

1602
01:46:17,195 --> 01:46:17,495
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1603
01:46:18,236 --> 01:46:19,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I just totally ruined Twin Peaks for all of you.

1604
01:46:19,997 --> 01:46:20,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, no, it's a great show.

1605
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew that going into watching Twin Peaks.

1606
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,741
[SPEAKER_18]: And by the way, both those shows, like 10, 20 years old.

1607
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:28,343
[SPEAKER_18]: No, like Twin Peaks is like fucking 20 years old at this point.

1608
01:46:28,383 --> 01:46:31,125
[SPEAKER_18]: So like if you didn't already know, like I'm not going to save you from spoilers.

1609
01:46:31,725 --> 01:46:32,445
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1610
01:46:32,746 --> 01:46:33,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

1611
01:46:35,147 --> 01:46:35,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1612
01:46:35,608 --> 01:46:36,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to some tweets.

1613
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:38,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, back to the Twitter music.

1614
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:40,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Some like tweets for topics tonight.

1615
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:47,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Hatch71 tweeted us and says, Can't wait to hear the discussion on Sony's continued persecution of the hacking community.

1616
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:49,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the way he phrased that there.

1617
01:46:50,098 --> 01:46:51,299
[SPEAKER_18]: The persecution.

1618
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:53,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it gets worse, actually.

1619
01:46:53,701 --> 01:46:53,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

1620
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:55,222
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have a story on it coming up later?

1621
01:46:55,722 --> 01:46:56,803
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I have one.

1622
01:46:56,823 --> 01:46:58,164
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to sum it up for us?

1623
01:46:58,564 --> 01:47:01,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they are actually now trying to go after everybody.

1624
01:47:02,647 --> 01:47:03,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally.

1625
01:47:04,348 --> 01:47:06,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

1626
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:08,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Find the exact one here.

1627
01:47:09,472 --> 01:47:10,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony is looking for you.

1628
01:47:10,373 --> 01:47:16,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It says apparently over at the website, PSX Scene, the latest court documents, because they've been putting up all the court documents, kind of like WikiLeaks.

1629
01:47:17,678 --> 01:47:18,898
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pretty much going after everyone.

1630
01:47:18,918 --> 01:47:35,950
[SPEAKER_08]: They're planning to subpoena several sites, including PSX Scene, YouTube, Twitter, PayPal, and Slashdot, in order to attempt to locate the whereabouts of Team Failoverflow and other hackers like Kakaroto, Wanekoko, and Graf Chocolo, Hermes, and Camus.

1631
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:39,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are a lot of the guys behind some of the custom firmwares and stuff.

1632
01:47:40,273 --> 01:47:49,518
[SPEAKER_08]: They can go after them all they want, but the thing is, a lot of these guys aren't even from the US, and the DMCA does not apply to them.

1633
01:47:52,480 --> 01:48:03,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of all that stuff, too, if this court case comes out where this guy finds it okay to be able to jailbreak PS3s or whatever, then this isn't going to matter anyway.

1634
01:48:03,908 --> 01:48:05,089
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1635
01:48:25,635 --> 01:48:27,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't mean to download the Kesha.

1636
01:48:27,636 --> 01:48:30,357
[SPEAKER_18]: It just infected my computer.

1637
01:48:30,777 --> 01:48:40,241
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I slept with someone and suddenly I got a Kesha infection.

1638
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:41,181
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like a disease.

1639
01:48:42,041 --> 01:48:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1640
01:48:43,842 --> 01:48:46,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I caught Kesha.

1641
01:48:46,423 --> 01:48:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's something better.

1642
01:48:47,763 --> 01:48:51,325
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to follow up with that Sony is hunting everybody down.

1643
01:48:53,394 --> 01:48:55,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Linux has been brought back to firmware 3.41.

1644
01:48:56,317 --> 01:48:59,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing public yet, but they've brought it back.

1645
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:05,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And not only is it brought back, but now it has full access to all the resources of the PlayStation 3.

1646
01:49:05,886 --> 01:49:09,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's Linux better, I guess.

1647
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:11,071
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Super Linux!

1648
01:49:11,612 --> 01:49:12,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Linux evolved.

1649
01:49:12,633 --> 01:49:13,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Linux evolved.

1650
01:49:14,595 --> 01:49:15,355
[SPEAKER_18]: It knows!

1651
01:49:19,482 --> 01:49:22,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Big thanks to all the people that are tweeting about our 400th episode.

1652
01:49:22,265 --> 01:49:22,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Really appreciate it.

1653
01:49:22,926 --> 01:49:26,529
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of you guys on Twitter that are like, yay, 400, episode 400, and so forth.

1654
01:49:26,829 --> 01:49:30,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love all the pictures that they have of a giant enemy crab.

1655
01:49:31,293 --> 01:49:31,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1656
01:49:32,414 --> 01:49:33,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for the Sony stories.

1657
01:49:33,675 --> 01:49:34,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what?

1658
01:49:34,356 --> 01:49:36,298
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get any giant enemy crabs on Twitter.

1659
01:49:36,638 --> 01:49:36,818
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1660
01:49:37,879 --> 01:49:40,882
[SPEAKER_18]: MadCatz is making a replacement fight stick panel for Mortal Kombat

1661
01:49:53,334 --> 01:49:55,696
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a tweet from our pal TigerClaw who always promotes our show.

1662
01:49:55,716 --> 01:49:56,296
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate him.

1663
01:49:56,917 --> 01:50:05,784
[SPEAKER_18]: He says, or I'm sorry, this story says that there is a Mortal Kombat Tournament Edition arcade stick, but I guess it has kind of like a unique layout to it.

1664
01:50:06,244 --> 01:50:14,491
[SPEAKER_18]: So MadCatz came out and says there's going to be a replacement panel for the current Tournament Edition fight sticks that will let you have the arcade perfect controls.

1665
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:15,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's the deal.

1666
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:19,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, like Street Fighter has like six buttons, but Mortal Kombat has like...

1667
01:50:19,815 --> 01:50:23,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it also has six if you count the run button, but they're in like a different arrangement.

1668
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:23,721
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like an X.

1669
01:50:24,968 --> 01:50:26,069
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all pump-it-up style.

1670
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:27,850
[SPEAKER_18]: High-low punch, high-low kick.

1671
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:28,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1672
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,271
[SPEAKER_18]: And block is in the middle.

1673
01:50:29,311 --> 01:50:32,993
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of makes an X. And then run is kind of like awkwardly off to the side.

1674
01:50:33,533 --> 01:50:34,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So there you go.

1675
01:50:34,954 --> 01:50:35,534
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's kind of cool.

1676
01:50:35,554 --> 01:50:36,635
[SPEAKER_18]: They're making a new overlay for that.

1677
01:50:36,655 --> 01:50:37,555
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of awesome, actually.

1678
01:50:38,416 --> 01:50:38,656
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1679
01:50:39,116 --> 01:50:44,479
[SPEAKER_18]: And Sterlok is sending us a tweet about what we can do in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

1680
01:50:44,859 --> 01:50:46,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Just keep doing what you're doing.

1681
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,841
[SPEAKER_18]: The show just keeps getting better and better.

1682
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:51,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's to another 400 episodes of awesome.

1683
01:50:52,343 --> 01:50:53,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you guys are awesome.

1684
01:50:54,996 --> 01:50:58,477
[SPEAKER_18]: SJ100Matt says, we need t-shirts within the next 400 episodes.

1685
01:50:58,537 --> 01:50:59,318
[SPEAKER_18]: We probably do.

1686
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:06,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, except I have to point this out.

1687
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:10,122
[SPEAKER_18]: SalaciousPop, you know how I told you the guildies were listening to tonight's show?

1688
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:15,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I just got a text there from one of our guildies there, Spike.

1689
01:51:16,004 --> 01:51:17,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Raging at Kesha hate.

1690
01:51:22,401 --> 01:51:25,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, by the way, have you seen that toy that they sell in Targets?

1691
01:51:25,163 --> 01:51:29,785
[SPEAKER_18]: This little, uh, dancing little, uh, like a Valentine's Day doll that you can give somebody?

1692
01:51:30,105 --> 01:51:38,050
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of which... Almost sounds like the real thing.

1693
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:40,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

1694
01:51:41,271 --> 01:51:42,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, moving on.

1695
01:51:43,288 --> 01:51:44,609
[SPEAKER_18]: How about some actual gaming news?

1696
01:51:44,649 --> 01:51:45,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Back to more video games.

1697
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:13,503
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember back Final Fight Double Impact where there was kind of this unannounced DRM in place.

1698
01:52:13,883 --> 01:52:18,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you had to be connected to the internet in order to play the game.

1699
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:23,166
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you downloaded it and say you want to play it offline or if your internet cut out...

1700
01:52:24,466 --> 01:52:25,087
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks.

1701
01:52:25,147 --> 01:52:28,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Capcom apologized for it and stuff.

1702
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,872
[SPEAKER_08]: But really what they were apologizing for is that they didn't tell you about it up front.

1703
01:52:31,932 --> 01:52:35,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Bionic Commander 2 Rearmed has the same DRM in place.

1704
01:52:35,355 --> 01:52:38,017
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to be connected to the internet in order to play this game.

1705
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:42,641
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done that because they don't want people sharing the game.

1706
01:52:42,861 --> 01:52:48,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there is a way you can share the game up to five times by recovering your accounts and stuff like that.

1707
01:52:49,646 --> 01:53:18,972
[SPEAKER_08]: and um so people buy a copy and then they share it with you know four other friends and stuff um and so now they have a note on the game listing it says note you must log into the PlayStation Network each time you play the game uh it says while Final Fight Double Impact um I guess they had like a online co-op mode Rearmed does not have an online co-op mode or an online mode at all it's an offline game so it's just kind of a dick move if you ask me

1708
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:23,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, distributing their game is also a dick move.

1709
01:53:23,074 --> 01:53:24,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know what, though?

1710
01:53:24,174 --> 01:53:26,575
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is, this is pissing a lot of people off.

1711
01:53:28,636 --> 01:53:36,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people may not care about it and will purchase the game, but some people actually are just not purchasing the game regardless of they didn't even care about sharing the game.

1712
01:53:36,979 --> 01:53:38,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Does the Xbox One have the same requirement?

1713
01:53:38,699 --> 01:53:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they do.

1714
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:40,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1715
01:53:40,700 --> 01:53:42,200
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I could see where people would be mad.

1716
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:43,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably because you can't share the game back and forth.

1717
01:53:44,101 --> 01:53:48,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Because what if, like, you have to, you know, what if your PS3 isn't hooked up to go online?

1718
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:50,882
[SPEAKER_18]: But then I think, well, you've got to go online to get the game.

1719
01:53:51,462 --> 01:53:54,163
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess not having an internet connection.

1720
01:53:54,183 --> 01:53:56,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, let's play Devil's Advocate here.

1721
01:53:56,583 --> 01:54:00,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Say you take your PS3 to a friend's house and say, oh, I really want this game.

1722
01:54:00,144 --> 01:54:05,265
[SPEAKER_08]: You go to their friend's house, hook it up to their internet connection, download the game, and then you take it home and you're like, crap, can't play it.

1723
01:54:06,415 --> 01:54:27,488
[SPEAKER_18]: I realize things are different now but like I know back in the day like especially with the Dreamcast I used to have to run a gigantic cord across the entire house and hook it into my Dreamcast if I wanted to play so you know it wasn't always online and I think some people are still kind of doing that with PS3 even though it has built-in Wi-Fi just some people in some places are a little bit behind the times you know it happens

1724
01:54:28,308 --> 01:54:31,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're on Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi can be sketchy sometimes.

1725
01:54:31,631 --> 01:54:31,872
[SPEAKER_08]: True.

1726
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,293
[SPEAKER_08]: You get drops every now and then.

1727
01:54:34,394 --> 01:54:38,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Have they said what happens if you start up the game and then your Wi-Fi just cuts out?

1728
01:54:38,538 --> 01:54:40,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I've had problems with my internet connection in the past.

1729
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:41,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you get kicked out of the game.

1730
01:54:41,982 --> 01:54:46,266
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh, that's just like the Ubisoft one that they got torn a new one over.

1731
01:54:46,286 --> 01:54:46,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1732
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:59,316
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Capcom, the new face of Capcom They do cool shit and then they start copying games and doing DRM schemes It's like, who are you, Capcom?

1733
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:02,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously I don't even know you anymore

1734
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:06,340
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1735
01:55:25,228 --> 01:55:26,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Why aren't they getting in?

1736
01:55:44,548 --> 01:55:52,294
[SPEAKER_18]: E3 Expo 2011 show management has placed caps on this year's media badge assignments due to the tremendous number of requests for media badges, etc.

1737
01:55:52,694 --> 01:56:03,083
[SPEAKER_18]: We require that sites be fully launched, operational for six months, and that the website receives a minimum of 8,000 monthly unique impressions as a baseline for each media badge issued.

1738
01:56:03,683 --> 01:56:10,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Quantcast.com, for example, currently has your site listed at approximately 10,000 monthly uniques for the month of December 2010.

1739
01:56:11,326 --> 01:56:16,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Based on the above, we can approve two media badges for site that provided this info at this time.

1740
01:56:17,347 --> 01:56:17,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a second.

1741
01:56:17,928 --> 01:56:20,288
[SPEAKER_08]: For every 8,000, though, but they only have 10,000.

1742
01:56:20,368 --> 01:56:21,429
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not 16,000.

1743
01:56:22,409 --> 01:56:27,711
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe they're being nice or maybe they hit the cap for one and then I don't know.

1744
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:31,293
[SPEAKER_18]: So, but there's a lot of people out there that are really upset about this.

1745
01:56:31,393 --> 01:56:38,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, to be honest, if OLR wanted to go, we probably wouldn't be able to under these conditions because I looked up our site on one of these.

1746
01:56:38,838 --> 01:56:43,281
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we have like 800 hits or something, but that's like really wrong.

1747
01:56:43,541 --> 01:56:45,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I don't know what these sites use to measure.

1748
01:56:45,723 --> 01:56:47,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe you know more about this stuff, Salacious Pop.

1749
01:56:47,364 --> 01:56:54,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them, some of the websites that you do the tracking, you actually have to put an embed code or whatever, some sort of code that's in your webpages.

1750
01:56:54,248 --> 01:56:54,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridiculous.

1751
01:56:55,629 --> 01:56:56,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I mean, come on.

1752
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:59,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Our podcast gets downloaded more than that.

1753
01:56:59,873 --> 01:57:01,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Plus, we're a podcast.

1754
01:57:02,775 --> 01:57:14,305
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have really a website that caters to... I mean, there's people that work very hard on our website, but mostly the website is a place for our show to be delivered.

1755
01:57:14,366 --> 01:57:19,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And occasionally a little story that kind of kicks it back to old school LR about old school songs or whatever.

1756
01:57:20,010 --> 01:57:20,051
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

1757
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:24,814
[SPEAKER_18]: These sites would not measure our download shows.

1758
01:57:24,874 --> 01:57:26,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, granted, I haven't asked for an E3 pass.

1759
01:57:26,956 --> 01:57:29,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't had an official rejection, so it's hard to say.

1760
01:57:30,819 --> 01:57:34,101
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost wonder if maybe I should register as broadcast media if I want to go.

1761
01:57:34,562 --> 01:57:42,047
[SPEAKER_18]: But at the same time, seriously, all the other indie shows I know are getting told no, or they're getting one badge.

1762
01:57:42,487 --> 01:57:47,111
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm kind of like, well, if no one's freaking going to E3 this year, then fuck it.

1763
01:57:47,191 --> 01:57:48,452
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll read about it on the internet.

1764
01:57:49,052 --> 01:57:52,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of the fun of going to E3 is getting to see everybody.

1765
01:57:52,495 --> 01:57:59,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it was fun going to E3, but honestly, last year, I didn't miss it.

1766
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:02,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched all the press conferences, which is great.

1767
01:58:02,363 --> 01:58:03,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to watch the press conferences.

1768
01:58:03,704 --> 01:58:08,427
[SPEAKER_08]: That's better than going to E3 because I didn't get to watch the press conferences when I went to E3.

1769
01:58:08,948 --> 01:58:13,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get invited to the press conferences, so you had to watch them streamed.

1770
01:58:13,892 --> 01:58:15,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, streaming was great.

1771
01:58:15,973 --> 01:58:16,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to watch that.

1772
01:58:16,954 --> 01:58:20,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I got all the coverage I possibly wanted to, you know, absorb in there.

1773
01:58:20,536 --> 01:58:21,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't have to wait in lines for games.

1774
01:58:22,477 --> 01:58:23,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, yeah, I didn't get to play demos.

1775
01:58:23,918 --> 01:58:25,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to try out the 3DS and stuff.

1776
01:58:25,739 --> 01:58:28,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But, eh, whatever.

1777
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,540
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't really care.

1778
01:58:29,941 --> 01:58:31,962
[SPEAKER_18]: There's two ways you can kind of look at this.

1779
01:58:32,142 --> 01:58:37,144
[SPEAKER_18]: And one is that, you know, the big sites are getting bigger and the small sites are getting smaller.

1780
01:58:37,264 --> 01:58:44,568
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, how are independents and startups supposed to compete if E3's not going to let them in because they're not already a big site?

1781
01:58:44,628 --> 01:58:45,669
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, this is just letting...

1782
01:58:46,489 --> 01:58:53,731
[SPEAKER_18]: OneUp and IGN have more quote-unquote exclusives to mix in with the stories they copy from small sites.

1783
01:58:54,091 --> 01:58:54,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's be real.

1784
01:58:55,132 --> 01:58:56,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Where do they get their information?

1785
01:58:57,272 --> 01:59:03,754
[SPEAKER_18]: They either get granted exclusives because they're big sites or they scour the internet up and down and get them from the little sites.

1786
01:59:04,474 --> 01:59:09,996
[SPEAKER_18]: We know because we've had stories taken from our site and put on these sites before, oftentimes without credit.

1787
01:59:11,454 --> 01:59:13,519
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just saying, how did they get to be so big?

1788
01:59:13,739 --> 01:59:17,768
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, because they have all that type of manpower, etc., etc., corporate funding, blah, blah, blah.

1789
01:59:18,589 --> 01:59:20,213
[SPEAKER_18]: So on that end, it's kind of bullshit.

1790
01:59:21,089 --> 01:59:25,312
[SPEAKER_18]: But on the other hand, I understand why E3 kind of needs to clamp down.

1791
01:59:25,432 --> 01:59:28,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there are a lot of people getting in that probably shouldn't be getting in.

1792
01:59:28,834 --> 01:59:30,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially as media.

1793
01:59:31,116 --> 01:59:42,024
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, yeah, but there's a lot of sales associates and stuff like that over at retail stores and stuff like that that are getting in that maybe don't really necessarily need to be there.

1794
01:59:42,464 --> 01:59:44,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I don't know.

1795
01:59:44,245 --> 01:59:45,666
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, it's just like...

1796
01:59:46,807 --> 01:59:48,128
[SPEAKER_18]: But where do you draw the line?

1797
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Where do you draw the line?

1798
01:59:49,469 --> 01:59:55,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if you meet the qualifications of having the business license and everything like that, you've obviously established yourself as a legitimate thing.

1799
01:59:55,992 --> 01:59:57,713
[SPEAKER_18]: You should at least get one or two.

1800
01:59:58,393 --> 02:00:08,919
[SPEAKER_18]: But I understand if Joe's PodunkGameBlog.com tries to get 20 badges, I get why that's a problem, especially with these stories about people are selling their badges and everything.

1801
02:00:09,299 --> 02:00:12,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Way to go, few bad apples for ruining the barrel for the rest of us.

1802
02:00:13,001 --> 02:00:17,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Truth be told, if you really wanted to go to E3, this goes to anybody.

1803
02:00:17,566 --> 02:00:19,888
[SPEAKER_18]: If you really wanted to go to E3, you could still.

1804
02:00:20,249 --> 02:00:21,109
[SPEAKER_18]: You know how you have to do it?

1805
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:23,152
[SPEAKER_18]: You pay $400 and you just get one of the badges.

1806
02:00:23,472 --> 02:00:26,855
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not really an advertised thing, but you can totally go on there.

1807
02:00:26,955 --> 02:00:28,697
[SPEAKER_18]: And they say like industry or whatever.

1808
02:00:28,757 --> 02:00:30,219
[SPEAKER_18]: You could say you're a student or whatever.

1809
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:34,223
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're willing to throw $400 at them, they're going to let you in.

1810
02:00:35,956 --> 02:00:36,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Why wouldn't they?

1811
02:00:37,236 --> 02:00:37,856
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

1812
02:00:37,936 --> 02:00:44,598
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, despite the traffic our site gets, if I really wanted to go, I could pay $400 and go.

1813
02:00:46,598 --> 02:00:55,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, media badges, even if you have a media badge and you're not an IGN or 1UP or something like that, you're just going to get treated like shit.

1814
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:58,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, they're like, oh, who are you?

1815
02:00:59,121 --> 02:00:59,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, I'm sorry.

1816
02:00:59,941 --> 02:01:01,021
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not giving you an interview.

1817
02:01:01,401 --> 02:01:05,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You may get a few scheduled meetings with some of the

1818
02:01:06,242 --> 02:01:24,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the largest ones we got into like Sony, Bethesda and stuff like that but you know Sony Online not Sony Computer Entertainment but like they really don't give a shit about most of the press especially unless you're a big site because that's where the traffic is

1819
02:01:25,348 --> 02:01:32,475
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be invited to the closed door presentation where they're only allowing 10 people to see Cooking Mama 5, Gladiator Axe Battle.

1820
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:35,938
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so you don't get those hush-hush meetings.

1821
02:01:36,939 --> 02:01:38,841
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, there's another problem I have with this.

1822
02:01:40,803 --> 02:01:49,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of think it's a little bit, I mean, the way they're measuring is also kind of the part that peeves me a little bit because it's really unfair to podcasters and so forth.

1823
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:54,609
[SPEAKER_18]: And plus, like I said, that website tells you we get 800 hits, unique hits.

1824
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:59,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I could whip up stats that tell you the number is much higher, like astoundingly higher.

1825
02:01:59,731 --> 02:02:02,812
[SPEAKER_18]: And look, I'm not trying to have an EP conversation here or what have you.

1826
02:02:03,032 --> 02:02:04,813
[SPEAKER_18]: I just, I have facts to back it up.

1827
02:02:05,393 --> 02:02:14,101
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the number to get everybody in this room into E3 if they would take our stats, which are, I believe, more accurately measured than any of this stuff.

1828
02:02:14,661 --> 02:02:16,363
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, whatever.

1829
02:02:17,844 --> 02:02:23,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyhow, so this isn't a me, me, poor me, because if this is the way it is, you know, E3, it's a private show.

1830
02:02:23,249 --> 02:02:24,150
[SPEAKER_18]: They can do what they want.

1831
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:29,774
[SPEAKER_18]: But if nobody's going, then at the same time, what do we owe E3?

1832
02:02:30,015 --> 02:02:30,275
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean...

1833
02:02:32,512 --> 02:02:34,013
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1834
02:02:57,765 --> 02:03:12,161
[SPEAKER_18]: can't afford a big booth at this show they can't afford to compete with the big guys maybe this is a week for the indie shows to celebrate the indie games and maybe maybe that's something we'll have to consider for this year

1835
02:03:15,026 --> 02:03:43,569
[SPEAKER_18]: so uh also I wanted to say this I kind of don't want to spend $400 to go to E3 or whatever whatever it is I mean again to be fair I haven't even tried yet I haven't got told no yet if none of my friends are going I'm just gonna fucking go to PAX like that's where it's at you know that's where all the gaming people are and you know PAX at this point is you get to see a lot of the same demos that are already at E3 and it's more of a nerd convention and so forth there you go PAX is way more fun than E3 mhm

1836
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:50,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of miss what they did in 2006, I think is what it was, during E3.

1837
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Where it was like, hey, guess what?

1838
02:03:53,493 --> 02:03:56,454
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this awesome demo on the show floor for Lost Planet.

1839
02:03:56,574 --> 02:03:57,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

1840
02:03:57,174 --> 02:03:58,914
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1841
02:03:59,214 --> 02:03:59,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Go check it out.

1842
02:03:59,875 --> 02:04:00,935
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to go to E3.

1843
02:04:00,995 --> 02:04:03,696
[SPEAKER_08]: You can check out some of the demos that are going to be on the show floor right here.

1844
02:04:04,516 --> 02:04:06,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get a chance to play them.

1845
02:04:06,737 --> 02:04:07,497
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1846
02:04:08,357 --> 02:04:10,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see what develops in this story.

1847
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of develops.

1848
02:04:13,281 --> 02:04:14,362
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

1849
02:04:14,582 --> 02:04:26,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have a dev console that still has access to a certain net that are partnered with different publishers out there.

1850
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:30,015
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of E3 demos pop up on tube.

1851
02:04:31,116 --> 02:04:37,940
[SPEAKER_18]: I bet we hear more information on this before the show actually hits because, again, you go look at some Twitters out there.

1852
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:42,943
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of negative buzz on it right now, so I don't think E3 is going to like all that negative buzz.

1853
02:04:43,444 --> 02:04:44,925
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't give a shit because guess what?

1854
02:04:45,005 --> 02:04:48,107
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the day, they get their coverage on all the big sites, and you know what?

1855
02:04:49,207 --> 02:04:49,848
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't give a shit.

1856
02:04:49,868 --> 02:04:53,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Indie blogs might be little, but they're loud.

1857
02:04:54,608 --> 02:04:55,729
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1858
02:05:21,226 --> 02:05:23,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually is from SNK.

1859
02:05:23,128 --> 02:05:24,408
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not Nintendo related.

1860
02:05:25,909 --> 02:05:38,417
[SPEAKER_10]: SNK Arcade Classics Zero for PSP is... Excuse me, I got ahead of... Radio's biggest nightmare.

02:05:40,619 --> 02:05:43,681
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be released on April 21st.

1863
02:05:44,361 --> 02:05:49,845

02:05:50,936 --> 02:05:54,082
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them being Psycho Soldier.

1865
02:05:55,845 --> 02:05:59,451
[SPEAKER_10]: I could just tell from the cover because it was the game that Athena and Kenzo came from.

1866
02:06:00,413 --> 02:06:02,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that game because she sings through the whole thing.

1867
02:06:02,817 --> 02:06:03,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty fun.

1868

[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, you totally have to find the music for Psycho Soldier.

1873
02:06:58,417 --> 02:07:00,978
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have to find it later because I'm setting up for our next segment.

1874
02:07:01,358 --> 02:07:01,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1875
02:07:02,098 --> 02:07:03,998
[SPEAKER_18]: But what's your favorite game in that pack?

1876
02:07:04,018 --> 02:07:06,139

1877
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,500
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I love Psycho Soldier even though it's actually really not that great of a game.

1878
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,501
[SPEAKER_10]: It just makes me laugh because you're singing through the whole thing.

1879
02:07:13,521 --> 02:07:18,242
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of the first arcade games that I'll digitize singing to go on continuously through the whole game.

1880
02:07:18,502 --> 02:07:18,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

1881
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:23,083
[SPEAKER_10]: It was such a fun little bad game.

02:07:24,343 --> 02:07:26,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that and I also have to add Ikari Warriors, you know.

[SPEAKER_08]: I love Ikari Warriors.

1884
02:07:29,044 --> 02:07:30,625
[SPEAKER_08]: That game is so awesome.

1885
02:07:31,025 --> 02:07:33,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It was incredibly glitchy on the NES.

1886
02:07:33,925 --> 02:07:37,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, making that cartridge dirtier made it more fun.

1887
02:07:38,166 --> 02:07:39,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ooh, what glitches are going to happen now?

1888
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:47,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, since it is episode number 400, we thought we would do something special for you guys.

1889
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:48,828
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do a little game here.

02:07:58,732 --> 02:08:09,318

1894
02:08:09,819 --> 02:08:13,661

1922
02:10:50,265 --> 02:10:52,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I have no mic.

1923
02:10:54,366 --> 02:10:56,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky doesn't know how to run a radio show because he has no mic.

1924
02:10:57,366 --> 02:10:59,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, when he talks off mic, you can't hear him.

1925
02:11:01,294 --> 02:11:02,595
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he hates all of you, by the way.

1926
02:11:04,437 --> 02:11:05,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, Alan.

1927
02:11:05,838 --> 02:11:07,459

[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get to the match game itself.

1930
02:11:17,808 --> 02:11:18,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Lovely introductions.

02:11:28,898 --> 02:11:30,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't yell out the answer.

1941
02:11:30,559 --> 02:11:31,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Just think about it.

1942
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:34,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Because our folks here in studio have to also come up with their answers.

1943

[SPEAKER_18]: You have to write it on a little card.

02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:45,150
[SPEAKER_18]: You just make believe.

1950

[SPEAKER_18]: Also not a match.

1995
02:14:15,284 --> 02:14:19,027
[SPEAKER_18]: So the score is 0-0.

02:14:19,647 --> 02:14:21,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Good job so far, Kaijudo and Frisbee.

02:14:23,530 --> 02:14:24,691
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's okay, Kaijudo.

1999
02:14:25,772 --> 02:14:28,354
[SPEAKER_18]: You got three more questions to try and break this tie.

2000
02:14:28,434 --> 02:14:29,154
[SPEAKER_18]: So you ready for them?

2001

02:14:32,346 --> 02:14:32,706
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay.

2004
02:14:33,107 --> 02:14:33,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, here we go.

[SPEAKER_18]: Question number two.

2006
02:14:36,849 --> 02:14:45,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie was excited to hear that not just Final Fantasy IV, but SNK Classics were coming to the PSP.

2007
02:14:46,296 --> 02:14:49,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Too bad her husband Dan sold the PSP yesterday to buy some blank.

[SPEAKER_18]: Not just Final Fantasy 4, but SNK Classics are coming to the PSP.

[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Ding.

02:15:12,718 --> 02:15:14,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Waiting on an answer from Frisbee as well.

2015
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:15,841
[SPEAKER_18]: This is tough.

2016
02:15:17,645 --> 02:15:23,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Dan, DarkSakura's husband Dan, sold the PSP for some... Alright, there you go.

2017
02:15:23,448 --> 02:15:25,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we're waiting on an answer from Frisbee in our chatroom.

2018
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:27,831
[SPEAKER_18]: He's lagging a little bit.

2019
02:15:28,511 --> 02:15:29,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, there is that delay.

2020
02:15:32,944 --> 02:15:34,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to look at Orange Lounge to see.

2021
02:15:38,847 --> 02:15:40,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Paying Loki in boom boom dollars.

[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo, you have an answer, I'm hoping, right?

2026
02:15:52,754 --> 02:15:53,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I have an answer.

2027
02:15:53,535 --> 02:15:53,995

[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2030
02:15:57,097 --> 02:16:01,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo, too bad her husband Dan sold the PSP yesterday to buy some.

2031
02:16:02,605 --> 02:16:03,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, vending machine what?

2032

[SPEAKER_17]: Japanese vending machine panties.

2033
02:16:07,331 --> 02:16:07,732
[SPEAKER_17]: My husband?

2034
02:16:17,042 --> 02:16:17,382

2037
02:17:17,891 --> 02:17:20,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, unfortunately, is also not a match.

2038
02:17:20,053 --> 02:17:22,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you had meatballs earlier, so you had to buy the meat.

2039
02:17:22,476 --> 02:17:22,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2040
02:17:22,756 --> 02:17:23,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2041
02:17:23,838 --> 02:17:29,063
[SPEAKER_18]: So, after two questions, the score is zero to zero.

2042
02:17:29,664 --> 02:17:30,445
[SPEAKER_18]: It's eyeballs.

2043
02:17:30,745 --> 02:17:32,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Kaijudo, Kaijudo, Kaijudo.

2044

[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll see, though.

2045
02:17:33,248 --> 02:17:34,249
[SPEAKER_18]: You have a chance to catch up.

2046
02:17:34,289 --> 02:17:34,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Here you go.

2047
02:17:34,590 --> 02:17:35,631
[SPEAKER_18]: You ready for question number three?

[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, you can do it.

2049
02:17:38,719 --> 02:17:39,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2050
02:17:39,259 --> 02:17:40,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Question number three.

2051
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:46,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob was sad to hear that he'd need 8,000 listeners to get into E3 this year.

2052
02:17:47,444 --> 02:17:53,747
[SPEAKER_18]: He wrote an appeal to the E3 board saying, Dear E3, give me a media badge.

2053
02:17:54,508 --> 02:17:58,870
[SPEAKER_18]: I may not have 8,000 listeners, but I sure as hell have 8,000 blank listeners.

2054
02:18:05,609 --> 02:18:07,990
[SPEAKER_18]: You need 8,000 people to go to E3 this year.

2055
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:12,491
[SPEAKER_18]: We may not have 8,000 listeners, but I sure as hell have 8,000 blank.

2056
02:18:14,812 --> 02:18:15,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Ding.

2057
02:18:17,173 --> 02:18:17,453
[SPEAKER_18]: Ding.

2058
02:18:18,073 --> 02:18:19,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, that was fast.

2059
02:18:19,074 --> 02:18:20,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody just dinged in real quick there.

2060
02:18:21,575 --> 02:18:21,975
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2061
02:18:22,755 --> 02:18:24,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo, do you think you know an answer?

2062
02:18:24,156 --> 02:18:25,596
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still waiting on Frisbee, but are you ready?

2063
02:18:26,596 --> 02:18:27,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I have an answer.

2064
02:18:27,797 --> 02:18:28,497
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's see.

2065
02:18:30,198 --> 02:18:30,938
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm waiting on Frisbee.

2066
02:18:32,423 --> 02:18:34,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Need... I wonder if he's getting help.

2067
02:18:37,564 --> 02:18:37,944
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2068
02:18:39,884 --> 02:18:40,244
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2069
02:18:41,365 --> 02:18:42,265
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, here we go.

2070
02:18:42,325 --> 02:18:42,725
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.

2071
02:18:42,785 --> 02:18:43,085
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2072
02:18:43,665 --> 02:18:44,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2073
02:18:44,685 --> 02:18:48,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I may not have 8,000 listeners, Kaijudo, but I sure as hell have 8,000.

2074
02:18:48,246 --> 02:18:52,886
[SPEAKER_20]: You have 8,000 in WoW gold.

2075
02:18:52,906 --> 02:18:54,107
[SPEAKER_18]: 8,000 in WoW gold.

2076
02:18:54,227 --> 02:18:54,667
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2077
02:18:55,287 --> 02:19:01,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And Frisbee says, I sure as hell have 8,000 players in my guild.

2078
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:06,660
[SPEAKER_18]: First off, you're really wrong, but that's okay.

2079
02:19:07,801 --> 02:19:09,562
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that they're both WoW references.

2080
02:19:09,942 --> 02:19:11,683
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, here we go.

2081
02:19:11,883 --> 02:19:13,363
[SPEAKER_18]: I sure as hell have 8,000.

2082
02:19:14,384 --> 02:19:15,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to Loki.

2083
02:19:15,484 --> 02:19:16,285
[SPEAKER_18]: I sure as hell have 8,000.

2084
02:19:17,565 --> 02:19:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Inches of E-peen.

2085
02:19:18,846 --> 02:19:20,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Inches of E-peen.

2086
02:19:21,107 --> 02:19:22,507
[SPEAKER_18]: True, but not a match.

2087
02:19:22,627 --> 02:19:22,928
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2088
02:19:24,605 --> 02:19:47,314
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, I sure as hell have 8,000 gallons of Propel gallons of Propel taking it back to old school 8,000 gallons of Propel SalaciousPop, I sure as hell have 8,000 loyalty stamps to Pinkberry loyalty stamps to Pinkberry hey, I'm close to that still no matches Arcadium42, I sure as hell have 8,000 rage points

[SPEAKER_18]: Rage points.

2090
02:19:49,756 --> 02:19:50,556
[SPEAKER_18]: What's a rage point?

2091
02:19:50,776 --> 02:19:51,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2092
02:19:53,138 --> 02:19:54,159
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not the angry one.

2093
02:19:54,199 --> 02:19:54,559
[SPEAKER_17]: He is.

2094
02:19:54,859 --> 02:19:56,440
[SPEAKER_17]: He's the angry one, Arcadian.

2095
02:19:56,780 --> 02:19:57,461
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not angry.

2096
02:19:59,802 --> 02:20:00,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, my turn.

2097
02:20:01,664 --> 02:20:02,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I sure as hell have 8,000.

2098
02:20:04,246 --> 02:20:04,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Gold!

2099
02:20:05,106 --> 02:20:06,967
[SPEAKER_18]: I said gold and I meant Warcraft.

2100
02:20:07,067 --> 02:20:07,688
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a match.

2101
02:20:08,148 --> 02:20:09,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo is on the board.

2102
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:11,050
[SPEAKER_18]: One point.

2103
02:20:11,530 --> 02:20:13,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo matches on 8,000 gold.

2104
02:20:14,091 --> 02:20:14,591
[SPEAKER_18]: There it is.

2105
02:20:15,072 --> 02:20:15,952
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is tied up.

2106
02:20:16,652 --> 02:20:17,693
[SPEAKER_18]: One zip.

2107
02:20:18,253 --> 02:20:19,034
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's not a tie.

2108
02:20:19,154 --> 02:20:20,795
[SPEAKER_18]: This is why I'm not a game show host.

2109
02:20:21,195 --> 02:20:22,315
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not tied up anymore.

2110
02:20:22,335 --> 02:20:24,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just so used to these things ending in a draw.

2111
02:20:24,536 --> 02:20:28,098
[SPEAKER_18]: It is now Kaijudo pulling ahead one to nothing.

2112
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:30,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Kaijudo, there is still one more question to go.

2113
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:32,641
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to maintain your lead.

2114
02:20:32,761 --> 02:20:34,783
[SPEAKER_18]: Frisbee, this is your chance to catch up.

2115
02:20:34,803 --> 02:20:35,143
[SPEAKER_18]: You ready?

2116
02:20:36,484 --> 02:20:36,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2117
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:38,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go, Frisbee.

2118
02:20:38,666 --> 02:20:39,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go, Kaijudo.

2119
02:20:40,047 --> 02:20:40,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Last question.

2120
02:20:42,108 --> 02:20:50,395
[SPEAKER_18]: The listeners of OLR sat in the chat room skipping the Super Bowl to listen to OLR's 400th episode.

2121
02:20:51,135 --> 02:20:59,362
[SPEAKER_18]: They all agreed that the show was going fine, but that a landmark show such as this was in desperate need of more blank.

2122
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:11,874
[SPEAKER_18]: It is the landmark 400th episode, and everyone agrees that the show is going fine, but this show is in desperate need of more blank.

2123
02:21:12,374 --> 02:21:12,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Ding.

2124
02:21:13,655 --> 02:21:13,935
Ding.

02:24:27,199 --> 02:24:38,759
[SPEAKER_20]: If you ever wanted to develop your own games and you got lost with Game Maker 8 or RPG Maker is just a little too confusing for you, then pick up Big Planet 2 and you'll be able to make the games that you've always wanted to play.

2143
02:24:39,279 --> 02:24:40,640
[SPEAKER_20]: and play GoldenEye Source.

2144
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:41,760
[SPEAKER_20]: I keep pumping that game.

2145
02:24:41,781 --> 02:24:42,741
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys need to try that.

2146
02:24:43,321 --> 02:24:46,223
[SPEAKER_18]: I will put it on my list right after I finish up with the Dragon Age 2 demo.

[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Kajudo, I need you to send an email to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com right away, okay?

02:24:53,127 --> 02:24:53,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Got it.

[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, do it right now.

2151
02:24:54,227 --> 02:24:55,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2152
02:24:55,248 --> 02:24:55,708
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, thank you.

2153
02:24:56,569 --> 02:24:56,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

2154
02:24:56,769 --> 02:24:57,329
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

2155
02:24:58,231 --> 02:25:00,313
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, congrats, Chaijudo, and congrats, Frisbee.

2156
02:25:01,074 --> 02:25:05,619
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to open up the Skype line for more calls a little later on tonight, but don't call in right now.

2157
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:07,502
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get to some more news stories.

2158
02:25:07,522 --> 02:25:11,326
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not quite ready for the rest of the calls just yet.

2159
02:25:11,406 --> 02:25:14,209
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's go to another news story from Loki.

2160
02:25:14,469 --> 02:25:15,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you guys enjoyed Match Game.

2161
02:25:17,351 --> 02:25:24,755
[SPEAKER_08]: THQ is talking a little bit about their sales of the UDraw tablet, their peripheral that kind of resembles something that you might see with Mario Paint.

2162
02:25:25,676 --> 02:25:32,540
[SPEAKER_08]: They've sold 1.2 million UDraw units in the third quarter of their fiscal year, of course.

2163
02:25:33,060 --> 02:25:35,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, they want more UDraw games.

2164
02:25:36,082 --> 02:26:04,467
[SPEAKER_08]: they're actually looking to kind of change up their business strategy a bit trying to step away from some of the kids and I guess movie cartoon based stuff that they have coming out THQ does a lot they have like Nintendo license so they do a lot of Spongebob and crap at Nicktoons and all sorts of stuff that comes out with that

2165
02:26:06,908 --> 02:26:09,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Which would be good, because I don't like selling it each year.

2166
02:26:09,850 --> 02:26:13,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever made anything that's been really good for everyone?

2167
02:26:13,413 --> 02:26:14,293
[SPEAKER_15]: The You Don't Know Jack game?

2168
02:26:14,314 --> 02:26:18,576
[SPEAKER_08]: For everyone?

2169
02:26:18,616 --> 02:26:24,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Saints Row, Red Faction, a lot of the Volition stuff through them is pretty cool.

2170
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:26,102
[SPEAKER_08]: UFC, people like UFC.

2171
02:26:26,422 --> 02:26:29,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do have the mature stuff, but as far as casual family stuff,

2172
02:26:30,586 --> 02:26:38,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I just remember back in the day 10-15 years ago they were putting out all these crap games that no one seemed to like.

2173
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:44,270
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that movie?

2174
02:26:44,350 --> 02:26:44,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Home Alone.

2175
02:26:45,111 --> 02:26:45,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Some sort of Home Alone.

2176
02:26:46,111 --> 02:26:48,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god, Home Alone was terrible.

2177
02:26:49,432 --> 02:26:50,373
[SPEAKER_18]: The games were not fun.

2178
02:26:51,533 --> 02:26:51,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2179
02:26:52,593 --> 02:26:54,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, those U-Draws seem to be doing pretty well.

2180
02:26:54,894 --> 02:26:56,015
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I see them all over now.

2181
02:26:56,435 --> 02:26:59,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're doing pretty well and it'd be nice when there's more software out there.

2182
02:26:59,876 --> 02:27:03,557
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did a Mario Paint game that used U-Draw, that'd be pretty awesome.

2183
02:27:03,977 --> 02:27:08,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you think it might be something Nintendo tries to show off at the Big Expo later this year?

2184
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:09,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be nice.

2185
02:27:32,193 --> 02:27:32,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

2186
02:27:51,906 --> 02:27:57,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, before you get all PO'd that you're going to have to buy this character, it is going towards a good cause.

2187
02:27:58,073 --> 02:28:11,547
[SPEAKER_18]: The money that they raise from this character will be donated to charities devoted to breast cancer research, and that is according to The Behemoth, because obviously, February is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and you see a lot of pink ribbons that people wear, so what better than a pink knight?

2188
02:28:11,787 --> 02:28:12,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this.

2189
02:28:12,548 --> 02:28:13,909
[SPEAKER_18]: This is good news for gaming.

2190
02:28:14,209 --> 02:28:15,150
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a great story.

2191
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:16,091
[SPEAKER_18]: So check this out.

2192
02:28:16,131 --> 02:28:19,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you, you know, just on principle, check it out.

2193
02:28:19,795 --> 02:28:20,235
[SPEAKER_18]: They're so cute.

2194
02:28:20,275 --> 02:28:22,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, and the Pink Knight gets a lollipop.

2195
02:28:22,598 --> 02:28:22,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2196
02:28:23,058 --> 02:28:23,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome.

2197
02:28:24,039 --> 02:28:27,042
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, the Pink Knight will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

2198
02:28:27,142 --> 02:28:31,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Just hasn't happened just yet, but it will happen hopefully this month.

2199
02:28:31,987 --> 02:28:33,068
[SPEAKER_18]: So check that out.

2200
02:28:33,428 --> 02:28:34,309
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a great cause.

2201
02:28:34,729 --> 02:28:35,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Good story.

2202
02:28:35,802 --> 02:28:41,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open up the mailbag and we're going to dive in headfirst to the mailbag.

2203
02:28:41,166 --> 02:28:44,669
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura's going to pull out a few emails and read them for us live on air.

2204
02:28:44,709 --> 02:28:48,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Just make sure she doesn't read the two guys that just sent me their emails' addresses.

2205
02:28:48,972 --> 02:28:49,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we don't have them yet.

2206
02:28:50,033 --> 02:28:50,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

2207
02:28:51,838 --> 02:28:52,919
[SPEAKER_10]: So, first email.

2208
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:55,281
[SPEAKER_10]: And now my voice decides to go out.

2209
02:28:55,861 --> 02:28:56,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, OLR.

2210
02:28:56,682 --> 02:29:00,385
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to pop you guys a message to wish you congratulations on reaching episode 400.

2211
02:29:01,406 --> 02:29:11,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's difficult enough just to listen to or watch 400 episodes of something, but here you guys have successfully put forward the dedication and drive to broadcast that many truly an awesome achievement.

2212
02:29:12,555 --> 02:29:14,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I also do need to congratulate him on his fantastic grammar

2213
02:29:30,555 --> 02:29:34,317
[SPEAKER_18]: I just love the name Snake 361 as the title.

2214
02:29:35,818 --> 02:29:36,639
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very clever.

2215
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:43,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, if you can't listen to all 400 episodes of OLR, I don't have time to play 359 other Snake games, okay?

2216
02:29:46,514 --> 02:29:47,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

2217
02:30:14,815 --> 02:30:15,696
[SPEAKER_10]: which I wasn't here for.

2218
02:30:16,797 --> 02:30:17,317
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

2219
02:30:17,397 --> 02:30:18,958
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was here for the fourth episode.

2220
02:30:18,978 --> 02:30:20,059
[SPEAKER_18]: You came back for the fourth.

2221
02:30:20,099 --> 02:30:21,160
[SPEAKER_18]: You were gone like the second or third.

2222
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:22,261
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the Harry Potter closet.

2223
02:30:22,361 --> 02:30:23,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, anyhow.

2224
02:30:23,622 --> 02:30:23,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2225
02:30:24,963 --> 02:30:25,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, memories.

2226
02:30:25,583 --> 02:30:27,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that the Mel episode?

2227
02:30:27,205 --> 02:30:27,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he come out?

2228
02:30:27,745 --> 02:30:28,906
[SPEAKER_18]: He came out pretty early on.

2229
02:30:29,266 --> 02:30:29,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2230
02:30:30,407 --> 02:30:34,328
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great time every time, and I've enjoyed every minute that I've spent with OLR.

2231
02:30:34,408 --> 02:30:37,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Jamie, Matt, and Rob for being awesome enough to bring us Orange Lodge Radio.

2232
02:30:38,149 --> 02:30:43,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, if you've ever participated in chat or called into the show, thank you as well for helping to make the show what it is.

2233
02:30:44,130 --> 02:30:48,751
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be hearing from me again soon, and hopefully I'll see many of you at PAX East 2011.

2234
02:30:49,471 --> 02:30:50,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop by my booth and say hello.

2235
02:30:51,432 --> 02:30:55,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Still awaiting the budget for Golden Girls Death Squad, AaronYYR.

2236
02:30:57,301 --> 02:30:58,702
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if he wants us to say his last name.

2237
02:30:58,943 --> 02:31:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: You know they do have those crowdsourcing websites now.

2238
02:31:03,587 --> 02:31:04,188
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

2239
02:31:04,928 --> 02:31:05,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to look into that.

2240
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:07,851
[SPEAKER_18]: We reported on that last week.

2241
02:31:07,891 --> 02:31:08,392
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.

2242
02:31:08,672 --> 02:31:09,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the well wishes.

2243
02:31:10,033 --> 02:31:10,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Appreciate it.

2244
02:31:10,514 --> 02:31:13,817
[SPEAKER_18]: And best of luck with Snake 361 and you better come on the show and plug it.

2245
02:31:13,857 --> 02:31:14,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2246
02:31:15,098 --> 02:31:15,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Next email.

2247
02:31:15,879 --> 02:31:16,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Greetings, OLR.

2248
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:20,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations on reaching your quadricentennial episode.

2249
02:31:20,984 --> 02:31:26,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been listening to your show on and off for years now, and every time I come back, it's like returning to old friends.

2250
02:31:27,169 --> 02:31:28,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're getting old.

2251
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:29,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you.

2252
02:31:30,012 --> 02:31:30,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I still look gorgeous.

2253
02:31:33,315 --> 02:31:33,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch.

2254
02:31:34,996 --> 02:31:36,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so?

2255
02:31:37,098 --> 02:31:40,041
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys always manage to brighten up a dull bus ride in the morning.

2256
02:31:40,181 --> 02:31:41,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm glad I'm good for something.

2257
02:31:42,614 --> 02:31:45,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm never able to listen live due to the time difference.

2258
02:31:45,996 --> 02:31:48,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in the UK and I doubt tonight will be any different.

2259
02:31:48,817 --> 02:31:52,398
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope it's a fun show and I'll be looking forward to it in the podcast feed.

2260
02:31:52,919 --> 02:31:55,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope you lot are around for many more shows to come.

2261
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:56,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Catastrophic Moggy.

2262
02:31:57,781 --> 02:31:58,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

2263
02:31:59,241 --> 02:31:59,902
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the name.

2264
02:31:59,962 --> 02:32:00,662
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very clever.

2265
02:32:01,802 --> 02:32:03,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here.

2266
02:32:03,443 --> 02:32:07,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to round up the staff to wish you guys happy 400, but we had a slight problem.

2267
02:32:07,865 --> 02:32:08,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So here, enjoy.

2268
02:32:09,166 --> 02:32:09,546
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an MP3.

2269
02:32:10,543 --> 02:32:12,306
[SPEAKER_18]: That means I have to go in the mailbag and pull that up, don't I?

2270
02:32:12,326 --> 02:32:12,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you do.

2271
02:32:12,787 --> 02:32:13,708
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll come back to that.

2272
02:32:13,768 --> 02:32:14,630
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to pull that up right now.

2273
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:19,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, congratulations on your 400th episode.

2274
02:32:20,034 --> 02:32:25,740
[SPEAKER_10]: As a long-time listener and a first-time writer, I thought I would share one of my favorite memories from listening to OLR.

2275
02:32:26,260 --> 02:32:38,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I cannot pinpoint when exactly I started listening, sometime in 2006, my favorite memories include a wonderful discussion about Uno on Xbox Live as the words draw for bitch have graced every game I have played ever since.

2276
02:32:39,153 --> 02:32:40,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep up the amazing work.

2277
02:32:40,714 --> 02:32:41,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey Kuro!

2278
02:32:41,154 --> 02:32:41,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Huh?

2279
02:32:41,295 --> 02:32:41,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Kuro!

2280
02:32:41,435 --> 02:32:41,515
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

2281
02:32:41,555 --> 02:32:42,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you heard from Sailor Flare?

2282
02:33:03,556 --> 02:33:04,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, actually, I haven't.

2283
02:33:05,179 --> 02:33:06,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you know what happened to her?

2284
02:33:06,701 --> 02:33:07,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea.

2285
02:33:07,763 --> 02:33:10,688
[SPEAKER_16]: She said she's supposed to meet us online and record the bumper for OLR.

2286
02:33:10,728 --> 02:33:11,309
[SPEAKER_16]: It's their 400th episode.

2287
02:33:13,046 --> 02:33:13,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to give her a call?

2288
02:33:14,447 --> 02:33:17,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I tried calling her, but I don't know where she lives.

2289
02:33:18,069 --> 02:33:21,332
[SPEAKER_16]: She can't get a signal or anything like that.

2290
02:33:21,412 --> 02:33:27,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I sent her a text, and hell, I've gotten on the roof of my house and said it smokes.

2291
02:33:27,136 --> 02:33:29,417
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got mail.

2292
02:33:29,477 --> 02:33:33,600
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just about to say, that's where that little bee thing on your computer is.

2293
02:33:34,541 --> 02:33:36,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's check it out and see what it is.

2294
02:33:38,001 --> 02:33:40,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Ranma, hey Kuro, it's Sailor Flare.

2295
02:33:41,103 --> 02:33:49,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, I would be with you guys right now, but there are some rabid, angry fanboys, and they are attacking the studio, and I need to do my part to ward them off.

2296
02:33:50,650 --> 02:33:53,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Moon Tiara Magic!

2297
02:33:56,674 --> 02:34:01,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I didn't think it was possible for fanboys to find studios.

2298
02:34:01,837 --> 02:34:02,658
[SPEAKER_16]: That's, um...

2299
02:34:07,388 --> 02:34:09,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need to find a new location.

2300
02:34:10,569 --> 02:34:12,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even want to remember this happened.

2301
02:34:12,871 --> 02:34:14,031
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes two of us so.

2302
02:34:14,171 --> 02:34:15,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, happy 400.

2303
02:34:15,752 --> 02:34:17,293
[SPEAKER_16]: We gotta find new real estate now.

2304
02:34:17,954 --> 02:34:19,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, see you later.

2305
02:34:19,455 --> 02:34:20,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

2306
02:34:20,755 --> 02:34:22,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Love you guys.

2307
02:34:22,556 --> 02:34:23,897
[SPEAKER_18]: That was nice.

2308
02:34:24,117 --> 02:34:25,078
[SPEAKER_18]: That was so nice.

2309
02:34:25,938 --> 02:34:30,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Only you guys could gay up this show more than I can with a Sailor Moon reference.

2310
02:34:32,542 --> 02:34:33,583
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two more emails.

2311
02:34:35,188 --> 02:34:36,068
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, thanks guys.

2312
02:34:36,428 --> 02:34:38,049
[SPEAKER_10]: This comes from Mike.

2313
02:34:39,229 --> 02:34:40,749
[SPEAKER_10]: It's subject 3DS.

2314
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:46,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I was extremely happy to hear the Final Fantasy 4 might be getting a re-release on the 3DS.

2315
02:34:46,811 --> 02:34:49,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be the main reason to get a 3DS for me.

2316
02:34:49,572 --> 02:34:55,353
[SPEAKER_10]: It has always been a three-way tie for me between 7, 6, and 4 for my favorite Final Fantasy.

2317
02:34:55,793 --> 02:34:58,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Every console I have bought was to play a Final Fantasy.

2318
02:34:58,794 --> 02:35:00,454
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation for 7, PS2 for 10, and a PS3 for 13.

2319
02:35:03,175 --> 02:35:07,137
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope that Squeenix will fix the shitstorm known as 14.

2320
02:35:08,317 --> 02:35:11,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it and it has potential, just not in its current form.

2321
02:35:11,558 --> 02:35:16,420
[SPEAKER_10]: The story is just as awesome as 11, but everything else is what it holds back.

2322
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It might have been adequate pre-wow, but now it's either clone wow or don't even try.

2323
02:35:22,622 --> 02:35:25,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for reading and making me laugh until I puke when the podcast is updated.

2324
02:35:27,825 --> 02:35:45,722
[SPEAKER_18]: you're welcome whatever you do you don't have to share pictures of that please yeah you know what though as far as like all the MMOs have to copy WoW not necessarily DC Universe seems to be doing okay and it's very different than WoW just so you know so there you go

02:36:31,380 --> 02:36:32,861
[SPEAKER_18]: The internet is for porn

2329
02:36:55,049 --> 02:36:59,373
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really appreciate you guys kind of making up our extended family here at OLR.

2330
02:37:00,034 --> 02:37:01,976
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, what else can I say?

2331
02:37:02,056 --> 02:37:03,738
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys kind of keep us motivated.

2332
02:37:04,038 --> 02:37:08,383
[SPEAKER_18]: All those days where I'm like, you know, I could be doing something else on Sunday nights.

2333
02:37:08,943 --> 02:37:11,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been goth dancing.

2334
02:37:11,185 --> 02:37:11,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2335
02:37:14,128 --> 02:37:17,250
[SPEAKER_18]: in 10 years because of OLR.

2336
02:37:17,590 --> 02:37:19,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I could go goth dancing again if I'd quit OLR.

2337
02:37:20,312 --> 02:37:26,456
[SPEAKER_18]: But then I get some email that's just awesome, you know, and it's like, oh, yeah, that's why we do OLR.

2338
02:37:27,296 --> 02:37:28,617
[SPEAKER_18]: And to watch Loki play Gal Gun.

2339
02:37:28,637 --> 02:37:29,778
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the other reason I do OLR.

2340
02:37:30,318 --> 02:37:30,698
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2341
02:37:31,539 --> 02:37:41,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though we are all sunshiny, happy, rainbowy, and, you know, fluffy kittens, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a little bit of angst in the form of the FUs of the week.

2342
02:37:56,559 --> 02:38:00,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I really didn't have an F you until, uh, tonight.

2343
02:38:01,604 --> 02:38:09,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I, F you, and this is gonna, F you to political correctness.

2344
02:38:10,832 --> 02:38:11,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it.

2345
02:38:12,514 --> 02:38:14,916
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to people getting offended over shit that has nothing to do with them.

2346
02:38:17,679 --> 02:38:18,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

2347
02:38:18,900 --> 02:38:19,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2348
02:38:20,121 --> 02:38:20,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

2349
02:38:20,681 --> 02:38:22,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, your F you of the week.

2350
02:38:24,015 --> 02:38:27,716
[SPEAKER_08]: F you not being able to read Japanese, so I hit replay level instead of continue.

2351
02:38:28,456 --> 02:38:29,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't understand that.

2352
02:38:30,337 --> 02:38:31,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to play this level again.

2353
02:38:32,938 --> 02:38:36,119
[SPEAKER_18]: My F you of the week goes to the fact that this weekend just flew by.

2354
02:38:36,219 --> 02:38:41,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, yesterday I'm at work, it feels like, and now it's all, ah, I gotta do it all again tomorrow.

2355
02:38:41,720 --> 02:38:42,440
[SPEAKER_18]: So, whatever.

2356
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:44,201
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I like my job, so, you know.

2357
02:38:44,861 --> 02:38:49,065
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2358
02:39:08,701 --> 02:39:09,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And Salacious Pop?

2359
02:39:09,521 --> 02:39:11,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Sort of a boring answer, but just F you to the economy.

2360
02:39:11,522 --> 02:39:13,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I think a lot of people are with you there.

2361
02:39:13,802 --> 02:39:15,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, there it is, the FUs of the week.

2362
02:39:37,714 --> 02:39:42,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on to just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, which is going to be interesting tonight.

2363
02:39:43,138 --> 02:39:45,960
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we'll do the Skype line as long as we can tonight.

2364
02:39:46,380 --> 02:39:52,164
[SPEAKER_18]: We might have to put a time limit on calls tonight, just so you know, because if the match game was any indication, we got a lot of people wanting to call in tonight.

2365
02:39:52,444 --> 02:39:53,605
[SPEAKER_18]: So we might have to do a little time limit.

2366
02:39:54,085 --> 02:39:57,188
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Loki, sorry, not FU, news story.

2367
02:39:58,229 --> 02:40:02,995
[SPEAKER_08]: The movie site First Showing is reporting that there's a Zombies Ate My Neighbors film in development.

2368
02:40:03,076 --> 02:40:04,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

2369
02:40:04,357 --> 02:40:10,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently based on the old 16-bit game, which I forgot is actually developed by LucasArts.

2370
02:40:10,866 --> 02:40:13,090
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome if LucasArts put that out.

2371
02:40:14,912 --> 02:40:16,133
[SPEAKER_10]: That game was great.

2372
02:40:16,713 --> 02:40:18,494
[SPEAKER_10]: There needs to be trampoline levels.

2373
02:40:18,714 --> 02:40:21,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a flick being described as a horror comedy.

2374
02:40:21,196 --> 02:40:25,578
[SPEAKER_08]: More specifically, John Hughes meets Judd Apatow meets George A. Romero.

2375
02:40:26,879 --> 02:40:29,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I think it'd be an excellent movie.

2376
02:40:30,061 --> 02:40:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole thing was a parody on kind of the horror genre anyways.

2377
02:40:32,902 --> 02:40:38,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was absolutely ridiculous with like 50 foot tall babies and zombies and werewolves.

2378
02:40:38,726 --> 02:40:40,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there were aliens in there as well.

2379
02:40:41,553 --> 02:40:45,155
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game that I should have played but just missed completely and I still have no idea why.

2380
02:40:45,375 --> 02:40:46,856
[SPEAKER_03]: But I definitely remember the hype around it.

2381
02:40:46,916 --> 02:40:47,717
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on Virtual Console.

2382
02:40:47,737 --> 02:40:48,197
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

2383
02:40:48,898 --> 02:40:49,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a Wii, but yeah.

2384
02:40:49,638 --> 02:40:51,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, did you just pimp Nintendo's Virtual Console?

2385
02:40:51,619 --> 02:40:52,120
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you did.

2386
02:40:53,621 --> 02:40:55,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they put out some games.

2387
02:40:55,462 --> 02:40:56,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They just stopped now.

2388
02:40:56,963 --> 02:40:57,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to call you on it.

2389
02:40:57,903 --> 02:40:58,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

2390
02:40:58,343 --> 02:40:58,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, fine.

2391
02:40:58,724 --> 02:40:59,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Download the ROM.

2392
02:40:59,844 --> 02:41:00,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck paying them money.

2393
02:41:02,352 --> 02:41:02,732
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2394
02:41:03,513 --> 02:41:05,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Now there's the Loki answer I was looking for.

2395
02:41:06,435 --> 02:41:07,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it could make a cool movie.

2396
02:41:07,696 --> 02:41:13,260
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if they kind of don't try to keep it as the video game, I think the name has enough recognition.

2397
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:13,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keep the story.

2398
02:41:14,020 --> 02:41:15,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't even bother.

2399
02:41:15,862 --> 02:41:21,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's enough people that just would have no idea there was even a game that exists that would go see the movie.

2400
02:41:21,466 --> 02:41:25,209
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you would get the game again because it would tie into the movie.

2401
02:41:25,229 --> 02:41:27,130
[SPEAKER_18]: But, of course, movie tie-in games always suck.

2402
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:34,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the thing, though, about it, though, is you don't even need to, like, have game times, because the whole thing is just basically a spoof of, like, the horror genre.

2403
02:41:34,995 --> 02:41:45,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically, it's like Monster Squad, actually, a little bit, because it's all the shit, horrible things that can happen in, like, horror movies all happening at once.

2404
02:41:46,283 --> 02:41:56,269
[SPEAKER_08]: There's zombies attacking, there's evil dolls, there's werewolves, there's giant babies, there's, I think there were giant ants and stuff, like, all sorts of crazy shit going down all at once.

2405
02:41:57,830 --> 02:42:20,602
[SPEAKER_03]: what you need well it seems like the theme of it was all of the um all of the really awful horror movies that came out in the 50s that were all metaphors for communism the giant ants and whatever yeah exactly yeah right all right i played through that whole game that had like i think there was like over 100 levels in the game it was ridiculous

2406
02:42:23,576 --> 02:42:28,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Beatles, or at least one of them.

2407
02:42:29,159 --> 02:42:33,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Ringo Starr, one of the ones that's still left and still kicking.

2408
02:42:33,961 --> 02:42:38,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Ringo Starr apparently has...

2409
02:42:39,563 --> 02:42:43,905
[SPEAKER_18]: registered a trademark that indicates that his name has been trademarked.

2410
02:42:44,146 --> 02:42:55,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Ringo, his name, has been trademarked for downloadable computer games via the internet and wireless devices, toys, namely toy vehicles, plush toys, pet toys, and skateboards.

2411
02:42:56,812 --> 02:42:59,754
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have no idea if Ringo is going to start getting into skateboarding.

2412
02:43:00,074 --> 02:43:01,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Daddy, I want the Ringo vehicle.

2413
02:43:02,477 --> 02:43:03,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Which seems a little odd to me.

2414
02:43:03,499 --> 02:43:09,467
[SPEAKER_18]: I would understand if there was a Ringo music game or something coming, like a drumming on your iPad type of thing.

2415
02:43:09,927 --> 02:43:11,529
[SPEAKER_18]: But skateboards and pet toys?

2416
02:43:11,930 --> 02:43:14,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Clearly he's trying to protect the name from something.

2417
02:43:15,014 --> 02:43:16,316
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what this strikes me as.

2418
02:43:16,916 --> 02:43:21,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Ringo could kind of be like, I don't know, like a new ring toss game or something.

2419
02:43:21,678 --> 02:43:21,998
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2420
02:43:22,658 --> 02:43:23,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll with me here.

2421
02:43:23,578 --> 02:43:27,140
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be some new game and maybe he doesn't want to lose that on his name.

2422
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:28,640
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe that's why he trades market.

2423
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:32,502
[SPEAKER_18]: But then again, are you allowed to trademark something if you don't have a plan to use it?

2424
02:43:33,002 --> 02:43:33,442
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess so.

2425
02:43:33,482 --> 02:43:35,003
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of squatters and so forth.

2426
02:43:36,643 --> 02:43:41,825
[SPEAKER_18]: By the way, of course, the attorney has been asked on why Ringo Starr trademarked the name and no comment.

2427
02:43:43,055 --> 02:43:43,535
[SPEAKER_18]: No comment.

2428
02:43:44,635 --> 02:43:49,377
[SPEAKER_18]: The last time Ringo was heard in a video game news story, it was with the Beatles rock band.

2429
02:43:49,737 --> 02:43:55,559
[SPEAKER_18]: He was talking to Jimmy Fallon about it and said, the graphics are great, I love the game, I love the music, but it's for young folk.

2430
02:43:57,379 --> 02:44:01,720
[SPEAKER_18]: His 15th studio album came out last year called Why Not?

2431
02:44:03,101 --> 02:44:03,461
Why not?

2432
02:44:04,501 --> 02:44:05,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Make a video game?

2433
02:44:05,301 --> 02:44:05,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

2434
02:44:06,462 --> 02:44:07,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Ringo skateboards?

2435
02:44:07,362 --> 02:44:07,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, why not?

2436
02:44:08,542 --> 02:44:08,962
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

2437
02:44:09,443 --> 02:44:11,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you buy a Ringo skateboard, Slicerspot?

2438
02:44:13,146 --> 02:44:16,587
[SPEAKER_03]: If I didn't have the self-esteem to buy the Tony Hawk one, then yes.

2439
02:44:17,888 --> 02:44:20,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta keep the bar low sometimes.

2440
02:44:20,749 --> 02:44:25,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well of course there's the folks in chatroom that are coming up with all these Ringo games.

2441
02:44:25,890 --> 02:44:28,051
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTest Studio says RingoStars Pro Skater.

2442
02:44:28,971 --> 02:44:31,212
[SPEAKER_18]: Frisbee says RingoStars Wasteland.

2443
02:44:31,672 --> 02:44:33,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Frisbee, RingoStar Underground.

2444
02:44:34,173 --> 02:44:37,654
[SPEAKER_18]: SSJ100Matt is bringing up that Sarah Palin filed a copyright on her name.

2445
02:44:39,235 --> 02:44:41,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that mean they can keep making the Nalen Palin?

2446
02:44:41,396 --> 02:44:43,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Or is that illegal now?

2447
02:44:43,438 --> 02:44:44,318
[SPEAKER_18]: The Palin porns.

2448
02:44:44,678 --> 02:44:45,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you seen these?

2449
02:44:46,159 --> 02:44:49,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Sarah Palin like rejuvenated the porn industry.

2450
02:44:49,602 --> 02:44:50,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you know that?

2451
02:44:51,104 --> 02:44:55,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's that one actress that looks exactly like her that's like, yes, this is my moment.

2452
02:44:55,928 --> 02:44:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Who, Tina Fey?

2453
02:44:57,829 --> 02:44:58,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Tina Fey.

2454
02:45:00,071 --> 02:45:06,356
[SPEAKER_18]: But she could do this Nalen Palin and then just roll right over and do the 30 Rock porn.

2455
02:45:06,517 --> 02:45:11,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they make those really awful Deer Hunter games for PC that are like $9.99 brand new

2456
02:45:13,442 --> 02:45:14,643
[SPEAKER_03]: They always come out with a new version.

2457
02:45:14,663 --> 02:45:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: She should just license that.

2458
02:45:15,783 --> 02:45:16,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Except it'll be Moose Hunter.

2459
02:45:16,824 --> 02:45:17,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah Palin's Moose Hunter.

2460
02:45:18,805 --> 02:45:19,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Available.

2461
02:45:19,265 --> 02:45:19,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Wolf Hunter.

2462
02:45:20,786 --> 02:45:22,127
[SPEAKER_10]: But that one would have to be a helicopter game.

2463
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:25,941
[SPEAKER_18]: DungeonBuster in our chat room is suggesting Ringo ate my neighbors.

2464
02:45:27,702 --> 02:45:28,983
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a possible video game.

2465
02:45:29,563 --> 02:45:32,345
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Skype line is open.

2466
02:45:32,805 --> 02:45:38,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Launch Radio on Skype or our Skype line phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2467
02:45:38,348 --> 02:45:42,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Please don't be offended if we move through your calls quickly tonight because I think there's a lot of people that want to get in.

2468
02:45:42,870 --> 02:45:50,394
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki, while we wait for the calls coming because there is about a minute and a half delay between time we say something and the time folks hear it as it encodes through the interwebs.

2469
02:45:50,814 --> 02:45:52,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories for us tonight?

2470
02:45:53,335 --> 02:46:21,007
[SPEAKER_08]: um yeah let's see other than uh we talked a little bit about how Linux is making its return to 3.41 uh you can also get Linux via the custom firmware 3.55 it's a bestest it's not quite as awesome as the uber Linux that's on 3.41 but uh you know beggars can't be choosers I guess um let's see other fun stuff we can talk about here um

2471
02:46:23,643 --> 02:46:35,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, the phone number is 1-877-GAME, O-L-R, G-A-M-E-O-L-R Or, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio And the phones are starting to light up Let's get to them Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2472
02:46:37,354 --> 02:46:42,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, this is Red the Haze from Houston, Texas Red the Haze, congrats, you're the first one to get through tonight What's on your mind, buddy?

2473
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:49,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd like to greet you a happy Chinese New Year If you didn't notice, it's this weekend

2474
02:46:50,351 --> 02:46:51,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that's right.

2475
02:46:51,433 --> 02:46:53,235
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally, it slipped my mind.

2476
02:46:53,576 --> 02:46:59,404
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I had an ex who was Chinese and it was kind of, you know, it didn't go so well.

2477
02:46:59,484 --> 02:47:02,208
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've had to block a lot of that out of my mind.

2478
02:47:02,268 --> 02:47:02,909
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's okay.

2479
02:47:02,969 --> 02:47:04,010
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's just, you know.

2480
02:47:05,603 --> 02:47:09,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not Chinese, I was in a club last night where they had line dancers there Line dancing?

2481
02:47:32,588 --> 02:47:37,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, line dancing, like dragon dancing, you know, but it was kind of weird.

2482
02:47:37,751 --> 02:47:45,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I was thinking because you said you were from eastern Texas, maybe they do the whole, like, you know, country line dancing, the whole, like, electric slide and all that stuff.

2483
02:47:45,095 --> 02:47:45,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Yee-haw!

2484
02:47:47,316 --> 02:47:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a lot of Asians down there, so we got an Asian thing down there.

2485
02:47:52,059 --> 02:47:52,419
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all right.

2486
02:47:52,439 --> 02:47:53,520
[SPEAKER_18]: We live in northern California.

2487
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:54,660
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same story here.

2488
02:47:56,822 --> 02:47:57,102
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2489
02:47:57,142 --> 02:47:59,103
[SPEAKER_18]: So what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?

2490
02:48:00,846 --> 02:48:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, regarding to the Super Bowl, I was talking to my girlfriend who works for a Canadian cable provider, and she's been getting a lot of calls about the Super Bowl up there, and it seems that a lot of people from Canada are complaining that they're not getting the U.S.

2491
02:48:21,532 --> 02:48:22,132
[SPEAKER_06]: commercials.

2492
02:48:24,484 --> 02:48:25,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Weird.

2493
02:48:25,564 --> 02:48:32,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, you gotta tread lightly with Super Bowl chat around here because that is our competition tonight for our landmark episode.

2494
02:48:32,406 --> 02:48:34,626
[SPEAKER_18]: But Canada getting ripped off.

2495
02:48:34,706 --> 02:48:36,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Canada getting the big shaft.

2496
02:48:36,287 --> 02:48:37,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now that's interesting to me.

2497
02:48:38,107 --> 02:48:41,788
[SPEAKER_18]: So why would Canada... Because, you know, what did Canada do to deserve that?

2498
02:48:41,808 --> 02:48:43,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you find big shafts interesting?

2499
02:48:43,128 --> 02:48:43,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

2500
02:48:43,708 --> 02:48:46,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Why did Canada... What did Canada do to deserve that?

2501
02:48:47,209 --> 02:48:50,710
[SPEAKER_18]: They just sit up there and they're all peaceful, making maple...

2502
02:48:51,850 --> 02:48:52,791
[SPEAKER_10]: They're free healthcare.

2503
02:48:53,011 --> 02:48:53,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

2504
02:48:53,991 --> 02:48:54,811
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hurting no one.

2505
02:48:54,971 --> 02:48:57,873
[SPEAKER_03]: If Doritos spent $30 million on a commercial, they should see it.

2506
02:48:58,473 --> 02:48:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2507
02:48:59,493 --> 02:49:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that popular these days.

2508
02:49:02,074 --> 02:49:02,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

2509
02:49:02,815 --> 02:49:08,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, maybe something's going on where the Canadian broadcaster wanted to sell their own damn commercials.

2510
02:49:08,537 --> 02:49:11,398
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, can't your Canadian friends just go on YouTube and see the same shit?

2511
02:49:11,498 --> 02:49:13,899
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that's how I watch stupid bull commercials.

2512
02:49:14,761 --> 02:49:17,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what they've been instructed to tell them.

2513
02:49:17,322 --> 02:49:18,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go on the internet.

2514
02:49:19,524 --> 02:49:22,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It just comes off as that.

2515
02:49:22,085 --> 02:49:24,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet exists for that kind of thing, you know?

2516
02:49:24,806 --> 02:49:25,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Also for porn.

2517
02:49:26,207 --> 02:49:27,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now here's my question.

2518
02:49:27,488 --> 02:49:29,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Was Betty White in any of the commercials this year?

2519
02:49:33,157 --> 02:49:34,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2520
02:49:34,718 --> 02:49:35,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't watching.

2521
02:49:35,299 --> 02:49:36,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Dead Space and listening to you guys.

2522
02:49:36,980 --> 02:49:37,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

2523
02:49:59,724 --> 02:50:02,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to congratulate you guys on the 400th episode.

2524
02:50:02,165 --> 02:50:04,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a long-time listener, first-time caller.

2525
02:50:05,626 --> 02:50:06,466
[SPEAKER_18]: My favorite line.

2526
02:50:06,506 --> 02:50:06,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2527
02:50:07,246 --> 02:50:07,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.

2528
02:50:07,826 --> 02:50:09,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you so much for calling the show.

2529
02:50:09,327 --> 02:50:10,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Really appreciate it.

2530
02:50:10,307 --> 02:50:13,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Quickly, what video game... Oh, you already said Dead Space.

2531
02:50:13,168 --> 02:50:14,668
[SPEAKER_18]: What other video games have you been playing this week?

2532
02:50:16,809 --> 02:50:17,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Mag.

2533
02:50:17,909 --> 02:50:19,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to trash talk about it.

2534
02:50:19,870 --> 02:50:21,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with people regularly on it.

2535
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:25,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I've spent 300 hours on it.

2536
02:50:25,451 --> 02:50:26,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, my gosh.

2537
02:50:26,612 --> 02:50:27,832
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a Mag 2 on the way, isn't there?

2538
02:50:29,758 --> 02:50:31,820
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're playing on the PS3.

2539
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:38,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to jump to Homefront, which sounds like a better deal, considering that the multiplayer has better incentives.

2540
02:50:39,246 --> 02:50:40,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Call of Duty.

2541
02:50:41,027 --> 02:50:42,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to keep an eye out for that.

2542
02:50:42,649 --> 02:50:44,790
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, I've got to get to other calls, but thank you so much for the call.

2543
02:50:45,171 --> 02:50:46,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Congrats on getting through first on your first call.

2544
02:50:46,792 --> 02:50:47,633
[SPEAKER_18]: That's quite an accomplishment.

2545
02:50:48,173 --> 02:50:48,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Take care, buddy.

2546
02:50:48,613 --> 02:50:49,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2547
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:53,562
[SPEAKER_18]: STO 100 Matt in our chat room is confirming Betty White was in one of the commercials.

2548
02:50:53,762 --> 02:50:54,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I need to know.

2549
02:50:54,942 --> 02:50:56,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Who won the volleyballs?

2550
02:50:56,243 --> 02:50:56,883
[SPEAKER_18]: By what score?

2551
02:50:56,903 --> 02:50:57,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Should I ask?

2552
02:50:58,004 --> 02:50:58,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't.

2553
02:50:58,524 --> 02:51:00,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the green people.

2554
02:51:01,045 --> 02:51:01,745
[SPEAKER_18]: The cheese heads?

2555
02:51:02,286 --> 02:51:02,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2556
02:51:02,626 --> 02:51:05,547
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the cheesy people won by like three points or something.

2557
02:51:05,727 --> 02:51:05,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2558
02:51:06,167 --> 02:51:06,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2559
02:51:07,088 --> 02:51:10,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have bets going on the Super Bowl or something?

2560
02:51:10,489 --> 02:51:10,989
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2561
02:51:11,009 --> 02:51:13,751
[SPEAKER_18]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.

2562
02:51:13,771 --> 02:51:14,031
[SPEAKER_18]: Watch.

2563
02:51:14,071 --> 02:51:17,732
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally probably got that wrong and everybody in chat is going to be like, Rob, you're so dumb.

2564
02:51:18,153 --> 02:51:18,433
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2565
02:51:21,033 --> 02:51:31,899
[SPEAKER_18]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio SSJ100Matt says the NFL Network commercial with the different TV shows wait a minute, does that count?

2566
02:51:33,640 --> 02:51:45,467
[SPEAKER_18]: showing like a two I think showing a two second clip of Hot in Cleveland might not count although I will say that show is pretty fucking funny but meanwhile we have another show on the line or another show, another call on the line hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2567
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:47,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god, Rob.

2568
02:51:47,751 --> 02:51:48,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob, it's Ranma.

2569
02:51:48,532 --> 02:51:50,434
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a bone to pick with you right now.

2570
02:51:50,695 --> 02:51:50,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2571
02:51:51,837 --> 02:51:54,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Where do you get off saying that we gave up the show?

2572
02:51:55,240 --> 02:51:57,442
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you have no right to do that.

2573
02:51:57,622 --> 02:52:00,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't make me get nasty up in here because I will, girlfriend.

2574
02:52:00,565 --> 02:52:00,885
[SPEAKER_16]: I will.

2575
02:52:01,826 --> 02:52:02,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, you didn't.

2576
02:52:02,967 --> 02:52:04,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I did.

2577
02:52:04,689 --> 02:52:06,270
[SPEAKER_17]: You did not call into this show.

2578
02:52:07,531 --> 02:52:08,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I did.

2579
02:52:08,772 --> 02:52:11,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't make me because I got my hag right here.

2580
02:52:11,455 --> 02:52:13,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Yo, we will bring it, sister.

2581
02:52:13,116 --> 02:52:15,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Girl, I will pull that weave.

2582
02:52:15,258 --> 02:52:17,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I will pull that weave right on out of your head.

2583
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:21,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll rip that pulse while I'm picking it already is, alright?

2584
02:52:21,501 --> 02:52:22,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not the one.

2585
02:52:22,641 --> 02:52:23,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I am not the one.

2586
02:52:24,502 --> 02:52:25,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, girl.

2587
02:52:31,583 --> 02:52:32,983
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to... Yes, I do.

2588
02:52:33,063 --> 02:52:33,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I do.

2589
02:52:33,703 --> 02:52:36,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold my earrings, alright?

2590
02:52:36,404 --> 02:52:37,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Hold my earrings.

2591
02:52:37,444 --> 02:52:41,385
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to admit, the Sailor Moon thing, a little bit gay.

2592
02:52:41,685 --> 02:52:42,405
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit gay.

2593
02:52:43,145 --> 02:52:43,986
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can say that.

2594
02:52:45,166 --> 02:52:45,306
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

2595
02:52:46,536 --> 02:52:48,258
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2596
02:53:06,235 --> 02:53:10,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, you ever play RPGs and you give the characters names?

2597
02:53:11,580 --> 02:53:14,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I tend to name them after the various anime characters and so forth.

2598
02:53:15,363 --> 02:53:20,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, what are the craziest names you've given the characters?

2599
02:53:21,280 --> 02:53:28,022
[SPEAKER_18]: My Final Fantasy 1 party was probably fuck, fart, poop, and ass.

2600
02:53:30,003 --> 02:53:34,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of Final Fantasy, my roommate's playing through the four heroes of light.

2601
02:53:34,884 --> 02:53:39,325
[SPEAKER_16]: He named the main hero Dipshit and named the princess Gonorrhea.

2602
02:53:39,745 --> 02:53:45,147
[SPEAKER_16]: He's at the scene where the king tells him, Dipshit, go find my Gonorrhea right now.

2603
02:53:47,313 --> 02:53:48,094
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2604
02:54:06,610 --> 02:54:07,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2605
02:54:23,106 --> 02:54:38,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Oregon Trail is the first game of people of this generation that really were able to do that with the names but in Final Fantasy 7 if you give Aerith in particular the most raunchiest name you could think of, lols for days you will get your money's worth

2606
02:54:41,079 --> 02:54:45,204
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like the trend is like you get the lulls off of any of the Final Fantasy games.

2607
02:54:45,264 --> 02:54:46,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Like my roommate played Tactics.

2608
02:54:47,567 --> 02:54:50,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what the character's name was.

2609
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:51,111
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was Head.

2610
02:54:51,892 --> 02:54:54,796
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the scenes where the guard's like, you will give us Head now.

2611
02:54:57,899 --> 02:54:59,822
[SPEAKER_16]: And what possessed this question?

2612
02:55:02,569 --> 02:55:13,401
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, I'm just, we're just watching TV, you know, and my roommate's telling me he's playing the game and he's showing me this, and I'm like, I wonder if the OLR peeps have ever done this.

2613
02:55:13,922 --> 02:55:16,705
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just throwing something out there for good conversation.

2614
02:55:17,005 --> 02:55:17,646
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's all good.

2615
02:55:18,477 --> 02:55:19,638
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll have to excuse me.

2616
02:55:19,658 --> 02:55:23,361
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm tearing up a little bit.

2617
02:55:24,402 --> 02:55:28,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Flaming Clint just died.

2618
02:55:28,325 --> 02:55:32,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I cheered.

2619
02:55:34,010 --> 02:55:39,174
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really tragic because I used Flaming Clint as my healer in the party.

2620
02:55:40,135 --> 02:55:44,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't believe that Sephiroth just went and stabbed Flaming Clint right through the abdomen.

2621
02:55:44,658 --> 02:55:44,879
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just...

2622
02:55:45,848 --> 02:55:46,569
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just wrong.

2623
02:55:46,889 --> 02:55:47,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Right in the middle.

2624
02:55:47,909 --> 02:55:48,690
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just wrong.

2625
02:55:50,071 --> 02:55:51,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Flaming Clint, I love you.

2626
02:55:56,535 --> 02:55:56,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you happy now?

2627
02:55:57,036 --> 02:55:57,676
[SPEAKER_16]: You wrong, man.

2628
02:55:57,896 --> 02:55:58,417
[SPEAKER_16]: You wrong.

2629
02:55:58,777 --> 02:55:59,738
[SPEAKER_16]: Funny, but wrong.

2630
02:56:01,699 --> 02:56:04,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Ranma?

2631
02:56:04,621 --> 02:56:05,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Not necessarily.

2632
02:56:05,522 --> 02:56:07,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, um, Sakura-chan.

2633
02:56:08,224 --> 02:56:08,424
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

2634
02:56:08,484 --> 02:56:09,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

2635
02:56:10,085 --> 02:56:11,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Jovedaya says hi.

2636
02:56:12,106 --> 02:56:12,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

2637
02:56:13,107 --> 02:56:14,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy birthday, Jovedaya.

2638
02:56:14,878 --> 02:56:15,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday.

2639
02:56:19,263 --> 02:56:19,864
[SPEAKER_10]: She heard.

2640
02:56:20,885 --> 02:56:21,306
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2641
02:56:21,586 --> 02:56:23,068
[SPEAKER_18]: We got to get some more calls, Ranma.

2642
02:56:23,308 --> 02:56:24,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one, buddy.

2643
02:56:25,270 --> 02:56:25,551
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2644
02:56:27,775 --> 02:56:31,978
[SPEAKER_18]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2645
02:56:33,019 --> 02:56:34,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Skype line is open right now.

2646
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:35,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Look what happens on calls.

2647
02:56:35,481 --> 02:56:35,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, look.

2648
02:56:36,982 --> 02:56:40,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Every gamer has a voice and sometimes that voice takes us right to the crapper.

2649
02:56:40,946 --> 02:56:43,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you hear my crying in the other room?

2650
02:56:43,448 --> 02:56:44,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yes, you did.

2651
02:56:44,749 --> 02:56:45,769
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have family over to you.

2652
02:56:47,330 --> 02:56:47,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, good.

2653
02:56:48,851 --> 02:56:49,992
[SPEAKER_18]: The kids aren't visiting today?

2654
02:56:50,813 --> 02:56:51,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, just Jamie?

2655
02:56:51,674 --> 02:56:52,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, well, screw her.

2656
02:56:52,774 --> 02:56:53,055
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2657
02:56:55,717 --> 02:56:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he can't do that right now because we're doing the show.

2658
02:56:58,839 --> 02:56:59,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

2659
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:00,341
[SPEAKER_18]: I love our chatters.

2660
02:57:00,841 --> 02:57:05,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Brad from Prod Culture in chat just said, so he pierced Flaming Clit?

2661
02:57:09,968 --> 02:57:13,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God, I love the listeners.

2662
02:57:15,191 --> 02:57:19,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, it's Marissa Hi Marissa Welcome to the program

2663
02:57:33,277 --> 02:57:33,957
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

2664
02:57:33,977 --> 02:57:35,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how are you guys doing?

2665
02:57:35,238 --> 02:57:36,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like fun over there.

2666
02:57:36,999 --> 02:57:42,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good, but I'm... I had an emotional moment a minute ago, but I'm all better.

2667
02:57:43,543 --> 02:57:47,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, I figured out... Seriously, Rob was shaking and crying.

2668
02:57:47,946 --> 02:57:48,586
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I did.

2669
02:57:49,067 --> 02:57:52,829
[SPEAKER_18]: I just figured out how to unlock the safe and get Smelly dumped to join my party.

2670
02:57:54,110 --> 02:57:55,030
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm okay now.

2671
02:57:58,573 --> 02:58:00,255
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned Oregon Trail earlier.

2672
02:58:00,275 --> 02:58:01,476
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to join my trail.

2673
02:58:01,977 --> 02:58:03,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually sounds kind of dirty.

2674
02:58:03,859 --> 02:58:04,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a freaking Facebook team.

2675
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:06,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I have you join my party so you can die of dysentery.

2676
02:58:07,744 --> 02:58:08,744
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a Facebook game now.

2677
02:58:08,784 --> 02:58:13,086
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually tried the game on Facebook this week and it's weird.

2678
02:58:13,806 --> 02:58:15,206
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not what I remember.

2679
02:58:15,306 --> 02:58:16,367
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so different.

2680
02:58:16,447 --> 02:58:20,988
[SPEAKER_18]: It's trying to invite your friends and it is exactly what I thought.

2681
02:58:21,068 --> 02:58:26,549
[SPEAKER_18]: You can name your party members after Facebook friends and then spam their walls when they die of dysentery and so forth.

2682
02:58:27,990 --> 02:58:34,131
[SPEAKER_04]: All they're trying to do is milk the Facebook point system because basically to survive the game you have to give them actual money.

2683
02:58:35,432 --> 02:58:35,612
[SPEAKER_04]: But

2684
02:58:37,314 --> 02:58:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything of an important relevance to say other than typing jokes and boob references right now but I want to wish you a happy 400th and I'm so excited your show makes my week and you two have to come down here soon and visit

2685
02:58:52,007 --> 02:58:52,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I really do.

2686
02:58:53,247 --> 02:58:55,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to come stay with you on the 13th.

2687
02:58:56,328 --> 02:59:02,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I may have a week off in June suddenly where I'm doing nothing and I had planned to come to LA.

2688
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:05,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, what an invitation it is.

2689
02:59:05,311 --> 02:59:06,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have shit to do, I guess.

2690
02:59:07,051 --> 02:59:07,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see you.

2691
02:59:08,372 --> 02:59:12,233
[SPEAKER_18]: This news bulletin just in, E3 has been moved into Marissa's pants.

2692
02:59:12,393 --> 02:59:12,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

2693
02:59:13,333 --> 02:59:14,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, it's a party!

2694
02:59:15,034 --> 02:59:18,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and by the way, Marissa, I'm very sorry to do this to you.

2695
02:59:19,115 --> 02:59:19,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

2696
02:59:20,143 --> 02:59:20,663
[SPEAKER_18]: What is this?

2697
02:59:20,943 --> 02:59:21,504
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you doing?

2698
02:59:22,805 --> 02:59:25,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Why didn't you warn me before you heard me?

2699
02:59:25,247 --> 02:59:26,327
[SPEAKER_18]: Take that, Vuvuzela.

2700
02:59:26,347 --> 02:59:29,870
[SPEAKER_09]: By request of the chat room.

2701
02:59:31,311 --> 02:59:31,912
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that?

2702
02:59:32,032 --> 02:59:32,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get it.

2703
02:59:33,113 --> 02:59:39,798
[SPEAKER_18]: It's her stupid Vuvuzela app on the iPhone that I hate, and whoever made that can die in a boat fire.

2704
02:59:39,818 --> 02:59:41,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, SSJ100Matt.

2705
02:59:41,739 --> 02:59:45,783
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to have to play the melodica for me sometime.

2706
02:59:46,721 --> 02:59:48,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing my melodica.

2707
02:59:48,582 --> 02:59:49,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

2708
02:59:49,922 --> 02:59:50,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll play it on the show.

2709
02:59:50,742 --> 02:59:56,564
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope that you need to learn how to play Aerith's theme on the melodica so I can cry.

2710
02:59:58,084 --> 03:00:07,647
[SPEAKER_18]: But Marissa, I hope you're able to come up to the show and bring your assets, your big, voluptuous brain, of course I mean, back to the show.

2711
03:00:08,287 --> 03:00:10,308
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, congrats.

2712
03:00:10,728 --> 03:00:13,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, may there be 400 more.

2713
03:00:14,409 --> 03:00:14,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2714
03:00:14,809 --> 03:00:15,349
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll try.

2715
03:00:15,470 --> 03:00:16,470
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be old, but we'll try.

2716
03:00:16,890 --> 03:00:17,931
[SPEAKER_18]: Marissa, have a wonderful night.

2717
03:00:17,951 --> 03:00:18,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for calling.

2718
03:00:19,011 --> 03:00:19,251
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2719
03:00:19,271 --> 03:00:19,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat soon.

2720
03:00:19,932 --> 03:00:20,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2721
03:00:24,274 --> 03:00:24,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Ciao.

2722
03:00:24,594 --> 03:00:26,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I played my melodica on air.

2723
03:00:27,915 --> 03:00:31,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I have wanted a melodica forever, and Marissa got me a melodica, and I love it to death.

2724
03:00:31,537 --> 03:00:32,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you play chopsticks?

2725
03:00:34,038 --> 03:00:34,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, wait.

2726
03:00:34,478 --> 03:00:35,579
[SPEAKER_18]: She's going to try and play chopsticks.

2727
03:00:35,599 --> 03:00:35,899
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we go.

2728
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:38,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.

2729
03:00:38,520 --> 03:00:38,921
[SPEAKER_17]: You can do it.

2730
03:00:47,290 --> 03:00:47,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember.

2731
03:00:48,070 --> 03:00:49,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember how to play this.

2732
03:00:49,870 --> 03:00:52,071
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm throwing up the horns.

2733
03:00:52,111 --> 03:00:53,351
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to go to rock.

2734
03:00:53,611 --> 03:00:53,871
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

2735
03:00:53,891 --> 03:00:56,332
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to write the new OLR theme song on the melodica.

2736
03:00:59,753 --> 03:01:00,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

2737
03:01:00,853 --> 03:01:02,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Now you need to put that thing away.

2738
03:01:04,174 --> 03:01:05,054
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, put it away.

2739
03:01:06,055 --> 03:01:07,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, put it away.

2740
03:01:10,516 --> 03:01:12,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to play Final Fantasy stuff.

2741
03:01:12,537 --> 03:01:15,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Butterfly, Dom Dom Aram, any of the Romani classics.

2742
03:01:15,377 --> 03:01:17,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, can you do Dom Dom Aram, Dom Dom Aram.

2743
03:01:17,598 --> 03:01:18,558
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, look, we got another call.

2744
03:01:18,918 --> 03:01:20,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2745
03:01:20,258 --> 03:01:20,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's this?

2746
03:01:22,179 --> 03:01:23,099
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are old.

2747
03:01:23,139 --> 03:01:24,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I should be talking to you.

2748
03:01:25,379 --> 03:01:26,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bobby.

2749
03:01:26,159 --> 03:01:27,240
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, my friend?

2750
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:28,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

2751
03:01:28,520 --> 03:01:28,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only $278, $400.

2752
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like past the hill.

2753
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:29,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2754
03:01:35,830 --> 03:01:37,771
[SPEAKER_18]: We fell off the earth, actually.

2755
03:01:37,851 --> 03:01:39,192
[SPEAKER_18]: We're that far past the hill.

2756
03:01:39,292 --> 03:01:39,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2757
03:01:39,772 --> 03:01:40,593
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what to tell you.

2758
03:01:41,213 --> 03:01:44,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And you notice how I was like, I was going to call in next and then Ranma called.

2759
03:01:45,336 --> 03:01:49,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I let somebody else go in between because I know I can't follow that up.

2760
03:01:49,438 --> 03:01:49,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

2761
03:01:50,039 --> 03:01:50,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

2762
03:01:52,529 --> 03:01:55,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Ranma always brings a certain something special to the show.

2763
03:01:55,490 --> 03:01:56,870
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what else to say.

2764
03:01:57,590 --> 03:01:59,451
[SPEAKER_18]: But I will say, I also own a melodica.

2765
03:01:59,851 --> 03:02:00,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you?

2766
03:02:00,251 --> 03:02:00,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God.

2767
03:02:00,791 --> 03:02:01,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2768
03:02:01,972 --> 03:02:03,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, now we might have this whole week off.

2769
03:02:03,852 --> 03:02:04,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Bobby, we need a duet.

2770
03:02:05,053 --> 03:02:09,934
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have this week off in June where we're not doing anything, so maybe we need to have melodica con.

2771
03:02:10,414 --> 03:02:17,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to know how to play the whole opera thing from Final Fantasy VI.

2772
03:02:17,258 --> 03:02:18,619
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I was trying to remember how to play.

2773
03:02:19,099 --> 03:02:20,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Except it's in a bizarre key.

2774
03:02:21,201 --> 03:02:22,562
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was like, I don't remember!

2775
03:02:24,525 --> 03:02:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2776
03:02:24,805 --> 03:02:25,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.

2777
03:02:44,643 --> 03:02:57,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a 32-key, I think, soprano melodica from Marissa, who has been with me when I've gone to several music stores looking for melodicas.

2778
03:02:58,073 --> 03:02:59,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know what's next on the list?

2779
03:03:00,889 --> 03:03:01,469
[SPEAKER_10]: An auto harp.

2780
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:03,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Or a theremin.

2781
03:03:03,650 --> 03:03:05,071
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to say, when are you getting a theremin?

2782
03:03:05,091 --> 03:03:06,031
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought you wanted a theremin.

2783
03:03:06,071 --> 03:03:08,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want a theremin, but I can afford an auto harp.

2784
03:03:08,332 --> 03:03:13,795
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that Bobby is one of the biggest band nerds I know, but I don't think he called in to talk about melodicas tonight.

2785
03:03:13,835 --> 03:03:14,695
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind, Bobby?

2786
03:03:15,535 --> 03:03:25,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I got home from where I went tonight and wanted to wish you guys happy 400th because I didn't create any audio like I said I would because I'm a bad person.

2787
03:03:25,319 --> 03:03:27,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to do audio for the last FNG, so it's all good.

2788
03:03:28,421 --> 03:03:28,581
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

2789
03:03:29,661 --> 03:03:31,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, thank you so much for the call.

2790
03:03:31,421 --> 03:03:33,742
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, a big thank you, Bobby.

2791
03:03:34,302 --> 03:03:37,903
[SPEAKER_18]: This show almost died a few years ago, actually.

2792
03:03:38,183 --> 03:03:47,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And when Live 365 kind of made it impossible for us to keep continuing to do a radio station with kind of the new unrealistic rates that they were going to charge for our audience.

2793
03:03:47,925 --> 03:03:51,566
[SPEAKER_18]: And you were obviously really the person who...

2794
03:03:52,006 --> 03:04:13,715
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean other folks might try to take credit for it but you were the guy that brought us to All Games Radio a couple years before and helped kind of facilitate us coming on in a more you know kind of permanent way where our live show is now kind of exclusively here so for that we and the rest of the OLR listeners really thank you for helping this show reach 400 because otherwise it probably would have ended around 278 so

2795
03:04:15,819 --> 03:04:24,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome, and you guys are keeping me on because all your listeners tune in early to me, and so I can use that as my numbers even though they're not really listening to me.

2796
03:04:25,106 --> 03:04:25,646
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's awesome.

2797
03:04:25,666 --> 03:04:26,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It works both ways.

2798
03:04:26,427 --> 03:04:30,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Bobby, I hate to say it, but sadly we don't even have 8,000 people tuning in, so I don't know what you're going to do.

2799
03:04:32,191 --> 03:04:34,072
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't gotten my rejection letter yet.

2800
03:04:34,192 --> 03:04:34,653
[SPEAKER_18]: You're waiting.

2801
03:04:35,593 --> 03:04:35,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby.

2802
03:04:36,193 --> 03:04:36,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm prepared.

2803
03:04:37,274 --> 03:04:37,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby.

2804
03:04:38,234 --> 03:04:38,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2805
03:04:38,914 --> 03:04:39,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We are your fan club.

2806
03:04:41,315 --> 03:04:43,475
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not an E3 without Bobby either.

2807
03:04:43,495 --> 03:04:49,216
[SPEAKER_18]: I can really mean that because dude's gone to like what, the last 15 in a row or something like that?

2808
03:04:49,397 --> 03:04:50,817
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be my 15th.

2809
03:04:51,217 --> 03:04:52,277
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be your 15th.

2810
03:04:52,477 --> 03:04:52,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2811
03:04:52,877 --> 03:04:54,238
[SPEAKER_18]: And they are going to say no to this man.

2812
03:04:54,298 --> 03:04:54,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Possibly.

2813
03:04:55,518 --> 03:04:58,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we don't know yet.

2814
03:04:58,421 --> 03:05:05,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the optimistic reading of the emails that if you have below 8,000, that's still one.

2815
03:05:06,369 --> 03:05:12,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It's over 8,000 to get the second one, but those are all blogs and stuff.

2816
03:05:12,416 --> 03:05:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder because they do make the distinction in the application form of podcast.

2817
03:05:17,441 --> 03:05:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

2818
03:05:18,462 --> 03:05:19,323
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2819
03:05:36,367 --> 03:05:42,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I could get 8,000 people to listen, and you could get 8,000 people to listen, but they're not going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2820
03:05:42,290 --> 03:05:42,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2821
03:05:43,491 --> 03:05:49,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully most of our audience is smart enough not to have spyware tubulars installed on their computer.

2822
03:05:49,693 --> 03:05:50,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

2823
03:05:50,494 --> 03:05:51,014
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a little bit.

2824
03:05:51,034 --> 03:05:52,495
[SPEAKER_18]: The way they're measuring it is kind of janky.

2825
03:05:52,855 --> 03:06:00,138
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, again, and we said this earlier, and I know you were at your party, so you probably didn't hear this, but, you know, it's mostly a case of a few bad apples ruining the barrel.

2826
03:06:00,338 --> 03:06:03,140
[SPEAKER_18]: And I see why E3 feels like they need to take this step.

2827
03:06:03,880 --> 03:06:05,801
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's just kind of like the wrong step.

2828
03:06:06,141 --> 03:06:07,801
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you should have gone left instead of right.

2829
03:06:07,881 --> 03:06:08,402
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

2830
03:06:09,402 --> 03:06:12,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I'm already told I'm not allowed at GDC anymore, too.

2831
03:06:12,183 --> 03:06:14,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like E3 was really all I had left other than PAX.

2832
03:06:15,944 --> 03:06:18,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Because GDC took this step two years ago.

2833
03:06:20,291 --> 03:06:21,452
[SPEAKER_18]: There is neatness.

2834
03:06:21,572 --> 03:06:25,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I like getting to hang with the developers and get to see some of the stuff.

2835
03:06:25,758 --> 03:06:29,883
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when I played Warhammer Online for the first time, I was getting to talk to developers and stuff.

2836
03:06:29,903 --> 03:06:30,504
[SPEAKER_18]: It was kind of cool.

2837
03:06:30,564 --> 03:06:37,854
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know... But, you know, if somebody's really serious about getting into E3 in terms of...

2838
03:06:38,314 --> 03:06:38,935
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2839
03:06:56,270 --> 03:07:01,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could, with an exhibits only badge, you really could have done the exact same thing you did last year.

2840
03:07:01,712 --> 03:07:02,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't need a press badge.

2841
03:07:02,832 --> 03:07:04,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, I'll tell you this.

2842
03:07:05,313 --> 03:07:05,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you this.

2843
03:07:06,413 --> 03:07:08,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Even with my exhibits only, I got into press events.

2844
03:07:09,394 --> 03:07:09,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2845
03:07:10,834 --> 03:07:13,955
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they know you, it doesn't matter what your badge says.

2846
03:07:15,347 --> 03:07:29,060
[SPEAKER_02]: all I had to do was flash them a card that says I do this podcast and they're like we want you exactly so I think it'll be fine if you really really want to go and yes I really really want to go thankfully I got a refund

2847
03:07:29,755 --> 03:07:30,936
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2848
03:07:47,274 --> 03:07:47,554
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2849
03:07:47,815 --> 03:07:49,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got my DDR Freak stuff.

2850
03:07:50,496 --> 03:07:50,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

2851
03:07:51,016 --> 03:07:52,417
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you might be able to do with that.

2852
03:07:52,797 --> 03:07:57,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so, I mean, I didn't get mine the other year, and I think it's because of my name change.

2853
03:07:57,780 --> 03:07:58,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

2854
03:07:58,340 --> 03:07:58,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

2855
03:07:59,741 --> 03:08:01,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides, I want to go to Anaheim.

2856
03:08:02,062 --> 03:08:02,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2857
03:08:02,303 --> 03:08:02,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Disneyland.

2858
03:08:02,903 --> 03:08:04,784
[SPEAKER_18]: He wants to go to the place that we always talk about.

2859
03:08:05,164 --> 03:08:05,404
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2860
03:08:05,624 --> 03:08:11,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Bobby, I've got to let you go so we can squeeze some more calls in, but we'll see you next week as we do every week.

2861
03:08:11,308 --> 03:08:12,208
[SPEAKER_18]: So have a good one, buddy.

2862
03:08:12,849 --> 03:08:13,109
[SPEAKER_18]: You too.

2863
03:08:13,409 --> 03:08:13,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

2864
03:08:14,926 --> 03:08:17,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we let Bobby go a little long, but that's okay because you know what?

2865
03:08:17,147 --> 03:08:20,609
[SPEAKER_18]: He always has us on his show every week and helps promote us.

2866
03:08:20,729 --> 03:08:24,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know as much as he thinks it's us promoting him, it does work both ways.

2867
03:08:24,571 --> 03:08:26,412
[SPEAKER_18]: So he can take a little more time.

2868
03:08:26,832 --> 03:08:31,735
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, 877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

2869
03:08:32,015 --> 03:08:32,776
[SPEAKER_18]: You can give us a call.

2870
03:08:33,096 --> 03:08:34,557
[SPEAKER_18]: We got time for a couple more calls, right?

2871
03:08:34,617 --> 03:08:35,637
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not done yet.

2872
03:08:36,558 --> 03:08:37,678
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the fight out of us yet.

2873
03:08:38,039 --> 03:08:39,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe one more call, actually.

2874
03:08:39,399 --> 03:08:40,220
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm looking at the time.

2875
03:08:40,260 --> 03:08:42,681
[SPEAKER_18]: This is starting to go on two hours by the time we finish.

2876
03:08:42,861 --> 03:08:43,842
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to make an announcement.

2877
03:08:44,002 --> 03:08:44,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what?

2878
03:08:44,662 --> 03:08:45,562
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom is amazing.

2879
03:08:46,403 --> 03:08:46,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

2880
03:08:46,963 --> 03:08:47,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2881
03:08:47,663 --> 03:08:48,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, she had you.

2882
03:08:48,664 --> 03:08:50,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Aww.

2883
03:08:51,985 --> 03:08:53,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Hers is the womb that bore me.

2884
03:08:54,906 --> 03:08:57,247
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

2885
03:08:57,327 --> 03:08:59,267
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are waiting for the delay to catch up.

2886
03:08:59,287 --> 03:09:00,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any other last minute stories real quick?

2887
03:09:00,828 --> 03:09:03,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot to ask earlier.

2888
03:09:03,349 --> 03:09:07,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe I did and I just... MTV Games has shut down.

2889
03:09:08,371 --> 03:09:09,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I heard about that.

2890
03:09:10,126 --> 03:09:10,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Sucks to be them!

2891
03:09:11,527 --> 03:09:13,048
[SPEAKER_18]: AOL's buying the Huffington Post.

2892
03:09:13,128 --> 03:09:14,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get at least one more call in here.

2893
03:09:14,729 --> 03:09:15,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2894
03:09:15,889 --> 03:09:16,230

2898
03:09:22,213 --> 03:09:25,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, two really quick hits.

2899
03:09:26,035 --> 03:09:29,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to keep it short and sweet just in case you want to get one less call.

2900
03:09:30,718 --> 03:09:31,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

03:09:39,614 --> 03:09:42,775
[SPEAKER_05]: and more shows to come in the following years.

2903
03:09:43,876 --> 03:09:58,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, just want to point out to those that have PlayStation Network accounts, there's more free wheels on their usual spots.

2904
03:09:58,321 --> 03:10:02,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing overly exciting, but hey, they're there and they're free.

2905
03:10:02,967 --> 03:10:04,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I like free stuff.

2906

2908
03:10:10,614 --> 03:10:11,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2909
03:10:11,675 --> 03:10:13,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2910
03:10:13,657 --> 03:10:16,119

03:10:28,470 --> 03:10:36,174
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I like that he kind of calls in and says what's free on PlayStation because I don't have time to follow all of it.

2921
03:10:36,594 --> 03:10:41,196
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and some voices need to know of all the free stuff.

2922
03:10:41,996 --> 03:10:42,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

2967
03:12:49,648 --> 03:13:13,701

03:14:09,523 --> 03:14:09,823
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

2984

[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

2991
03:14:17,987 --> 03:14:19,108
[SPEAKER_18]: We could crash at Bobby's.

2992
03:14:19,908 --> 03:14:20,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We could go to Bobby's.

2993
03:14:21,869 --> 03:14:22,109

2994
03:14:22,469 --> 03:14:22,830

2995
03:14:23,150 --> 03:14:25,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Which was the name of a Supernatural episode this season.

2996
03:14:25,891 --> 03:14:26,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you nerd.

2997
03:14:26,551 --> 03:14:26,812
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2998
03:14:27,052 --> 03:14:28,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Brad, thanks so much for the call.

2999
03:14:28,252 --> 03:14:28,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one.

3000
03:14:29,133 --> 03:14:29,733
[SPEAKER_18]: You too, guys.

3001
03:14:29,773 --> 03:14:30,053
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

3002
03:14:32,534 --> 03:14:32,935
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

3003
03:14:34,135 --> 03:14:35,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Should we do one more call?

3004
03:14:37,205 --> 03:14:43,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes Alright, we'll do one more call We just can't stop Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3005
03:14:45,749 --> 03:14:48,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Legend of Zaku What's on your mind, my friend?

3006
03:14:49,331 --> 03:15:06,379
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, I'd like to say happy 400th to you guys Happy 400th to us Thank you Happy 400th to you too, Zaku You've been here for a lot of it, so thank you Yeah, at least a good 80, you know, like 75% of it But yeah Good enough

3007
03:15:06,989 --> 03:15:14,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let me see, I'm trying to think, because I've been out of like the whole, you know, I've been out of like the recent gaming news, aside from that new PSP announced.

3008
03:15:14,974 --> 03:15:26,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, from what I heard, a lot of the devs are just like, you know, they're creaming in their pants over how it's like, you know, like a generation ahead of the current smartphones out there.

3009
03:15:27,901 --> 03:15:33,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Which just, which, you know, the way I see it, they're just paying a lot of lip service to Sony.

3010
03:15:35,086 --> 03:15:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean that's the whole point is it because right now there have to be nimble against not only Apple but whoever else is releasing any new Android tabs that could just rival what Sony's going to end up releasing.

3011
03:15:48,032 --> 03:15:50,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

3012
03:15:50,534 --> 03:15:55,816
[SPEAKER_07]: We really don't know how the new NGP will perform when they release it.

3013
03:15:56,357 --> 03:16:02,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can tell you this, I mean dual core phones are going to be here in a little bit.

3014
03:16:04,011 --> 03:16:14,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have all these game developers, the ones that are not targeting the PXP, the ones that have targeted the iPhones and high-end Android phones, they're going to have to start capitalizing it.

3015
03:16:15,028 --> 03:16:17,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way, you know, they have...

3016
03:16:17,785 --> 03:16:18,586
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on and so forth.

3017
03:16:40,769 --> 03:16:47,590
[SPEAKER_18]: With iPhone 5, I'm sure, kind of like a hybrid thing for AT&T and Verizon on its way in the summer.

3018
03:16:47,710 --> 03:16:49,691
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, it's just crazy times.

3019
03:16:51,351 --> 03:16:57,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Verizon only got the hand-me-downs, per se.

3020
03:16:57,232 --> 03:17:00,673
[SPEAKER_07]: AT&T still has a ton of exclusives now.

3021
03:17:01,433 --> 03:17:06,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever a new iPhone comes out, Verizon will get it months afterwards.

3022
03:17:07,075 --> 03:17:08,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, too early to tell.

3023
03:17:10,865 --> 03:17:16,968
[SPEAKER_07]: But so far, that's the indication that I've seen so far that, you know, AT&T will still have it.

3024
03:17:17,228 --> 03:17:21,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have its, like, you know, full exclusivity, like, it's the only carrier where you can buy it.

3025
03:17:22,190 --> 03:17:26,572
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll probably have what, you know, they'll have, like, a compromised, like, a timed exclusive.

3026
03:17:27,232 --> 03:17:37,397
[SPEAKER_07]: But you do realize that, you know, as I said, Google's already, you know, already has, like, Android 3.0 out, which is, like, their tablet version, which is supposed to, like,

3027
03:17:38,188 --> 03:17:45,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Harold in the era of $300 tablets that pretty much rivaled the iPad for a matchup to that.

3028
03:17:56,325 --> 03:18:02,427
[SPEAKER_07]: They just have to bring something that you can't really get on an iPhone or high-end Android phone.

3029
03:18:02,827 --> 03:18:09,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, something that not only surpasses PS2, but just barely touches PS3 graphics.

3030
03:18:09,349 --> 03:18:11,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Something that melts faces with awesomeness.

3031
03:18:12,930 --> 03:18:13,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

3032
03:18:13,370 --> 03:18:19,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you need something that's kind of a hybrid in between the PS2 and the 360.

3033
03:18:19,592 --> 03:18:22,953
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get that on a small package like an NGP,

3034
03:18:24,457 --> 03:18:28,138
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're pretty much a step ahead of the competition.

3035
03:18:28,638 --> 03:18:30,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Last question, Zaku.

3036
03:18:30,758 --> 03:18:31,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you think they'll succeed?

3037
03:18:31,978 --> 03:18:43,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony, I mean, the way I see it is that they never had this much heat from anyone outside of Nintendo.

3038
03:18:44,001 --> 03:18:51,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now that Apple's creeping up, you know, Apple and the other manufacturers are creeping up, they have to, like,

3039
03:18:52,350 --> 03:18:54,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they have to make sure they hit another home run.

3040
03:18:55,411 --> 03:19:02,334
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP sold really well, but there are more iPhones out there than PSPs, and that's a fact.

3041
03:19:02,374 --> 03:19:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: There are more Android phones out there.

3042
03:19:04,415 --> 03:19:08,516
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot more high-end smartphones than people who have PSPs.

3043
03:19:08,636 --> 03:19:09,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we will see.

3044
03:19:10,397 --> 03:19:15,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Buddy, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.

3045
03:19:15,259 --> 03:19:16,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Take care, my friend.

3046
03:19:16,799 --> 03:19:17,740
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see you on episode 700.

3047
03:19:20,469 --> 03:19:21,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.

3048
03:19:47,321 --> 03:19:58,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Pax East, DragonCon, Pax Prime, ASEN I do want to go to ASEN We dug out actually all of my old costumes and I found my Tamari fan

3049
03:20:00,184 --> 03:20:02,765
[SPEAKER_03]: WonderCon Season Comic-Con

3050
03:20:26,502 --> 03:20:27,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a friend that goes every year.

3051
03:20:27,983 --> 03:20:28,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

3052
03:20:28,484 --> 03:20:28,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

3053
03:20:29,384 --> 03:20:30,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Then again, she works in the industry.

3054
03:20:31,526 --> 03:20:31,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

3055
03:20:32,407 --> 03:20:34,408
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to get some help from my friends over there.

3056
03:20:34,889 --> 03:20:40,233
[SPEAKER_18]: AkumaJP, Kitsune, somebody might need some help if I were to come out there for Tokyo Game Show.

3057
03:20:41,374 --> 03:20:46,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you guys can clearly tell I can't even read the Japanese release dates right.

3058
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:49,741
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have problems navigating around there.

3059
03:20:50,188 --> 03:20:51,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's going to do it.

3060
03:20:51,769 --> 03:20:53,809
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to wrap up episode 400 of this show.

3061
03:20:53,869 --> 03:20:55,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Sadly, it's not a marathon tonight.

3062
03:20:55,390 --> 03:20:56,590
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't go all night long.

3063
03:20:56,891 --> 03:20:58,591
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight.

3064
03:20:59,011 --> 03:20:59,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Got to go around, though.

3065
03:20:59,972 --> 03:21:01,652
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm assuming all the last minute news is done.

3066
03:21:03,113 --> 03:21:05,834
[SPEAKER_18]: If so, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

3067
03:21:06,694 --> 03:21:07,855
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki, we'll start with you.

3068
03:21:07,895 --> 03:21:08,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Your final thought tonight.

3069
03:21:10,315 --> 03:21:11,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Galgan's a weird game.

3070
03:21:11,696 --> 03:21:15,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope I don't get visited by Chris Hansen.

3071
03:21:15,377 --> 03:21:22,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Salacious Pop, since you have the microphone, thank you so much for being here tonight in this very special episode because you're a special guy.

3072
03:21:24,621 --> 03:21:25,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?

3073
03:21:27,498 --> 03:21:31,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eagerly anticipating our trip to the Noodle House after this.

3074
03:21:31,921 --> 03:21:32,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you hungry?

3075
03:21:33,361 --> 03:21:33,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

3076
03:21:33,842 --> 03:21:34,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's alright.

3077
03:21:35,302 --> 03:21:37,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Arcadian, thank you for being here.

3078
03:21:37,464 --> 03:21:39,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Appreciate your support as always.

3079
03:21:39,024 --> 03:21:45,288
[SPEAKER_18]: You've kind of been there since day one as well, way back in the Arvigil days, so you've watched us grow up right in front of your eyes.

3080
03:21:46,989 --> 03:21:48,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3081
03:21:48,550 --> 03:21:51,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go over what my game of 2010 was, and that was Nier.

3082
03:21:51,892 --> 03:21:56,154
[SPEAKER_15]: It has a very good story, very good characters, and very good music, and

3083
03:21:56,534 --> 03:21:57,214
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

3084
03:22:25,640 --> 03:22:31,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and one thing about it is that the female character swears in almost every scene she's in.

3085
03:22:31,986 --> 03:22:35,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's something that would appeal more to older players than younger players.

3086
03:22:35,370 --> 03:22:37,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Younger players probably wouldn't like the story as much.

3087
03:22:39,454 --> 03:22:45,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the characterizations probably wouldn't really ring true to them or wouldn't really kind of mix with their experience.

3088
03:22:45,580 --> 03:22:48,042
[SPEAKER_15]: But older people would probably think would like it a lot more.

3089
03:22:48,943 --> 03:22:49,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so noted.

3090
03:22:50,724 --> 03:22:52,804
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a hell of a final thought, but I'll have to check that game out.

3091
03:22:53,745 --> 03:23:00,527
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is, gosh, A, I could use some Pinkberry, but sadly they're closed.

3092
03:23:01,227 --> 03:23:09,190
[SPEAKER_18]: And B, thank you guys for listening for the past 400 episodes, or whenever you joined, even if this week was your first show.

3093
03:23:09,890 --> 03:23:10,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for listening.

3094
03:23:11,431 --> 03:23:12,411
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

3095
03:23:12,671 --> 03:23:13,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Baskin-Robbins is open.

3096
03:23:15,492 --> 03:23:17,033
[SPEAKER_18]: We get an afterbirth to do still.
