0	20020	Tonight, February 6th, 2011, Nintendo disagrees with low app pricing, Halo gets remade this
20020	32080	holiday and has Zelda Skyward Sword been further delayed?
32080	35760	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35760	39700	Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39700	42240	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
42240	46520	With me as always, say hello to the one and only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46520	47880	Greetings and salutations.
47880	49580	How are you Ms. Summers?
49580	56180	My voice is coming and going, I will at points sound like a twelve year old boy, but I'm
56180	57180	doing good.
57180	58180	I'm happy, excited.
58180	60060	A lot of people I know have been getting sick lately.
60060	61060	It's not just you.
61060	62060	Something's going around.
62060	63060	Something's going around.
63060	64700	But it has stolen my voice.
64700	68400	By the way, I noticed you're wearing like a nerdy Star Trek shirt, but it's a red shirt.
68400	69400	That's a bad sign.
69400	70400	But it's engineering.
70400	71400	Okay.
71400	73220	The engineers are smart enough to stay inside.
73220	75420	It's the security guys that keep getting blown up.
75420	79560	Yes, plus I don't know what it is about that shirt but it is showing off your very adequate
79560	80560	bazoom.
80560	81560	Yes.
81560	82560	Thank you.
82560	83560	So congratulations.
83560	84560	Thank you.
84560	85560	All right.
85560	88140	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.
88140	89140	Hi.
89140	90540	How are you, Loki?
90540	91540	I'm fine.
91540	93060	He's a man of many words.
93060	95340	Anything interesting going on for you this week?
95340	96340	No.
96340	97340	No?
97340	98340	All right.
98340	101800	It's going to be one of those shows.
101800	104620	We have some guests in studio, so let me introduce them.
104620	108920	Of course, we always have the ever-present fourth guest with us in our chat room, chat.orange
108920	109920	lounge radio.com.
109920	111580	So you can join us in our chat room.
111580	112580	There are people live.
112580	118300	I do know there's some type of ball game going on right now that people seem to care about,
118300	121820	so I know things are a little bit less than usual.
121820	125840	But thank you so much to the loyalists who have tuned in tonight.
125840	128420	It is a bit of a special night, but I'll get into that in a minute.
128420	132540	Let me introduce the guest here in studio with us as he is once in a while.
132540	134180	Say hello to the one and only, Salacious Pop.
134180	135180	Hello.
135180	136180	How are you?
136180	137180	Good.
137180	138180	Yeah?
138180	142020	What's happened in the past, I don't know, month or so since you've been here?
142020	143300	Lots of wow games.
143300	144300	I don't know.
144300	145300	Good times.
145300	146300	Good.
146300	148220	Because this is a video game show, so you can talk about some of those games.
148220	149220	All right.
149220	152660	Now, here's what's distracting Loki is that he's playing Galgun.
152660	158780	He brought into studio, and can you, Salacious Pop, how do you describe this game to people?
158780	160420	I don't even know.
160420	167260	Well, you're in obviously a school, high school, and they're little Sailor Moon-looking anime
167260	170100	girls in their little suits.
170100	174060	And it's kind of like, I guess, time crisis where you've just got the cross hairs, and
174060	176700	you move the cursor over, and you shoot them with hearts.
176700	181700	And they make noises, which I will not try to repeat.
181700	182700	Aw, you're no fun.
182700	184220	The volume's turned down.
184220	185220	Yeah.
185220	187340	Well, I think it's implied.
187340	191020	But yeah, and then they fall down with their love for you because you shot them with your
191020	192020	love gun.
192020	193020	Oh, great.
193020	197260	Loki's turned it up, I don't know if it gets picked up on the mic or whatever, but...
197260	199980	Oh, does it come through on our little soundboard now?
199980	202100	No, I don't think it does.
202100	204540	All right, I thought we were high tech or something.
204540	205540	All right, maybe next time.
205540	206540	Yeah, we've played samples.
206540	207540	I know, we've done it before.
207540	208540	I don't know.
208540	209540	I don't think it's...
209540	210540	We could, but I haven't done it.
210540	212020	Loki did this very last minute tonight, so...
212020	216220	All right, well, say hello as well to also joining us for this special show.
216220	217220	Say hello to Arcadian42.
217220	218220	Hello out there.
218220	219220	How are you?
219220	220220	I'm doing good.
220220	221220	I haven't seen you in a while either.
221220	222220	Not since the last time we did a show.
222220	225220	Well, you know, when you were here.
225220	226220	Last December.
226220	227220	Yes.
227220	228220	So, what's new with you?
228220	229220	Not too much.
229220	230220	Yeah?
230220	232980	Now I'm into crazy work time, so I don't have much time to play games these days.
232980	233980	Crazy work time?
233980	236100	What do you do for a living without, you know, you don't have to tell us where you work,
236100	237100	but what kind of work?
237100	240540	Well, I work at two places, and the first place I work five hours a day, every day,
240540	241540	all year.
241540	245500	The other place, I work eight hours a day, like, six to eight, like, nine months of the
245500	246500	year.
246500	247500	Wow.
247500	248500	All right.
248500	249500	Busy, busy.
249500	250500	Yeah.
250500	251500	All right.
251500	254380	So, I'm going to get around to how is your gaming week, but I should acknowledge that
254380	258580	tonight is a little bit special because it is episode 400 of Orange Lounge Radio.
258580	259580	Yay.
259580	262020	400 freaking shows.
262020	269100	This show started on June 23rd, 2002, and here we are, over 400 weeks, because we're
269100	274000	lazy, we take a lot of weeks off, over 400 weeks later, but 400 shows later, here we
274000	275460	are at our show.
275460	276460	It's exhausting.
276460	278540	So, what are we doing special tonight?
278540	281260	The same shit we've done for a long time.
281260	282260	No.
282260	283260	We had something special.
283260	284260	That's true.
284260	285460	We do have one new special thing, but the live listeners don't get to see it.
285460	288220	This is something special for the podcasties.
288220	289220	Meatballs?
289220	290220	Oh.
290220	292580	Well, the listeners don't get meatballs.
292580	293900	No, but we're special.
293900	294900	We get meatballs.
294900	295900	All right.
295900	301140	I think originally this was going to be a drunk show, but Loki's got the kid, Rob drives,
301140	305820	Jamie's not going to pay to get us all blitzed, and if we took a shot every time Nintendo
305820	307940	made a bad business decision, we would just die.
307940	308940	We would be dead.
308940	309940	Exactly.
309940	312300	And remember, a lot has happened in nine years of the show.
312300	316260	I have my gallbladder out for one, so I have no alcohol tolerance anymore.
316260	317260	Remember when I almost died, y'all?
317260	318260	That was hilarious.
318260	319260	You were so skinny, though.
319260	320260	You look so good.
320260	321260	I know.
321260	324020	God, I want to get pancreatitis again.
324020	325900	So which character should we attempt to rape first?
325900	328020	Oh, the one with the bunny ears.
328020	329020	The bunny girl.
329020	330020	Got it.
330020	331020	All right.
331020	332020	What's your name?
332020	333020	I have no idea.
333020	339540	The other thing to keep in mind, since we started this show nine-ish years ago, we were
339540	345180	a lot younger, and things were different then, and we would drink a lot more than we do now.
345180	346500	So if you do drink, drink responsibly.
346500	347820	What do you mean, than I do now?
347820	353980	There's a lot of people drinking today, because there's this brown ball that people throw
353980	354980	to each other.
354980	357360	It's the Super Bowl of sports ball.
357360	360660	Men dress up in these big suits and push each other to the ground.
360660	361660	They wear tights.
361660	362660	They wear tight shorts.
362660	363660	The whole thing's very homoerotic.
363660	364660	The whole nation watches it.
364660	366620	They wear tight shorts and pad their chest.
366620	370180	Betty White is in commercials and things.
370180	374060	Ecstasy shot, because you shot her in the crotch.
374060	375060	Wow.
375060	377420	I love radio about video games.
377420	378420	All right.
378420	381060	Anyhow, let's start off with how was your gaming week?
381060	382620	I almost said, how was your week?
382620	383620	How was your day?
383620	384620	How was that for old school?
384620	385620	Yeah.
385620	387140	This show has changed quite a bit, actually.
387140	390540	I don't know how many of you guys have listened to OLR for the entire time, but back when
390540	394180	it was like episode one, obviously, you probably know we were talking about DDR.
394180	395180	The migraine episode.
395180	397020	The money and all that stuff.
397020	399020	But we used to kind of start off with how was your week?
399020	400020	How was your day?
400020	402320	We didn't just talk about all video games.
402320	403620	Now we do.
403620	407160	So next thing I'm going to say is I'm going to say the cage match pick goes into rotation
407160	408980	all week long here at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
408980	411220	It goes into rotation in our hearts.
411220	412220	Exactly.
412220	413220	All right.
413220	414220	Dark soccer.
414220	415220	How was your gaming week?
415220	416220	I hit level 85.
416220	417220	Addict.
417220	418220	Dealer.
418220	419220	Congratulations, though.
419220	420220	Thank you.
420220	429940	Now I'm kind of bored and I'm working on building reps, so I built my Darnassus rep like in
429940	439580	one night and now I have a kitty cat cat and a meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
439580	440940	That's really about it.
440940	446740	Dan got his driving rig, his, his, uh, driving wheel set up for, uh, Gran Turismo five.
446740	451620	He got this sort of stand so that he can put, he can put it away when he's done playing
451620	457340	and he got the seats out of the Honda Prelude, which he is building his driving seat out
457340	459120	of.
459120	460700	And that's what Dan's gaming week has been.
460700	462980	So he actually took seats out of a real car.
462980	463980	It's in the living room.
463980	464980	To build a grand theft.
464980	466180	I almost said grand theft.
466180	467380	Gran Turismo five.
467380	468380	I'll take a picture of it.
468380	469380	Wow.
469380	470380	Yeah.
470380	471380	You shouldn't put it on the little feed.
471380	472380	Yeah.
472380	473380	So I'll do that right now.
473380	474380	All right.
474380	475380	You should.
475380	476380	Wow.
476380	477380	What are you doing?
477380	478380	That's insanity.
478380	479380	Just because he can.
479380	480380	Yes.
480380	481380	He's your husband.
481380	482380	I don't let him do shit.
482380	483380	He just does it.
483380	485380	Then again, the same goes vice versa.
485380	488620	Does he let you sit in the seat or is he like, nah, this is the captain's chair.
488620	490820	I don't care to sit in the seat.
490820	494300	It's a seat on a milk crate right now.
494300	495300	It's ghetto.
495300	498540	And I'm taking a picture and showing you all how weird my husband is.
498540	502180	You can see those pictures at www dot orange lounge radio.com.
502180	504700	All right, Loki, you got to pause that game and tell us about your gaming week.
504700	505700	How was your gaming week?
505700	506700	My gaming is weird.
506700	509900	This week I didn't play a whole lot.
509900	518260	I played just Grand Theft Auto, of course, and a little bit of some iOS games.
518260	524060	I played League of Evil, which I didn't really care for that one.
524060	527500	They're comparing it kind of to Super Meat Boy, and I'm sorry, it's not Super Meat Boy.
527500	529100	It's not even close.
529100	536220	It's just kind of, almost reminds me of Mega Man, but really hard and basic.
536220	537900	It's an iPhone game, so what do you expect?
537900	539900	So it's the basic bitch of video games.
539900	542500	It's just, eh, kind of lame.
542500	549340	And then there was this other pirate game that was kind of cool with anime people that
549340	554820	I played that was kind of fun.
554820	556820	And what else did I try?
556820	560220	Oh, I played more Swords and Poker 2 because that game is just awesome.
560220	562220	Really wish it was still in the App Store.
562220	564980	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
564980	565980	Why'd they take it down?
565980	566980	I don't know.
566980	567980	It's stupid.
567980	570580	They took the first one and the second one down.
570580	571860	They're both excellent games.
571860	573140	I mean, I've sunk...
573140	576140	Are they violating any copyrights or something?
576140	578140	No, I don't see how they would.
578140	581020	These are games that really should make it to consoles.
581020	582980	They're really good.
582980	588740	It's just kind of like Puzzle Quest but Poker, and it's a really unique, fun game.
588740	594780	If you have a, you know, jailbroken iPod or iPhone or something like that, I'd recommend
594780	597880	downloading them, even though it is piracy, but they're not in the store.
597880	605940	So I mean, I'd say go buy them if you could, but you can't, so pirate them.
605940	609060	I guess it might be okay to advocate piracy in that little circumstance.
609060	612060	But I mean, if they came back in the store, they're only 99 cents.
612060	616820	I mean, I bought the game when it came out, or when I found it on there, but they pulled
616820	623140	it eventually, because I had a friend recommend it, and it's just, it's awesome.
623140	625700	Going to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com, a few comments.
625700	631420	Jim Sallee about the football game says, men in costumes fighting to handle brown balls
631420	633100	in the end zone?
633100	634100	Super Bowl is so gay.
634100	635100	A little bit.
635100	636100	A little bit.
636100	637100	All right.
637100	641120	Also, Spazinator says, if Loki ever goes a week without playing Grand Theft Auto IV,
641120	642120	the universe will implode.
642120	644380	Did you play Grand Theft Auto IV this week?
644380	647940	Yeah, we play it like almost every day.
647940	648940	Okay, just checking.
648940	651100	We play the modded games.
651100	653340	It's such a shadow of Grand Theft Auto.
653340	659220	It's seriously a whole epic game of its own, but yeah, so we're still playing Grand Theft
659220	660220	Auto.
660220	661220	We will play something else.
661220	665900	I think we will probably go to Saintsboro 3 once that comes out, and then of course,
665900	668340	when the next Grand Theft Auto comes out, we'll be going to that.
668340	673060	Yeah, I was about to say, have you heard those rumors that the next Grand Theft Auto is set
673060	677500	to debut at the big expo in L.A. in June?
677500	680140	It's not going to be for at least another year.
680140	681780	There's not Grand Theft Auto coming out this year.
681780	683500	You think they might do just a little tease?
683500	685060	What does Rockstar have going on right now?
685060	686900	Well, they've got a bunch of stuff coming out.
686900	691620	They've got L.A. Noire, which is coming out in spring, or spring, summer, or second quarter,
691620	692620	if you will.
692620	693620	Okay.
693620	696460	Then they've got Max Payne 3 coming out at some point.
696460	699180	Probably going to be in the fall.
699180	706900	They had something else too, though, from Take 2 that was supposed to be coming out.
706900	709800	I think Max Payne 2 is probably, you see, because I think they're going to be putting
709800	713420	out L.A. Noire, because that's going to be kind of like their Red Dead Redemption for
713420	718980	the year, and then Max Payne will probably come out maybe fourth quarter.
718980	727980	Grand Theft Auto, I would see maybe, ideally, probably next April would be when I could
727980	731180	see that, but I don't know if that's actually going to happen.
731180	732180	They have the engine already.
732180	736380	They'll just build it off of the Red Dead Redemption, since it's just an update to the
736380	743020	Rage Engine anyways, so yeah, I mean, come on, I'm going to get it day one.
743020	748180	Saints Row 3, though, I'm much of a fan of Saints Row 3 as I am of Grand Theft Auto,
748180	752700	or Saints Row, the series, so I'll be definitely picking that up this fall.
752700	756580	And the problem is, though, is Saints Row, the multiplayer is completely different than
756580	760340	Grand Theft Auto, whereas Grand Theft Auto is more open world, Saints Row is kind of
760340	765180	these little small arenas, and it's really fast paced, and I still kick the crap out
765180	767160	of everybody, and it's really buggy.
767160	771480	It's funny, actually, in Saints Row 2, a little known fact, you can throw the sticky bombs
771480	775460	on people and detonate them, like say if I throw three of them on somebody and detonate
775460	778620	one and kill them, when they respawn, they still have two stuck to them, and you can
778620	780640	detonate it again, and they die.
780640	781640	It's great.
781640	783660	It's such a glitchy game, but it's awesome.
783660	784660	Awesome.
784660	787100	Uh, any interest in Chinatown Wars Part 2?
787100	788100	I hate Chinatown Wars.
788100	789100	I honestly...
789100	790740	I just had a feeling.
790740	797140	It's just, the old top down games were great, but I'm sorry, once, Chinatown Wars, the reason
797140	803420	it existed was because that's all that really the DS could handle, I mean, the PSP games
803420	805500	are a perfect example of what they could have done.
805500	806500	It was great.
806500	810440	The PSP games were, I mean, they control kind of eh, because there's only one analog stick,
810440	811440	but it was still funny.
811440	817380	We played that, you know, up until Grand Theft Auto, well actually up until Saints Row 2,
817380	822180	or Saints Row 1, we played, you know, the PSP versions of Grand Theft Auto to death.
822180	825780	Those things were really fucking glitchy.
825780	829780	But yeah, I mean, seriously, if there's a new PSP, god, if there's an NGP version of
829780	834100	Grand Theft Auto, I'm gonna have to pick that out, and we may have to all get NGP's to bust
834100	841020	that out, but, uh, I'll be buying every game day one, as long as it's on some crap like
841020	842020	Chinatown Wars.
842020	844860	Alright, let's check in with our guests and see what they've been playing this week.
844860	846740	Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?
846740	848220	Um, pretty good.
848220	852740	Uh, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Knights of the Crystal, which doesn't really count
852740	855740	as a game, and World of Warcraft.
855740	856740	Lots of World of Warcraft.
856740	858220	What's going on in World of Warcraft for you?
858220	860780	I don't want to get too far into the discussion, but...
860780	868180	Yeah, um, I was in a, I guess a more social, casual-centric guild, and I decided to try
868180	873680	and explore a group of people that were more focused on the really hardcore raiding stuff,
873680	876220	to see if I can, you know, handle that.
876220	881180	And they took me on a raid, as a trial, so I got to see some of the new raid content,
881180	882480	did a 25-man.
882480	883480	They carried me.
883480	887880	I'm pretty much a scrub right now, but it was neat to see.
887880	891580	So you turned your back on your friends to go see more pretty internet dragons?
891580	894380	I'm a traitorous maverick.
894380	897820	I'm just giving you shit, obviously, because it's the same guild I'm in, but I know there's
897820	900700	a lot of people that are excited for you, and you can come back and tell us stories.
900700	902980	And you can come on Horde House and talk all about it.
902980	905380	Yeah, it's more a Horde House conversation.
905380	906380	Alright.
906380	910740	But I, you know, it's still, obviously WoW's a huge game, so, gotta talk about what's going
910740	911740	on there.
911740	914140	So, how's Championship Edition going for you?
914140	915740	I mean, breaking records?
915740	917580	I still only play, like, the one mode.
917580	922260	I've unlocked all the other modes, and I'm like, I just want the five minutes.
922260	923260	That's me, too.
923260	924260	I'm the exact same way.
924260	926340	I go through and I unlock everything, and then it's like, okay, I just want to play
926340	929700	this one map over and over, because it's the one that drives the leaderboards.
929700	931260	It's on the main Xbox 360.
931260	935260	I don't know if this is weird or not, but you know how, like, in the Xbox 360 dashboard,
935260	938660	you get to see leaderboards, but they're only for a certain mode in the game.
938660	941700	It's usually, like, the default leaderboard is what you see in.
941700	944840	That's the one I will try the hardest on.
944840	948500	And in this case, it's usually, like, stage one or the default board and settings for
948500	950200	Pac-Man Championship Edition.
950200	955180	And even with the default game style, you can still, you know, on the options before
955180	961500	you start up the match, there are eight or nine different visually art, like, you can
961500	964660	have the neon or, like, all green or the 3D model, whatever.
964660	965920	I just leave it on the default.
965920	969540	So visually, all the stuff they put into the game I haven't looked at yet, because there's
969540	970540	no reason to.
970540	975180	So you just want to hear the pretty music.
975180	976180	All right.
976180	978460	Well, let's move on to Arkadian42.
978460	980460	How was your gaming week?
980460	984180	The only thing I really had to play this week was Rock Band 3, because I got the cymbals
984180	986260	pack so I could play pro mode.
986260	988540	So I was doing that.
988540	993340	And that's why I got a mic stand so I could sing when I want to sing, but I don't do that
993340	994340	all that often.
994340	997180	I was going to say, you're kind of a quiet guy, and now here I am hearing about that
997180	1000580	you have to get the cymbals and the microphones so that you can rock out and sing all the
1000580	1001580	privacy of your own home.
1001580	1006620	Yeah, I don't really sing that much just because my voice is kind of screwy, and also because
1006620	1010980	there's people on the other side of the walls, they don't want to bother them because my
1010980	1015740	voice is probably sort of deep, so it probably goes through the walls, so I don't want to
1015740	1017260	bug them.
1017260	1018540	Nice.
1018540	1022700	So what was the first song you had to play when you got the cymbals?
1022700	1026300	Because there's always that one song people got to play in Rock Band.
1026300	1027300	I don't know.
1027300	1032620	I think it was one of the easier songs just so I could get used to the cymbals.
1032620	1035420	Just go through the training a little bit.
1035420	1042140	The training is not that much different from the standard trainer for drums.
1042140	1048420	It just has pretty much the same training, but with the cymbals added.
1048420	1053340	Just mainly mostly the, what is it, the ride or whatever, like the hi-hat one you hit most,
1053340	1057540	so that's pretty much the only one they add, the other one's barely in there for the training.
1057540	1061020	But once you get to the regular game, then yeah, you play those.
1061020	1062020	Alright.
1062020	1063020	Cool, cool.
1063020	1064020	Sounds like...
1064020	1065020	Oh, yeah.
1065020	1067020	I have to make an announcement on behalf of the show.
1067020	1068020	Uh oh.
1068020	1069020	Okay.
1069020	1070020	Happy birthday to Giovanni.
1070020	1071020	That's right.
1071020	1077400	I saw her angst on Twitter about the whole, some game where people wear these uniforms
1077400	1079460	and they all have numbers on them.
1079460	1085460	Well, to quote a conversation that was going on on one of the lesbian's Facebook.
1085460	1087060	I miss the OLR lesbians.
1087060	1088060	How are they these days?
1088060	1089580	Seem to do well.
1089580	1093660	For those that lost track, the OLR lesbians, they were on the show what about, probably
1093660	1097840	about four years ago at this point, they moved together to Wisconsin?
1097840	1099260	One of them already lived in Wisconsin.
1099260	1100260	I see.
1100260	1102820	That's right, because they were flying back and forth a little bit.
1102820	1106740	So they now, they now habitate in Wisconsin with their Birkenstocks.
1106740	1112540	At this game, they use a racket to hit an orange ball into the net, and then they smoke
1112540	1113540	the Rose Bowl.
1113540	1117620	Alright, can I talk about my gaming week?
1117620	1121100	Oh, one more birthday wish.
1121100	1122360	Is it his birthday today?
1122360	1123360	How funny.
1123360	1124820	That's ironic.
1124820	1128340	You would think he was born on Friday, or Friday the 13th or something.
1128340	1129340	Maybe.
1129340	1133780	Well, no, because today's February 6th, so you don't wish him a happy birthday today
1133780	1140300	if he was born February 13th.
1140300	1143300	I was thinking of a Friday.
1143300	1144300	Oh, okay.
1144300	1145300	That's alright.
1145300	1147220	Alright, let's move on.
1147220	1148220	My gaming week.
1148220	1151660	I played, I made an effort to play some indie games this week.
1151660	1154180	So I played a few indie games on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1154180	1159060	I basically handed the controller to Alan, and I was like, pick games that look fun.
1159060	1162700	So he picked a few games for me, and probably my favorite out of the bunch that I played
1162700	1165320	was Radian Games Ballistic.
1165320	1168060	It's a indie game on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1168060	1172700	Very Geometry Wars-esque, and a very slick, high-definition kind of interface.
1172700	1175460	It's one of those, you know, dual thumbstick control-y type of games, just like Geometry
1175460	1180860	Wars, and you know, little power-ups that you can put on, and you can kind of hit a
1180860	1185860	button to go into more like Uber mode, where you fire more bullets, but you move a little
1185860	1186860	bit slower.
1186860	1189900	So, you know, for people that are thinking, you know, their life is lacking, Geometry
1189900	1194340	Wars, especially with the sad news about, you know, bizarre creations shutting their
1194340	1200020	doors, it's a nice little, you know, way to hold you over, and it's not that expensive.
1200020	1202460	So it's, and the demo's very generous.
1202460	1205160	So there's no reason you can't check out the demo, which is out there.
1205160	1206160	So I liked Ballistic.
1206160	1207160	That was cool.
1207160	1208620	Some of the games I didn't like so much.
1208620	1213100	I'm gonna butcher the name of this game, but it was something like Maid-Chan's Cave Adventure.
1213100	1214980	I don't, was that the name of its license, Pop?
1214980	1216620	Do you remember what the name of the game was?
1216620	1217700	Something like Maid?
1217700	1218700	It was Maid-San.
1218700	1219700	Maid-San.
1219700	1222900	It was like, like, crazy cave adventure, wild cave adventure, but yeah.
1222900	1223900	Yeah, it was dumb.
1223900	1227140	I mean, it was funny for a minute, but it's a really weird mechanic.
1227140	1230700	Like, it's kind of like, okay, it's, I guess it's like side-scroller-y, puzzle-y.
1230700	1233340	Yes, you play a maid who explores caves.
1233340	1234340	That really is what you do.
1234340	1235340	Yeah.
1235340	1236780	And, you know, you think, oh, this is really funny.
1236780	1242700	But you go to collect stars and things, but you have to, the main mechanic of the game
1242700	1246020	is that you duck to avoid the little zombie dudes.
1246020	1247020	The ogres.
1247020	1248020	The baseball bats.
1248020	1249020	Yeah.
1249020	1251420	And when the maid got hit with a baseball bat, I laughed out loud.
1251420	1254580	It's worth downloading the demo just to see that, because it's really, like, not that
1254580	1259380	I advocate violence against maids, but it was kind of funny the first time.
1259380	1263280	Yeah, because the ogre sees you and says, you know, something in Japanese and marches
1263280	1267220	towards you, and then here comes the club thud, and just the way they do it is.
1267220	1268220	Right.
1268220	1273060	Now, you can hide by crouching, but the longer you crouch, your field of vision gets narrower
1273060	1275760	and narrower and narrower.
1275760	1278260	So you have to kind of crouch while you wait for the guys to pass you, which is a really
1278260	1279380	weird mechanic.
1279380	1285220	So, yeah, it was okay, but I don't think I would have paid money for it, but the demo
1285220	1286220	was fun.
1286220	1287220	Pro tip.
1287220	1290620	If you're going to check out the demo for this game, go into the options, change it
1290620	1294920	to English, unless you read and understand Japanese thoroughly, then good on you.
1294920	1297860	But the first time I played through, I was like, oh, this game's only in Japanese.
1297860	1298860	Great.
1298860	1300300	Because I don't understand it at all.
1300300	1304620	So I'm just like, I see a Y, like the Y button, so I'll hit that and see what it does.
1304620	1307460	Oh, the game must have just told me that Y does a high jump.
1307460	1310700	So yeah, turn it into English, you'll be doing yourself a favor.
1310700	1312100	Very harsh scoring, by the way, too.
1312100	1313680	I was very upset.
1313680	1316180	It's all about speed and precision.
1316180	1320660	Those of you people that like your speed runs might find something here for you.
1320660	1323020	So the third game, I don't even know what it was called.
1323020	1324020	It was crap.
1324020	1325020	It was total crap.
1325020	1327540	Beach Bubble Boo Bobble.
1327540	1328540	I don't know.
1328540	1333180	Beachy Booby Anime Chick Games, which, of course, Alan downloaded because he saw the
1333180	1337580	anime chicks in bikinis, and he was like, oh, it kind of looks like Bubble Bobble.
1337580	1339200	No, here's the game.
1339200	1342500	You fly around and you collect colored balls.
1342500	1344340	Doesn't matter what color they are.
1344340	1346440	You just clear the screen.
1346440	1348340	It's like Pac-Man, but crap.
1348340	1351220	And you want to dodge these little things that are floating around.
1351220	1356260	And if you successfully clear the level, then a little piece of the picture in the background
1356260	1360100	will unveil, and you might get to see some drawn boobies.
1360100	1364540	Some little anime babe boobies in the background.
1364540	1370340	You can play it with one hand very easily, because you're just clearing the screen of
1370340	1372660	the stuff.
1372660	1373940	That's all I'm going to.
1373940	1375700	You can infer the rest.
1375700	1379900	And seriously, though, if you're going to pay money to download this for your one hand
1379900	1381820	entertainment, like go buy a nudie mag.
1381820	1382860	It's money better spent.
1382860	1383860	This game was stupid.
1383860	1385980	So just go buy a nudie mag.
1385980	1386980	Or you know what?
1386980	1387980	Go on the internet.
1387980	1389860	There's titties for free everywhere.
1389860	1392020	Just go to nationalgeographic.com.
1392020	1393020	And if you go to the...
1393020	1394660	Why do you need to go to the nationalgeographic.com?
1394660	1395660	It's a joke.
1395660	1396660	I'm just curious.
1396660	1397660	It's a joke.
1397660	1398660	All right.
1398660	1399660	So even...
1399660	1400660	Because that's where we all saw titties.
1400660	1401660	Well, I don't know.
1401660	1404780	That's where I saw titties for the first time was in the National Geographic magazine.
1404780	1406060	I don't know about you guys, but...
1406060	1407540	Were you not breastfed?
1407540	1410580	And you're gay now, so that's a cautionary tale rather than advice.
1410580	1411580	So...
1411580	1413580	What are you trying to say?
1413580	1415140	There's nothing wrong with it.
1415140	1416140	So even...
1416140	1417140	I am who I am.
1417140	1418140	I am proud of who I am.
1418140	1422300	So even though we've butchered the name of the game, if you go to the Xbox Live Indie
1422300	1427060	Marketplace and look up new, even without even knowing the name of the game, just scan
1427060	1430140	through the tiles, and you will immediately know what game we're talking about just by
1430140	1431140	the image.
1431140	1432140	Yeah.
1432140	1433140	Booby Beach Bubble Bobble Boobies.
1433140	1434140	Yeah.
1434140	1436720	For the record, I love boobs.
1436720	1439020	You don't have to be straight or whatever.
1439020	1440020	Boobs are awesome.
1440020	1441020	We can all agree on that.
1441020	1442020	Right, Jamie?
1442020	1443020	Boobs are...
1443020	1444020	I'm very fond of mine.
1444020	1445020	There you go.
1445020	1446020	Everybody can agree.
1446020	1447020	And others.
1447020	1448500	One, two, three, four, five.
1448500	1449940	Five OLR people agree.
1449940	1450940	Boobies are great.
1450940	1451940	Right, Alan?
1451940	1452940	Boobies are great?
1452940	1453940	Yes.
1453940	1454940	Yes.
1454940	1455940	Thank you.
1455940	1459260	And I did see the Make a Baby game on there, but I didn't download it for you.
1459260	1460620	I already had the Make a Baby game.
1460620	1461620	Okay.
1461620	1462820	They have a sequel, by the way.
1462820	1463820	Do they?
1463820	1464820	Yes, they do.
1464820	1465820	That's the one I saw.
1465820	1466820	I haven't heard of the sequel.
1466820	1469300	Something about evil babies or something.
1469300	1470300	Evil babies?
1470300	1471300	I don't know.
1471300	1472300	Like Rosemary's Baby?
1472300	1473300	I don't know.
1473300	1474300	Alright.
1474300	1475300	Other than that, more of the same.
1475300	1476300	More wow.
1476300	1478500	Super Meat Boy, which Alan loves to watch me play.
1478500	1479500	Super Meat Boy.
1479500	1482200	Because I am not the mild man or radio host when I play Super Meat Boy.
1482200	1483780	But I had to check out the internets.
1483780	1488020	All those new levels and things that are on there, which I didn't realize, not all of
1488020	1489680	the levels are Super Meat Boy.
1489680	1491220	Like some of them are some of the other characters.
1491220	1492860	Like you have to play the other characters.
1492860	1495220	So yeah, good times.
1495220	1496220	So yeah.
1496220	1500660	I have that on PC, Super Meat Boy, but I haven't unlocked the headcrab yet.
1500660	1502900	And I'm a huge Half-Life fan.
1502900	1506500	So the fact that I can play as a headcrab, I need to get on that and unlock that.
1506500	1509020	Because that was the Valve Steam edition.
1509020	1510020	Alright.
1510020	1515500	Anyhow, let's move on with some housekeeping tonight.
1515500	1518220	There's actually a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
1518220	1521220	As you might have heard, it's our 400th episode of the show.
1521220	1526220	And we are unveiling on the podcast this week, which yes, is up to date now.
1526220	1527220	Thank you very much.
1527220	1528900	And we'll hopefully continue to be up to date.
1528900	1531540	I have some new ideas on how we're going to do that.
1531540	1535740	But the most important thing is that there is some brand new art for the show that we're
1535740	1537540	unveiling tonight, which is fun.
1537540	1539360	So Dark Sakura did it.
1539360	1540360	And it's nice.
1540360	1542540	It's nice to have a change of pace once in a while.
1542540	1543980	Yeah, I got creative.
1543980	1546060	It's not as orange as the art before.
1546060	1547060	There's orange in it.
1547060	1548060	There's orange in it.
1548060	1551180	No, which you know, the show is called Orange on its Radio for fuck's sake.
1551180	1552180	But it's nice.
1552180	1553180	I like what you do with it.
1553180	1556220	There's like a Mario theme going on, then a Charlie's Angels thing with the shadows,
1556220	1557220	which I like.
1557220	1558220	So check that out.
1558220	1559220	That'll be on the podcast feed.
1559220	1563100	It'll also show it's going to show up everywhere because it's going to switch the old art as
1563100	1565660	much as we love that picture and everything.
1565660	1567180	It is about five years old here.
1567180	1568660	Isn't that color anymore?
1568660	1570980	Well, you can't see the color anyways.
1570980	1574820	Your hair is orange in the picture because everything is my hair at the time was fuchsia.
1574820	1576020	Yeah.
1576020	1581380	That very like Mistress Tia took that picture and bitch moved to New York City like five
1581380	1582380	years ago.
1582380	1585340	So she's had like she's since had a child.
1585340	1586340	Yes.
1586340	1587340	That's how old that photo was.
1587340	1588340	So now we have a new thing.
1588340	1589340	Check that out.
1589340	1591460	And then lost a divorce worth of, you know, weight.
1591460	1592460	Yeah.
1592460	1593460	Oh yeah.
1593460	1594460	Oh yeah.
1594460	1595460	So I miss her by the way.
1595460	1596460	Very good job Miss Tia.
1596460	1599660	I know none of our listeners probably know her anymore because she was on the show forever
1599660	1600660	ago.
1600660	1604260	She was on the very last live OLR, if I remember right.
1604260	1605260	Yeah.
1605260	1608060	Or it was the first OLR when we married the two shows.
1608060	1611580	When OLR was a live show and then separately a podcast, I think she was on the very last
1611580	1612980	live only OLR.
1612980	1613980	Yeah.
1613980	1614980	So miss her.
1614980	1617780	Anyhow, reminiscing about things in the past.
1617780	1618780	Other things that are going on.
1618780	1621940	So not only do we have new artwork to represent the show, which will hopefully spread everywhere
1621940	1624100	because we're replacing our old stuff.
1624100	1629660	The other thing is that I want to give a plug for dead pixel live, which runs on all games
1629660	1634380	radio Monday through Thursday at seven o'clock Eastern four o'clock Pacific.
1634380	1636500	I was on the show earlier this week.
1636500	1637500	So check that out.
1637500	1638660	It was Thursday's episode.
1638660	1643940	So if you want to go back in his podcast feed and look at dead pixel live.com, you can check
1643940	1644940	that out.
1644940	1645940	And you're on for a while too.
1645940	1646940	Oh God.
1646940	1647980	He was like on for like an hour.
1647980	1650220	He was nice enough.
1650220	1653820	Derek over at dead pixel live has been doing his show a really long time as well.
1653820	1655100	And he's daily.
1655100	1659500	So he passed 400 episodes a long time ago because he's doing like four of them a week.
1659500	1661400	I think for a while he might've been doing five.
1661400	1666580	So he passed 400 a long time ago and you know, so we had a lot to talk about as, as much
1666580	1669080	as how do you stay motivated to do a show.
1669080	1670080	So it was cool.
1670080	1671980	Cause we just kind of, you know, BS back and forth for a little while.
1671980	1674460	And then he had me on for the news and we talked a little bit about NGP and some of
1674460	1675460	that other stuff.
1675460	1676460	So it was fun.
1676460	1677460	It was a fun time.
1677460	1678460	So I just want to give a plug for that.
1678460	1683020	And if you want to hear, um, another great show, I think that's really it.
1683020	1688500	As far as housekeeping goes, um, add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch
1688500	1692460	radio, or you can always add us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR lots of tweets this
1692460	1693460	week.
1693460	1697100	Cause we've been asking people about the show and I'll read some of those tweets a little
1697100	1701740	later on in the show, but for now, let's start off episode 400 as we always do with a little
1701740	1704340	bit of gaming news.
1704340	1707980	So Loki, what's going on in the world of gaming?
1707980	1713880	Um, same old stuff, I guess, you know, when people run out of ideas for consoles, what's
1713880	1718660	the first thing that happens actually, it's not even really consoles or games or anything
1718660	1724700	related to that, but, uh, even in the movie industry remakes, Hey, if it was good the
1724700	1726580	first time, it'll be good the second time.
1726580	1727580	Right?
1727580	1728580	Yeah.
1728580	1729580	Yeah.
1729580	1730580	Maybe.
1730580	1734220	Um, so Microsoft is rumored to be coming out, uh, well actually it's not so much a rumor
1734220	1735220	anymore.
1735220	1741140	Um, they're going to be remaking the original Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved, uh, it's coming
1741140	1747540	out this holiday for the Xbox 360, you'll be getting a, uh, kind of a graphical facelift.
1747540	1754340	Uh, they're expecting a 1080p resolution, uh, and also possibly 3D support.
1754340	1760020	Um, of course, uh, the thought is they're going to be remaking it using the reach engines,
1760020	1763220	so it'll look, you know, all fancy and stuff.
1763220	1768300	And uh, apparently it's being developed by, um, Saber Interactive, the company that was
1768300	1778180	behind, uh, Timeshift and, uh, Namco's, I guess, upcoming game Inversion, so, um, neat.
1778180	1784100	And uh, they said the game is expected to, uh, come out on November 15th, which is basically
1784100	1788380	ten years after the original Halo game, alongside the original Xbox.
1788380	1792340	It's kind of interesting, though, to go along with that, though, and maybe possibly one
1792340	1801460	of the features of the game, uh, connecthalo.com was registered by Microsoft, um, of course,
1801460	1806140	this is a URL that was registered to Microsoft back in June of 2010.
1806140	1810500	It could be, not necessarily that it's going to be a Connect Halo game, but maybe they
1810500	1814660	were just, you know, registering before people, uh, cyber-squatted on it, so.
1814660	1816340	Oh, good point, good point.
1816340	1817340	Who knows?
1817340	1821460	And the only thing that the Kinect will recognize is when you dip your knees down, so that you
1821460	1822460	can teabag.
1822460	1823460	Yes.
1823460	1824460	Nice.
1824460	1830900	Um, you know, honestly, though, I, I, I think it wouldn't be so bad if they had Kinect support,
1830900	1835260	but not necessarily in the fact that you have to, you know, stand up and, you know, play
1835260	1838580	the whole game that way, but, like, head tracking would be awesome.
1838580	1839580	Okay.
1839580	1845420	I don't, I, I see, you know, they said, oh yeah, we can do, you know, Kinect and controller
1845420	1846420	games.
1846420	1847420	Why don't they do head tracking?
1847420	1851540	Head tracking would be the easiest thing to support in, like, most of these games, you
1851540	1854140	know, you just have it where it tracks your head a little bit, and so it kind of gives
1854140	1858580	you a little bit more of immersion, and you don't necessarily need to do it, and, you
1858580	1861820	know, and it would be pretty awesome for any first-person shooter.
1861820	1865980	Now, backing up a little bit before we get into this whole Kinect theory, I think you
1865980	1870140	said, you know, this whole thing about the game, this was not an official Microsoft announcement,
1870140	1871140	right?
1871140	1874020	Like, somebody just blew the lid on their big E3 surprise, right?
1874020	1875020	Yes.
1875020	1878100	Like, is this some type of, like, insider leak, or, because they went on down to the
1878100	1879100	date.
1879100	1880100	That's something else.
1880100	1882140	Well, they're, I think they're guessing on the date.
1882140	1886300	They're saying, you know, it makes sense because it's ten years from the original, so, you
1886300	1887300	know.
1887300	1888300	Okay, fair enough.
1888300	1892820	Because, I mean, if you, let's see here, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna just pull this up here
1892820	1895900	real quick, because sometimes dates don't necessarily jive.
1895900	1896900	Right.
1896900	1901340	The fifteenth would be a Tuesday, so that is a release date, that's usually the typical
1901340	1905100	release date for a lot of these games nowadays.
1905100	1908860	Which is great, because they're finally getting along the lines with the movie industry.
1908860	1911660	They all released them on the same date.
1911660	1914460	Not if you're Nintendo, you sometimes do Sundays if you're Nintendo.
1914460	1918580	They've been doing less Sundays than they would have in the past, so.
1918580	1921340	But yeah, Nintendo, they had to be special.
1921340	1926600	Now, I gotta admit, this news isn't totally surprising, because I think Microsoft kind
1926600	1930940	of teased this idea when they shut down Halo 2 that, well, you never know, these games
1930940	1931940	might come back.
1931940	1937900	So, this news isn't, like, totally surprising, but, uh, you know, I think a lot of us thought,
1937900	1941460	oh, it would be an Xbox Live Arcade game, or they're not gonna go back and redo the
1941460	1942460	whole damn thing.
1942460	1944820	I mean, Halo is a pretty good looking game anyway.
1944820	1950060	They probably never said it wasn't gonna be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
1950060	1951060	Good point.
1951060	1952060	I guess anything's possible there.
1952060	1955060	But if they do all this Kinect stuff, and who knows, I think they're gonna release it
1955060	1956060	as a retail.
1956060	1957060	It's gonna be retail.
1957060	1959060	They can charge sixty bucks before they're gone.
1959060	1960060	Exactly.
1960060	1961060	Go ahead.
1961060	1964820	I was gonna say, it just seems weird to me that we're already gonna see a trend of remaking
1964820	1969340	games that, cause, like, the graphics on the PS2 and the Xbox original aren't really bad
1969340	1973500	enough to warrant a remaking, it's like remaking, I don't know, a ten year old movie, like American
1973500	1974500	Pie.
1974500	1979000	And plus, they upscaled that stuff anyways for, you know, if you played on the Xbox 360,
1979000	1981740	it does upscale those old games a little bit.
1981740	1983820	I mean, it's not terrible.
1983820	1986060	But we're already seeing this on the Playstation 3 a lot.
1986060	1990500	I mean, it's just like, all of a sudden, they're like, oh hey, got a word collection sold well,
1990500	1995380	let's remake everything, let's just update everything and port it onto the PS3.
1995380	1999580	Because none of that PS2 backwards compatibility is coming anytime soon.
1999580	2003660	Or so we think, and then all of a sudden, boom, look, oh, you know how you can play
2003660	2006540	those games that you just bought on the PS3.
2006540	2009060	I don't mind a lot of the remakes, actually.
2009060	2011980	A lot of them are pretty good, and they bring some bonus stuff to the table.
2011980	2015500	I know that might sound really weird, like the Hollywood remakes I could do without.
2015500	2016620	Most of those are poop.
2016620	2020700	But like, for instance, Square Enix, we have a show, a story later in the show about Final
2020700	2022020	Fantasy IV coming on the PSP.
2022020	2023020	It looks badass.
2023020	2024340	I can't wait to get it.
2024340	2027540	I mean, granted, that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy games they ever made, but I
2027540	2031500	mean, those Final Fantasy remakes in general, one and two on the PSP and then the ones on
2031500	2033980	the DS, were all awesome, and all of them were worth having.
2033980	2036500	Isn't that, isn't that some kind of a head scratcher too, because, you know, for the
2036500	2040180	longest time on the PSP, and then, granted, there's a Kingdom Hearts game here and there
2040180	2044220	and stuff like that, but there isn't really a lot of games I'm really interested in, and
2044220	2048300	all of a sudden it's like, oh, by the way, now we're gonna put out Final Fantasy IV on,
2048300	2050060	you know, and the after years on the PSP.
2050060	2051300	It's like, whoa, hey, that's pretty cool.
2051300	2052780	You know, I gotta pick up that.
2052780	2056860	Oh, hey, Earth Defense Force II is coming out on the PSP in Japan, but, you know, eventually
2056860	2057860	they'll come out over here.
2057860	2060860	Hey, that's pretty cool, and then, there was one other one.
2060860	2065260	I can't remember what it was, so, but like, I mean, you know, there's Third Birthday,
2065260	2071780	a new Desida game, and it's just a lot of cool stuff coming out.
2071780	2073260	Anyhow, go ahead.
2073260	2077040	I just think with games it's very easy to blur the line between what is a remake and
2077040	2081540	what is a port with new menus, and depending on how, you know, sleazy the company is, they
2081540	2083060	can call it one when it's really the other.
2083060	2084060	I don't know.
2084060	2085060	True.
2085060	2087460	One game I totally left out of my gaming week that I meant to talk about, I actually downloaded
2087460	2091980	on the PlayStation 3 this week the PlayStation 1 version of Mega Man 2, which they'd released,
2091980	2093420	I think, just last week.
2093420	2096540	I think these games were really new to the PlayStation Marketplace, which is cool.
2096540	2097540	I love Mega Man 2.
2097540	2101160	It's one of my favorite Mega Mans they ever did, and it's really just the NES version,
2101160	2104900	but the way they market it on the Marketplace, and I should have known this because it's
2104900	2111100	just a port of the PlayStation 1 version, but it's really just the NES game on the PS1
2111100	2115140	with some fancy menus, and I think the PocketStation game is in there, too.
2115140	2120060	I can't understand a lick of the menus because they are all in pretty intense Japanese, like,
2120060	2123100	it's not easy to navigate around the game.
2123100	2126380	I mean, you just kind of figure start, start, start, eventually will get you in the game,
2126380	2127380	and it does.
2127380	2132260	But unfortunately, total lack from Sony, even in the online manual, if you go into the online
2132260	2135860	manual on the PS3, I don't even know if a lot of you guys know this, but if you pause
2135860	2139500	your game on the PlayStation 3 if you're playing a PS1 game, you can go in and look at the
2139500	2140500	original manual.
2140500	2142100	It's all in there, like a PDF that you navigate around.
2142100	2144820	PSP has that, too, when you play a PS1 game on a PSP.
2144820	2145820	Exactly.
2145820	2146820	Same feature.
2146820	2148460	But, yeah, they didn't bother to translate the manual, either.
2148460	2150100	So it's just Japanese, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese.
2150100	2151100	Great if you speak Japanese.
2151100	2152100	I don't.
2152100	2153140	Way to go, Capcom.
2153140	2154140	You suck.
2154140	2155140	So anyway.
2155140	2157580	Let's look for Roku instead of Mega.
2157580	2162900	Well it's just, you know, whereas I support this whole Japanese release of games, I mean,
2162900	2167260	I understand if they don't have the manpower to go in and translate the original ROM.
2167260	2168260	That is a little bit of work.
2168260	2171260	What they need to do is they need to give it the same treatment that it would as the
2171260	2172260	Asian regions.
2172260	2175220	Like, for example, I imported Wangan Midnight.
2175220	2180340	Granted, the game's all in Japanese, the manual's all in Japanese, but they have one sheet in
2180340	2184380	there that's in English that basically gives you the controls of the game.
2184380	2185380	Perfect.
2185380	2186380	Awesome.
2186380	2187380	Perfect.
2187380	2188380	That's all I need to do to, you know, play the game.
2188380	2192340	A few basic menus it translates for you, and the rest you have to figure it out yourself.
2192340	2193840	That's all you need to do.
2193840	2195380	That takes like one person to do that.
2195380	2198420	I mean, seriously, you don't even need to translate this stuff, you just kind of figure
2198420	2201700	it out, write it down, create a graphic, boom.
2201700	2202700	Done.
2202700	2203700	What?
2203700	2204700	That's maybe a day's worth of work.
2204700	2208180	Oh, but that's way too much for Capcom.
2208180	2212580	They're too busy implementing DRM and shit, so whatever.
2212580	2213860	Alright.
2213860	2218820	Somehow we got way off base of the original Halo Connect thing.
2218820	2221860	But as you were talking about with Mega Man stuff, and I made the comment that was pretty
2221860	2225740	funny before the show, and you said save it for the show, so I'll just repeat it on the
2225740	2226740	show.
2226740	2227740	Sure.
2227740	2232700	We were talking about rehashes and stuff, and I was bitching about the Super Mario All-Stars
2232700	2238060	limited edition, basically a port of a Super Nintendo game onto the Wii.
2238060	2242460	And hey, guess what, they could have charged $8 for it on Virtual Console, but no, they're
2242460	2244900	going to make you pay $30 for it.
2244900	2248620	It's basically like Nintendo taking a giant shit in your mouth, and of course all the
2248620	2253620	fans will eagerly gobble it up, because it's a Nintendo.
2253620	2257500	And you know, shit in your mouth now also available in teal blue, so you have that option
2257500	2258500	as well.
2258500	2259500	Hooray!
2259500	2263780	Looking at some comments from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, I'm having
2263780	2267820	to scroll back here a little bit because they said these a while ago, but Dark Tetsuya says,
2267820	2272540	See, I had a feeling Microsoft would remake the older games since the Xbox originals can't
2272540	2273860	connect to Live anymore.
2273860	2275900	Kind of the same thing I was thinking with Halo 2.
2275900	2279140	But Halo 1 didn't have multiplayer, I don't know if you guys remember that.
2279140	2281420	It had, excuse me, it didn't have Xbox Live.
2281420	2283540	It had like LAN support.
2283540	2287580	The first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception, true story.
2287580	2292780	And they had a LAN thing all set up with the original Halo, it was neat.
2292780	2298220	And then Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I'm a Halo fan, but jeesh, unless it's continuing
2298220	2302340	the storyline, not doing the stupid past, but I'm not into this crap anymore.
2302340	2307300	Well technically, Halo 1 is a sequel to Halo Reach.
2307300	2308300	Technically.
2308300	2309300	I guess.
2309300	2312780	So they could say, hey, it's a sequel to Halo Reach.
2312780	2314980	Halo 1.
2314980	2321860	Because Halo 1 lacked Xbox Live, I can see where they want to do this again.
2321860	2323700	And they can kind of get away with it.
2323700	2326620	Because it would be bringing something new to the table that the original Halo didn't
2326620	2327620	have.
2327620	2328620	You know what I mean?
2328620	2331100	You know, maybe while they're at it, instead of straight porting it over, maybe they can
2331100	2332260	tweak a few things.
2332260	2333260	Add some maps.
2333260	2334260	Add some little...
2334260	2336660	Throw the Halo 2 maps in there, durr.
2336660	2337660	Add some like...
2337660	2339180	They need to add in red versus blue mode.
2339180	2341980	They're not going to add any Halo 2 maps in there, because you know why?
2341980	2345340	Because they're going to release Halo 2 in HD, so yeah.
2345340	2348900	Well then charge 1600 Microsoft points for it or something.
2348900	2352540	I mean, I know, wishful thinking, right, but who knows.
2352540	2353540	Anyhow.
2353540	2355580	All right, let's move on to some other stories.
2355580	2359140	And yeah, this is kind of along those same lines about rehashes and so forth.
2359140	2360360	Although not really.
2360360	2361360	This is more of a dud.
2361360	2364220	This is about a game coming out on the 3DS.
2364220	2368740	New Super Mario Brothers was somewhat announced for the 3DS.
2368740	2369920	I mean, come on, people.
2369920	2372660	Of course there's going to be a Mario game on the 3DS.
2372660	2376220	But it's nice to hear a little bit of a confirmation that it is being worked on, because that tells
2376220	2379500	you this game is probably coming out a little sooner rather than later.
2379500	2385060	In fact, in my mind, this kind of says it's probably one of their E3 games this year,
2385060	2388500	because you know they've got to unveil some big things on the 3DS this year.
2388500	2389500	Anyhow.
2389500	2390500	Come on.
2390500	2391700	Come up with a new damn game.
2391700	2392700	I understand.
2392700	2396820	Ooh, it's New Super Mario Brothers, and we're porting it through all the different systems.
2396820	2397820	Well...
2397820	2398820	Come up with a new game.
2398820	2399820	You don't call it...
2399820	2400820	First off, don't call it New Super Mario Brothers.
2400820	2403460	That's a stupid name for a game.
2403460	2404460	Well, that...
2404460	2405460	Okay, where to begin?
2405460	2406460	First off, that's not...
2406460	2407460	You know, they haven't confirmed that that's named.
2407460	2410180	Let me tell you what's been said, because we're reading a lot into this.
2410180	2413380	I'm just saying that they have New Super Mario Brothers Wii, and they have New Super Mario
2413380	2415580	Brothers, you know.
2415580	2419140	The New Super Mario Brothers Wii is the most ironic thing ever, because it's not new.
2419140	2420140	It's just a...
2420140	2421660	But let's be honest, Loki.
2421660	2426620	The New Super Mario Brothers DS and the New Super Mario Brothers Wii are both probably
2426620	2430820	at least in the top ten games on those respective consoles, easily, if not the top five.
2430820	2434140	Okay, and so that gives them the excuse to come up with crappy names for their games.
2434140	2435140	That's awesome.
2435140	2436140	Super...
2436140	2439980	Super Take a Dump, you know, it's the, you know, Zelda sequel.
2439980	2440980	Oh, but...
2440980	2441980	So your problem is the name.
2441980	2442980	I don't want to see that in 3D.
2442980	2443980	My name...
2443980	2445740	Yeah, my problem is the name of the game.
2445740	2448700	It's just like New Super Mario Brothers.
2448700	2449700	Wow!
2449700	2451340	Thank you for putting all that effort in there.
2451340	2453980	Well, what are we going to call this New Super Mario Brothers game?
2453980	2454980	That's genius!
2454980	2458980	Well, now calling it Luigi's Mansion didn't really work out for them.
2458980	2461540	Well, that was a different game entirely, you know.
2461540	2464020	Come up with something new.
2464020	2468820	Stop porting shit over because you have casual people and playing these systems and stuff.
2468820	2470260	It had Super Princess Peach.
2470260	2471940	I don't think that did so hot either.
2471940	2476140	Well, that's because Princess Peach can't hold her own fucking game unless it was cooking
2476140	2478780	or doing makeup or something.
2478780	2479780	Wow!
2479780	2482580	Dark Sakura, Rebuttal?
2482580	2483580	She's doing her nails?
2483580	2485580	Dude, it's Princess Peach.
2485580	2486860	Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you.
2486860	2488940	I was actually cutting out a very painful hangnail.
2488940	2489940	Oh, okay.
2489940	2493020	But I have something sharp in my hand.
2493020	2494420	And this is home turf.
2494420	2496660	Dude, it's Princess Peach, though.
2496660	2501140	It's not like we're fucking talking about, like, Lara Croft or some shit like that.
2501140	2503540	It's Princess Prissy Peach, okay?
2503540	2505300	Hey, I love Princess Peach.
2505300	2506300	Shut your mouth.
2506300	2507300	Who's Daisy in the bad house?
2507300	2510780	The special abilities are her fucking emotions.
2510780	2511780	I'm anger now!
2511780	2512780	Ooh, I'm happy!
2512780	2518300	I used to joke in Mario Brothers 2 that when she floated in her pink dress, it's because
2518300	2519300	she had gas.
2519300	2520300	And she'd go psssh.
2520300	2522220	Fucking bipolar Princess Peach to the rescue.
2522220	2527420	I will take you on in Super Smash Brothers, and I will whoop your ass with Peach.
2527420	2528420	She's awesome.
2528420	2529420	No, no, no.
2529420	2531060	It's all about Zelda in cheek mode.
2531060	2532460	Ah, yes.
2532460	2533660	Zelda is pretty awesome.
2533660	2534660	Anyhow.
2534660	2536260	Zelda cosplaying as a gay man.
2536260	2539980	Can I read the damn quote that led us to this whole thing in the first place?
2539980	2540980	Yes.
2540980	2542980	What are we talking about again?
2542980	2543980	Halo.
2543980	2544980	Miyamoto.
2544980	2545980	That's right.
2545980	2546980	Yes, Halo on the 3DS.
2546980	2547980	Excellent.
2547980	2548980	Alright.
2548980	2549980	Look, Miyamoto says, yes.
2549980	2553940	So in the interest of adopting a new technology for the Super Mario Brothers tradition, I
2553940	2557960	am now making a new Super Mario Brothers game for the Nintendo 3DS system.
2557960	2563140	By the way, this is out of a Q&A from Iwata on Nintendo's site.
2563140	2566980	Iwata says, the next stage for the Super Mario Brothers Preservation Society's activities
2566980	2568620	is the Nintendo 3DS.
2568620	2570580	Miyamoto, yes, laughs.
2570580	2572620	Because he's thinking about money.
2572620	2576140	Miyamoto then stripped naked and landed in a kiddie pool of money and just cried and
2576140	2577140	laughed and screamed.
2577140	2580140	Like, $50 is going to be fucking New Super Mario Brothers 3D.
2580140	2582060	That is going to be the fucking title of the game.
2582060	2584900	Seriously, that is going to be it.
2584900	2587060	New Super Mario Brothers 3D.
2587060	2588060	That's it.
2588060	2589060	There's the title.
2589060	2590060	You mad?
2590060	2591060	Alright.
2591060	2592060	I'm just saying that...
2592060	2593780	Can I finish the quote?
2593780	2594780	Can I finish?
2594780	2595780	Can I finish?
2595780	2596780	Fine.
2596780	2597780	Go ahead.
2597780	2601300	I want to show everyone as soon as possible what the New Super Mario Brothers will be
2601300	2602980	like on the Nintendo 3DS.
2602980	2604460	I'm finished.
2604460	2606100	I'm just saying.
2606100	2607980	I want to show you what it's going to be like.
2607980	2608980	Turn on the Wii.
2608980	2612980	Turn on the DS.
2612980	2614980	Done.
2614980	2622180	But, by the way, the fact that he says, as soon as possible, do you think that expo in
2622180	2624500	June in LA will be the place to see it?
2624500	2626740	You know what as soon as possible is?
2626740	2628940	That's Nintendo time we're talking here, okay?
2628940	2632020	As soon as possible means we're going to announce it as soon as possible, but it may not come
2632020	2634700	out for a couple years.
2634700	2642460	It all depends on how quickly they can port Mario 64 3D.
2642460	2648580	AlphaKananagram in our chatroom says, I remember Miyamoto saying he wanted to remake Super
2648580	2649940	Mario World, I think.
2649940	2651540	I like Super Mario World.
2651540	2655080	That was like one of the greatest video games ever made was the original Mario World.
2655080	2659380	By the way, the new album art kind of pays homage to that, actually.
2659380	2661380	Kind of funny how that works.
2661380	2665260	That was the first decent high res picture of a low res image I could find.
2665260	2666260	It worked out, man.
2666260	2667260	Yeah.
2667260	2668260	That's a great game.
2668260	2669260	I like it, especially since a bullet bill's eating your head.
2669260	2672780	Even the hater over here has to admit that it's one of the better games that they ever
2672780	2674620	made as he goes back to playing Galaga.
2674620	2678060	I realized after I did it that a bullet bill was eating your head.
2678060	2679060	That's all right.
2679060	2680060	Yeah.
2680060	2681060	All right.
2681060	2682060	How about something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo?
2682060	2683060	How about it?
2683060	2684060	It does have to do with Nintendo.
2684060	2685060	God damn it.
2685060	2686060	But not really.
2686060	2687060	Well, it's on the 3DS.
2687060	2688540	I'll leave it that way.
2688540	2692380	Three imaginings for Pac-Man and Galaga on the 3DS.
2692380	2697100	We will have Pac-Man Tilt and Galaga 3D Impact.
2697100	2701100	And they are in the same pack, which is Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions that are going to be
2701100	2704020	out on the 3DS.
2704020	2708260	Pac-Man Tilt sort of is a gyroscope type game, so he's in Rainbow Land.
2708260	2710420	Look, he paused the game.
2710420	2711420	I'm waiting.
2711420	2715260	With Championship Edition style.
2715260	2717960	And it's just very Tilty.
2717960	2721140	You have to watch out because you may injure yourself.
2721140	2723580	I do not like Tilty games for the record.
2723580	2726500	I don't want to do that on the subway, because I'll hit someone.
2726500	2731240	I love this picture, by the way, of the guy moving the 3DS around and moving it above
2731240	2732240	his head.
2732240	2733240	There's a little picture there.
2733240	2735460	Oh, Loki, did you have a comment?
2735460	2745340	I was just going to say that, I mean, I know Pac-Man is your staple franchise, Namco.
2745340	2749540	It's just like Konami trying to shove fucking Frogger down our throats.
2749540	2752020	Seriously, I don't give a shit about Pac-Man anymore.
2752020	2754020	I think a lot of people don't give a shit about Pac-Man.
2754020	2755020	Grab Pac-Man.
2755020	2756020	No, no, no.
2756020	2757020	Hold on.
2757020	2758020	Stop.
2758020	2759020	Stop.
2759020	2760020	Shut up.
2760020	2761020	Okay.
2761020	2762020	Stop it.
2762020	2763020	Real quick.
2763020	2764020	Granted, Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty awesome.
2764020	2765020	Thank you.
2765020	2766020	Because it is like the original Pac-Man.
2766020	2768100	I don't give a shit about Tilty Pac-Man.
2768100	2770460	I don't give a shit about Pac-Man in a go-kart.
2770460	2772580	I don't give a shit about Pac-Man at a party.
2772580	2775340	I don't give a shit about multiplayer Pac-Man.
2775340	2779060	I mean, it's just, Pac-Man's cool.
2779060	2783900	If you want to port it 8 billion times like you've already done, fine, you know, because
2783900	2785900	people just need to own Pac-Man again.
2785900	2791220	But stop trying to force Pac-Man down my throat.
2791220	2799620	That's like, I mean, seriously, it's just, okay, well, can I finish my story, please?
2799620	2802060	Do people keep buying it?
2802060	2803900	Because they're stupid.
2803900	2804900	Because it's cheap.
2804900	2807800	Because they put it out in the iPod and stuff for 99 cents.
2807800	2811020	Because people buy anything for 99 cents.
2811020	2813020	My sensibilities are being offended.
2813020	2814020	Yes, Dark Sakura.
2814020	2815620	I'm going to finish my story now, please.
2815620	2817340	Go ahead.
2817340	2820380	And besides that, Pac-Pix did kind of suck.
2820380	2821380	Seriously.
2821380	2822380	Terrible.
2822380	2828340	The Galaga is going to be completely reimagined as a rail shooter, by the way.
2828340	2831280	I don't know how I feel about that.
2831280	2833540	The thought that I might enjoy it makes me feel a little dirty.
2833540	2834540	I'd look at that.
2834540	2835540	I'd check that out.
2835540	2836540	It'd be awesome.
2836540	2837540	You'd hit that?
2837540	2838540	What?
2838540	2839540	You'd hit that?
2839540	2840540	Yeah.
2840540	2844660	Let's do a Space Invaders rail shooter in the time crisis engine, since we're aborting
2844660	2846180	on all these franchises.
2846180	2854980	Hey, because Yars' Revenge is going to be awesome as a rail shooter with anime chicks.
2854980	2857020	I think I'm done.
2857020	2860300	No interest in the battle royale game, that new arcade table.
2860300	2861380	That looks kind of cool.
2861380	2862380	No interest?
2862380	2863380	No, it's stupid.
2863380	2869860	I mean, because if you play that game with one person, you're playing the original Pac-Man.
2869860	2873380	Well maybe, Loki, maybe you need to evaluate.
2873380	2875140	Why don't I have any friends?
2875140	2876140	Could it be?
2876140	2877140	Oh, I'm sorry.
2877140	2880020	I don't want to be friends because I don't want to play multiplayer Pac-Man with them.
2880020	2882020	Well those aren't friends I want.
2882020	2887900	Why won't you play multiplayer Pac-Man with me, man?
2887900	2888900	What's wrong?
2888900	2890420	Why won't you play with me?
2890420	2893420	Because you never let me be Pinky!
2893420	2895620	Because you like crappy games!
2895620	2904060	No, it's... seriously though, I mean, I had to laugh though with just that arcade cabinet
2904060	2908540	because it's so expensive and it's meant to look like a cocktail cabinet.
2908540	2911280	Like people still remember what cocktail cabinets are.
2911280	2916020	Especially kids nowadays don't know what the fuck a cocktail cabinet is, and that shit's
2916020	2924500	gonna get broken so fast, and, really, I don't see a big draw to Pac-Man in the arcade.
2924500	2928260	People don't go to the fucking arcades to play Pac-Man, they can play Pac-Man on everything
2928260	2930300	because Namco's hoarded out to everything.
2930300	2931620	Including Google.
2931620	2932820	Exactly!
2932820	2938960	So why do I need to go to the arcade to play Pac-Man when I can play it anywhere?
2938960	2942180	So how does Ultracade manage to make any money then?
2942180	2945100	Because it seems like they've done a great job by cashing in on them.
2945100	2947780	There's always someone on the damn Ultracade machine at Dave & Buster's.
2947780	2948780	Always!
2948780	2949780	Easy!
2949780	2951580	Because their cabinets are cheap to reproduce.
2951580	2955060	Basically it's a cheap monitor, they have a cheap computer inside there that's running
2955060	2959700	on an arcade board, they license everything, and it gives a good option for arcade owners
2959700	2964300	because you have multiple games in one small cabinet instead of having a full arcade full
2964300	2965300	of games.
2965300	2968680	It's basically, you know, drop it in and you make money because everybody has a game that
2968680	2970680	they like on there.
2970680	2971860	And you can kick the machine!
2971860	2973860	It's fun.
2973860	2977140	Ah, moving on.
2977140	2981860	AlphaKananagram says, how much is that battle royale cabinet?
2981860	2985420	I don't remember the exact cost but I believe it's like $5,000 which is ridiculous.
2985420	2990340	And it's only because there's a stupid touch screen, you know, HDTV in there.
2990340	2992140	And honestly the game is-
2992140	2994140	Sounds pretty.
2994140	2995580	Great!
2995580	2996580	You know what?
2996580	3002920	They should just make it, port it to the Microsoft Surface because that's just, it has no software
3002920	3003920	for it.
3003920	3004920	I remember those.
3004920	3005920	That was fun.
3005920	3011100	That was at PAX that one year in that hotel that we weren't even staying at.
3011100	3015900	Because we were in the other hotel down the street but for some reason, who's hotel was
3015900	3016900	that?
3016900	3017900	Was that Bobby's hotel?
3017900	3018900	It was Bobby's.
3018900	3019900	We were just camped in front of the Microsoft Surface.
3019900	3020900	Actually we had a lot of fun though.
3020900	3021900	That was a fun time.
3021900	3022900	We were playing with the fish.
3022900	3023900	We were.
3023900	3024900	Google Maps.
3024900	3025900	Anyhow, sorry.
3025900	3026900	Reminiscing.
3026900	3027900	Yeah.
3027900	3035460	So move server is coming to PC is apparently maybe revealed at a game developer's conference.
3035460	3040940	Now what move server is is actually kind of a software development kit for porting move
3040940	3045500	controls over to the PC so you can use the, you know, move on the PC.
3045500	3049700	Not to be outdone by the Kinect or anything.
3049700	3051180	Neat idea I guess.
3051180	3056900	They already have kind of move type controllers anyways for the PC.
3056900	3060580	But I guess if you, you know, really want to find another use for your move controller
3060580	3064180	then you can go ahead and use it on your PC.
3064180	3069740	I'd imagine though you would need a Bluetooth adapter and, well obviously the stuff for
3069740	3073640	the move, the camera and everything.
3073640	3078340	Obviously no software supports it yet but, you know, it's set to be announced possibly
3078340	3079420	on March 2nd.
3079420	3083340	Am I the only one that doesn't really understand the need for the Kinect and the move stuff
3083340	3084340	on the PC?
3084340	3088500	I don't know about you guys, but my PC is in my bedroom and it's kind of in a space
3088500	3090900	where I don't really want to move around.
3090900	3096060	Like that's my place to get fat is I sit my butt in that chair and I have my feet up on
3096060	3098580	the desk and I'm playing World of Warcraft.
3098580	3099740	Click click click click click.
3099740	3100740	Yeah.
3100740	3102580	I don't play Kinect in my bedroom.
3102580	3104660	Here's the thing for the move stuff.
3104660	3105660	Who would do that?
3105660	3106660	Well.
3106660	3107660	Maybe a paraplegic.
3107660	3112860	The Kinect, I mean, I think is going to entice people more to hook it up to the PC because
3112860	3115140	of all the cool, neat things you can do with it.
3115140	3117000	The move is really just another controller.
3117000	3118000	It's like the Wii.
3118000	3121700	And honestly, the move wasn't that exciting when it came out on the PlayStation 3.
3121700	3126760	I mean, it's a decent controller, but it, and I know that they're really pushing hard
3126760	3131220	for it to be like a first person shooter and a hardcore accessory.
3131220	3135260	But honestly, the hardcore players out there, they see right through this shit and they're
3135260	3139300	not going to just go buy their stupid looking machine gun looking thing to plug this thing
3139300	3145740	into just because it's supposed to, it doesn't make you more accurate in these first person
3145740	3146740	shooter games.
3146740	3147860	It's just kind of weird.
3147860	3151660	But I don't think that you're going to see a lot of super innovative stuff with this.
3151660	3156500	I mean, the same type of stuff that you would see with this, you can do already on the Wii
3156500	3158380	remote with a Bluetooth adapter.
3158380	3163220	So I don't know, I'm just kind of scratching my head with it.
3163220	3168740	But hey, whatever, you know, they can go, hey, look, we're on PC too, yay.
3168740	3172460	You know, I just kind of saw this as trying to beat Microsoft to the punch in kind of
3172460	3177660	officially supporting them because they clearly, Sony sees, oh, great, people want to have
3177660	3179300	these motion controllers on their PCs.
3179300	3180300	That's awesome.
3180300	3184700	But the thing is, though, is it, I mean, what are you going to be able to do with it?
3184700	3186340	That's my thing is what are you going to be able to do with it?
3186340	3190900	I mean, the controller, it's pretty accurate and stuff, but it doesn't do all the cool
3190900	3195420	nifty like, you know, 3D scan stuff that you can do with the Kinect.
3195420	3197180	It's just, you know, good.
3197180	3202260	Now I have the vision camera support or whatever in, or not the vision camera, the PlayStation
3202260	3203260	Eye.
3203260	3212500	You know, big deal, now I can, I have a webcam, whoo, I mean, it's just, I don't see the point.
3212500	3215940	I would be kind of curious, though, I don't know if you actually need the eye camera.
3215940	3221420	I wonder if you can just use normal web cameras to, kind of as like the eye, that'd be kind
3221420	3222420	of neat.
3222420	3223420	See if you could do that.
3223420	3228260	But, I don't know, whatever, I guess it's good that they have another option.
3228260	3232420	I just don't see a lot of, you know, unless it's other than indie games and stuff like
3232420	3236260	that, I don't see a lot of people, like, adding support for this for their games.
3236260	3238900	I just don't think that's going to happen.
3238900	3243900	Again, I don't, if you have to buy all this other stuff to make it work, like the Bluetooth
3243900	3246740	adapter or whatever, well, I guess computers haven't built in nowadays, right?
3246740	3250180	A lot of computers have them, I mean, laptops and stuff have them built in.
3250180	3254900	Not so much, you know, actual PCs and stuff like that.
3254900	3256860	But I mean, that stuff's cheap.
3256860	3259380	It's not too expensive to add a Bluetooth adapter.
3259380	3262220	If you're really interested in this stuff, and hey, you may have one for like a headset
3262220	3267540	or something like that, so, great, but, I don't know, I guess it's neat to have the
3267540	3271140	option, but I just don't see a lot of people using this.
3271140	3274260	I think that the Kinect is going to be a lot more popular when it comes to stuff.
3274260	3277900	I mean, you'll see a lot of, you know, cool move hacks and stuff, and I mean, granted,
3277900	3281780	they could have come up with, I mean, it's Bluetooth, they could have come up with custom
3281780	3288260	drivers and stuff for the, the move controllers and everything, but you don't see anyone doing
3288260	3290380	that because no one cares.
3290380	3294660	It's just like, I don't think anyone's going to really care when this comes out for PC.
3294660	3301260	Alright, well, let's move on, since Loki is such a fan of Nintendo tonight, I just have
3301260	3303380	to get his opinion on this story.
3303380	3308580	One of the big games that Nintendo was hawking at last year's E3 was Zelda Skyward Sword.
3308580	3312880	Well, it looks like that they might be kind of pushing that game again at the expo this
3312880	3316940	year because it looks like Skyward Sword is going to be a little while before it comes
3316940	3317940	out.
3317940	3320760	It's clearly the first quarter of the year, it's not happening.
3320760	3325800	Second quarter of the year is looking a little grim because they have said that The Legend
3325800	3330880	of Zelda Ocarina of Time has been in the process of being remade for Nintendo 3DS, and this
3330880	3336140	Nintendo 3DS version is expected to hit the market earlier than Skyward Sword.
3336140	3340500	And that's what Satoru Iwata says in a recent financial report piece.
3340500	3341500	Come on, folks.
3341500	3342980	I mean, remade.
3342980	3346820	All they're doing is just porting the assets to the fucking 3DS, that's all they're doing.
3346820	3347820	Ooh, remade.
3347820	3351700	I thought at one point Nintendo was touting how easy it was to port games over to 3DS.
3351700	3352700	Exactly!
3352700	3353700	That's why there's so many-
3353700	3354700	Anything with a Z-axis.
3354700	3359940	It's just all, all it is is just, you know, some core engine stuff that they're rebuilding
3359940	3363340	and then all the assets and stuff, they're just porting on over.
3363340	3366700	I don't think that they're really up-resing a lot of the stuff that's on there.
3366700	3370820	They're just kind of straight porting it over and then, you know, tweaking the engine a
3370820	3372300	little bit to have it all run in.
3372300	3373860	That's all they're doing.
3373860	3375700	The Skyward Sword stuff, I'm not surprised.
3375700	3379340	I mean, look at how long, you know, Metroid Other M was delayed.
3379340	3384220	I mean, it was just kind of getting pushed back and back and back, you know, for a while.
3384220	3385460	And same with a lot of the other games.
3385460	3390020	And I would not be surprised if something like this, you know, doesn't come out.
3390020	3394260	I mean, because a lot of times I think that they're, they promise a lot of games that
3394260	3396180	come out and then they just don't have them.
3396180	3400380	And so they're like, okay, well crap, what's it going to be our holiday game or something
3400380	3401380	like that?
3401380	3405620	And then it'll get pushed to, you know, November or something like that.
3405620	3407180	Because really they haven't announced a lot of stuff.
3407180	3412860	I mean, sure, there's gonna be stuff at E3, but I don't know.
3412860	3416420	It's just, they're going to be looking for that big holiday title and sell more systems
3416420	3417420	for the Wii.
3417420	3418420	That's kind of my thought too.
3418420	3422780	You know, Miyamoto, they say in this that Miyamoto's team is entering the final completion
3422780	3425100	stage of the Wii title, whatever that means.
3425100	3428860	But this kind of makes me think that maybe part of the reason for this delay is so that
3428860	3432060	they have something to show on the Wii this year at that big expo.
3432060	3433060	You know what I mean?
3433060	3437820	Like maybe, uh, there's not a lot else scheduled to be coming out on the Wii.
3437820	3438820	Maybe just Dance 3?
3438820	3439820	I don't know.
3439820	3446220	I mean, I think what, well, some things I could see them doing, like, uh, you know,
3446220	3451100	New Super Mario Brothers 2, you know, I could see them doing something like that just because
3451100	3454620	they already have the engine built and it's basically just building new levels for it.
3454620	3458100	Maybe tweaking and adding some new things on their new abilities or some shit like that
3458100	3460460	and everyone will go buck wild over it.
3460460	3465620	Um, uh, they've been promising Pikmin forever, so they'll make me a new Pikmin game.
3465620	3470740	But honestly, I mean, I just can't get too excited about Pikmin, I'm sorry.
3470740	3476460	Um, I mean, I think this year there's going to be a lot of 3DS games, um, you know, you
3476460	3477460	may see...
3477460	3478460	Of course.
3478460	3480940	You're going to see a lot of stuff that they've already announced that's not coming out, like
3480940	3486500	the Kid Icarus game, again, is going to be another focus of, you know, E3 because it's
3486500	3490460	probably going to be their, I'd be willing to bet that's one of their holiday titles
3490460	3492460	for the 3DS.
3492460	3496940	Um, I don't know, it's just, it's more of the same.
3496940	3501380	I mean, that's all it really is, it's just, you know, what franchise haven't they put
3501380	3502380	out for a while?
3502380	3505220	I mean, okay, that's probably going to be the game coming.
3505220	3509660	Alright, let's go to Dark Soccer with another story for us, then we'll get to release dates.
3509660	3512020	We are just Nintendo focused today, aren't we?
3512020	3513740	Oh, we go where the news is.
3513740	3516400	Well, Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.
3516400	3519820	He has a problem with mobile gaming.
3519820	3521520	I have a problem with mobile gaming.
3521520	3526700	He has a problem with how cheap mobile games are, like, you know, for iPhone and this type
3526700	3527700	of app games.
3527700	3534740	He's basically, um, quoted saying that one of the biggest risks in the industry is inexpensive
3534740	3538940	games that are disposable from a consumer standpoint.
3538940	3543100	As in, oh crap, 99 cents, I'm fine with it, I'm done with it.
3543100	3548540	And basically it removes the idea of, you know, value from the game because now you're
3548540	3554900	so saturated with things that are so cheap that you expect everything to be so cheap.
3554900	3558380	What an amazing fucking metaphor for the state of games on the Wii.
3558380	3559380	Yeah.
3559380	3561700	I mean, here's the problem though.
3561700	3562700	Irony much?
3562700	3567140	You know, the problem with that thought though is that, what if those cheap games are really
3567140	3568140	good?
3568140	3569660	Well, see, that's what he said.
3569660	3571060	Well, now that's not possible.
3571060	3576080	He used Angry Birds as an example of the diamond in the rough, you know, that every so often
3576080	3580580	you come up with something that's exceptional, but for the most part, they're all just cookie
3580580	3581580	cutter crap.
3581580	3584560	Well, hey, you know, guess what, Nintendo?
3584560	3588620	You have this thing called the DSiWare service, why don't you start cutting, you know, coming
3588620	3595120	up with some really cheap concept games, sell them for, you know, a buck, and make some
3595120	3599180	money instead of bitching about how other people are being successful.
3599180	3600420	Waaah!
3600420	3602500	People are selling games and making money.
3602500	3604420	Why didn't I think of that?
3604420	3605420	Waaah!
3605420	3610420	Why isn't my, you know, twenty dollar copy of Let's Go Cook Some Shit in My Kitchen,
3610420	3612180	you know, not selling well?
3612180	3613180	Why?
3613180	3615100	What, people don't like math tutor games?
3615100	3617100	What's wrong with them?
3617100	3618700	Why isn't this selling?
3618700	3619700	I mean, come on.
3619700	3624580	Because Nintendo has to put forward this illusion of quality with things that they put out,
3624580	3632540	and yeah, I agree, a lot of it's crap, however, they do have their corporate image to uphold.
3632540	3634580	It's part of who they are, part of their branding.
3634580	3639340	They give, they stop caring about quality when that fucking seal left their goddamn
3639340	3640340	boxes.
3640340	3642340	And you know how many years ago that was?
3642340	3643900	A long time ago.
3643900	3649140	They don't give a shit, it's all about, what can we port, what will people want to buy?
3649140	3650580	What can we make them want to buy?
3650580	3655540	Oh hey, let's uh, let's port some GameCube games over and add Wii controls to them.
3655540	3658500	For the record, I do see people buying that shit.
3658500	3659500	Exactly.
3659500	3660500	They're making money.
3660500	3661500	Exactly.
3661500	3662500	They're making money.
3662500	3666740	They're literally bitching about somebody using a different business strategy to make
3666740	3667740	money.
3667740	3668740	Oh, I know.
3668740	3669740	Because they didn't think of it first.
3669740	3673020	If they didn't think of it first, and because it's competing with their market, and now
3673020	3679500	they're saying, well, how do we justify these games that are, you know, possibly crap like
3679500	3684540	this for $20 when these people are selling something similar that may be better than
3684540	3686740	our product for a dollar?
3686740	3688500	They can't.
3688500	3693340	You know, I gotta say though, to some extent, I think he has a point, because a lot of the
3693340	3696380	mobile games on the iOS system are pieces of shit.
3696380	3698740	Like a lot of them are truly terrible games.
3698740	3699740	Yeah.
3699740	3700740	Go ahead.
3700740	3706060	A friend of mine once said that trying to find a good app game at that price point is
3706060	3710060	like trying to get honest nutrition from a vending machine.
3710060	3714180	More often than not, you're getting a melted Snickers.
3714180	3715180	Sort of weird metaphor.
3715180	3716180	But I like it.
3716180	3717180	It's true.
3717180	3719140	First five minutes.
3719140	3726580	But you know, and to some extent, I'm willing to pay 30, 40 bucks for a great game if I'm
3726580	3730460	going to get that value out of it, you know?
3730460	3734380	Sometimes if I get a really good game for a dollar, it does kind of feel like a steal.
3734380	3736620	Hence like Steam sales.
3736620	3737620	That's another big thing.
3737620	3739900	I get great games for $4, $10.
3739900	3744160	I find it hard to, you know, excuse the fact that people are saying, well, there's a lot
3744160	3745900	of crappy games out there on the iOS.
3745900	3747260	Yes, there are.
3747260	3748260	And you know what?
3748260	3752180	If you do some research and before you, you know, purchase your games, you don't have
3752180	3753980	to buy all those crappy games.
3753980	3756300	Same with, you know, the more expensive games.
3756300	3758820	If you do your research, you don't have to buy the expensive games.
3758820	3762580	But at the same time, he's basically saying, well, these games are cheap and there's no
3762580	3764280	good cheap games out there.
3764280	3765280	That's not true.
3765280	3770140	The difference being is that in the case of some of these games that are on there for
3770140	3773580	dirt cheap, they're made by like a couple of guys who are just hanging out and like,
3773580	3774580	oh, let's put a buck on it.
3774580	3775820	We have to put something on it.
3775820	3776820	Let's do a dollar.
3776820	3778500	They just do it for fun.
3778500	3781140	You know, those little games come out, sometimes there'll be a company behind it.
3781140	3786380	With most of Nintendo's stuff, you're looking at basically developers, people who have to
3786380	3790300	pay employees to develop this, you know, bigger companies.
3790300	3793060	You're dealing with a corporate structure.
3793060	3797820	The other thing to look at too is that, you know, yeah, they have the DSiWare, but most
3797820	3800780	of their games are still physical games.
3800780	3801780	You have to pay for materials.
3801780	3804420	You have to pay for packaging.
3804420	3807840	There's a designer that goes into designing the box.
3807840	3809420	You've got someone doing the manual.
3809420	3812220	You have a technical writer writing everything that goes in the manual.
3812220	3814980	You have someone documenting the game mechanics.
3814980	3817060	You've got however many programmers.
3817060	3820540	You're actually having to pay more people for the product.
3820540	3824460	Therefore the price point is going to go up and they have to make a profit on it.
3824460	3829720	So you're dealing with corporate business as opposed to a couple of people just putting
3829720	3830860	out a game for shits.
3830860	3831860	But I'm a consumer.
3831860	3832860	I don't give a crap about that.
3832860	3833860	And that's the thing.
3833860	3839300	If they have this option to release a game for $10 instead of say $30 just because they
3839300	3841900	can avoid all those costs, why don't they do that?
3841900	3844980	Because if they market it well enough, they will have no problem selling that.
3844980	3849520	I guarantee if there is a good game that came on DSiWare, there's blogs that cover that
3849520	3851900	shit every week of what comes out.
3851900	3853100	People will be aware of it.
3853100	3854260	People will buy it and that's it.
3854260	3856180	I mean it's same with like Xbox Live Arcade.
3856180	3858300	There's tons of stuff that's $10, $20.
3858300	3860380	I mean there's great games.
3860380	3865420	For the most part, if they put out something that's going to be half the price to market
3865420	3869220	and they raise the price of it $10, chances are they're actually going to end up making
3869220	3871740	more money that way.
3871740	3873740	Here's a question.
3873740	3877700	You bring up a good point about like really everything that goes into making a video game.
3877700	3881420	But as the industry kind of moves towards this digital distribution thing, I think as
3881420	3885180	a whole, I think in the next generation of consoles, you're going to see more direct
3885180	3889540	downloads of games and you know, hence why we see GameStop starting to already come up
3889540	3892740	with their plan B, so to speak.
3892740	3894860	Should these people in the middle kind of be worried?
3894860	3897780	Well no, I see things definitely going that way.
3897780	3903260	But for right now, with what they have now, I think that, and keep in mind Nintendo, for
3903260	3906900	all the innovations that they like to bring in, they are very reluctant to change.
3906900	3909100	How long do they stick with a cartridge?
3909100	3911140	I mean really.
3911140	3916740	They do have that reluctance to embrace something new as far as marketing and distribution strategy
3916740	3918820	is concerned.
3918820	3924300	But I think that, you know, they're probably going to be another 10 years late like they
3924300	3927340	were before, but they're going to eventually catch up to it.
3927340	3929580	Right now, that's not in the way that they operate.
3929580	3931460	That's not in how they do business.
3931460	3935460	And they can't really see anything outside of their own box.
3935460	3938860	They may think that they're innovating in the way games are played and the way things
3938860	3939860	are doing.
3939860	3946440	They're looking at the way we can innovate what we have now within this little cube.
3946440	3949020	Not meaning to bring up the GameCube, of course.
3949020	3955780	But they've always been about their own proprietary hardware and their own proprietary way of
3955780	3957760	delivering the games.
3957760	3960980	They've been about doing things the Nintendo way.
3960980	3965900	And if you look over the course of the years, their business model really hasn't changed.
3965900	3969300	There hasn't been any real change in their strategy.
3969300	3971020	They've still kept things.
3971020	3973220	They want tight control over everything.
3973220	3976420	They want things to be to the Nintendo standard.
3976420	3982060	Even if the game is suck, all of the releasing of that game is done to Nintendo standard.
3982060	3986180	So I think it's also another way that they, you know, I mentioned their branding before.
3986180	3990500	I think it's actually a way that they protect their corporate identity too, is by having
3990500	3992900	such tight control over how everything goes out.
3992900	3996500	Unfortunately, that's money out of their pocket.
3996500	3997500	That's the way it goes.
3997500	4002480	That's how they can't see outside of their own business model to see a way that another
4002480	4005460	business model could work for them.
4005460	4006820	All right.
4006820	4007820	They're afraid to change.
4007820	4008820	I think they're afraid to take a risk.
4008820	4013900	I kind of agree and I don't want to go too far off track, but you know, companies afraid
4013900	4014900	to take risks.
4014900	4015900	That's something we've covered before.
4015900	4020180	And that is why Konami is not making the most profitable guitar game.
4020180	4021180	Although they could have.
4021180	4022180	They could have.
4022180	4023180	They wanted to take some risks.
4023180	4024180	They had it.
4024180	4025180	They had it.
4025180	4026180	I had it in my hand.
4026180	4027180	All right.
4027180	4028180	Anyhow, let's move on.
4028180	4031220	We got to travel the world and talk about release dates of games that are coming out
4031220	4032220	very soon.
4032220	4033220	Let's start in the US.
4033220	4038500	This week, taking some serious risks on Nintendo Wii.
4038500	4039900	Mario Sports Mix.
4039900	4047180	It's a sports game with Mario and other people and some Square Enix characters as well.
4047180	4048820	People love their Mario games.
4048820	4050540	Brain and Body Connection.
4050540	4053940	This is a game that's kind of similar to the Brain Age game that was on the Wii.
4053940	4059200	That was on Xbox 360 supporting the Kinect, or I should say requiring the Kinect.
4059200	4064220	Press Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 this week.
4064220	4068940	Junior Brain Trainer 2 on Nintendo DS.
4068940	4070820	This is pretty awesome.
4070820	4077140	Finally making its comeback, You Don't Know Jack on DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360
4077140	4078140	this week.
4078140	4079140	Oh my god, that's this week?
4079140	4080140	That's this week.
4080140	4081140	Holy crap, yay!
4081140	4082940	Is there like a demo or anything for this?
4082940	4083940	I don't know if there's a demo.
4083940	4085940	Actually, I heard there's probably a video on some website.
4085940	4091780	But I've heard if you pre-order it, it's $30 and it's going to be like $40 after pre-orders.
4091780	4092780	Something like that.
4092780	4093780	That's not right.
4093780	4094780	I don't think so.
4094780	4096580	That's just what someone said on the message board.
4096580	4102620	They dropped the price on it, so they probably told people to make some more pre-orders.
4102620	4106300	Trinity Souls of Zillow on PlayStation 3.
4106300	4114900	That's from, looks like Tecmo.
4114900	4118480	And Zuzu Princess, yay!
4118480	4119480	Another hamster game.
4119480	4131860	And then about a week from today, Dragon Quest VI, Realms of Revelation.
4131860	4132860	Realms of Revalency.
4132860	4137180	Sorry, can I look at this preview real quick for You Don't Know Jack here in studio?
4137180	4138180	Sure.
4138180	4141100	I just kind of want to check this out because I used to love this game so much.
4141100	4145300	So THQ is making this game.
4145300	4147740	Wow, that's an old logo.
4147740	4148740	Jellyvision.
4148740	4149740	Yay.
4149740	4153220	You don't know Jack.
4153220	4159620	The Trivia Party video game is back and all new for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo
4159620	4161060	DS, and PC.
4161060	4162740	Everybody's favorites are still there.
4162740	4166820	Twisted trivia questions, the dis or dat, screw your neighbor, and the Jack Attack.
4166820	4171020	Plus all new face-melting features and surprises, including online play.
4171020	4177020	From socialism to social networks, from bigamy to bigfoot, from wargames to drinking games,
4177020	4180060	it's You Don't Know Jack.
4180060	4182340	Yeah, I gotta buy it.
4182340	4183340	Damn it.
4183340	4186060	I'm trying to save money, but I need this.
4186060	4188060	I need it.
4188060	4189060	When?
4189060	4192540	Will your liver explode if you don't have that, Rob?
4192540	4193540	Possibly.
4193540	4194940	My spleen will be painin'.
4194940	4195940	It's only 30 bucks, though.
4195940	4196940	That's not that bad.
4196940	4197940	Does it make your liver quiver?
4197940	4198940	It's only 30 bucks.
4198940	4199940	You heard the man.
4199940	4200940	It's half the price.
4200940	4204580	It's half the price of what I paid for that crappy Tron game.
4204580	4207660	Anyhow, anything else this week, Logie?
4207660	4208660	No, that's it.
4208660	4209660	All right.
4209660	4213900	Let's move over to Japan and talk about what is coming out over there in Japan this week.
4213900	4218780	On the 8th of February, the Asia regions are getting test drive unlimited too.
4218780	4221120	Sometimes the Asia dates sneak their way onto my list.
4221120	4227780	But on the 10th of February, actually in Japan this week, Entaku no Saito, Students of Round,
4227780	4228780	comes out this week.
4228780	4231580	I'm not sure what that is.
4231580	4235100	It's an RPG game on the Xbox 360.
4235100	4239660	Looks like, kind of neat, looks like you can have like a party of six people and you can
4239660	4245120	kind of use your D-pad to use like, you know, attacks or spells or items.
4245120	4248140	This looks like it might be very old school RPG.
4248140	4251840	It doesn't look like it has kind of all the newfangled stuff in it, so.
4251840	4256680	It's called Entaku no Saito, Students of Round, is what it's called, Logie?
4256680	4257680	Students of Round.
4257680	4258680	Yes.
4258680	4259680	Students of Round.
4259680	4260680	And Final Fantasy VII.
4260680	4264540	Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare finally makes its way to Japan this week as well.
4264540	4268540	So if you are in Japan and you like yourself some Red Dead Redemption, check it out.
4268540	4272540	PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, LittleBigPlanet 2 finally makes it your way, as well as Red
4272540	4278340	Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare, and Sengoku Musou 3Z comes out in a regular and like a
4278340	4280280	special limited edition.
4280280	4286320	So if you are a fan of these games, this is the third one in the series from Koei.
4286320	4287820	I think it's like a Dynasty Warriors-esque kind of game.
4287820	4289540	It's more Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
4289540	4290540	Oh yes.
4290540	4293020	And you like choose between all these different characters.
4293020	4294020	It looks like there's like 20 different characters.
4294020	4297540	Basically, if you see Sengoku in the name, that's what it is.
4297540	4305060	Alright, moving on to some of the other consoles, going to the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Musou 3
4305060	4308300	Moshuden, which means scale down version.
4308300	4311780	I just made that up, but seeing as it's on the Wii, it probably is a little bit different.
4311780	4313780	Something legend.
4313780	4315780	Side story.
4315780	4322020	Nothing on the DS this week, obviously, because they're still warming up for the 3DS out there.
4322020	4329060	So the only other system that I would really mention is the PSP, which has Tales of the
4329060	4333500	World Radiant Mythology 3 coming out this week from Bandai Namco.
4333500	4335100	So check that out.
4335100	4337700	Music game fans, DJ Max Portable 3 is out next week.
4337700	4340380	Thought I'd throw that out there.
4340380	4344560	This looks a little bit like that Final Fantasy Crisis Core, kind of, but a different set
4344560	4348020	of characters, this whole Tales of the World.
4348020	4353100	I wonder if that's the Tales of Blank series, kind of on the PSP.
4353100	4355060	Don't know.
4355060	4356060	How about Europe?
4356060	4364860	Well, for Europe, we have on the 8th EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velious on PC, and Explodemum
4364860	4369300	Demon, Explodemon on PlayStation 3.
4369300	4374640	On the 11th, we have Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and Dr. Kawashima's
4374640	4377900	Body and Brain Training on Xbox 360.
4377900	4384140	We also have Edna and Harvey the Breakout on PC, Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, and Trinity
4384140	4389100	Zil-ol-zero for PS3 by Koei.
4389100	4390740	All right.
4390740	4395500	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, then we got the classic game of the week,
4395500	4397280	and it's a good one for episode 400.
4397280	4399260	People are going to be tingly in their special places.
4399260	4400260	I hope so.
4400260	4402100	Let's move on with a couple quick stories before that.
4402100	4407100	We talked last week about how Sony announced the PlayStation suite, which will bring PlayStation
4407100	4410500	1 emulation to the Android platform.
4410500	4419140	Well, there's rumors that they may be expanding the suite to cover other operating systems,
4419140	4425140	including the iOS format, as well as Windows at a later date.
4425140	4429060	So it might make it kind of cool to have an official PlayStation 1 emulator.
4429060	4433620	I can't imagine how that won't be cracked, but okay.
4433620	4439420	I actually already have plenty of emulators out there, now that I think of it.
4439420	4447660	They're even saying that it's possible that other Sony products, like Sony Internet TV
4447660	4451620	powered by Google, might also get some support for it.
4451620	4454780	That might be kind of neat, I guess.
4454780	4459660	Make some really cheap PlayStation 1 players, I guess.
4459660	4460660	Yeah.
4460660	4466740	So they have a completely open stance to it, they say.
4466740	4467740	So that's pretty neat.
4467740	4473860	I can totally see them doing that.
4473860	4475880	I guess wherever the money can be made, right?
4475880	4477300	That's the old rule of thumb.
4477300	4478300	Exactly.
4478300	4483500	And honestly, I think porting it to a PC platform would probably be a little bit better, seeing
4483500	4488860	as, you know, you have buttons.
4488860	4492740	And as they stress, you know, buttons are important.
4492740	4496060	Except on these certain mobile phones, we'll make do without them.
4496060	4499860	Speaking of mobile phones, and especially the whole crossover, and this is kind of ironic
4499860	4503780	considering the story that DarkSakura was talking about a little earlier, Angry Birds
4503780	4506980	is apparently making its way onto the 3DS.
4506980	4507980	That's right.
4507980	4513160	Rovio, who makes Angry Birds, they're trying to bring Angry Birds to just about every platform
4513160	4514160	that's out there.
4514160	4516220	And of course, that would include the 3DS.
4516220	4521420	They spoke with 3DS Focus, and they are saying that they're going to bring out their games
4521420	4526420	on the 3DS's download titles later this year, including Angry Birds Rio.
4526420	4528020	There you go.
4528020	4531980	So they're gonna be in awe-inspiring 3D.
4531980	4535300	Angry Birds is also out for the PS3 and the PSP, if you're curious.
4535300	4536300	Come on!
4536300	4540600	It's Angry Birds, a 2D game.
4540600	4541600	Does that really need to be a 3D?
4541600	4545060	Maybe you can, like, be behind the bird while you shoot things.
4545060	4546060	I don't know.
4546060	4547060	That's dumb.
4547060	4549580	It is a little dumb.
4549580	4550580	Alright.
4550580	4558060	Uh, let's get into a segment we like to do on the show here where we walk into the vault
4558060	4559060	and pick a game.
4559060	4561540	It's the classic game of the week.
4561540	4567100	It's DarkSakura's opportunity to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be worshipping
4567100	4568100	this game.
4568100	4569880	Or at least check it out.
4569880	4571500	It's the classic game of the week.
4571500	4574660	This is another game that we should introduce by menu, Rob.
4574660	4575660	I will try.
4575660	4576740	Not everybody's gonna recognize it, you know.
4576740	4577740	I know.
4577740	4580540	But the people who do will get special brownie points.
4580540	4581540	Here we go.
4581540	4584540	Let's fire it up here and look at some of the music.
4584540	4588740	Or at least some of the ambience from this game.
4588740	4594220	Ah, memories.
4594220	4601260	Best menu music ever.
4601260	4602260	Alright.
4602260	4603260	What is it, DarkSakura?
4603260	4604260	I'm dying.
4604260	4605260	It's B-Mania.
4605260	4606260	Yay.
4606260	4610380	It is the game that started it all.
4610380	4612500	This gave us the whole Bimani thing.
4612500	4614700	This gave us Orange Lounge Radio.
4614700	4620380	Gee, Konami, what were you thinking?
4620380	4628860	But it started off in 1997 and really got big in 98.
4628860	4634900	I remember back in the day having the emulator BM98 on my computer so I could play B-Mania
4634900	4636620	stuff at home.
4636620	4641100	That was my first Bimani experience with BM98.
4641100	4648580	And from there we've had B-Mania 2 DX, we've had B-Mania 3, we've had DDR, Para Para, Dance
4648580	4650780	of Maniacs.
4650780	4651780	So many.
4651780	4652780	So many.
4652780	4656000	But let's go ahead and focus on the original B-Mania.
4656000	4664460	You had five keys and a turntable and everybody was right-side pride back in the day.
4664460	4669620	And so basically the little platforms would scroll down on your screen and you had to
4669620	4675140	hit the corresponding button or scratch at the right time or a combination of buttons
4675140	4680180	with a very interesting kind of low-quality video playing in the background that was typically
4680180	4682520	just repeated scenes over and over again.
4682520	4684060	It was the PlayStation 1 after all.
4684060	4687900	Well I'm talking about the arcade one too, shoot.
4687900	4693940	But yeah we had, it came out on the PlayStation, they had the really nice controller and the
4693940	4698660	dinky controller and I started off with the dinky controller and then bought a nice controller.
4698660	4701660	And we had all kinds of versions.
4701660	4706500	But we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about B-Mania's second mix and B-Mania which was
4706500	4709140	the first one that came out on the PlayStation.
4709140	4715900	We had practice mode where you could practice, free mode and expert, expert plus and easy.
4715900	4718680	That was actually available in third mix.
4718680	4725860	Expert plus was offered in sixth mix and of course boss battle where you would, that was
4725860	4731540	just so much fun watching the, actually you'd also have your tutorial mode too where they
4731540	4732540	would tell you how to play.
4732540	4733540	B-Mania 3 had that too.
4733540	4737320	B-Mania 3 had an effector pedal which I don't think I played a single song on that game
4737320	4742020	that actually used the pedal, but it did also have the effector sliders which was really
4742020	4743020	neat.
4743020	4748380	And the cabinets were, there was a standard cabinet and a mini cabinet.
4748380	4753580	The standard I'm sure is the one that most everyone's seen which is the 29 inch screen.
4753580	4758740	The mini cabinet had the 20 inch screen and basically I think one was space saver or the
4758740	4759740	other.
4759740	4764820	But the mini cabinet they didn't get too many released in the US.
4764820	4770460	If you can find an American beatmania that's made of the mini cabinet, probably kind of
4770460	4771980	worth some money I think.
4771980	4777420	However you can go buy old beatmania machines for like what, 300 bucks at the metronome?
4777420	4778420	Seriously.
4778420	4786180	But I remember back in the day when we would get new bit money games and would trek across
4786180	4794180	California to you know go to Milpitas or Sunnyvale or I remember going for when DDR Max came
4794180	4798980	out going to San Diego and looking for one there while I was already there.
4798980	4802940	But yeah we've got also all kinds of different versions that have come out.
4802940	4811020	We've had beatmania, actually the US beatmania which is actually beatmania 2DX, the 7 key
4811020	4818500	with the switchable turntable had a beatmania mode in it which basically was just 5 keys
4818500	4820820	but I'm not gonna pick on that.
4820820	4825260	There were versions for the Game Boy Color and the WonderSwan Color which we knew somebody
4825260	4829580	who had that, an ex roommate of yours.
4829580	4833580	It was really hard, the little scratching table was like it attached to the WonderSwan
4833580	4840020	and it didn't quite work on the WonderSwan Color quite right.
4840020	4843420	And they also had little keychain beatmania games too.
4843420	4845820	It was a huge fad for a while.
4845820	4847500	Very big.
4847500	4850700	And Konami, oh Konami.
4850700	4854460	They were kinda late to jump on the beatmania bandwagon in the US.
4854460	4859020	They didn't listen to their fans, well a couple of them listened to their fans but nobody
4859020	4863220	listened to them for quite a while until they were like oh I see you're importing it, let's
4863220	4864220	bring it out.
4864220	4869220	Gee DDR is suddenly selling over there, maybe we should have got on that a while ago.
4869220	4875940	The first official beatmania game in the US you guys was a port of 2DX night style, sorta.
4875940	4881300	It kinda used that interface and had a mishmash of games.
4881300	4883820	Oh yeah the crappy, I don't even acknowledge that.
4883820	4884820	But it is beatmania.
4884820	4886820	Yeah that's true, that's true.
4886820	4892940	And it came out relatively early enough and we had one of those at RVGL.
4892940	4899180	And it was, let me just go back into the list of the games and keep in mind I probably have
4899180	4900180	most of these.
4900180	4904940	I remember when I went hunting down a club mix cause that in my opinion is the best.
4904940	4908420	Can you play salamander beatcrush mix or?
4908420	4910100	Yeah I can play salamander beatcrush mix, hold on.
4910100	4912460	I didn't see what you were playing, oh you're playing overdoser?
4912460	4916940	No you had some video of it.
4916940	4917940	Let me actually do this video.
4917940	4919820	The only cool part of this one is the beginning of it.
4919820	4923140	I don't think this is somebody filming their TV, I think this is actual, oh they are filming
4923140	4924140	their TV.
4924140	4926140	Oh wow.
4926140	4930300	Oh there's this one actually, this is an actual.
4930300	4940180	There we go, yeah.
4940180	4942860	Which really only at the beginning sounds like salamander music.
4942860	4943860	Right.
4943860	4949100	But I mean they did have all kinds of remixes from their old games in that too but here's
4949100	4951420	all the different versions.
4951420	4955860	As far as arcade releases we had beatmania, beatmania second mix, third mix complete mix
4955860	4959700	which was hip hop mania over here, we got that as hip hop mania.
4959700	4963460	We had fourth mix the beat goes on, fifth mix time to get down which actually had a
4963460	4964460	lot of good music.
4964460	4969060	There was complete mix 2, now take that back, that was the one that we had because it had
4969060	4972060	3, 2, 1 stars in it, remember.
4972060	4977100	Anyway, club mix, beatmania featuring dreams come true which was a little j-pop band back
4977100	4984160	then, beatmania core remix, there was sixth mix UK underground musics, seventh mix keep
4984160	4986740	an evolution and beatmania the final.
4986740	4990780	And in korea there was beatstage, beatstage third mix, beatstage complete mix, beatstage
4990780	4994580	fourth mix, the beat goes on, fifth mix time to get down and in north america we had hip
4994580	4997220	hop mania complete mix and complete mix 2.
4997220	4998220	Geez.
4998220	5005020	On the playstation, I'm gonna read them all, it's episode 400 and I can, beatmania, beatmania
5005020	5010460	append yebisu mix which I have, third mix mini, append third, yeah these are all appends
5010460	5013820	which basically if you had the first game you bought the appends and you'd swap them
5013820	5020380	which made it a pain in the ass if you were on an american system trying to get them to
5020380	5025460	play and having to do the disc swaps and all this crap which I found my way around.
5025460	5030980	You get a little thing that plugs into the back, there was go to mix, fourth mix, fifth
5030980	5038580	mix best hits, dreams come true, go to mix 2 going global which was actually pretty cool,
5038580	5044060	club mix, the sound of tokyo which was also fun, sixth mix and beatmania europe.
5044060	5050820	For gameboy colors there was beatmania gb, gb2 gotcha mix and gb2 gotcha mix 2.
5050820	5055060	Wonder swan, there was beatmania for wonder swan, there was a bajillion bemoni pockets
5055060	5060180	which I was talking about little monochrome lcb screens and they were little but the fun
5060180	5066060	thing about that is there was an anime song mix that was all stuff from anime by go nagai
5066060	5072500	which is like cutie honey and mazinger z and you know, there was a toki meki memorial
5072500	5080020	version because you know konami own toki meki memorial, a bunch of anime, there was a hello
5080020	5086460	kitty mix, there was enjoy georgia's signature, there was tiger's version, kawaii version
5086460	5091900	which means cute but it had to do with magazine, toki meki 2 love stories, kona mix best hits
5091900	5096500	2000 and tiger's version 2 which was for the hanshin tiger's baseball team.
5096500	5098460	Baseball is a big deal.
5098460	5100420	And that's it.
5100420	5102020	If there were more, I ain't reading them.
5102020	5106260	Right, it was a lot to begin with but it just shows you like how big and it was so weird
5106260	5111100	that this game just didn't really, it was a cult thing here, it really was, so like
5111100	5112380	under the radar.
5112380	5114540	We were weird for liking this game.
5114540	5119620	I just remember and this is actually literally how I got into it.
5119620	5128540	It was probably february of 98 on, I think we were actually on the old penny and two,
5128540	5132860	the overclocked 60 to 120 computer dan had.
5132860	5136420	One of my friends saying, hey there's this game out in japan but we can't get it but
5136420	5138460	here's an emulator.
5138460	5140460	And it was bm 98.
5140460	5141460	Nice.
5141460	5144460	And then it went from there.
5144460	5145460	Right.
5145460	5147300	I need to download bm 98 again.
5147300	5155580	Your classic game of the week beatmania available in the arcade or on many, many, many, many,
5155580	5157980	different home releases on playstations.
5157980	5159980	Oh it loves me.
5159980	5161500	Oh yeah.

5210020	5216260	the 6th of 2011 at allgames.com for our 400th episode of our show.
5216260	5222260	So welcome you guys and loki is in the house he's playing gal gun tonight and he's been
5222260	5226000	playing it pretty much during the entire show and he's not ranting about something nintendo.
5226000	5227940	So loki what do you think so far?
5227940	5231340	Like right now he's in like a music room something I don't know shooting girls with love.
5231340	5235220	It's a weird game I don't know I don't really know what's going on but I know that they
5235220	5240420	have this like focus mode where you're doing something to parts of girls and then they
5240420	5245300	orgasm and it causes the other girls to orgasm or whatever they faint with love what it's
5245300	5254780	an orgasm okay so hot infectious orgasm strange fun all right yeah I could see why they got
5254780	5258420	rid of the panty shots though because I mean it would have been porn pretty much yeah is
5258420	5262700	that now we were talking earlier about one-handed games do you think algun could be a one-handed
5262700	5271660	game with a special controller maybe I mean because you'd have to you'd have it's hard
5271660	5275620	because you have to aim with the left analog stick and then you have the flashlight attachment
5275620	5280260	issue with the a button I was gonna say if it had an auto auto fire then yeah because
5280260	5284820	then you could just auto fire maybe and they have like a zoom you probably do with like
5284820	5289300	some sort of like special like remappable like nunchuck type controller or something
5289300	5293380	where you have a shoot button as a trigger and maybe you could do it one-handed then
5293380	5300380	but no it's not a one-handed game all right well I love this new video capture card thing
5300380	5305020	it's awesome we're gonna get into some rapid-fire news here in just a little bit but first we

5382660	5387340	dot they'll do the with their arms they're like I'm gonna reach for it but that's it
5387340	5392020	I'm not chasing that shit anymore I'm too old so bat bat did I tell you that when I
5392020	5396420	got Shermy one of those she hated what you do know she looked at the little dot and then
5396420	5404800	she looked right up at the pointer realized how it worked and didn't try anymore sure
5404800	5409380	we just don't care all right she's smart when she's trying to be lazy another spin-off show

5434460	5440020	what excellent just told me so hi guild grats on level 9 why aren't you in chat beating

5449300	5454420	you get lots of guild leveling from that all right but we'll save the rest of the wow chatter
5454420	5460380	for the best little horde house in Azeroth which usually releases Thursdays ish depending
5460380	5465040	on our taping schedule which is really erratic although I will say this extra for told me
5465040	5470620	he loved the live show love the live show and kind of wants to do it again so you never
5470620	5475260	know what might happen we might have to storm the OLR studios more than once a week all
5475260	5482220	right anyhow let's move on to some rapid fire news and lots and lots of news that we just
5482220	5485820	don't have time to talk a whole long time about because you know we've got to fit in
5485820	5492740	Nintendo rants for Loki so Loki armored core 5 was announced and it's kind of cool it's
5492740	5496540	been announced for a while but they announced that it's going to have team based online
5496540	5503060	multiplayer which is pretty cool it's expected to come out over here I guess they're saying
5503060	5510780	it's 2012 in North America and Europe and late 2011 in Japan but the game looks pretty
5510780	5516420	awesome kind of reminds me a little bit of the like the crossing oh god chrome hounds
5516420	5522500	with armored core 4 which is pretty cool because that chrome hounds kind of had that team based
5522500	5528080	co-op stuff and chrome hounds kind of had like that cultish following to it but unfortunately
5528080	5533740	not strong enough following to necessitate a second game right yeah it was kind of like
5533740	5539980	think their version of like a North American armored core just stick with armored core
5539980	5545460	the problem with chrome hounds was it was slow just slow mechs slow everything whereas
5545460	5552820	armored core is just kind of fast and fast-paced lots of missiles and yeah so um that'll be
5552820	5558300	kind of cool and expect that next year I guess uh Namco announced that yes guess what we're
5558300	5562860	gonna do another Ridge Racer this current generation I'm gonna wait for another console
5562860	5571340	to come out Ridge Racer yes Ridge Racer unbounded and that's gonna be on Xbox 360 PlayStation
5571340	5578060	3 and PC in 2012 the game had a little teaser trailer for it of course no actual gameplay
5578060	5585060	but it basically kind of resembles burnout and it's actually being developed by Bugbear
5585060	5590620	Entertainment who of course put out the game flat out so they kind of know something about
5590620	5597540	destructible racing games and I don't know it looks kind of neat I like burnout Ridge
5597540	5602980	Racer is kind of cool so Ridge Racer drifting with burnout which of course what story about
5602980	5615020	Ridge Racer would be incomplete without damage it's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer PlayStation yes
5615020	5621900	and then this is not too unexpected but Project Dark which was a working title for of course
5621900	5627980	this new game Dark Souls was announced in the latest Famitsu magazine it's basically
5627980	5636460	gonna be the kind of a successor to Demon's Souls but not in a way they're actually saying
5636460	5644420	that they're making the game harder and they said I guess similar it's gonna be similar
5644420	5649980	in style but not necessarily a sequel to Demon's Souls and players will be able to create their
5649980	5655660	own characters though they're no longer I guess different job classes I guess just tweaks
5655660	5660860	to the world design as well the world is no longer divided into levels instead being one
5660860	5665700	large area and there's gonna be cooperative and competitive players will it be as fucking
5665700	5673540	hard because oh my it's gonna be harder oh god seriously Demon's Souls is awesome couldn't
5673540	5679340	tell you much about it though because I keep getting killed horrifically over and over
5679340	5686580	again it's not a forgiving game and let's see what else well they're cool tidbits did
5686580	5692580	they have about it of course they said that the online system will be returning and it's
5692580	5699620	been highly enhanced to allow users to share experience and they said grow together in
5699620	5703380	the world although I'm sure that means going to other people's games and trying to kill
5703380	5710380	the other people like you could in the original neat I know the first game is pretty cool
5710380	5715220	it's kind of a sleeper hit so it should be good all right moving on to some other stories
5715220	5719140	you know earlier in the show we talked about this and Final Fantasy 4 the complete collection
5719140	5724060	on the PSP I am so excited for this because I love one and two on the PSP and this looks
5724060	5728340	amazing it's gonna be coming out April 19th at the complete collection so and that is
5728340	5733000	the North American release day wow that's right it is so you're getting an awesome game
5733000	5737900	as a present for your birthday from Squeenix it's gonna retail for $30 and of course if
5737900	5742460	you haven't heard this is the original Final Fantasy 4 and the after years which came out
5742460	5746500	originally on mobile gaming over in Japan and later on the Wii I played about I don't
5746500	5750380	know half of it on the Wii but there was a lot of download episodes you had to do and
5750380	5754980	I beat like two of them but yeah it'll be nice to have the entire collection on the
5754980	5761500	PSP this story almost makes me a little sad because I have Final Fantasy 4 for the DS
5761500	5766140	the 3d one that they did played the first hour of it gorgeous love it my favorite Final
5766140	5770380	Fantasy and now it's like I feel that I shouldn't play that and finish that because this is
5770380	5774540	coming out even though that the art design is totally different you know I really liked
5774540	5780700	the 3d Final Fantasies which is weird because I was I'm usually not like into the 3d stuff
5780700	5785940	but I just I love the art style on the PSP ones like it's just so sharp and they've just
5785940	5789900	retouched those sprites and it's that this this is the same look that they gave Final
5789900	5793820	Fantasy 1 and 2 and apparently there's supposed to be like new effects with the magic and
5793820	5797780	everything and there's you know there's some videos out there too it looks great have you
5797780	5801540	seen the trailer I haven't it looks pretty cool let me see if I can do I know it's supposed
5801540	5805620	to be rapid fire news let me see if I can do a quick quick quick shot of the trailer
5805620	5813500	here which was available somewhere let me see if I can find it I might have to search
5813500	5818100	YouTube for it so maybe I'll show you later remind me after the show all right let's move
5818100	5823020	on though with other releases tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad new school
5823020	5827340	tapper not the old school tapper yep that's right it's a brand new tapper game that's
5827340	5832580	going to be coming out you know root beer tapper if you never played the old school
5832580	5836780	one that's actually beer which most people I don't think ever played the beer one so
5836780	5842540	I remember it root beer tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad all those iOS it's
5842540	5847440	going to be called tapper world tour it is not a port of the original game I mean obviously
5847440	5851980	it's that same same kind of feel but it's all new graphics and this is what's kind of
5851980	5857260	cool the new graphics it's all hand drawn graphics courtesy of you ready for this dark
5857260	5861920	Sakura Don Bluth is doing all the drawing for this game and if you don't know who that
5861920	5865700	is he did the dragon's lair games back in the day and he's kind of like a legend in
5865700	5870340	the animation circles so that's awesome actually like at first I was kind of like I love tapper
5870340	5874100	it's like a farce old school games go but when I heard about this I was like oh yeah
5874100	5877460	yeah another yeah this would be like yards revenge turning in her first person shooter
5877460	5880220	that'll be great but then I heard like Don Bluth's doing all the art and I'm like oh
5880220	5885140	now it just went like the 80s awesome again yeah to bring it back to Don Bluth he did
5885140	5892340	the secret of NIMH movie and Xanadu oh god and all dogs go to heaven and I want to say
5892340	5901880	Fern Gully was that him or no I think perhaps IDK anyway that guy he's awesome alright moving
5901880	5907540	on to a story about Castlevania you know Castlevania harmony of despair is one of those games is
5907540	5914300	available on Xbox Live Arcade well there is a new stage that's available for 240 Microsoft
5914300	5922140	points it's based on an original Famicom Konami title Getsufuma den so there you go 160 points
5922140	5927340	if you want to actually play as the character Getsufuma it has 8-bit graphics though and
5927340	5932180	I guess it's kind of old school sorry I didn't mean to do the loud but this is kind of what
5932180	5939500	it looks like here in the game see if I can kind of kind of neat those almost look like
5939500	5951440	little metroids that you're fighting there so there you go that's coming out soon moving
5951440	5957500	on Dark Sakura some quick stories for us and the Twitter topics is twitter.com slash olr
5957500	5964180	well we talked about Pac-Man in part A Ms. Pac-Man is going to be coming out for iPad
5964180	5971140	and then there will be a free Valentine's Day update for Pac-Man on the iPhone it's
5971140	5978900	a more Namco love in the form of Pac-Man so that's cute and then this makes me happy Puyo
5978900	5984220	Puyo will be on Virtual Console in Japan and it will have online multiplayer so I guess
5984220	5989060	Nintendo sort of getting it but not really well hold on you said Virtual Console and
5989060	5994740	online multiplayer yes in Wow I don't know what those words mean when they're put together
5994740	6001100	I know it's not that I are you sure Puyo Puyo I love Puyo Puyo the original have online
6001100	6008380	multiplayer you could play two people it was on like the Sega Genesis right I know but
6008380	6013300	Nintendo never adds anything to their game so it must have been on the original I'm glad
6013300	6017700	I've foreseen the internet and you know there were four player versions though that came
6017700	6023140	out on Nintendo 64 and Saturn I'm glad a landmark game such as Puyo Puyo yeah it's like Puyo
6023140	6029340	Puyo is amazing but of all the games like why I don't understand but they like to keep
6029340	6033180	us confused that's maybe they're waiting to see how this does and then they're gonna go
6033180	6039180	back and do everything else and re-release it for eight more dollars with online multiplayer
6039180	6044540	and all that shit that we should have had the first time right Dark Sakura yes it was
6044540	6050620	such a fun game such a fun game and then we have a little bit of something else we have

6087780	6090860	of you know since we're coming up on our 400th episode and you know lots of people are saying
6090860	6096320	yay grats on 400 because I don't know what other video game podcasts that are weekly
6096320	6099740	have gotten as high as 400 I'm not sure if they're out there I don't know of them you'll
6099740	6104580	have to tell me so you know we're excited and we have no plans to quit anytime soon
6104580	6108980	so who knows we might just make 500 we'll see anyhow we were asking folks what was your
6108980	6112420	favorite moment of the past 400 episodes we asked that question on twitter earlier this
6112420	6118860	week the seg said when I was on the show of course deep man said rob coming out to the
6118860	6123380	olr to go fans I don't even remember that actually I mean it had to happen at some point
6123380	6129180	but I don't know I was just kind of always the gay one uh rob boycotting the xbox I think
6129180	6132900	that's when I got really mad at my xbox red ringing of death like three days after I bought
6132900	6137500	it and then I think it red ringed again he was really mad uh Loki's mac rant that's like
6137500	6144260	every week um e3 2006 I think it was my first show sorry no dates alpha kenanagram says
6144260	6150440	one of them was it to go it's pizza man remember that good times that was one of the older
6150440	6156380	shows uh dark tetsuya says karaoke revolution 69 and 120 those are the episodes number of
6156380	6161740	those happening the april fool's day pre-show 2007 with the giggling lesbian gaming show
6161740	6166780	I remember that one and uh the death of the soundboard table in episode 307 remember when
6166780	6172100	uh intern drew knocked the whole damn table over yes yes I remember that too that was
6172100	6178220	awesome good times still never found his body then we asked what should happen in the next

6181380	6186580	launch radio zaku pilot 256 said dance party come on that happens every week it's just
6186580	6191020	the after we've gone off the air uh kidman project says the inauguration of president
6191020	6196700	cat uh blade 3 says I want to see rob get married and jamie and dan have a little demon
6196700	6206980	baby that plays video games at age 1.5 it'll happen a demon baby will happen act def says
6206980	6211500	what I hope happens is that you get to a thousand episodes congrats for making it there this
6211500	6216900	far and here's for 600 more but at 1000 guys it's seriously over because by the time we
6216900	6221260	get to 1000 episodes let's see if it took us almost 10 years to get to 400 we'll be
6221260	6228900	getting close to like 45 by the time the thousand comes out close to 50 the holodeck ought to
6228900	6236460	be out by then and then there's really no more need for olr the olr will olr will cease
6236460	6240960	to you won't be able to drag rob out of the holodeck exactly I'll be playing one-hand
6240960	6246620	games in the holodeck all right um what do you want to see in the next 400 episodes of
6246620	6252180	olr alpha kenanagram says some on-air smack talk from loki's kid it could happen if we
6252180	6256760	keep if we go another 10 years the kid could come in here and say something uh we'll see
6256760	6263660	let's see uh dark tetsuya says three words loki as tingle or at very least the return
6263660	6270520	of rob's mr spanky see people wouldn't understand the mr spanky joke anymore you know mr spanky
6270520	6276340	was really funny when he was a character in ddr but now it doesn't make sense like we

6403840	6408600	to hear the discussion on sony's continued persecution of the hacking community i like
6408600	6414100	the way he phrased that there the uh persecution yeah it gets worse actually really do we have
6414100	6418840	a story on it coming up later uh no but i i want to sum it up for us last minister yes
6418840	6426380	uh they are actually now trying to go after everybody literally um they've uh let's see
6426380	6432020	here find an exact one here sony is looking for you it says apparently over the website
6432020	6435380	psx scene the latest court documents because they've been putting up all the court documents
6435380	6439940	kind of like wikileaks um they're pretty much going after everyone they're planning to subpoena
6439940	6444780	several sites including psx scene youtube twitter paypal and slashdot in order to attempt
6444780	6451060	to locate the whereabouts of team fail overflow and other hackers like uh kakaroto uh one
6451060	6457900	at cocoa and uh graph chocolo hermes and kamu those are a lot of the guys behind some of
6457900	6462300	the custom firmwares and stuff they can go after them all they want but the thing is
6462300	6472580	a lot of these guys aren't even from the us and uh the dms dmca does not apply to them
6472580	6477580	and on top of all that stuff too um you know if this court case comes out where you know
6477580	6483100	this guy they find it okay to be able to jailbreak ps3s or whatever in those it's gonna matter
6483100	6486780	anyway but they're fine they're trying to take down as many people as possible or mainly
6486780	6493820	just to scare people i guess whatever well it's like when the ria takes a random housewife
6493820	6499300	or grandma and says all right you have four songs from kesha on your computer so we're
6499300	6504020	suing you for like 30 million dollars and your appeals will get denied it's the same
6504020	6511460	thing i didn't mean to download the kesha it just infected my computer i think i slept
6511460	6524060	with someone and suddenly i got a kesha infection that sounds like a disease i'm sorry i i caught
6524060	6528900	kesha oh and then and then here here's here's something better if if you want to kind of
6528900	6534580	follow up with that you know sony is hunting everybody down lennox has been brought back
6534580	6540620	to firmware 3.41 uh nothing public yet but they've brought it back and not only is it
6540620	6545940	brought back but now it has full access to all the uh resources of the playstation 3
6545940	6555260	so it's lennox better i guess it's super lennox lennox evolved lennox evolved it knows
6555260	6562780	uh big thanks to all the people that are tweeting about our 400th episode really appreciate
6562780	6566740	it there's a lot of you guys on twitter that are like yay 400 episode 400 and so forth

6572860	6578020	sony stories i was like what i didn't get any giant enemy craps on twitter no i didn't
6578020	6583980	catch crabs i didn't catch kesha all right tiger claw says it's a tweet one tweet tells
6583980	6586820	me he wasn't listening to part a he must have been watching that football game because we
6586820	6591060	talked about that story already but i'll read this other one mad cats is making a replacement
6591060	6595100	fight stick panel for mortal combat this is a tweet from our pal tiger claw who always
6595100	6599380	promotes our show we appreciate him uh he says uh or i'm sorry this story says that
6599380	6604540	there is a mortal combat tournament edition arcade stick um but i guess it has kind of
6604540	6609440	like a unique layout to it so uh mad cats came out and says there's going to be a replacement
6609440	6614020	panel for the current tournament edition fight sticks that will let you have the arcade perfect
6614020	6618760	controls here's the deal remember like street fighter has like six buttons but mortal combat
6618760	6622580	has like well it also has six if you count the run button but they're in like a different
6622580	6627620	arrangement it's like an x you know it's all pump it up style high low punch high low kick
6627620	6631620	block exactly block is in the middle and kind of makes an x and then run is kind of like
6631620	6635960	awkwardly off to the side so there you go so that's kind of cool they're making a new
6635960	6641220	overlay for that that's kind of awesome actually uh all right and sturlock is um sending us
6641220	6645360	a tweet about uh what we can do in the next few episodes of orange lounge radio just keep
6645360	6649900	doing what you're doing the show just keeps getting better and better here's to another
6649900	6656820	four hundred episodes of awesome oh you guys are awesome uh sj100 matt says we need t-shirts
6656820	6665260	within the next 400 episodes we probably do all right that's it for twitter topics tonight
6665260	6669060	except i have to point this out uh salacious pop you know how i told you the guildies were
6669060	6674460	listening to tonight's show yeah i just got a i got a text there from uh one of our guildies
6674460	6684440	there spike raging at kesha hate which by the way have you seen that toy that they sell
6684440	6689140	in targets this little uh dancing a little uh like valentine's day doll that you can
6689140	6696860	give somebody speaking of which
6696860	6703820	almost sounds like the real thing look at that all right moving on how about some actual
6703820	6709940	gaming news back to more video games more video games less kesha sorry uh loki all right
6709940	6715700	um this is kind of cool um well the game's kind of cool what they're doing not quite
6715700	6721940	cool uh bionic commando rear arm 2 just came out on the playstation network and on xbox
6721940	6729140	live arcade you may remember back uh final fight double impact uh where there was kind
6729140	6737660	of this unannounced uh drm in place basically you had to be connected to the internet in
6737660	6742060	order to play the game so if you downloaded it and say you want to play it offline or
6742060	6747780	if your internet cut out that sucks and then of course you know capcom apologized you know
6747780	6751460	for it and stuff but really what they're apologizing for is that they didn't tell you about it
6751460	6756220	up front because bionic commander 2 rear armed has the same drm in place you have to be connected
6756220	6761460	to the internet in order to play this game they've done that because um they don't want
6761460	6765240	people sharing the game apparently there is a way you know you could share the game up
6765240	6771940	to five times by recovering your accounts and stuff like that and um so people buy a
6771940	6777740	copy and then they share with you know four other friends and stuff um and so now they
6777740	6781500	have a note on the game listing it says no you must log into the playstation network
6781500	6786660	each time you play the game uh this is while final fight double impact um i guess they
6786660	6793180	had like a online co-op mode rear arm does not have an online co-op mode or an online
6793180	6801260	mode at all it's an offline game so it's just kind of a dick move if you ask me well distributing
6801260	6805640	their game is also a dick move yeah but you know what though the thing is is this is pissing
6805640	6811420	a lot of people off in the you know some people may not care about it and will purchase the
6811420	6815820	game but some people actually are just not purchasing the game regardless of they didn't
6815820	6820700	even care about sharing the xbox one at the same requirement i don't think they do interesting
6820700	6824240	you know i could see where people like you can't share the game back and forth because
6824240	6828680	what if like you have to uh you know what if you're just ps3 isn't hooked up to go online
6828680	6833520	but then i think well you got to go online to get the game so i guess not having an internet
6833520	6838400	connection okay let's let's play devil's advocate here say you take your ps3 to a friend's house
6838400	6842100	and say oh i really want this game you go to the friend's house hook it up to your internet
6842100	6845860	connection download the game and then you take it home you're like crap can't play it
6845860	6849740	i i realize things are different now but like i know back in the day like especially with
6849740	6854260	the dreamcast i used to have to run a gigantic cord across the entire house and hook it into
6854260	6859940	my dreamcast if i wanted to play so you know it wasn't always online and i think some people
6859940	6864320	are still kind of doing that with ps3 even though it has built-in wi-fi just some people
6864320	6868860	in some places are a little bit behind the times you know it happens especially if you're
6868860	6874560	on wi-fi wi-fi can be sketchy sometimes true you get drops every now and then um have they
6874560	6877460	said what happened what happens if like you you know you start up the game and then your
6877460	6881220	wi-fi just cuts out because i've had problems with my internet connection i think you get
6881220	6885660	kicked out of the game oh my gosh that that's just like the ubisoft one that they got torn
6885660	6891500	a new one over yeah interesting this is capcom the new face of capcom they do cool shit and
6891500	6899180	then they start you know copying games and doing drm schemes it's like who are you capcom
6899180	6905860	seriously i don't even know you anymore all right well this story has been making a lot
6905860	6910900	of rounds this week uh this is about you know e3 big expo in june and i've talked a lot
6910900	6913640	about how this year is definitely going to be either like one of the best shows ever
6913640	6918540	or one of the worst well it's definitely going to be a different show uh e3 it was announced
6918540	6923140	this week uh has been declining a lot of media badges a lot of the people that have got in
6923140	6927340	in years past they're not getting in this year why aren't they getting in because now
6927340	6933740	e3 is seeing how much traffic you get and they're using websites like compete.com zenu
6933740	6938820	returns.com is that a Scientology thing oh forget it uh quantcast.com and Alexa they're
6938820	6942460	using these sites and some of the rejection letters that they're sending to sites go something
6942460	6948100	like this uh e3 expo 2011 show management has placed caps on this year's media badge
6948100	6953160	assignments due to the tremendous number of requests for media badges etc etc we require
6953160	6956900	that sites be fully launched operational for six months and that the website receives a
6956900	6963620	minimum of 8 000 monthly unique impressions as a baseline for each media badge issued
6963620	6968380	quantcast.com for example currently has your site listed at approximately 10 000 monthly
6968380	6973560	uniques for the month of december 2010 based on the above we can approve two media badges
6973560	6979560	for site that provided this info at this time wait a second for every 8 000 though but they
6979560	6985060	only have 10 000 that's not 16 000 so i don't maybe they're being nice or maybe maybe they
6985060	6990080	hit the cap for one and then i don't i don't know so but there's a lot of people out there
6990080	6995100	that are really upset about this and you know to be honest uh if olr wanted to go we probably
6995100	6998720	wouldn't be able to under these conditions because i looked up our site on one of these
6998720	7003940	i think we have like 800 hits or something but that's like really wrong like i don't
7003940	7007260	know what these sites use to measure maybe you know more about this stuff salacious pop
7007260	7011100	some of them some of the websites that you do the tracking you actually have to put an
7011100	7016360	embed code or whatever some sort of code that's in your ridiculous web pages so yeah i mean
7016360	7023180	come on our podcast gets downloaded more than that exactly plus we're a podcast we don't
7023180	7028140	i mean we don't have really a website that uh you know caters to i mean you know there's
7028140	7033060	people that work very hard on our website but mostly the website is a place for our
7033060	7037480	show to be delivered and occasionally a little story that kind of kicks it back to old school
7037480	7043640	lr about old school songs or whatever you know so these sites would not measure our
7043640	7048180	download shows now granted i haven't asked for an e3 pass i haven't you know so i haven't
7048180	7052400	had an official rejection so it's hard to say i almost wonder if maybe i should register
7052400	7057140	as broadcast media if i want to go but at the same time like seriously all the other
7057140	7062600	indie shows i know are getting like told no or they're getting like one batch and i'm
7062600	7067660	kind of like well if no one's freaking going to e3 this year then fuck it i'll read about
7067660	7071540	it on the internet you know part of the fun of going e3 is kind of getting to see everybody
7071540	7078260	it was you know seriously it was fun going to e3 but honestly last year you know i didn't
7078260	7083100	miss it i mean i watched all the press conferences which it's great i got to watch the press
7083100	7086620	conferences that's better than going to e3 because i didn't get to watch the press conferences
7086620	7092180	when i went to you know e3 because i didn't get invited to the press conferences so you
7092180	7097260	had to watch some streamed and honestly streaming it was great i got to watch that i got all
7097260	7101420	the coverage i possibly wanted to you know absorb in there didn't have to wait in lines
7101420	7105300	for games so granted yeah i didn't get to play demos i didn't get to try out the 3ds
7105300	7111320	and stuff but eh whatever you know i i don't really care there's two ways you can kind
7111320	7115940	of look at this and one is that you know at the big sites are getting bigger and the small
7115940	7122100	sites are getting smaller like how are independents and startups supposed to compete if e3 is
7122100	7126220	not going to let them in because they're not already a big site i mean this is just letting
7126220	7133020	one up and ign have more quote-unquote exclusives to mix in with the stories they copy from
7133020	7138260	small sites let's be real where do they get their information they either get granted
7138260	7142940	exclusives because they're big sites or they scour the internet up and down and get them
7142940	7147860	from the little sites we know because we've had stories taken from our site and put on
7147860	7153100	these sites before oftentimes without credit i'm just saying how did they get to be so
7153100	7157340	big you know because they have all that type of manpower etc etc corporate funding blah
7157340	7163660	blah blah so on that end it's kind of bullshit but on the other hand i understand why e3
7163660	7167760	kind of needs to clamp down because there are a lot of people getting in that probably
7167760	7172980	should be yeah but especially as media okay i was gonna say yeah but there's a lot of
7172980	7178940	you know like sales associates and stuff like that over you know at retail stores and stuff
7178940	7183900	like that that are getting in that maybe don't really necessarily need to be there but i
7183900	7188700	don't know at the same time it's just like but where do you draw the line where do you
7188700	7192800	draw the line i think if you meet the qualifications of having the business license and everything
7192800	7196740	like that you've obviously established yourself as a legitimate thing you should at least
7196740	7202820	get one or two but i understand like if you know joe's podunkgameblog.com tries to get
7202820	7207940	20 badges i get why that's a problem especially with these stories about people are selling
7207940	7211700	their badges and everything way to go few bad apples for ruining the barrel for the
7211700	7218000	rest of us truth be told if you really wanted to go to e3 this goes to anybody if you really
7218000	7222260	wanted to go to e3 you could still you know how you have to do it you pay 400 and you
7222260	7226220	just get one of the badges it's not really an advertised thing but you can totally go
7226220	7229840	on there and they they say like industry or whatever you could say you're a student or
7229840	7233620	whatever i'm i'm if you're willing to throw four hundred dollars at them they're gonna
7233620	7240460	let you in why wouldn't they you know what i mean so again despite the traffic our site
7240460	7247140	gets if i really wanted to go i could pay four hundred dollars and go but and and and
7247140	7253260	honestly media badges even if you have a media badge yeah and you're not an ign or one up
7253260	7256900	or something like that right you're just gonna get treated like shit so it's it's it's seriously
7256900	7261260	it's they're like oh who are you oh no i'm sorry we're not giving you an interview you
7261260	7268300	you may get a few um you know scheduled meetings with some of the uh i think the largest ones
7268300	7274660	we got into like uh like sony bethesda or and stuff like that but you know sony online
7274660	7280260	not so many computer entertainment um but like they really don't give a shit about most
7280260	7285380	of the press especially unless you're a big site because that's where the traffic is yeah
7285380	7289580	you won't be invited to the closed door presentation where they're only allowing ten people to
7289580	7295420	see cooking mama five gladiator acts battle you know so you you don't get those hush hush
7295420	7301620	meetings by the way there's another problem i have with this um i kind of think it's a
7301620	7306340	little bit i mean it's the way they're measuring is also kind of the part that peeves me a
7306340	7311580	little bit because it's really unfair to podcasters and so forth and plus like i said the webs
7311580	7316660	that website tells you we get 800 hits unique hits i could whip up stats that tell you the
7316660	7321720	number is much higher like astoundingly higher and look i'm not trying to have an ep conversation
7321720	7326980	here or what have you i just i have facts to back it up we have the number to get everybody
7326980	7332760	in this room in e3 if they would take our stats which are i believe more accurately
7332760	7340100	measured than any of this stuff but you know whatever anyhow so this isn't a me me poor
7340100	7343680	me because if this is the way it is you know e3 it's a private show they can do what they
7343680	7353460	want but if nobody's going then at the same time what do we owe e3 i mean these companies
7353460	7358700	are making announcements at a show in los angeles why should we continue to post about
7358700	7362800	e3 expo and all this stuff and let it get more google hits and all this other stuff
7362800	7367340	you know why are we inflating them if they won't help inflate us maybe that's something
7367340	7372860	the indie folks need to be asking themselves maybe the time during this expo this year
7372860	7378820	is maybe time we should be highlighting games that are in our boat can't afford a big booth
7378820	7383020	at this show they can't afford to compete with the big guys maybe this is a week for
7383020	7391220	the indie shows to celebrate the indie games and maybe maybe that's something we'll have
7391220	7400020	to consider for this year so uh also i wanted to say this i kind of don't want to spend
7400020	7404220	400 to go to e3 or whatever whatever it is i mean again to be fair i haven't even tried
7404220	7408060	yet i haven't got told no yet if none of my friends are going i'm just gonna fucking go
7408060	7412900	to packs like that's where it's at you know that's where all the gaming people are and
7412900	7417060	you know packs at this point is you get to see a lot of the same demos that are already
7417060	7423140	at e3 and it's more of a nerd convention and so forth there you go packs is way more fun
7423140	7430660	than e3 mm-hmm so i kind of miss what they did like in 2006 i think is what it was during
7430660	7435600	e3 where it was like hey guess what you know uh we have this awesome demo on the show for
7435600	7440060	philosophy and guess what it's also on xbox light marketplace go check it out you don't
7440060	7443140	have to go to e3 you can check out some of the demos that are gonna be on the show floor
7443140	7450120	right here you know just get a chance to play them that's awesome we will see what develops
7450120	7456100	in this story because speaking of develops what what's that you know uh i still have
7456100	7464020	a dev console that still has access to uh a certain net that are partnered with different
7464020	7472860	uh publishers out there a lot of e3 demos pop up on too i bet we hear more information
7472860	7477500	on this before the show actually hits because again it's it's uh you go look at some twitter's
7477500	7481580	out there there's a lot of negative buzz on it right now so i don't think e3 is gonna
7481580	7485820	like all that negative buzz they don't give a shit because guess what the end of the day
7485820	7489540	they get their coverage on all the big sites and you know what that's what they don't give
7489540	7496660	a shit indy blogs might be little but they're loud besides if all the big boys are getting
7496660	7500500	their stories from the indie blogs anyway at some point they're gonna pick up on this
7500500	7506600	something to think about they don't care by the way when i say big blogs i don't mean
7506600	7510820	all of them there are a few really good ones out there but unfortunately you know just
7510820	7516380	like we're in this boat a few dicks ruin it for everybody all right moving on dark sakura
7516380	7521060	you got some news for us here that's a little bit happier hopefully definitely happier um

8724440	8732200	paint um they've sold 1.2 million udraw units in the third quarter um of their fiscal year of
8732200	8738600	course and of course they want more udraw games uh they're actually looking to kind of change up
8738600	8748280	their business strategy a bit trying to step away from some of the kids and um i guess uh movie
8748280	8755560	cartoon based stuff that they have coming out um thq does a lot they have like nintendo license
8755560	8762840	so they do a lot of spongebob and um you know crap at nicktoons and all sorts of stuff that
8762840	8768840	comes out with that um which would be good because i don't like selling it each year
8768840	8773240	have you ever made anything that's been really good for for everyone the you don't know jack
8773240	8779400	the you don't know jack game for everyone right yeah it is them but but uh i mean saints row red
8779400	8785240	faction a lot of the you know volition stuff you know through them is pretty cool ufc i mean people
8785240	8791080	like ufc so they do have the mature stuff but like as far as casual family stuff yeah i just remember
8791080	8796920	like back in the day like 15 years 10 15 years ago they were putting all these crap games that
8796920	8805080	no one no one seemed to like like like like some what was that movie like home alone like some
8805080	8813080	sort of home alone oh god it was terrible yeah the games were not fun all right well uh those
8813080	8817400	udraws seem to be doing pretty well i mean i see them all over now yeah they do they're doing
8817400	8821000	pretty well and uh be nice when there's more software out there if they did like a mario
8821000	8825800	paint game that used to udraw that pretty awesome do you think uh it might be something nintendo
8825800	8831080	tries to show off at the big big expo later this year i think it would be nice i don't know if
8831080	8836920	that's actually going to be the case all right well this is pretty cool i like this uh castle
8836920	8841160	crashers you know this game's kind of old at this point but a lot of people are still loving it and
8841160	8845880	what better to kind of reinvigorate the game a little bit than adding a new character and what
8845880	8850360	better to add a new character than to add a new character for charity that's right there is a
8850360	8856360	brand new pink knight available in castle crashers there is a pink knight uh the pink knight comes
8856360	8862040	with a lollipop and pink armor and joins the red blue yellow and green knights in the adventures
8862040	8867560	uh you do have to buy the pink knight if you want it in castle crashers it's in the playstation
8867560	8872840	network version and it's gonna cost you a dollar 99 to get the character now before you get all
8872840	8878440	po that you're gonna have to buy this character it is going towards a good cause uh the money
8878440	8882920	that they raise from this character will be donated to charities devoted to breast cancer
8882920	8886840	research and that is according to the behemoth because obviously february is breast cancer
8886840	8891560	awareness month and you see a lot of pink ribbons that people wear so what better than a pink knight
8891560	8896760	i like this this is good news for gaming this is a great story so uh check this out even if you uh
8897400	8901960	you know just on principle check it out i know and the pink knight gets a lollipop
8901960	8908280	yeah awesome uh by the way the pink knight will be coming to xbox live arcade just hasn't happened
8908280	8914600	just yet but it will happen hopefully this month so check that out i think that's a great cause

8946040	8951480	successfully put forward the dedication and drive to broadcast that many truly an awesome achievement
8952280	8957080	i only regret that i haven't listened to more olr than i have lately and tonight i've been hard at
8957080	8963080	work on snake 361 the sequel is snake 360 in fact i'm working on it as you read this and can't wait

8983800	8990200	other snake games okay one of my favorite things about olr something you all say along every gamer
8990200	8995160	has a voice anyone can post on the internet but with olr this is true in both a figurative and
8995160	9000600	literal sense colin's are frequent fun and memorable when is a chat room not just a chat room
9000600	9004760	when it's a conversation with a great community of gamers and when it can steer the show at any
9004760	9009960	moment in any way imaginable it transforms olr into more than the sum of its parts into something
9009960	9015400	unique enough that the 400th episode feels just as fresh as the fourth episode which i wasn't here
9015400	9020040	for that's true no i think no i was here for the fourth episode you came back for the fourth you

9289480	9295560	for me between seven six and four for my favorite final fantasy every console i have bought was to
9295560	9302440	play a final fantasy playstation for seven ps2 for 10 and a ps3 for 13 i just hope that squeenix

9487000	9492840	f you to political correctness i said it f you to people getting offended over shit

9496840	9504520	all right moving on loki you're a few of the week f you not being able to read japanese so
9504520	9509720	i hit replay level instead of continue i i just don't understand that i don't want to play this
9509720	9515720	level again my a few of the week goes to the fact that this weekend just flew by like yesterday i
9515720	9521800	m at work it feels like and now it's all i gotta do it all again tomorrow so whatever at least i
9521800	9527400	like my job so you know but it's just uh i missed the weekend slaysh is actually good arcadian
9527400	9532440	because he has a mic do you have an f you this week arcadian uh fuck you to my uh ipod and or
9532440	9538840	itunes it makes fun every so often it wants to make my ipod forget it has anything on it and
9538840	9544360	have to restore it just done it like three times piece of shit and then fuck you kind of nostalgia
9544360	9550040	because i don't have time to go back and play this the games i feel like playing go ahead because i
9550040	9555080	was looking at like my actually putting together a new road mix because i lost it with my new
9555080	9560600	computer so putting it together and her old songs from games that i want to go back and play
9560600	9567240	anime to watch and shit like that that i have no time for and salacious pop sort of a boring
9567240	9572680	answer but just f you to the economy hey i think a lot of people are with you there all right
9572680	9578760	there it is the f us of the week let's move on to just a couple more stories for you guys and then
9578760	9582920	the skype line which is going to be interesting tonight all right we'll we'll do the skype line
9582920	9587080	as long as we can tonight uh we might have to put a time limit on calls tonight just so you know
9587080	9590600	because if the match game was any indication we got a lot of people wanted to call in tonight
9590600	9595160	so we might have to do a little time limit all right uh loki if you uh sorry not if you news
9595160	9600600	story uh the movie site first showing is reporting that there's a zombies ate my neighbors film in
9600600	9607960	development yay apparently based on the uh old 16-bit game which i forgot is actually uh developed
9607960	9615480	by lucasarts that would be awesome if lucas starts to put that out that game was great they said uh
9615480	9619400	there needs to be trampoline levels it's a flick being described as a horror comedy more
9619400	9627000	specifically john hughs meets judd apatow meets george a romero honestly i think it'd be an
9627000	9631160	excellent movie the whole thing was a parody on kind of the horror genre anyways and it was
9631160	9637160	absolutely ridiculous with like 50-foot tall babies and zombies and werewolves and i think
9637160	9641560	there were aliens in there as well that's the game that i should have played but just missed
9641560	9645000	completely and i still have no idea why but i definitely remember the hype around it it's on
9645000	9649080	virtual console it's awesome i don't have a way but wait did you just pimp nintendo's virtual
9649080	9655240	console i think you did well they put out some games they just stopped now i i think they
9655240	9660360	just stopped now i i had to call you on it i'm sorry well fine download the rom fuck paying them
9660360	9667240	money there you go now there's the low-key answer i was looking for i think you can make a cool
9667240	9672040	movie i think you know if they kind of don't try to keep it as the video game i think the name has
9672040	9676280	enough recognition just keep the story don't you don't even bother you know i think there's enough
9676280	9681480	people that just would have no idea there was even a game that exists that would go see the movie and
9681480	9686040	then you would get the game again because it would tie into the movie but of course movie tie-in
9686040	9690360	games always suck and here's the thing though about it though is you don't even need to like
9690360	9694760	have game times because the whole thing is just basically a spoof of like the horror genre
9694760	9702360	it's basically it's like monster squad actually a little bit because it's all the the shit horrible
9702360	9707080	things that can happen in like uh horror movies all happening at once there's zombies attacking
9707080	9711800	there's evil dolls there's werewolves there's giant babies there's i think there were giant
9711800	9718200	ants and stuff like uh all sorts of crazy shit going down all at once that's what you need
9720520	9725640	well it seems like the theme of it was all of the um all of the really awful horror movies that
9725640	9729320	came out in the 50s that were all kind of metaphors for communism the giant ants and
9729320	9737640	whatever yeah exactly yeah right all right i played through that whole game that had like
9737640	9740520	i think there was like over 100 levels in the game it was ridiculous
9743240	9749480	all right one more story for you guys and it's about the battles or at least one of them ringo
9749480	9759400	star one of the ones that still left and still kicking uh ringo star hi i apparently has um
9759400	9765560	registered a trademark that indicates that his name has been trademarked ringo his name has
9765560	9771240	been trademarked for downloadable computer games via the internet and wireless devices
9771240	9778360	toys namely toy vehicles plush toys pet toys and skateboards so i have no idea if ringo is going
9778360	9783160	to start getting into skateboarding daddy i want the ringo vehicle i which seems a little odd to
9783160	9787640	me like i would understand if there was like a ringo music game or something coming like a
9787640	9792760	drumming on your ipad type of thing but uh skateboards and pet toys clearly he's trying
9792760	9797960	to protect the name from something that's what this strikes me as is that you know ringo could
9797960	9802920	kind of be like uh i don't know like a new ring toss game or something i don't know roll with me
9802920	9807000	here it could be some new game and maybe he doesn't want to lose that you know on his name
9807000	9810440	so maybe that's why he trades market but then again are you allowed to trademark something
9810440	9814920	if you don't have a plan to use it i guess so there's a lot of squatters and so forth
9816440	9820520	by the way of course the attorney has been asked on why ringo star trademarked the name
9820520	9828200	and no comment no comment the last time ringo was heard in a video game news story it was uh with
9828200	9832440	the beatles rock band he was talking to jimmy fallon about it and said the graphics are great
9832440	9839960	i love the game i love the music but it's for young folk his 15th studio album came out last
9839960	9849160	year called why not why not make a video game why not ringo skateboards sure why not there you go
9849160	9855560	would you buy a ringo skateboard slices pop if i didn't have the self-esteem to buy the the tony
9855560	9862280	hawk one then yes got it and got to keep you know keep the bar low sometimes all right well of course
9862280	9866520	there's the folks in chat room that are coming up with all these ringo games dark to see it says
9866520	9874280	ringo stars pro skater uh frisbee says ringo stars rate wasteland frisbee ringo star underground sga
9874280	9879000	100 matt is bringing up that sarah palin followed a copyright on filed a copyright on her name
9879000	9883800	does that mean they can keep making the nail in palin or is that uh illegal now the the palin
9883800	9889960	porns have you seen these sailor sarah palin like re rejuvenated the porn industry did you know that
9890920	9895560	well there's that one actress that looks exactly like her that's like yes this is my moment
9897720	9903400	not tina faye but she she could do this nail in palin and then just roll right over
9904200	9910120	and do the 30 rock porn well they make those really awful deer hunter games for pc that are
9910120	9915560	like 999 brand new they always come out with a new version she should just license that
9915560	9920920	except it'll be moose hunter sarah palin's moose hunter available hunter yeah but that

10395240	10403480	not me what are the craziest names you've given the characters my final fantasy one party was
10403480	10413720	probably um fuck fart poop and ass speaking of finance you only get four lanes through um the
10413720	10421000	four heroes of light he made the main hero dipshit and named the princess gonorrhea he's at the scene
10421000	10428440	where the king tells him dipshit go find my gonorrhea right now i do that immature shit
10428440	10433560	all the time it's great my character like the most amazing game i can think of uh was uh white
10433560	10439640	knight chronicles that i've been playing and uh i made i made a character named sassy and she's like
10439640	10444200	a black chick with flowing hair and she's very fierce she's very pangaroo you know what i found
10444200	10452200	my derby owner's club because remember he had one named um uh paula terry and i had one called
10452200	10458920	horse poop and we had a kiriyamaoka but i mean we've named our horses interesting things i had
10458920	10467000	a horse named glue yeah i think i think oregon trail is the first game of people of this generation
10467000	10472440	that really were able to do that with the names but in final fantasy 7 if you give eris or erith
10472440	10478200	in particular the most raunchiest name you could think of lols for days you will get your money's
10478200	10485320	worth it seems like the trend is like you get the lols of off of any of the final fantasy games like
10485320	10491880	my roommate played tactics i don't know what the character's name was i think it was head one of
10491880	10499000	the scenes where where the guards like you will give us head now what what and what possessed

10891160	10898680	it's like i know that's the hill where where we fell off the earth actually we're that far past
10898680	10903080	the hill i don't know i don't know what to tell you and you notice how i i was like i was gonna
10903080	10908280	call in next and then ron mccalled and so i let somebody else go in between because i know i can't

10921160	10926680	well now we might have this whole week we need a duet we're gonna have this week off in june
10926680	10931320	where we're not doing anything so maybe we need to have melodica con i i used to i used to know
10931320	10937720	how to play um the uh the whole opera thing from final fantasy 6 that's what i was trying to
10937720	10944920	remember how to play except it's in a bizarre key so i was like i don't remember well what what's
10944920	10949320	funny with the melodica which is i had no clue that we were going to go in this direction but
10949320	10955000	if you go to any of the events that the game audio network guild goes to they all have melodicas
10955000	10959320	instead of they'll have like maybe like one drum person it's like a drum circle but they all have
10959320	10966280	melodicas i love and they're all just doing like improv with their melodicas i i love them i got
10966280	10974360	a 32 keys i think of soprano melodica from um marissa who has been with me when i've gone to
10974360	10981400	several music stores looking for melodicas so you know what's next on the list an auto harp
10982760	10986360	or theremin i was gonna say we need to get there i mean i thought you wanted a theremin i do want
10986360	10991080	a theremin but i can afford another i know that bobby is one of the biggest band nerds i know
10991080	10994680	but i don't think he called in to talk about melodicas tonight what's on your mind bobby
10995320	10999880	i was i just i got home from from where i went tonight and uh you know wanted to wish you guys
10999880	11004840	happy 400 because i didn't create any audio like i said i would because i'm a bad person
11004840	11010840	that's i forgot to do audio for the last fng so it's all good so well they thank you so much for
11010840	11016840	the call and of course a big thank you bobby you know um this show almost died a few years
11016840	11023080	ago actually and uh when live 365 kind of uh kind of made it impossible for us to keep continuing to
11023080	11026920	do a radio station with kind of the new unrealistic rates that they were going to charge for our
11026920	11033800	audience and uh you were obviously really the the person i mean other folks might try to take credit
11033800	11038680	for it but you were the guy that brought us to all games radio a couple years before and helped kind
11038680	11043720	of facilitate uh us coming on in a more you know kind of permanent way where our live show is now
11043720	11050200	kind of exclusively here so for that we and the rest of the olr listeners really thank you for
11050200	11054520	helping this show reach 400 because otherwise it probably would have ended around 278 so
11054520	11058840	you're welcome and and you guys are keeping me on because all your listeners tune in early
11059880	11063720	to me and so i can use that as my numbers even though they're not really listening to me
11063720	11067240	yeah so it's awesome it works both ways well bobby i hate to say it but sadly we don't even
11067240	11071640	have 8 000 people tuning in so i don't know what you're gonna do or what i'm gonna i haven't gotten
11071640	11078840	my rejection letter yet you're waiting bobby i'm prepared bobby yes we are your fan club
11078840	11085320	we are your fan club it's it's not an e3 without bobby either it's just in you know i i can really
11085320	11089320	mean that because dude's gone to like what the last what 15 in a row or something like that
11089320	11094760	this would be my 15th this would be your 15th yes and they are going to say no to this man possibly
11095400	11100680	because yeah we don't know yet we see the way like i got the optimistic reading of the emails
11100680	11108360	that if you have below eight thousand that's still one right it's over eight thousand to get the second
11108360	11115080	one but those are all blogs and stuff and i wonder because they do note make the distinction in the
11115080	11121960	application form of podcast oh interesting so you know it wasn't like i said i'm an online writer i
11121960	11127080	said i'm online i do podcasts and i said here's where i've been here's how long i've been doing
11127080	11132200	it here's here's me on e3 coverage.com here's me at all games here's me at bobbyblackwolf.com
11132200	11138760	so maybe it's a different rule set for me because no but i could get 8 000 people to listen and you
11138760	11144120	could get 8 000 people to listen but they're not going to orangelandradio.com exactly and and
11144120	11148920	hopefully most of our audience is smart enough not to have spyware toolbars installed on their
11148920	11152920	computer exactly it is a little bit the way they're measuring it is kind of janky but you
11152920	11156120	know again and we said this earlier and i know you were at your party so you probably didn't hear
11156120	11160760	this but you know it's it's mostly a case of a few bad apples ruining the barrel you know and i see
11160760	11166440	why e3 feels like they need to take this step but it's just kind of like the wrong step like you
11166440	11170520	should have gone left instead of right you know what i mean well i mean i'm already told i'm not
11170520	11174760	allowed at gdc anymore too so it's like e3 was really all i had left other than packs
11176040	11182200	because gdc took this step two years ago i did there there there is neatness i'd like getting
11182200	11186920	to hang with the developers and get to see some of this stuff you know when i've played warhammer
11186920	11190680	online for the first time i was getting to talk to developers and stuff it was kind of cool but
11190680	11198520	you know so but you know if if somebody's really serious about getting into e3 in terms of if they
11198520	11202840	get rejected by the press pass there's still a way in it's just going to cost you a little bit
11202840	11207640	of money that's right four hundred dollars yeah but you can get in and if you already have contacts
11207640	11213320	when you with the industry you can still get you know you can still get appointments and all that
11213320	11217800	stuff i mean like you guys didn't even have appointments so you could with an exhibits only
11217800	11222360	badge you really could have done the exact same thing you did last year you didn't need a press
11222360	11227640	badge well now we have bobby i'll tell you this i'll tell you this even with my exhibits only i
11227640	11233560	got into press events yeah yeah as long as you they know you it doesn't matter what your badge
11233560	11239880	says all i had to do was flash them a card that says i do this podcast and they're like we want
11239880	11246280	you exactly it was so i think it'll be fine if you really really want to go and yes i really
11246280	11252440	really want to go um you know thankfully i got a refund from my taxes so if i do get the dear
11252440	11255880	john letter it's not going to be the end of the world well keep me posted because i sure as hell
11255880	11261080	ain't going if bobby ain't going because now i i would not have my usual travel buddy to go with
11261080	11264280	so i don't know what's gonna well i'm planning on going because i'm just gonna write them and say
11264280	11271480	hey i have a new last name send me my card what i've got my ddr freak stuff oh yeah you might be
11271480	11276680	able to do with that so yeah so i mean i didn't get mine the other year and i think it's because
11276680	11283560	of my name change interesting so and besides i want to go to anaheim yes he wants to go to the

11665880	11670360	you nerd all right brad thanks so much for the call have a good one you too guys later all right
11670360	11681960	all right should we do one more call yes all right we'll do one more call we just can't stop
11681960	11687960	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this legend of zaku what's on your mind my friend
11689160	11696600	first of all happy 400th to you guys happy 400th to us thank you happy 400th to you too zaku
11696600	11704760	you've been here for a lot of it so thank you yeah at least a good 80 you know like 75 of it
11705400	11709880	but yeah good enough all right let me see i'm trying to think because i've been out of like
11709880	11714200	the whole you know i've been out of like the recent gaming news aside for that new psp announced
11714840	11719960	but i mean from what i heard a lot of the devs are just like you know they're they're
11719960	11725080	creaming in their pants over how it's like you know genera like a generation ahead of the current
11725080	11731720	smartphones out there which got which just which you know the way i see it they're just
11731720	11737640	taking a lot of lip service so i mean that's the whole point is it because right now there has to
11737640	11742840	have to be nimble against not only apple but whoever else is releasing any new android tabs
11742840	11749480	that could just rival what but sony's gonna end up releasing i mean we'll give them the benefit
11749480	11756360	of that we really don't know how the the new ngps will perform when it releases but i can tell you
11756360	11763720	this i mean you know dual core phones are on are going to be here in a little bit so you're going
11763720	11768440	to have all these game developers aside from the ones that are not targeting the psp the ones that
11768440	11774280	have targeted the iphone and high-end android phones they're there they're capitalizing it
11774280	11780280	so that way you know they have you know they have like a known new release in particular games that
11780280	11785160	not only target ngp but are capable of running on these other newer smartphones you know what
11785160	11789720	there's ipad 2 is going to be out any day now they're they're probably going to announce that
11789720	11793080	so although i think that was supposed to come out in january and then of course now that iphone is
11793080	11799960	on verizon that's just going to further apple's grip on you know what's going on in the ios world
11799960	11806600	with iphone 5 i'm sure a kind of like a hybrid thing for at&t and verizon on its way in the
11806600	11814280	summer so i mean it's just crazy times sorry that um verizon only got like the really got the you
11814280	11819960	know the hand-me-downs per se it's like at&t still has an ex it has like a ton of exclusive now
11820680	11825400	whatever new phone whenever your iphone comes out it'll have you know verizon will get it
11825400	11832920	months afterwards well too early to tell but so far that's the indication that i've been
11832920	11838520	i've seen so far that you know at&t will still have it it doesn't have it's like you know full
11838520	11843320	exclusivity like it's the only carrier where you can buy it but it'll probably have what you know
11843320	11849720	they have like a compromise like a timed exclusive but you do realize that you know as i said google
11849720	11856280	is already is already you know already has like android 3.0 out which is like their tablet version
11856280	11862360	which is supposed to like herald in the the era of like three you know 300 tablets that
11862360	11867560	that pretty much rival the ipad right or match up to so wait let me let me ask you this then
11867560	11871960	obviously there's all this competing technology coming out we know that what is the ngp what is
11871960	11878360	it that they have to do to stand out from the crowd they just have to bring something that
11878360	11885320	that you can't really get on an iphone or high-end android phone basically something that not only
11885320	11891400	surpasses ps2 but just like barely touches ps3 graphics something that melts faces with awesomeness
11892760	11898120	exactly well you need something that has like you know it's kind of a hybrid in between the ps2
11898120	11905640	and you know the 360. if you get that on a small package like a like an ngp then you pretty much
11905640	11910600	you're pretty much like a step ahead of the competition last question zaku do you think
11910600	11911880	do you think they'll succeed
11914440	11920760	sony i mean on the way i see it is that remember they didn't they never had this much heat i mean
11920760	11928360	from from anyone outside of nintendo because now that apple's like creeping up you know apple and
11928360	11933320	and the other manufacturers are creeping up they have to like you know they have to make sure they
11933320	11939480	have to hit another home run all right the psp so really well but you know more there are more
11939480	11943720	iphones out there than psps and that's a fact you know there are more android phones out there
11944280	11949640	there's a lot more like high-end smartphones than people have psp all right one of them well we will
11949640	11955640	see buddy i gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your call all right take care
11955640	11963720	my friend we'll see you on episode 700 yeah definitely all right later dude all right that

12058840	12061560	gotta go around though i'm assuming all the last minute news is done
12061560	12066840	if so we'll go around and get everybody's final thought so loki we'll start with you your final
12066840	12072120	thought tonight uh galgan's a weird game hope i don't get visited by chris hanson
12073400	12078360	uh salacious pop since you have the microphone thank you so much for being here tonight in this
12078360	12084600	very special episode because you're a special guy so uh any final thoughts tonight for our listeners
12084600	12090760	final thoughts tonight for our listeners i'm eagerly anticipating our trip to the noodle house
12090760	12097240	after this are you hungry yeah all right that's all right uh arcadian thank you for being here
12097240	12101400	appreciate your support as always you've kind of been there since day one as well all way back in
12101400	12107240	the arvigal days so you've watched us grow up right in front of your eyes oh yeah any final
12107240	12112120	thoughts for our listeners tonight i'll go over what my game of 2010 was and that was near has
12112120	12118040	very good story very good characters and very good music and even though the game has a little
12118040	12122920	flaws to it that they could iron it out but generally they're not bad been big enough to
12122920	12128280	make it what the game experience that it was and i think it used but i think it would interest you
12128280	12132600	i've considered picking it up but i've read not so nice things about it don't listen to them okay
12132600	12137320	well because you're right they fuck it up a lot yeah because there's a controversy or something
12137320	12141320	but that's just something you wouldn't even figure out unless you read something really
12141320	12146600	deep into it a lot of people hated lost odyssey too and i thought it was fabulous so yeah and and
12146600	12152040	one thing about it that the the female character swears almost every scene she's in that and i
12152040	12155720	think it's something that appealed more to older players than younger players younger players
12155720	12161880	probably wouldn't like the story as much or some of the characterizations probably wouldn't really
12161880	12166600	ring true to them or wouldn't really kind of mix with their experience but like older people will
12166600	12171800	probably think would like a lot more all right so noted um that's a hell of a final thought but i'll
