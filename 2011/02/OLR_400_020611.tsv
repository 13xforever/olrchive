14085	23375	Tonight, February 6, 2011, Nintendo disagrees with low app pricing, Halo gets remade this holiday, and has Zelda Skyward Sword been further delayed?
31986	39288	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
39668	40568	My name is Rob Roberts.
40608	42069	I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
42149	46170	With me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46490	47750	Greetings and salutations.
47850	48510	How are you, Ms.
48530	48890	Summers?
49571	51911	My voice is coming and going.
52051	52271	Yeah.
52751	54452	I will at points sound like a 12-year-old boy.
54472	54912	Mm-hmm.
55652	56713	But I'm doing good.
56753	57874	I'm happy, excited.
57954	59955	A lot of people I know have been getting sick lately.
60015	60696	It's not just you.
60876	61636	Something's going around.
61656	62917	Something's going around.
63017	64458	But it has stolen my voice.
64698	67981	By the way, I noticed you're wearing like a nerdy Star Trek shirt, but it's a red shirt.
68261	68981	That's a bad sign.
69001	69722	But it's engineering.
70082	70362	Okay.
70503	72424	The engineers are smart enough to stay inside.
73164	75186	It's the security guys that keep getting blown up.
75546	75726	Yes.
75786	81110	Plus, I don't know what it is about that shirt, but it is showing off your very adequate bazoom.
81390	81630	Yes.
81971	82311	Thank you.
83376	84177	So congratulations.
84197	84617	Thank you.
84637	84817	All right.
85158	87900	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
88220	88420	Hi.
89722	90462	How are you, Loki?
90662	91063	I'm fine.
91203	92284	He's a man of many words.
92864	94486	Anything interesting going on for you this week?
97048	97188	No.
97669	97809	No?
99787	101448	All right, it's going to be one of those shows.
101788	104428	We have some guests in studio, so let me introduce them.
104668	111550	Of course, we always have the ever-present fourth guest with us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can join us in our chat room.
111570	112311	There are people live.
112771	120053	I do know there's some type of ball game going on right now that people seem to care about, so I know things are a little...
120493	121414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
141835	143757	Lots of WoW games, I don't know.
161203	162024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
182263	182683	Oh, you're no fun.
182703	184004	The volume's turned down.
184624	186746	Well, you can, I think it's implied.
187226	191508	But yeah, and then they fall down with their love for you because you shot them with your love gun.
192909	193349	Oh, great.
193389	194169	Loki's turned it up.
194209	196370	I don't know if it gets picked up on the mic or whatever, but.
197551	199152	Oh, does it come through on our little soundboard now?
201013	202894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
226249	227630	Yes, so what's new with you?
227650	228890	Uh, not too much.
229291	229511	Yeah?
229551	232652	Now I'm into crazy work time, so I don't have much time to play games these days.
232752	233673	Crazy work time?
233693	236574	What do you do for a living without, you know, you don't have to tell us where you work, but what kind of work?
236594	241197	Well, I work at two places, and the first place I work five hours a day, every day, all year.
241277	245539	The other place, I work eight hours a day, like six to eight, like nine months of the year.
246019	246299	Wow.
247079	247439	All right.
247499	247939	Busy, busy.
248380	248580	Yeah.
248880	249180	All right.
249860	250120	All right.
250440	258121	Well, we're going to get around to How Is Your Gaming Week, but I should acknowledge that tonight is a little bit special because it is episode 400 of Orange Lounge Radio.
258142	261682	400 freaking shows.
261902	269364	This show started on June 23, 2002, and here we are over 400 weeks because we're lazy.
269384	270284	We take a lot of weeks off.
270684	275125	Over 400 weeks later, but 400 shows later, here we are at our show.
275365	276226	It's exhausting.
276587	278208	So what are we doing special tonight?
278509	281112	The same shit we've done for a long time.
281172	282734	No, we had something special.
282874	283154	That's true.
283174	285417	We do have one new special thing, but the live listeners don't get to see it.
285437	286979	This is something special for the podcasties.
288194	288614	Meatballs?
289274	289374	Oh.
291095	292735	Well, the listeners don't get meatballs.
293055	293895	No, but we're special.
293915	294556	We get meatballs.
295196	307919	I think originally this was going to be a drunk show, but Loki's got the kid, Rob drives, Jamie's not going to pay to get us all blitzed, and if we took a shot every time Nintendo made a bad business decision, we would just die.
307939	308499	We would be dead.
308539	309099	Exactly.
309739	312280	Remember, a lot has happened in nine years of the show.
312380	315781	I have my gallbladder out for one, so I have no alcohol tolerance anymore.
316081	317363	Remember when I almost died, y'all?
317383	318344	That was hilarious.
319987	320848	You were so skinny, though.
320868	321489	You look so good.
321669	322330	I know.
322350	323572	God, I want to get peccary eyes again.
324013	325956	So which character should we attempt to rape first?
326757	328079	Oh, the one with the bunny ears.
328099	328740	The bunny ears.
328980	329341	Got it.
329561	329862	All right.
331981	332421	What's your name?
332441	333222	I have no idea.
333242	333842	It doesn't matter.
333862	334722	What do you mean that I do now?
350868	352549	Xtasy shot because you shot her in the crotch.
352629	352909	Wow.
375157	377098	I love radio about video games.
396844	419086	but uh we used to kind of start off with how was your week how was your day we didn't just talk about all video games now we do so next thing i'm going to say is i'm going to say the cage match pick goes into rotation all week long here at orange launch radio.com it goes into rotation in our hearts exactly all right uh dark soccer how is your gaming week i hit level 85 like yesterday addict dealer
422349	423050	Congratulations, though.
423070	423430	Thank you.
423771	430439	Now I'm kind of bored, and I'm working on building reps, so I built my Darnassus rep, like, in one night.
431500	432481	And now I have a kitty cat.
433122	433342	Cat.
433562	434103	I'm a kitty cat.
434404	435845	And a meow, meow, meow, and a meow, meow, meow.
437567	437727	And...
440794	446460	Dan got his driving wheel set up for Gran Turismo 5.
446760	451206	He got this sort of stand so that he can put it away when he's done playing.
451806	457553	And he got the seats out of the Honda Prelude, which he is building his driving seat out of.
459042	460582	and that's what Dan's gaming week has been.
460602	462823	Wait, so he actually took seats out of a real car?
462923	463603	It's in the living room.
463623	467104	To build a Gran Theft, I almost said Gran Theft, Gran Turismo 5?
467424	468225	I'll take a picture of it.
468525	470145	Wow, yeah, you should and put it on the little feed.
470525	472406	Yeah, I'll do that right now.
472646	473346	All right, you should.
474126	475867	Wow, that's dedication.
475927	476727	Why is he doing this?
476747	477447	That's insanity.
477487	478227	Just because he can?
478247	478687	Yes.
478707	479227	You let him.
479708	480328	He's your husband.
480788	481868	I don't let him do shit.
482228	482848	He just does it.
483929	485309	Then again, the same goes vice versa.
485329	488210	Does he let you sit in the seat or is he like, no, this is the captain's chair?
488810	490411	I don't care to sit in the seat.
490731	493132	It's a seat on a milk crate right now.
494193	494993	It's ghetto.
495333	498495	And I'm taking a picture and showing you all how weird my husband is.
498515	504598	Alright, you can see those pictures at www.orangeloungeradio.com Alright, Loki, you gotta pause that game and tell us about your gaming week.
504658	505318	How was your gaming week?
505538	506879	My game is weird.
508680	509840	This week I didn't play a whole lot.
509900	513682	I played just Grand Theft Auto, of course.
514623	514763	And...
516309	519151	A little bit of some iOS games I played.
521132	523534	League of Evil, which I didn't really care for that one.
523614	527397	They're comparing it kind of to Super Meat Boy, and I'm sorry, it's not Super Meat Boy.
527437	528958	It's not even close.
529058	535842	It's just kind of almost reminds me of Mega Man, but really hard and basic.
536043	537744	But it's an iPhone game, so what do you expect?
537864	539465	So it's the basic bitch of video games.
539845	542027	It's just kind of lame.
542427	551753	And then there was this other pirate game that was kind of cool with anime people that I played that was kind of fun.
554695	556216	And what else did I try?
556937	559859	Oh, I played more Swords & Poker 2 because that game is just awesome.
559879	561500	I really wish it was still in the App Store.
564127	564768	Puzzle Quest, Poker
585675	603296	and it's really unique fun game if you have a you know gel broken iPod or iPhone or something like that I recommend downloading them even though it is piracy but they're not in the store so I mean I'd say go buy them if you could but you can't so pirate them
605669	606269	Superbowl is so gay
634591	635954	A little bit, a little bit.
636314	642045	Also, Spazinator says, if Loki ever goes a week without playing Grand Theft Auto 4, the universe will implode.
642065	643287	Did you play Grand Theft Auto 4 this week?
645236	649180	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
668917	676083	Yeah, I was about to say, have you heard those rumors that the next Grand Theft Auto is set to debut at the big expo in LA in June?
677429	679351	It's not going to be for at least another year.
679471	681853	There's not Grand Theft Auto coming out this year.
681873	683254	You think they might do just a little tease?
683434	684755	What does Rockstar have going on right now?
685315	686756	Well, they've got a bunch of stuff coming out.
686777	687577	They've got L.A.
687617	689659	Noire, which is coming out in spring.
690199	691961	Spring, summer, second quarter, if you will.
692961	698586	Then they've got Max Payne 3 coming out at some point, probably going to be in the fall.
700407	703390	They had something else too that was from Take-Two that was supposed to be coming out.
704350	704451	Um...
706946	710507	I think Max Payne 2 is probably... I think they're going to be putting out L.A.
710527	713828	Noire because that's going to be kind of like their Red Dead Redemption for the year.
714328	716989	And then Max Payne will probably come out in the fourth quarter.
718950	720791	Grand Theft Auto, I would see maybe a...
722612	728576	Ideally, probably next April would be when I could see that.
728977	731159	But I don't know if that's actually going to happen.
731179	732119	They have the engine already.
732139	737484	They'll just build it off of the Red Dead Redemption since it's just an update to the Rage engine anyways.
740802	741462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
763115	765777	And it's really fast-paced, and I still kick the crap out of everybody.
766058	766818	And it's really buggy.
767099	772964	It's funny, actually, in Saints Row 2, little-known fact, you can throw the sticky bombs on people and detonate them.
773124	779970	Like, say if I throw three of them on somebody and detonate one and kill them, when they respawn, they still have two stuck to them, and you can detonate it again and they die.
780570	781151	It's great.
781331	783213	It's such a glitchy game, but it's awesome.
783413	783753	Awesome.
784934	786556	Any interest in Chinatown Wars Part 2?
787176	789239	I hate Chinatown Wars.
789379	791001	I just had a feeling.
791021	794265	The old top-down games were great, but I'm sorry.
795026	800313	Chinatown Wars, the reason it existed was because that's all the DS could handle.
800434	800654	I mean...
802452	805094	The PSP games are a perfect example of what they could have done.
805254	806175	It was great.
806335	811419	The PSP games were... I mean, they controlled kind of eh because there was only one analog stick, but it was still funny.
811459	818144	We played that up until Grand Theft Auto... Well, actually, up until Saints Row 2 or Saints Row 1.
818204	821446	We played the PSP versions of Grand Theft Auto to death.
822087	823668	Those things were really fucking glitchy.
824488	824608	Um...
825689	831471	But yeah, I mean, seriously, if there's a new PSP... God, if there's an NGP version of Grand Theft Auto, I'm going to have to pick that out.
831631	841614	We may have to all get NGPs to bust that out, but... I'll be buying every game day one, as long as it's not some crap like Chinatown Wars.
842517	844778	All right, let's check in with our guests and see what they've been playing this week.
844818	846218	Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?
847359	847739	Pretty good.
848719	854802	Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Knights of the Crystal, which doesn't really count as a game, and World of Warcraft.
855482	856623	Lots of World of Warcraft.
856683	858203	What's going on in World of Warcraft for you?
858243	860264	I don't want to get too far into the discussion, but...
860524	875793	Yeah, I was in a, I guess a more social casual centric guild and I decided to try and explore a group of people that were more focused on the really hardcore raiding stuff to see if I can, you know, handle that.
876173	878494	And they took me on a raid as a trial.
878855	885578	So I got to see some of the new raid content, did a 25 man, they carried me, I'm pretty much a scrub right now.
886139	886299	But
886559	887160	It was neat to see.
887840	891584	So you turned your back on your friends to go see more pretty internet dragons.
891704	893005	I'm a traitorous maverick.
894471	896932	I'm just giving you shit, obviously, because it's the same guild I'm in.
896972	900634	But I know there's a lot of people that are excited for you, and you can come back and tell us stories.
901054	902855	You can come on Horde House and talk all about it.
902975	905456	Yeah, it's more a Horde House conversation.
905556	905816	All right.
906217	911119	But, you know, it's still, obviously, WoW's a huge game, so got to talk about what's going on there.
911579	913900	So how's Championship Edition going for you?
914560	915721	I mean, breaking records?
915841	917802	I still only play, like, the one mode.
917962	919383	I've unlocked all the other modes.
920223	949573	and I'm like I just want the five minute that's me too I'm the exact same way I go through and I unlock everything and then it's like okay I just want to play this one map over and over because it's it's the one that drives the leaderboards it's on the main Xbox 360 I don't know if this is weird or not but you know how like in the Xbox 360 dashboard you get to see leaderboards but they're only for a certain mode in the game it's usually like the default leaderboard is what you see in that's the one I will try the hardest on and in this case it's usually like stage one or the default board and settings for Pac-Man Championship Edition
950129	964658	And even with the default game style, you can still, you know, on the options before you start up the match, there are eight or nine different visually art, like, you can have the neon or like all green or the 3D model, whatever.
964678	965699	I just leave it on the default.
965879	968300	So visually all the stuff they put into the game, I haven't looked at yet.
968320	969121	All right.
969201	970081	Because there's no reason to.
970702	972002	So you just want to hear the pretty music.
972463	973283	Yeah.
975242	979564	Alright, well let's move on to Arcadia N42 How was your gaming week?
980504	1001552	The only thing I really had to play this week was Rock Band 3 Because I got the symbols pack so I could play pro mode So I was doing that And also I got a mic stand so I could sing when I want to sing But I don't do that that often I was going to say, you're kind of a quiet guy And now here I am hearing about that you have to get the symbols and the microphones That you can rock out and sing all in the privacy of your own home
1002312	1016204	I don't really sing that much just because my voice is kind of screwy and also because there's people on the other side of the wall so I don't want to bother them because my voice is probably sort of deep so it probably goes through the walls so I don't want to bug them.
1016904	1017125	Nice.
1018506	1022569	So what was the first song you had to play when you got the cymbals?
1022589	1025912	Because there's always that one song people got to play in rock band.
1026620	1026980	I don't know.
1028001	1031864	I think it's one of the easier songs just so I could get used to the cymbals.
1032504	1035326	Just go through the training a little bit.
1035366	1041690	The training is not that much different from the standard trainer for drums.
1042450	1046813	It just has pretty much the same training but with the cymbals added.
1048334	1050056	Happy Birthday to Giovedea!
1070438	1079044	That's right, I saw her angst on Twitter about the whole, some game where people wear these uniforms and they all have numbers on them.
1080666	1085449	Well, to quote a conversation that was going on on one of the lesbians' Facebook.
1085609	1086990	Ah, I miss the OLR lesbians.
1087050	1087931	How are they these days?
1088464	1089364	seem to do well.
1089564	1094985	For those that lost track, the OLR lesbians, they were on the show, what, about probably about four years ago at this point.
1095345	1097526	They moved together to Wisconsin.
1097806	1099226	One of them already lived in Wisconsin.
1099366	1099646	I see.
1099986	1102107	That's right, because they were flying back and forth a little bit.
1102767	1105888	So they now they now habitate in Wisconsin with their Birkenstocks.
1105948	1113309	Apparently at this game, they use a racket to hit an orange ball into the net and then they smoke the Rose Bowl.
1113329	1116090	All right.
1116110	1117030	Can I talk about my gaming week?
1118655	1121397	I was sleeping on a Friday That's alright
1144352	1144592	All right.
1146353	1147093	Let's move on.
1147213	1148154	My gaming week.
1148734	1151595	I made an effort to play some indie games this week.
1151635	1153976	So I played a few indie games on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1154336	1158478	I basically handed the controller to Alan and I was like, pick games that look fun.
1159018	1160359	So he picked a few games for me.
1160499	1164741	And probably my favorite out of the bunch that I played was Radiant Games Ballistic.
1165241	1167502	It's an indie game on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1167918	1169280	Thank you for watching!
1186801	1198569	So, you know, for people that are thinking, you know, their life is lacking geometry wars, especially with the sad news about, you know, bizarre creations shutting their doors, it's a nice little, you know, way to hold you over.
1198589	1199910	And it's not that expensive.
1200510	1202091	And the demo is very generous.
1202411	1205113	So there's no reason you can't check out the demo, which is out there.
1205133	1205954	So I liked Ballistic.
1205974	1206434	That was cool.
1207215	1208395	Some of the games I didn't like so much.
1209316	1213059	I'm going to butcher the name of this game, but it was something like Maid Chan's Cave Adventure.
1213799	1214960	Was that the name of it, Salacious Pop?
1214980	1216441	Do you remember what the name of the game was?
1216981	1218602	Something like Maid... It was Maid San.
1218722	1219302	Maid Sans.
1219382	1223004	And then, like, crazy cave adventure, wild cave adventure, but yeah.
1223144	1223905	Yeah, it was dumb.
1224225	1227207	I mean, it was funny for a minute, but it's a really weird mechanic.
1227227	1230929	Like, it's kind of like... Okay, I guess it's like side-scrollery, puzzle-y.
1231269	1233270	Yes, you play a maid who explores caves.
1233310	1234130	That really is what you do.
1234310	1234450	Yeah.
1234630	1236291	And, you know, you think, oh, this is really funny.
1236672	1240634	But you go to collect stars and things, but you have to...
1241434	1247076	The main mechanic of the game is that you duck to avoid the little zombie dudes that have baseball bats.
1247436	1251017	Which, by the way, the first time the maid got hit with a baseball bat, I laughed out loud.
1251357	1253618	It's worth downloading the demo just to see that.
1254379	1259220	Not that I advocate violence against maids, but it was kind of funny the first time.
1259540	1263782	Yeah, because the ogre sees you and says something in Japanese and marches towards you.
1263822	1265282	And then here comes the club thud.
1265522	1266883	And just the way they do it is...
1267743	1274772	Now you can hide by crouching, but the longer you crouch, your field of vision gets narrower and narrower and narrower.
1275733	1279177	So you have to kind of crouch while you wait for the guys to pass you, which is a really weird mechanic.
1280278	1284703	So yeah, it was okay, but I don't think I would have paid money for it.
1284743	1285684	But the demo was fun.
1286405	1291310	Pro tip, if you're going to check out the demo for this game, go into the options, change it to English.
1291470	1294573	Unless you read and understand Japanese thoroughly, then good on you.
1294873	1297775	But the first time I played through, I was like, oh, this game's only in Japanese.
1297916	1298396	Great.
1298616	1299937	Because I don't understand it at all.
1300278	1304401	So I'm just like, I see a Y, like the Y button, so I'll hit that and see what it does.
1304562	1307004	Oh, the game just told me that Y does a high jump.
1307424	1308225	So, yeah.
1308345	1308885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1325033	1327336	Beach, Bubble, Boob, Bobble.
1327657	1328077	I don't know.
1328979	1337350	Beachy, booby, anime chick games, which of course Alan downloaded because he saw the anime chicks in bikinis and he was like, oh, it kind of looks like Bubble Bobble.
1337670	1338772	No, here's the game.
1339172	1341996	You fly around and you collect colored balls.
1342276	1343256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1368467	1369608	That's all I'm going to.
1369648	1370608	You can infer the rest.
1391997	1395180	And if you go to the... Why do you need to go to the NationalGeographic.com?
1395240	1395901	It's a joke.
1395921	1398923	Because that's where we all saw titties.
1399264	1400185	Well, I don't know.
1401085	1404789	That's where I saw titties for the first time was in the National Geographic magazine.
1404829	1406991	I don't know about you guys, but... Were you not breastfed?
1407451	1410634	And you're gay now, so that's a cautionary tale rather than advice.
1410654	1412996	What are you trying to say?
1413537	1414318	There's nothing wrong with it.
1415198	1416318	I am who I am.
1416418	1417379	I am proud of who I am.
1417999	1430601	Even though we've butchered the name of the game, if you go to the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace and look up new, even without even knowing the name of the game, just scan through the tiles and you will immediately know what game we're talking about just by the image.
1431241	1433202	Boobie Beach Bubble Bobble Boobies.
1434002	1435962	For the record, I love boobs.
1436662	1438603	You don't have to be straight or whatever.
1438843	1439563	Boobs are awesome.
1439723	1440783	We can all agree on that.
1440843	1441283	Right, Jamie?
1441423	1442324	I'm very fond of mine.
1442584	1443024	There you go.
1443584	1444304	Everybody can agree.
1444324	1444604	And others.
1446872	1447972	One, two, three, four, five.
1448273	1449673	Five OLR people agree.
1449733	1450473	Boobies are great.
1451254	1451674	Right, Alan?
1451694	1452134	Boobies are great?
1452154	1452774	Yes, yes.
1452994	1453294	Thank you.
1455575	1459236	And I did see the Make a Baby game on there, but I didn't download it for you.
1459336	1460397	I already had the Make a Baby game.
1460417	1460777	Okay.
1461637	1462558	They have a sequel, by the way.
1462818	1463118	Do they?
1463298	1463618	Yes, they do.
1463638	1464158	What's the sequel?
1464178	1464998	Yeah, that's the one I saw.
1465018	1466359	I haven't heard of the sequel.
1467854	1475960	Evil Babies Rosemary's Baby Super Meat Boy I didn't realize not all of the levels are Super Meat Boy Some of them are some of the other characters You have to play the other characters Good times
1495154	1495834	So, yeah.
1496114	1500456	I have that on PC, Super Meat Boy, but I haven't unlocked the headcrab yet.
1500616	1505839	And I'm a huge Half-Life fan, so the fact that I could play as a headcrab, I need to get on that and unlock that.
1506339	1508700	Because that was the Valve Steam edition.
1510361	1510641	Alright.
1511921	1512802	Alright, anyhow.
1513502	1515583	Let's move on with some housekeeping tonight.
1515603	1516944	There's actually a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
1518092	1518952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1543863	1544903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1569394	1569894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1591710	1591850	Yeah.
1591930	1592271	Oh, yeah.
1592531	1592791	Oh, yeah.
1593732	1594573	I miss her, by the way.
1594593	1595393	Very good job, Miss Tia.
1595593	1599917	I know none of our listeners probably know her anymore because she was on the show forever ago.
1600378	1603841	She was on the very last live OLR, if I remember right.
1604221	1604441	Yeah.
1605022	1607564	Or it was the first OLR when we married the two shows.
1607964	1610566	When OLR was a live show and then separately a podcast.
1610586	1612808	I think she was on the very last live only OLR.
1613009	1613209	Yeah.
1613329	1614230	So, miss her.
1614890	1615150	Anyhow.
1616011	1617252	Reminiscing about things in the past.
1617713	1618493	Other things that are going on.
1618513	1623438	So not only do we have new artwork to represent the show, which will hopefully spread everywhere because we're replacing our old stuff.
1624098	1634067	The other thing is that I want to give a plug for Dead Pixel Live, which runs on All Games Radio Monday through Thursday at 7 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Pacific.
1634567	1636289	I was on the show earlier this week.
1636489	1637230	So check that out.
1637290	1638631	It was Thursday's episode.
1638671	1642434	So if you want to go back in this podcasty feed and look at deadpixellive.com,
1643675	1660918	you can check that out and you were on for a while too oh god yeah I was like on for like an hour he was nice enough Derek over at Dead Beasts Alive has been doing his show a really long time as well and he's daily so he passed 400 episodes a long time ago because he's doing like four of them a week I think for a while he might have been doing five
1661318	1664401	So he passed 400 a long time ago.
1664581	1668924	So we had a lot to talk about as much as how do you stay motivated to do a show.
1669004	1672007	So it was cool because we just kind of BS back and forth for a little while.
1672027	1672907	And then he had me on for the news.
1672927	1674949	And we talked a little bit about NGP and some of the other stuff.
1674989	1675930	So it was fun.
1676110	1676570	I had a good time.
1676690	1677911	So I just want to give a plug for that.
1678412	1680493	And if you want to hear another great show.
1681895	1697937	I think that's really it as far as housekeeping goes add us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or you can always add us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR lots of tweets this week because we've been asking people about the show and I'll read some of those tweets a little later on in the show
1698277	1703799	But for now, let's start off episode 400 as we always do with a little bit of gaming news.
1704319	1707160	So, Loki, what's going on in the world of gaming?
1708941	1710461	Same old stuff, I guess.
1710921	1715023	You know, when people run out of ideas for consoles, what's the first thing that happens?
1715243	1722005	Actually, it's not even really consoles or games or anything related to that, but even in the movie industry.
1722286	1722786	Remakes!
1723746	1726347	Hey, if it was good the first time, it'll be good the second time, right?
1726744	1727865	Yeah, yeah, maybe?
1729025	1734688	So Microsoft is rumored to be coming out... Well, actually, it's not so much a rumor anymore.
1735708	1740350	They're going to be remaking the original Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved.
1740831	1742491	It's coming out this holiday for the Xbox 360.
1742972	1747654	You'll be getting a kind of a graphical facelift.
1749415	1754097	They're expecting a 1080p resolution and also possibly 3D support.
1754917	1762301	Of course, the thought is they're going to be remaking it using the Reach engines, so it'll look all fancy and stuff.
1763122	1772787	And apparently it's being developed by Saber Interactive, the company that was behind Timeshift and Namco's upcoming game Inversion.
1774324	1776804	So, neat.
1778085	1788267	And they said the game is expected to come out on November 15th, which is basically 10 years after the original Halo game alongside the original Xbox.
1788687	1793668	It's kind of interesting, though, to go along with that, though, and maybe possibly one of the features of the game.
1794408	1798349	ConnectHalo.com was registered by Microsoft.
1799169	1799989	Oh, boy.
1800009	1800089	Yeah.
1800789	1804673	Of course, this is a URL that was registered in Microsoft back in June of 2010.
1806154	1814583	It could be not necessarily that it's going to be a Kinect Halo game, but maybe they were just registering before people cybersquatted on it.
1815423	1816064	Oh, good point.
1816384	1816725	Who knows?
1816945	1822210	And the only thing that the Kinect will recognize is when you dip your knees down so that you can teabag.
1822690	1822931	Yes.
1824752	1825013	Nice.
1825033	1826594	I like that.
1826674	1838425	Honestly, though, I think it wouldn't be so bad if they had Kinect support, but not necessarily in the fact that you have to stand up and play the whole game that way, but head tracking would be awesome.
1839266	1839607	Okay.
1839667	1845572	I see they said, oh, yeah, we can do Kinect and controller games.
1845772	1847054	Why don't they do head tracking?
1847074	1849116	I think head tracking would be the easiest thing to support.
1849976	1861446	and like most of these games you know you just have it where it tracks your head a little bit and so it kind of gives you a little bit more of immersion you don't necessarily need to do it and you know and it would be pretty awesome for any first person shooter
1862085	1870432	Now, backing up a little bit before we get into this whole Kinect theory, I think you said, you know, this whole thing about the game, this was not an official Microsoft announcement, right?
1870552	1873615	Like, somebody just blew the lid on their big E3 surprise, right?
1873835	1874115	Yes.
1874396	1876737	So, is this some type of, like, insider leak?
1876758	1878379	Because they went on down to the date.
1878839	1880381	That's something else.
1880401	1882042	Well, I think they're guessing on the date.
1882102	1885725	They're saying, you know, it makes sense because it's ten years from the original, so...
1887166	1888788	Okay, fair enough.
1888948	1889528	Let's see here.
1889608	1895754	I'm going to just pull this up here real quick because sometimes dates don't necessarily jive.
1896615	1898256	The 15th would be a Tuesday.
1899117	1900278	That is a release date.
1900318	1904562	That's usually the typical release date for a lot of these games nowadays.
1905082	1908925	Which is great because they're finally getting along lines with the movie industry.
1909046	1910727	They all release them on the same date.
1911628	1912389	Not if you're Nintendo.
1912409	1913970	You sometimes do Sundays if you're Nintendo.
1914450	1918071	They've been doing less Sundays than they have in the past.
1919171	1921512	But yeah, Nintendo, they have to be special.
1922532	1931734	I gotta admit, this news isn't totally surprising because I think Microsoft kind of teased this idea when they shut down Halo 2 that, well, you never know, these games might come back.
1931834	1934135	So this news isn't totally surprising.
1934875	1942401	But, you know, I think a lot of us thought, oh, it would be an Xbox Live Arcade game, or they're not going to go back and redo the whole damn thing.
1942982	1944923	I mean, Halo is a pretty good looking game anyway.
1945024	1947946	Well, they never said it wasn't going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
1950031	1950532	Good point.
1950972	1951994	I guess anything's possible there.
1952014	1955778	But if they do all this Kinect stuff, I think they're going to release it as a retail.
1955939	1956780	It's going to be retail.
1956800	1958201	They can charge $60 for it.
1958342	1959063	Exactly.
1960344	1960605	Go ahead.
1961626	1965491	It just seems weird to me that we're already going to see a trend of remaking games that...
1965851	1966772	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1980988	1981629	A little bit.
1981789	1983430	I mean, it's not terrible.
1983750	1986152	But we're already seeing this on the PlayStation 3 a lot.
1986452	1990115	I mean, it's just like all of a sudden they're like, oh, hey, got a work collection sold well.
1990355	1991696	Let's remake everything.
1991736	1994778	Let's just update everything and port it onto the PS3.
1995098	1999041	Because none of that PS2 backwards compatibility is coming anytime soon.
1999602	2000682	Or so we think.
2000843	2005186	And then all of a sudden, boom, look, now you can play those games that you just bought on the...
2006667	2009009	I don't mind a lot of the remakes, actually.
2009169	2012032	A lot of them are pretty good, and they bring some bonus stuff to the table.
2012052	2013153	I know that might sound really weird.
2013393	2015315	Like, the Hollywood remakes I could do without.
2015375	2016196	Most of those are poop.
2016576	2018157	But, like, for instance, Square Enix.
2018217	2022041	We have a story later in the show about Final Fantasy IV coming on the PSP.
2022061	2022822	It looks badass.
2022962	2024143	I can't wait to get it.
2024403	2026805	I mean, granted, that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy games they ever made.
2026865	2031990	But, I mean, those Final Fantasy remakes in general, 1 and 2 on the PSP, and then the ones on the DS...
2032290	2034051	We're all awesome, and all of them are worth having.
2034071	2035733	Isn't that stuff kind of a head-scratcher, too?
2035773	2044099	Because, you know, for the longest time on the PSP, and granted, there's a Kingdom Hearts game here and there and stuff like that, but there isn't really a lot of games I'm really interested in.
2044139	2050004	Also, it's like, oh, by the way, now we're going to put out Final Fantasy IV and the After Years on the PSP.
2050044	2051245	It's like, whoa, hey, that's pretty cool.
2051265	2052766	You know, I've got to pick up that.
2052926	2056068	Oh, hey, Earth Defense Force 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.
2056108	2057570	But, you know, eventually it'll come out over here.
2057850	2058750	Hey, that's pretty cool.
2058851	2060892	And then there was one other one.
2060932	2061893	I can't remember what it was, so...
2062133	2071200	But, like, I mean, you know, there's, uh, third birthday, you know, new, uh, Dissida game, um, and it's just a lot of cool stuff coming out.
2072088	2073089	Anyhow, go ahead.
2096028	2096589	which is cool.
2096649	2097470	I love Mega Man 2.
2097510	2114691	It's one of my favorite Mega Mans I ever did and it's really just the NES version but the way they market it on the marketplace and I should have known this because it's just a port of the PlayStation 1 version but it's really just the NES game on the PS1 with some fancy menus and I think the Pocket Station game is in there too.
2115191	2117252	PSP has that too when you play a PS1 game on PSP
2144582	2145523	Exactly, same feature.
2146023	2148305	But yeah, they didn't bother to translate the manual either.
2148485	2149986	So it's just Japanese, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese.
2150166	2151787	Great if you speak Japanese, I don't.
2151947	2153668	Way to go, Capcom, you suck.
2154089	2154669	So anyway.
2154689	2157151	Let's look for Roku instead of Mega.
2157511	2167057	Well, it's just, you know, whereas I support this whole Japanese release of games, I mean, I understand if they don't have the manpower to go in and translate the original ROM.
2167117	2168118	That is a little bit of work.
2168138	2172101	What they need to do is they need to give it the same treatment that they would as the Asian regions.
2172341	2172941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2193756	2195217	That takes like one person to do that.
2195337	2197719	I mean, seriously, you don't even need to translate the stuff.
2197739	2201822	You just kind of figure it out, write it down, create a graphic, boom, done.
2202082	2202263	What?
2202723	2204444	That's maybe a day's worth of work.
2204664	2207827	Oh, but that's way too much for Capcom.
2208087	2210369	They're too busy implementing DRM and shit.
2210549	2211890	So, whatever.
2213482	2213722	All right.
2214523	2218165	Somehow we got way off base of the original Halo Connect thing.
2218746	2225890	But as you were talking about with Mega Man stuff, and I made the comment that was pretty funny before the show, and you said say before the show, so I'll just repeat it on the show.
2225990	2226170	Sure.
2226471	2236838	We were talking about rehashes and stuff, and I was bitching about the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition, basically a port of a Super Nintendo game onto the Wii.
2237978	2238879	And hey, guess what?
2238899	2243122	They could have charged $8 for it on Virtual Console, but no, they're going to make it.
2243822	2244803	pay $30 for it.
2244863	2252569	It's basically like Nintendo taking a giant shit in your mouth and of course all the fans will eagerly gobble it up because it's Nintendo.
2253510	2255992	And shit in your mouth now also available in teal blue.
2256373	2257894	So you have that option as well.
2260219	2266423	Look at some comments from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I'm having to scroll back here a little bit because they said these a while ago.
2266503	2273407	But DarkTetsuya says, See, I had a feeling Microsoft would remake the older games since the Xbox originals can't connect to live anymore.
2273747	2275068	Kind of the same thing I was thinking with Halo 2.
2275808	2277489	But Halo 1 didn't have multiplayer.
2277509	2278750	I don't know if you guys remember that.
2279090	2280991	It had, excuse me, it didn't have Xbox Live.
2281412	2282793	It had, like, LAN support.
2283493	2286295	The first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception.
2286635	2287175	True story.
2287496	2290778	And they had a LAN thing all set up with the original Halo.
2291138	2291718	It was neat.
2292719	2301965	And then Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I'm a Halo fan, but jeesh, unless it's continuing the storyline, not doing the stupid past, but I'm not into this crap anymore.
2302265	2303166	Well, technically...
2303786	2303986	I guess.
2304006	2304487	Halo 1.
2314471	2321515	Because Halo 1 lacked Xbox Live, I can see where they want to do this again.
2321715	2326937	And they can kind of get away with it because it would be bringing something new to the table that the original Halo didn't have.
2327258	2327678	You know what I mean?
2327698	2331940	You know, maybe while they're at it, instead of straight porting it over, maybe they can tweak a few things.
2332240	2333121	Add some maps.
2333361	2335202	Throw the Halo 2 maps in there.
2336403	2338946	They need to add in red versus blue mode.
2339126	2341970	They're not going to add any Halo 2 maps in there because you know why?
2342210	2344053	Because they're going to release Halo 2 in HD.
2345314	2348759	Well then charge 1600 Microsoft points for it or something.
2349039	2350681	I mean, I know, wishful thinking, right?
2350741	2351222	But who knows.
2352343	2352584	Anyhow.
2353544	2355325	All right, let's move on to some other stories.
2355545	2359006	And yeah, this is kind of along those same lines about rehashes and so forth.
2359666	2360307	Although not really.
2360367	2361247	This is more of a dud.
2361307	2363508	This is about a game coming out on the 3DS.
2364268	2368769	New Super Mario Brothers was somewhat announced for the 3DS.
2368849	2369770	I mean, come on, people.
2369990	2372270	Of course, there's going to be a Mario game on the 3DS.
2372671	2379373	But it's nice to hear a little bit of a confirmation that it is being worked on because that tells you this game is probably coming out a little sooner rather than later.
2379873	2388235	In fact, in my mind, this kind of says it's probably one of their E3 games this year, because you know they've got to unveil some big things on the 3DS this year.
2388915	2389155	Anyhow.
2389255	2391695	Come on, come up with a new damn game.
2391855	2396556	I understand, ooh, it's New Super Mario Brothers, and we're porting it through all the different systems.
2396616	2398177	Well... Come up with a new game.
2398477	2400957	Don't call it, first off, don't call it New Super Mario Brothers.
2401017	2402998	That's a stupid name for a game.
2403018	2404878	Well, that, okay, where to begin?
2405158	2407359	First, that's not, you know, they haven't confirmed that that's a name.
2407399	2408479	Let me tell you what's been said.
2408959	2409459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2425832	2429576	Probably at least in the top ten games on those respective consoles.
2429856	2430817	Easily, if not the top five.
2430837	2433981	Okay, and so that gives them an excuse to come up with crappy names for their games.
2434001	2435282	That's awesome.
2435602	2437224	Super take a dump, you know.
2437384	2439927	It's the Zelda sequel.
2439987	2441588	So your problem is the name.
2441649	2442950	I don't want to see that in 3D.
2443530	2445633	My problem is the name of the game.
2445693	2446313	It's just like...
2447194	2448515	New Super Mario Bros.
2448655	2448996	Wow!
2449276	2451278	Thank you for putting all that effort in there.
2451498	2453400	What are we going to call this New Super Mario Bros.
2453420	2453560	game?
2453740	2454541	That's genius!
2454601	2458764	Well, now calling it Luigi's Mansion didn't really work out for them.
2459085	2460826	Well, that was a different game entirely.
2461447	2462788	Come up with something new.
2463548	2468853	Stop porting shit over because you have casual people and playing these systems and stuff.
2468873	2470254	They had Super Princess Peach.
2470294	2471716	I don't think that did so hot either.
2472497	2478526	That's because Princess Peach can't hold her own fucking game unless it was cooking or doing makeup or something.
2478667	2479628	Wow.
2479668	2480810	DarkSakura, rebuttal?
2482451	2483612	She's doing her nails.
2483752	2485694	Dude, it's Princess Peach.
2485734	2487255	Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you doing your nails.
2487275	2488797	I was actually cutting out a very painful hangnail.
2489137	2489517	Oh, okay.
2490138	2491539	But I have something sharp in my hand.
2492940	2493901	And this is home turf.
2494982	2496483	Dude, it's Princess Peach, though.
2496563	2500686	It's not like we're fucking talking about, like, Lara Croft or some shit like that.
2501047	2503549	It's Princess Prissy Peach, okay?
2503569	2503649	Okay.
2503849	2505250	Hey, I love Princess Peach.
2505290	2505810	Shut your mouth.
2506770	2510592	The special abilities are her fucking emotions.
2510912	2512152	I'm anger now!
2512453	2513513	Ooh, I'm happy!
2513673	2515774	I used to joke in Mario Bros.
2515794	2518995	2 that when she floated in her pink dress it's because she had gas.
2519315	2522117	Fucking bipolar Princess Peach.
2522297	2525098	I will take you on in Super Smash Bros.
2525238	2526898	and I will whoop your ass with Peach.
2527359	2527979	She's awesome.
2528319	2528779	No, no, no.
2528839	2530540	It's all about Zelda in chic mode.
2531346	2531766	Ah, yes.
2532567	2533367	Zelda is pretty awesome.
2533447	2535668	Zelda cosplaying as a gay man.
2536169	2540091	Can I read the damn quote that led us to this whole thing in the first place?
2540111	2542912	What are we talking about again?
2542952	2543072	Halo.
2543092	2544593	That's right.
2544893	2546274	Yes, Halo on the 3DS.
2546374	2546754	Excellent.
2546814	2547615	Alright, look.
2548135	2553277	Miyamoto says, yes, so in the interest of adopting a new technology for the Super Mario Bros.
2553317	2555998	tradition, I am now making a new Super Mario Bros.
2556038	2557919	game for the Nintendo 3DS system.
2557959	2562360	By the way, this is out of a Q&A from Iwata on Nintendo's site.
2563261	2565501	Iwata says, the next stage for the Super Mario Bros.
2565582	2568243	Preservation Society's activities is the Nintendo 3DS.
2568663	2571584	Miyamoto, yes, laughs because he's thinking about money.
2571604	2571904	Yeah.
2572637	2576720	Miyamoto then stripped naked and landed in a kiddie pool of money and just cried and laughed and screamed.
2576740	2579482	I will bet you $50 is gonna be fucking New Super Mario Bros.
2579762	2579942	3D.
2579982	2581763	That is gonna be the fucking title of the game.
2582364	2583524	Seriously, that is gonna be it.
2584905	2585846	New Super Mario Bros.
2586126	2586346	3D.
2586867	2587287	That's it.
2587407	2588067	There's the title.
2588247	2588688	You mad?
2589408	2589648	Alright.
2590029	2593451	I'm just saying... Can I finish the quote?
2593671	2594532	Can I finish?
2595012	2595652	Can I finish?
2595752	2596433	Fine, go ahead.
2597836	2601100	I want to show everyone as soon as possible what the new Super Mario Bros.
2601140	2612915	will be like on the Nintendo 3DS I'm finished I'm just saying I want to show you what it's going to be like Turn on the Wii Turn on the DS Done
2617116	2624360	But by the way, the fact that he says as soon as possible, do you think that expo in June in LA will be the place to see it?
2624740	2626421	You know what as soon as possible is?
2626581	2628903	That's Nintendo time we're talking here, okay?
2629203	2633045	Soon as possible means we're going to announce it as soon as possible, but it may not come out for a couple years.
2634659	2641983	It all depends on how quickly they can port Mario 64 3D.
2642503	2649726	Alpha Cananogram in our chatroom says, I remember Miyamoto saying he wanted to remake Super Mario World, I think.
2650267	2651387	I like Super Mario World.
2651407	2654709	That was like one of the greatest video games ever made was the original Mario World.
2655009	2658411	By the way, the new album art kind of pays homage to that, actually.
2659211	2660051	Kind of funny how that works.
2661332	2663294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2680113	2681813	How about something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo?
2681933	2682494	How about it?
2682574	2683534	It does have to do with Nintendo.
2683574	2684314	God damn it!
2684834	2685414	But not really.
2685574	2686935	Well, it's on the 3DS.
2686995	2687675	I'll leave it that way.
2688475	2691816	Reimaginings for Pac-Man and Galaga on the 3DS.
2692296	2696036	We will have Pac-Man Tilt and Galaga 3D Impact.
2696917	2702018	And they are in the same pack, which is Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions that are going to be out on the 3DS.
2703938	2708059	Pac-Man Tilt sort of is a gyroscope type game, so he's in Rainbowland.
2709220	2710201	Loki paused the game.
2710221	2711081	I'm waiting.
2712242	2717847	With championship edition style and it's just very tilty.
2717887	2720068	You have to watch out because you may injure yourself.
2721229	2723051	I do not like tilty games for the record.
2723151	2726514	I don't want to do that on the subway because I'll hit someone.
2726774	2731798	I love this picture, by the way, of the guy moving the 3DS around and moving it above his head.
2731818	2733099	There's a little picture there.
2733399	2734480	Oh, Loki, did you have a comment?
2735521	2736962	I was just going to say that, I mean...
2739162	2743547	I know Pac-Man is your staple franchise, Namco.
2745269	2748193	It's just like Konami trying to shove fucking Frogger down our throats.
2748613	2751977	Seriously, I don't give a shit about Pac-Man anymore.
2752117	2753980	I think a lot of people don't give a shit about Pac-Man.
2754320	2756262	No, no, no, hold on.
2756282	2756503	Stop.
2756743	2757023	Stop.
2757324	2757644	Shut up.
2757864	2758465	Okay, stop it.
2758685	2759066	Real quick.
2760270	2763252	Granted, Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty awesome.
2763552	2765754	Because it is like the original Pac-Man.
2766034	2767956	I don't give a shit about Tilty Pac-Man.
2768156	2770377	I don't give a shit about Pac-Man in a go-kart.
2770518	2772319	I don't give a shit about Pac-Man at a party.
2772679	2774681	I don't give a shit about multiplayer Pac-Man.
2775441	2778503	I mean, it's just... Pac-Man's cool.
2779044	2782606	If you want to port it 8 billion times like you've already done, fine.
2782907	2785909	You know, because people just need to own Pac-Man again, but...
2788197	2789157	Pac-Man was great.
2789177	2790377	Can I finish my story, please?
2790417	2794298	My sensibilities are being offended.
2813516	2814217	Yes, DarkSakura.
2814257	2815398	I'm going to finish my story now, please.
2815559	2815859	Go ahead.
2817261	2818803	And besides that, pack picks did kind of suck.
2819924	2820665	Seriously.
2821286	2821867	Terrible.
2823348	2826933	Galaga is going to be completely reimagined as a rail shooter, by the way.
2828402	2830383	I don't know how I feel about that.
2831224	2833345	The thought that I might enjoy it makes me feel a little dirty.
2833465	2834045	I'd look at that.
2834185	2834805	I'd check that out.
2835526	2839008	You'd hit that.
2839048	2842610	Let's do a Space Invaders rail shooter in the Time Crisis engine.
2843690	2846051	Since we're aborting on all these franchises.
2846472	2850754	Hey, because Yars Revenge is going to be awesome as a rail shooter with anime chicks.
2855096	2855857	I think I'm done.
2856983	2860064	No interest in the Battle Royale game, that new arcade table?
2860144	2861144	That looks kind of cool.
2861364	2861944	No interest?
2862284	2863324	No, it's stupid.
2863344	2867625	I mean, because if you play that game with one person, you're playing the original Pac-Man.
2869786	2873306	Well, maybe you... Loki, maybe you need to evaluate.
2873346	2874647	Why don't I have any friends?
2875007	2876927	Could it be... Oh, I'm sorry.
2877127	2879668	I don't have any friends because I don't want to play multiplayer Pac-Man with them?
2879948	2880988	Well, those aren't friends I want.
2884717	2887882	Why won't you play multiplayer Pac-Man with me, man?
2887962	2888783	What's wrong?
2888843	2890145	Why won't you play with me?
2890205	2892027	Because you never let me be Pinky.
2893269	2894851	Because you like crappy games.
2897214	2900179	No, it's... Seriously, though, I mean... I...
2901454	2907917	I had to laugh though with just that arcade cabinet because it's so expensive and it's meant to look like a cocktail cabinet.
2908498	2910799	Like people still remember what cocktail cabinets are.
2910999	2917342	Especially kids nowadays don't know what the fuck a cocktail cabinet is and that shit's gonna get broken so fast.
2917603	2921345	And really, I don't see a big draw to...
2922165	2937635	Pac-Man in the arcade people don't go to the fucking arcades to play Pac-Man they can play Pac-Man on everything because Namco's hoarded out to everything including Google exactly so why do I need to go to the arcade to play Pac-Man when I can play it anywhere
2938945	2941987	So how does Ultracade manage to make any money then?
2942027	2947471	Because it seems like they've done a great job by cashing in on the... There's always someone on the damn Ultracade machine at Dave & Buster's.
2947611	2947831	Always.
2948111	2948311	Easy.
2948632	2950993	Because their cabinets are cheap to reproduce.
2951153	2952774	Basically, it's a cheap monitor.
2952834	2956016	They have a cheap computer inside there that's running on an arcade board.
2956036	2957017	They license everything.
2957598	2961240	And it gives a good option for arcade owners because you have multiple games in one...
2961660	2964442	Small Cabinet instead of having a full arcade full of games.
2964542	2969305	It's basically drop it in and you make money because everybody has a game that they like on there.
2970586	2971646	And you can kick the machine.
2971766	2972187	It's fun.
2975369	2975829	Moving on.
2978013	2981697	and Alpha Cananogram says, how much is that Battle Royale cabinet?
2982077	2986061	I don't remember the exact cost, but I believe it's like $5,000, which is ridiculous.
2986121	2990084	And it's only because there's a stupid touchscreen, you know, HDTV in there.
2990225	2992687	And honestly, the game sounds pretty.
2995071	2996072	Great, you know what?
2996272	3003217	They should just port it to the Microsoft Surface because that just has no software for it.
3003257	3004418	I remember those.
3004658	3005379	That was fun.
3005419	3009322	That was at PAX that one year in that hotel that we weren't even staying at.
3010943	3014585	Sony's Move server is coming to PC It may be revealed at a Game Developers Conference
3035721	3042672	Move Server is a software development kit for porting Move controls over to the PC.
3049554	3050715	Neat idea, I guess.
3051816	3064104	They already have kind of Move-type controllers anyways for the PC, but I guess if you really want to find another use for your Move controller, then you can go ahead and use it on your PC.
3064164	3071069	I'd imagine, though, you would need a Bluetooth adapter and, well, obviously, the stuff for the Move, the camera and everything.
3073371	3078835	Obviously, no software supports it yet, but it's set to be announced possibly on March 2nd.
3079426	3084030	Am I the only one that doesn't really understand the need for the Kinect and the Move stuff on the PC?
3084290	3091016	I don't know about you guys, but my PC is in my bedroom, and it's kind of in a space where I don't really want to move around.
3091136	3098403	That's my place to get fat, is I sit my butt in that chair, and I have my feet up on the desk, and I'm playing World of Warcraft.
3098463	3099964	Click, click, click, click, click.
3100405	3103187	I don't play Kinect in my bedroom at the PC.
3103207	3104308	Who would do that?
3105849	3108370	Um, well... Maybe a paraplegic.
3108551	3114694	The Kinect, I mean, I think is gonna entice people more to hook it up to the PC because of all the cool, neat things you can do with it.
3115134	3116755	The Move is really just another controller.
3116935	3117635	It's like the Wii.
3117795	3121377	And honestly, the Move wasn't that exciting when it came out on the PlayStation 3.
3121757	3129982	I mean, it's a decent controller, but it... And I know that they're really pushing hard for it to be like a first-person shooter and a hardcore accessory...
3131102	3158298	but honestly the hardcore players out there they see right through this shit and they're not going to just go buy their stupid looking machine gun looking thing to plug this thing into just because it's supposed to it doesn't make you more accurate in these first person shooter games it's just kind of weird but I don't think that you're going to see a lot of super innovative stuff with this I mean the same type of stuff that you would see with this you can do already on the Wii Remote with a Bluetooth adapter so um
3161286	3163031	I don't know, I'm just kind of scratching my head with it.
3163111	3164374	But hey, whatever, you know.
3165658	3167403	They can go, hey, look, we're on PC too.
3167583	3167804	Yay.
3169341	3179148	I just kind of saw this as trying to beat Microsoft to the punch in kind of officially supporting the... Because they clearly, Sony sees, oh, people want to have these motion controllers on their PCs.
3179168	3184352	That's awesome, but the thing is, though, is it... I mean, what are you going to be able to do with it?
3184392	3186213	That's my thing, is what are you going to be able to do with it?
3186554	3194460	I mean, the controller, it's pretty accurate and stuff, but it doesn't do all the cool, nifty, like, you know, 3D scan stuff that you can do with the Kinect.
3195360	3196941	It's just, you know, good.
3197181	3200042	Now I have the Vision Camera support or whatever.
3200502	3202682	Or not the Vision Camera, the PlayStation Eye.
3202702	3205343	You know, big deal.
3205423	3207644	Now I can have a webcam.
3208504	3210645	I mean, it's just, I don't.
3211837	3212337	I don't see the point.
3212677	3213878	I would be kind of curious though.
3213918	3216119	I don't know if you actually need the eye camera.
3216139	3221102	I wonder if you can just use normal web cameras to kind of ask like the eye.
3221122	3221822	That would be kind of neat.
3222002	3222822	See if you could do that.
3223343	3225424	But I don't know.
3225464	3225804	Whatever.
3226284	3228045	I guess it's good that they have another option.
3228345	3232487	I just don't see a lot of, you know, unless it's other than indie games and stuff like that.
3232747	3236229	I don't see a lot of people like adding support for this for their games.
3236349	3237790	I just don't think that's going to happen.
3239531	3246832	Again, if you have to buy all this other stuff to make it work, like the Bluetooth adapter or whatever, well, I guess computers haven't built in these days, right?
3246852	3248013	A lot of computers haven't.
3248133	3250293	I mean, laptops and stuff haven't built in.
3250513	3254574	Not so much actual PCs and stuff like that.
3254874	3256094	But, I mean, that stuff's cheap.
3256854	3258975	It's not too expensive to add a Bluetooth adapter.
3258995	3263035	And if you're really interested in this stuff, and hey, you may have one for a headset or something like that.
3263155	3265076	So, great, but...
3266036	3266356	I don't know.
3266376	3271200	I guess it's neat to have the option, but I just don't see a lot of people using this.
3271280	3274121	I think that the Kinect is going to be a lot more popular when it comes to this stuff.
3274582	3277584	I mean, you'll see a lot of cool move hacks and stuff.
3277644	3280306	Granted, they could have come up with... I mean, it's Bluetooth.
3280346	3289412	They could have come up with custom drivers and stuff for the move controllers and everything, but you don't see anyone doing that because no one cares.
3290412	3294015	It's just like, I don't think anyone's going to really care when this comes out for PC.
3296236	3300918	All right, well, let's move on since Loki is such a fan of Nintendo tonight.
3300958	3302638	I just have to get his opinion on this story.
3303398	3308320	One of the big games that Nintendo was hawking at last year's E3 was Zelda Skyward Sword.
3308840	3317263	Well, it looks like that they might be kind of pushing that game again at the Expo this year because it looks like Skyward Sword is going to be a little while before it comes out.
3317323	3319264	It's clearly the first quarter of the year.
3319404	3320124	It's not happening.
3320584	3335854	Second quarter of the year is looking a little grim because they have said that The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has been in the process of being remade for Nintendo 3DS and this Nintendo 3DS version is expected to hit the market earlier than Skyward Sword.
3336154	3340436	And that's what Satoru Iwata says in a recent financial report piece.
3340456	3341437	Come on, folks.
3341497	3342638	I mean, remade.
3343018	3345760	All they're doing is just porting the assets to the fucking 3DS.
3345800	3346480	That's all they're doing.
3346920	3347621	Ooh, remade.
3347981	3352104	I thought at one point Nintendo was touting how easy it was to port games over the 3DS.
3352245	3354787	Anything with the Z-axis.
3355267	3363394	It's just all it is is just some core engine stuff that they're rebuilding and then all the assets and stuff they're just porting on over.
3363454	3366236	I don't think that they're really up-resing a lot of the stuff that's on there.
3366696	3372221	They're just kind of straight porting it over and then tweaking the engine a little bit to have it all run in.
3373883	3375945	The Skyward Sword stuff, I'm not surprised.
3375965	3379568	I mean, look at how long Metroid Other M was delayed.
3379628	3383692	I mean, it was just kind of getting pushed back and back and back for a while.
3384193	3385554	And same with a lot of the other games.
3385594	3388337	And I would not be surprised if something like this doesn't come out.
3390139	3391640	I mean, because a lot of times I think that they're...
3392970	3396031	They promise a lot of games that come out, and then they just don't have them.
3396131	3397572	And so they're like, okay, well, crap.
3397612	3400813	What's it going to be our holiday game or something like that?
3400873	3403854	And then it'll get pushed to November or something like that.
3405475	3407195	Because really, they haven't announced a lot of stuff.
3407215	3408436	I mean, sure, there's going to be stuff at E3, but...
3411997	3412377	I don't know.
3412758	3415319	It's just they're going to be looking for that big holiday title.
3415759	3417080	Sell more systems for the Wii.
3417220	3419061	That's kind of my thought too.
3419242	3424625	They say in this that Miyamoto's team is entering the final completion stage of the Wii title, whatever that means.
3425045	3431729	But this kind of makes me think that maybe part of the reason for this delay is so that they have something to show on the Wii this year at that big expo.
3432029	3432610	You know what I mean?
3432670	3437673	Like maybe there's not a lot else scheduled to be coming out on the Wii.
3437713	3438633	Maybe Just Dance 3?
3438694	3439014	I don't know.
3439194	3440475	No, I mean...
3441295	3447158	I think some things I could see them doing, like New Super Mario Bros.
3447579	3460706	2, I could see them doing something like that, just because they already have the engine built, and it's basically just building new levels for it, maybe tweaking and adding some new things on their new abilities or some shit like that, and everyone will go buck wild over it.
3461866	3466189	They've been promising Pikmin forever, so they'll make me a new Pikmin game, but honestly...
3467765	3470207	I mean, I just can't get too excited about Pikmin, I'm sorry.
3471068	3474950	I mean, I think this year is going to be a lot of 3DS games.
3476291	3477172	Of course.
3477472	3490843	You're going to see a lot of stuff that they've already announced that's not coming out, like the Kid Icarus game again is going to be another focus of E3 because it's probably going to be their... I'd be willing to bet that's one of their holiday titles for the 3DS.
3490863	3490963	Yeah.
3494750	3496430	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3519981	3521483	I have a problem with mobile gaming.
3521503	3527490	He has a problem with how cheap mobile games are, like for iPhone and this type of app games.
3528091	3537702	It's basically quoted saying that one of the biggest risks in the industry is inexpensive games that are disposable from a consumer standpoint.
3538903	3567451	as in oh crap 99 cents I'm fine with it I'm done with it and basically it removes the idea of you know value from the game because now you're so saturated with things that are so cheap that you expect everything to be so cheap what an amazing fucking metaphor for the state of games on the Wii yeah I mean here's the problem irony much you know the problem with that thought though is that what if those cheap games are really good
3568646	3569787	Well, see, that's what he said.
3569807	3571068	Well, now that's not possible.
3571108	3574610	He used Angry Birds as an example of the diamond in the rough.
3575491	3581315	Every so often you come up with something that's exceptional, but for the most part, they're all just cookie cutter crap.
3582088	3583129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3599069	3600110	Wow!
3600190	3602152	People are selling games and making money.
3602432	3603913	Why didn't I think of that?
3604373	3605014	Wow!
3605274	3611739	Why isn't my $20 copy of Let's Go Cook Some Shit in my kitchen not selling well?
3612379	3612559	Why?
3612739	3614601	What, people don't like math tutor games?
3614941	3616202	What's wrong with them?
3617043	3618544	Why isn't this selling?
3618764	3619404	I mean, come on.
3619445	3624488	Because Nintendo has to put forward this illusion of quality with things that they put out.
3624528	3625469	And yeah, I agree.
3625929	3626790	A lot of it's crap.
3627030	3627531	However...
3628891	3632152	They do have their corporate image to uphold.
3632472	3634393	It's part of who they are, part of their branding.
3634533	3639954	They stopped caring about quality when that fucking seal left their goddamn boxes.
3640395	3641855	And you know how many years ago that was?
3642455	3643435	A long time ago.
3643856	3644736	They don't give a shit.
3644796	3646997	It's all about what will people want to buy?
3649048	3650431	What can we make them want to buy?
3650712	3651734	Oh, hey!
3652215	3655222	Let's port some GameCube games over and add Wii controls to them.
3655502	3657747	For the record, I do see people buying that shit.
3658627	3659107	Exactly.
3659408	3660108	They're making money.
3660489	3660949	Exactly.
3660969	3661710	They're making money.
3661930	3667154	Then why are they bitching about somebody using a different business strategy to make money?
3668095	3669656	Because they didn't think of it first.
3669816	3685589	They didn't think of it first and because it's competing with their market and now they're saying, well, how do we justify these games that are possibly crap like this for $20 when these people are selling something similar that may be better than our product for $1?
3686710	3687170	They can't.
3688471	3696273	You know, I got to say, though, to some extent, I think he has a point because a lot of the mobile games on the iOS system are pieces of shit.
3696293	3698294	Like a lot of them are truly terrible games.
3698714	3699574	Yeah.
3700534	3708497	A friend of mine once said that trying to find a good app game at that price point is like trying to get honest nutrition from a vending machine.
3709997	3712158	More often than not, you're getting a melted Snickers.
3714082	3715503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3734338	3735518	Hence like Steam sales.
3736178	3737419	That's another big thing.
3737679	3739599	I get great games for $4 or $10.
3740339	3745981	I find it hard to excuse the fact that people are saying, well, there's a lot of crappy games out there on the iOS store.
3746041	3746821	Yes, there are.
3747161	3747681	And you know what?
3747701	3753663	If you do some research and before you purchase your games, you don't have to buy all those crappy games.
3753783	3756083	Same with the more expensive games.
3756103	3758544	If you do your research, you don't have to buy the expensive games.
3758684	3763785	But at the same time, he's basically saying, well, these games are cheap and there's no good cheap games out there.
3764085	3764505	That's not true.
3764525	3774487	The difference being is that... In the case of some of these games that are on there for dirt cheap, they're made by a couple of guys who are just hanging out and like, oh, let's put a buck on it.
3774527	3776467	We have to put something on it, so let's do a dollar.
3777007	3777967	They just do it for fun.
3778468	3779688	You know, those little games come out.
3779708	3781088	Sometimes there'll be a company behind it.
3781128	3785009	With most of Nintendo's stuff, you're looking at basically developers.
3785429	3788889	People who have to pay employees to develop this.
3789089	3790230	You know, bigger companies.
3790250	3792130	You're dealing with a corporate structure.
3793050	3800719	The other thing to look at, too, is that, you know, yeah, they have the DSiWare, but most of their games are still physical games.
3800739	3802081	You have to pay for materials.
3802101	3803122	You have to pay for packaging.
3804284	3807447	There's a designer that goes into designing the box.
3807808	3809410	You've got someone doing the manual.
3809450	3811773	You have a technical writer writing everything that goes in the manual.
3812133	3813274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3830822	3831483	But I'm a consumer.
3831503	3832583	I don't give a crap about that.
3832723	3833304	And that's the thing.
3834144	3841490	If they have this option to release a game for $10 instead of, say, $30 just because they can avoid all those costs, why don't they do that?
3841610	3844952	Because if they market it well enough, they will have no problem selling that.
3845052	3851277	I guarantee if there's a good game that came on DSiWare, there's blogs that cover that shit every week of what comes out.
3851597	3852779	People will be aware of it.
3852839	3853600	People will buy it.
3853700	3854160	And that's it.
3854541	3856002	Same with Xbox Live Arcade.
3856022	3857444	There's tons of stuff that's $10, $20.
3857764	3859987	There's great games.
3860327	3869939	For the most part, if they put out something that's going to be half the price to market and they raise the price of it $10, chances are they're actually going to end up making more money that way.
3871653	3872614	Here's a question.
3873715	3877518	You bring up a good point about really everything that goes into making a video game.
3877578	3886805	But as the industry kind of moves towards this digital distribution thing, I think as a whole, I think in the next generation of consoles, you're going to see more direct downloads of games.
3887425	3892029	Hence why we see GameStop starting to already come up with their plan B, so to speak.
3892630	3894291	Shouldn't these people in the middle kind of be worried?
3894807	3897128	Well, no, I see things definitely going that way.
3897668	3906692	But for right now, with what they have now, I think that, and keep in mind Nintendo, for all the innovations that they like to bring in, they are very reluctant to change.
3906872	3908213	How long do they stick with a cartridge?
3909173	3909693	I mean, really?
3910694	3917437	They do have that reluctance to embrace something new as far as marketing and distribution strategy is concerned.
3918577	3926845	But, I think that, you know, they're probably going to be another 10 years late like they were before, but they're going to eventually catch up to it.
3927246	3929468	Right now, that's not in the way that they operate.
3929488	3930729	That's not in how they do business.
3931330	3934293	And they can't really see anything outside of their own box.
3935454	3939057	They may think that they're innovating in the way games are played and the way things are doing.
3939077	3939878	They're looking at...
3940999	3945640	The way we can innovate what we have now within this little cube.
3946340	3948081	Not meaning to bring up the GameCube, of course.
3948921	3956803	But they've always been about their own proprietary hardware and their own proprietary way of delivering the games.
3957663	3959684	They've been about doing things the Nintendo way.
3960924	3964825	And if you look over the course of the years, their business model really hasn't changed.
3965862	3994297	there hasn't been any real change in their strategy they've still kept things they want tight control over everything they want things to be to the Nintendo standard even if the game is suck all of the releasing of that game is done to Nintendo standard so I think it's also another way that they you know I mentioned their branding before I think it's actually a way that they protect their corporate identity too is by having such tight control over how everything goes out unfortunately that's money out of their pocket
3996385	3997185	That's the way it goes.
3997366	4006631	They can't see outside of their own business model to see a way that another business model could work for them.
4006731	4007451	They're afraid to change.
4007671	4008532	They're afraid to take a risk.
4009428	4033043	I kind of agree and I don't want to go too far off track but you know companies afraid to take risks that's something we've covered before and that is why Konami is not making the most profitable guitar game although they could have they could have wanted to take some risks they had it they had it in I had it in my hand all right anyhow let's move on we got to travel the world and talk about release dates of games that are coming out very soon let's start in the US Loki
4034085	4039749	This week, taking some serious risks on Nintendo Wii, Mario Sports Mix.
4039809	4044392	It's a sports game with Mario and other people and some Square Enix characters as well.
4047014	4048074	People love their Mario games.
4048695	4049895	Brain and Body Connection.
4050496	4053338	This is a game that's kind of similar to the Brain Age game that was on the Wii.
4053878	4058281	That was on Xbox 360 supporting the Kinect, or I should say requiring the Kinect.
4059061	4063503	Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 this week.
4064263	4066724	Junior Brain Trainer 2 on Nintendo DS.
4068865	4069865	This is pretty awesome.
4070565	4076928	Finally making its comeback, You Don't Know Jack on DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
4077408	4078648	Oh my god, that's this week?
4078748	4079549	That's this week.
4079709	4080869	Holy crap, yay!
4081409	4082750	Is there like a demo or anything for this?
4083010	4083971	I don't know if there's a demo.
4084011	4086193	Actually, I heard there's probably a video on some website.
4086313	4090596	But I've heard if you pre-order it, it's $30 and it's going to be like $40 after pre-orders.
4091676	4092316	Something like that.
4092837	4093397	I don't think so.
4094137	4095999	That's just what someone said on the message board.
4096559	4098340	They dropped the price on it.
4098980	4101302	They probably told people to make some more pre-orders.
4102582	4105324	Trinity, Souls of Zillow on PlayStation 3.
4105404	4109146	That's from... Looks like a Tecmo.
4111908	4112028	Um...
4114789	4117111	and Zuzu Princess.
4117411	4118272	Yay!
4118312	4119153	Another hamster game.
4119833	4126238	And then about a week from today, Dragon Quest 6.
4126638	4129960	Yeah, Dragon Quest 6, Realms of Revelation.
4131762	4133423	Realms of Revelancy.
4134284	4137086	Sorry, can I look at this preview real quick for You Don't Know Jack here in studio?
4137246	4140548	I just kind of want to check this out because I used to love this game so much.
4141009	4142009	Back in 2012, you see.
4144878	4147823	Wow, that's an old logo.
4147843	4148363	Jellyvision.
4148584	4148924	Yay.
4151894	4152995	You Don't Know Jack!
4153175	4155437	The trivia party video game is back!
4155657	4160640	And all new for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC!
4160940	4162561	Everybody's favorites are still there!
4162742	4166664	Twisted trivia questions, the dis or dat, screw your neighbor, and the jack attack!
4166764	4170727	Plus all new face-melting features and surprises, including online play!
4170907	4178853	From socialism to social networks, from bigamy to Bigfoot, from war games to drinking games, it's... You Don't Know Jack!
4181124	4181885	Yeah, I gotta buy it.
4182705	4183065	Damn it.
4183886	4185827	I'm trying to save money, but I need this.
4186368	4186788	I need it.
4189410	4191511	Will your liver explode if you don't have that, Rob?
4191711	4192192	Possibly.
4193152	4194513	My spleen will be painin'.
4194853	4195814	It's only 30 bucks, though.
4195914	4196354	That's not that bad.
4196374	4197315	Does it make your liver quiver?
4197775	4198576	It's only 30 bucks.
4198936	4199997	You heard the man.
4200277	4201238	Does it make your heart fart?
4201258	4203919	It's half the price of what I paid for that crappy Tron game.
4205961	4207222	Anyhow, anything else this week, Logie?
4208377	4213281	All right, let's move over to Japan and talk about what is coming out over there in Japan this week.
4213882	4218266	On the 8th of February, the Asia regions are getting Test Drive Unlimited 2.
4218706	4220668	Sometimes the Asia dates sneak their way onto my list.
4221048	4228495	But on the 10th of February, actually in Japan this week, Entakuno Saito, Students of Round, comes out this week.
4228975	4230477	I'm not sure what that is.
4231497	4233499	It's an RPG game on the Xbox 360.
4234800	4237081	Uh, looks like, um, kind of neat.
4237101	4244922	Looks like you can have, like, a party of six people, and you can kind of use your, uh, D-pad to use, like, you know, attacks or spells or items.
4245063	4248083	This looks like it might be very old-school, uh, RPG.
4248123	4250744	It doesn't look like it has kind of all the newfangled stuff in it, so.
4251604	4255445	Uh, it's called Entaku no Saito, Students of Round, is what it's called, Loki.
4256245	4257385	Students of Round.
4257485	4257685	Yes.
4258186	4259686	That's Summoned in Final Fantasy VII.
4260366	4264389	Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare finally makes its way to Japan this week as well.
4264489	4268031	So if you are in Japan and you like yourself some Red Dead Redemption, check it out.
4268471	4270172	PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
4270232	4273915	LittleBigPlanet 2 finally makes it your way as well as Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare.
4274295	4280098	And Sengoku Musou 3Z comes out in a regular and like a special limited edition.
4280238	4285282	So if you are a fan of these games, this is the third one in the series from Koei.
4286142	4288083	I think it's like a Dynasty Warriors-esque kind of game.
4288103	4289204	It's more Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
4289604	4290004	Oh, yes.
4291145	4293125	You can choose between all these different characters.
4293145	4294246	It looks like there's like 20 different characters.
4294266	4296547	Basically, if you see Sengoku in the name, that's what it is.
4297807	4298708	All right.
4298768	4300788	Moving on to some of the other consoles.
4300888	4307851	Going to the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Mosou 3, Moshuden, which means scaled-down version.
4308351	4311532	I just made that up, but seeing as it's on the Wii, it probably is a little bit different.
4311552	4312253	Something legend.
4313873	4314533	Side story.
4315354	4316034	That's Gaiden.
4317855	4321259	Nothing on the DS this week, obviously, because they're still warming up for the 3DS out there.
4321959	4332189	So the only other system that I would really mention is the PSP, which has Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 3 coming out this week from Bandai Namco.
4333430	4334150	So check that out.
4334871	4337473	Music Game Fans, DJ Max Portable 3 is out next week.
4338274	4339195	Thought I'd throw that out there.
4340293	4345057	This looks a little bit like that Final Fantasy Crisis Core, kind of, but a different set of characters.
4345557	4347359	This whole Tales of the World.
4348060	4352583	I wonder if that's the Tales of blank series, kind of on the PSP.
4354245	4354505	Don't know.
4354985	4355486	How about Europe?
4356427	4364954	Well, for Europe, we have on the 8th, EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius on PC, and Explodemon on PlayStation 3.
4369247	4377289	On the 11th, we have Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and Dr. Kawashima's Body and Brain Training on Xbox 360.
4377850	4388733	We also have Edna and Harvey the Breakout on PC, Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, and Trinity Zil-O-Zero for PS3 by Koei.
4389679	4389979	All right.
4390619	4392160	Just a couple more news stories for you guys.
4392180	4394541	Then we got the classic game of the week.
4395441	4396582	And it's a good one for episode 400.
4397082	4399143	People are going to be tingly in their special places.
4399343	4399823	I hope so.
4400083	4401964	Let's move on with a couple quick stories before that.
4402324	4407766	We talked last week about how Sony announced the PlayStation suite, which will bring PlayStation 1 emulation.
4408246	4410887	to the Android platform.
4411307	4424891	Well, there's rumors that they may be expanding the suite to cover other operating systems, including the iOS format, as well as Windows at a later date.
4425091	4429032	So it might be kind of cool to have an official PlayStation 1 emulator.
4429052	4433293	I can't imagine how that won't be cracked, but okay.
4433913	4437234	Actually, we have plenty of emulators out there now that I think of it.
4439335	4451219	They're even saying that it's possible that other Sony products like the Sony Internet TV powered by Google might also get some support for it.
4452300	4453700	That might be kind of neat, I guess.
4454700	4456941	Make some really cheap PlayStation 1 players, I guess.
4460082	4463464	Yeah, so they have a completely open stance to it, they say.
4466704	4467693	So that's pretty neat.
4468318	4469447	I can totally see him doing that.
4473968	4474809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4502990	4506153	Angry Birds is apparently making its way onto the 3DS.
4506854	4507294	That's right.
4508375	4515801	Rovio, who makes Angry Birds, they're trying to bring Angry Birds to just about every platform that's out there, and of course that would include the 3DS.
4516202	4526631	They spoke with 3DS Focus, and they are saying that they're going to bring out their games on the 3DS as download titles later this year, including Angry Birds Rio.
4527372	4527912	There you go.
4527972	4528893	So they're going to be in Rio.
4529833	4531374	Aw-inspiring 3D.
4532095	4534657	Angry Birds is also out for the PS3 and the PSP if you're curious.
4535117	4536117	Come on!
4536518	4539259	It's Angry Birds, a 2D game.
4540500	4541921	Does that really need to be in 3D?
4541941	4545083	Maybe you can be behind the bird while you shoot things.
4545163	4545623	I don't know.
4546784	4547445	That's dumb.
4548285	4548905	It is a little dumb.
4549686	4549986	Alright.
4551487	4557211	Let's get into a segment we like to do on the show here where we walk into the vault...
4558174	4558954	and pick a game.
4559014	4560855	It's the classic game of the week.
4561496	4567839	It's DarkSakura's opportunity to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be worshipping this game.
4568960	4569780	Or at least check it out.
4569860	4570841	It's the classic game of the week.
4571481	4573922	This is another game that we should introduce by menu, Rob.
4574843	4575323	I will try.
4575383	4576824	Not everybody's going to recognize it, you know.
4576924	4580445	I know, but the people who do will get special brownie points.
4580505	4580966	Here we go.
4581326	4586989	Let's fire it up here and look at some of the music or at least some of the ambience from this game.
4592939	4597240	Ah, memories.
4597260	4598380	Best mini music ever.
4600681	4601561	Yay.
4601681	4602862	Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?
4602882	4603282	I'm dying.
4603362	4604382	It's Beatmania!
4605242	4606002	Yay.
4606743	4609563	It is the game that started it all.
4610243	4612304	This gave us the whole Bimani thing.
4612384	4614745	This gave us Orange Lounge Radio.
4616565	4618106	G. Konami, what were you thinking?
4620106	4628614	But it started off in 1997 and really got big in 98.
4628975	4635741	I remember back in the day having the emulator BM-98 on my computer so I could play Beatmania stuff at home.
4636522	4638624	That was my first Beatmania experience with BM-98.
4640946	4652035	and from there we've had Beatmania 2DX, we've had Beatmania 3, we've had DDR, Parapara, Dance Maniacs, so many, so many.
4653036	4655899	But let's go ahead and focus on the original Beatmania.
4655959	4660422	You had five keys and a turntable and everybody was right side pride.
4661924	4662644	Back in the day.
4664346	4672593	And so basically the little platforms would scroll down on your screen and you had to hit the corresponding button or scratch at the right time.
4673054	4674455	Or a combination of buttons.
4675055	4681942	With a very interesting kind of low quality video playing in the background that was typically just repeated scenes over and over again.
4682522	4683943	It was the PlayStation 1 after all.
4684304	4686305	Well I'm talking about the arcade one too, shoot.
4686526	4686786	Yeah.
4687836	4691257	But yeah, we had... It came out on the PlayStation.
4691497	4694737	They had the really nice controller and the dinky controller.
4694777	4697478	And I started off with the dinky controller and then bought a nice controller.
4698538	4700659	And we had all kinds of versions.
4701439	4708400	But we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about Beatmania's second mix in Beatmania, which was the first one that came out on the PlayStation.
4709100	4711841	We had practice mode, where you could practice...
4712401	4715663	Free Mode, and Expert, Expert Plus, and Easy.
4715783	4717504	That was actually available in third mix.
4718445	4720186	Expert Plus was offered in sixth mix.
4721026	4732413	And, of course, Boss Battle, where you would... That was just so much fun, watching the... Actually, you'd also have your tutorial mode, too, where they would tell you how to play.
4732473	4733514	Beatmania 3 had that, too.
4733554	4738297	Beatmania 3 had an effector pedal, which I don't think I played a single song on that game that actually used the pedal.
4738917	4741098	But it did also have the effector sliders, which was really neat.
4742639	4771234	and the cabinets were there was a standard cabinet and a mini cabinet the standard I'm sure is the one that most everyone's seen which is the 29 inch screen the mini cabinet had the 20 inch screen and basically I think one was space saver and the other but the mini cabinet they didn't get too many released in the US if you can find an American Beatmania that's made of the mini cabinet probably kind of worth some money I think
4771994	4776735	However, you can go buy, you know, old Beat Mania machines for like, what, 300 bucks at Metreon?
4777436	4777936	Seriously.
4779816	4797982	But I remember back in the day when we would get new Bitmoney games and would trek across California to, you know, go to Milpitas or Sunnyvale or I remember going for a DDR, for when DDR Max came out, going to San Diego and looking for one there while I was already there.
4798963	4802866	But yeah, we've got also all kinds of different versions that have come out.
4802906	4809652	We've had Beatmania, actually the US Beatmania, which is actually Beatmania 2DX.
4810212	4820221	The 7 key with the switchable turntable had a Beatmania mode in it, which basically is just 5 key, but I'm not going to pick on that.
4820801	4825926	There were versions for the Game Boy Color and the Wonderswan Color, which we knew somebody who had that.
4827369	4828790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4847377	4849958	and Konami Ho Konami.
4850678	4853879	They were kind of late to jump on the Beatmania bandwagon in the U.S.
4854439	4855780	They didn't listen to their fans.
4856260	4862621	Well, a couple of them listened to their fans, but nobody listened to them for quite a while until they were like, oh, I see you're importing it.
4862641	4863482	Let's bring it out.
4863722	4865562	Gee, DDR is suddenly selling over there.
4865582	4866923	Maybe we should have got on that a while ago.
4866943	4867043	Yeah.
4868724	4875109	The first official Beatmania game in the US, you guys, was a port of 2DX Nights Tile.
4875489	4875990	Sorta.
4876630	4879092	It kind of used that interface and had a mishmash of games.
4879113	4880954	No, we actually had Hip Hop Mania.
4881535	4883937	Oh yeah, the crappy, I don't even acknowledge that in the arcades.
4883957	4885118	But it is Beatmania.
4885158	4886479	Yeah, it's true, it's true.
4886839	4890622	And it came out relatively early enough, and we had one of those at our VGL.
4892910	4897832	And it was... Let me just go back into the list of the games.
4897932	4899873	And keep in mind, I probably have most of these.
4899933	4901854	I remember when I went hunting down a Club Mix.
4902354	4905016	Because that, in my opinion, is the best.
4905196	4906556	Can you play Salamander Bee Crush Mix?
4906676	4909878	Yeah, I can play Salamander Bee Crush Mix.
4909898	4910158	Hold on.
4910178	4911298	I didn't see which one you were playing.
4911558	4912479	Oh, you were playing Overdoser?
4912739	4913719	No, you had some video of it.
4914740	4914840	Oh.
4916877	4917957	Let me actually do this video.
4917997	4919718	The only cool part of this one is the beginning of it.
4919878	4921579	I don't think this is somebody filming their TV.
4921619	4923599	I think this is actual... Oh, they are filming their TV.
4924039	4926620	Oh, well.
4927901	4928861	Oh, there's this one, actually.
4928921	4930662	This is an actual... There we go.
4930702	4931662	Yeah, that...
4940120	4958679	which really only at the beginning sounds like salamander music right but I mean they did have all kinds of remixes from their you know old games in that too but here's all the different versions um as far as arcade releases we had Deep Mania, Deep Mania second mix, third mix, complete mix which was Hip Hop Mania over here we got that as Hip Hop Mania
4959680	4964121	We had 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, Time To Get Down, which actually had a lot of good music.
4964482	4965302	There was Complete Mix 2.
4965382	4966662	No, take that back.
4966722	4967622	That was the one that we had.
4968283	4970623	Because it had 321 Stars in it, remember?
4971244	4972344	Anyway.
4972424	4977625	Club Mix, Beatmania featuring Dreams Come True, which was a little J-pop band back then.
4978386	4979486	Beatmania Core Remix.
4979706	4982507	There was 6th Mix, UK Underground Music.
4982707	4986048	7th Mix, Keepin' Evolution, and Beatmania The Final.
4986668	5002377	And in Korea, there was BeatStage, BeatStage 3rd Mix, BeatStage Complete Mix, BeatStage 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, How To Get Down And in North America, we had Hip Hop Maniac Complete Mix and Complete Mix 2 On the PlayStation, I'm gonna read them all It's episode 400 and I can't
5003757	5025090	Beatmania, Beatmania Append, the Ebisu Mix, which I have, Third Mix Mini, the Append Third, these are all Appends, which basically, if you had the first game, you bought the Appends and you'd swap them, which made it a pain in the ass if you were on an American system trying to get them to play and having to do the disc swaps and all this crap, which I found my way around.
5025430	5027111	You get a little thing that plugs into the back.
5028072	5036439	There was GoToMix, 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Best Hits, Dreams Come True, GoToMix 2, Glowing Global, which was actually pretty cool.
5038521	5040963	Club Mix, The Sound of Tokyo, which was also fun.
5041343	5043344	6th Mix, and Beatmania Europe.
5044025	5049529	For Game Boy Colors, Beatmania GB, GB2 Gotcha Mix, and GB2 Gotcha Mix 2.
5050730	5069708	WonderSwan, there was Beatmania for WonderSwan, there was a bajillion Baymoni pockets which I was talking about little monochrome LCD screens and they were little but the fun thing about that is there was an anime song mix that was all stuff from anime by Go Nagai which is like Cutie Honey and Mazinger Z and you know
5071365	5098912	there was a Tokimeki Memorial version because you know Konami owns Tokimeki Memorial a bunch of anime, there was a Hello Kitty mix there was Enjoy Georgia's Signature there was Tiger's version, Kawaii version which means cute but it had to do with magazine Tokimeki 2, Love Stories, Konamix Best Hits 2000 and Tiger's version 2 which was for the Hanshin Tigers baseball team baseball's a big deal and that's it
5100496	5101298	Thank you for watching!
5114663	5137276	I just remember, and this is actually literally how I got into it, is probably February of 98, on, I think we were actually on the old Pentium 2, the overclocked 60 to 120 computer Dan had, and one of my friends saying, hey, there's this game out in Japan, but we can't get it, but here's an emulator.
5138437	5139017	And it was BM98.
5139037	5139157	Nice.
5139257	5140218	And then...
5143299	5146882	I need to download BM98 again.
5147222	5149244	Your classic game of the week.
5150084	5150745	Beatmania.
5151946	5157930	Available in the arcade or on many, many, many, many, many different home releases on the PlayStation.
5158150	5158871	Oh, love to be.
5159731	5160052	Oh yeah.
5161505	5166346	Alright, that does it for your Classic Game of the Week and it also brings Part A of the show to a close.
5166366	5167467	But don't go anywhere, guys.
5167867	5169487	In Part B tonight, we've got a lot.
5169627	5171208	It's probably going to be a very long Part B tonight.
5171228	5173949	We've got your Twitter topics, of which there's a lot to get to tonight.
5174009	5175209	So get your Twitter topics in.
5175749	5179010	We'll get those and we'll get the FUs of the week, of course.
5179070	5180911	The Skype line as well and...
5181371	5181791	You know what?
5181831	5182672	We figured it's episode 400.
5183153	5184314	We got a lot of people in the house.
5184894	5186155	Let's do a match game tonight.
5186295	5188057	Oh, well, our match game returns tonight.
5188557	5192301	And we actually have a legitimate prize to give away tonight.
5192701	5193862	So it's pretty cool.
5194142	5198246	So we're going to give that away when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5205194	5207575	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5207615	5215997	We are live on this Sunday evening, February the 6th of 2011 at allgames.com for our 400th episode of our show.
5216197	5217157	So welcome you guys.
5217697	5219938	And Loki is in the house.
5219978	5221498	He's playing Gal Gun tonight.
5221678	5225579	And he's been playing it pretty much during the entire show and he's not ranting about something Nintendo.
5225939	5227800	So Loki, what do you think so far?
5227860	5229900	Like right now he's in like a music room or something.
5229920	5231200	I don't know, shooting girls with love.
5231280	5231841	It's a weird game.
5231881	5232241	I don't know.
5232481	5233341	I don't really know what's good.
5233641	5243706	I don't really know what's going on, but I know that they have this focus mode where you're doing something to parts of girls, and then they orgasm, and it causes the other girls to orgasm, or whatever.
5243726	5244667	They faint with love.
5245227	5246167	It's an orgasm, okay?
5247208	5247448	Hot.
5247828	5249509	Infectious orgasm game.
5249909	5250610	It's strange.
5252310	5252631	Fun!
5252651	5257553	Yeah, I can see why they got rid of the panty shots, though, because it would have been porn, pretty much.
5258734	5261075	Now, we were talking earlier about one-handed games.
5261135	5262776	Do you think Galgun could be a one-handed game?
5262796	5262836	Uh...
5265461	5269120	with a special controller, maybe I mean, because you'd have to
5271327	5277030	It's hard because you have to aim with the left analog stick and then you have to shoot with the A button.
5277170	5283894	I was going to say, if it had an auto-fire, then yeah, because then you could just... Auto-fire maybe, and they have a zoom.
5284075	5295742	You could probably do it with some sort of special remappable nunchuck type controller or something where you have a shoot button as a trigger and maybe you could do a one-handed then, but no, it's not a one-handed game.
5297071	5301113	Alright, well... I love this new video capture card thing, it's awesome.
5301534	5308158	We're gonna get into some rapid fire news here in just a little bit, but first we'd like to do little plugs for our side projects, of which we have a couple of them.
5308458	5311740	DarkSakura does a comic book podcast every week with her pals.
5312113	5312593	Comic Insanity
5332401	5334042	When do we get an OLR app for Android?
5334182	5336284	When someone makes it for us.
5337144	5338665	Because I don't know how to do that crap.
5338705	5341267	I don't either, but you got it for Comic Insanity.
5341367	5342207	I didn't do it.
5342428	5344069	Okay, we need to talk to your peoples.
5345349	5347451	I'll have my people contact us people.
5347611	5348832	I don't know, would chatters like that?
5348852	5350873	I don't know, what would we do on an iPhone or Android?
5350893	5355296	Twitter and Facebook connection and links to the forums.
5355396	5358318	Maybe like exclusive content, like topless pictures of Shermie?
5359440	5360742	Jeremy's always topless.
5361283	5362124	She's such a whore.
5362825	5363586	I mean, not really.
5364127	5366290	If you don't know, by the way, Shermie is, of course, DarkSakura's cat.
5366831	5367953	She's very fat and sassy.
5368654	5369655	I got her to play this morning.
5370837	5371839	You got her to play what, WoW?
5372282	5374763	No, I dangled a string, and she's like, bat.
5375623	5376303	That was fun.
5376963	5377684	Good times.
5377844	5387366	My cats used to lose their mind over the laser pointer, and now the best that they'll do is if you wiggle the laser dot, they'll do the, with their arms, they're like, I'm gonna reach for it, but that's it.
5387386	5388827	I'm not chasing that shit anymore.
5388907	5389507	I'm too old.
5390147	5391247	So, bat, bat.
5391367	5393208	Did I tell you about when I got Shermie one of those?
5394088	5394929	She hated what she did.
5394969	5397931	No, she looked at the little dot and then she looked right up at the pointer.
5398731	5401133	Realized how it worked and didn't try anymore.
5404695	5405595	Shermie just don't care.
5406536	5407937	She's smart when she's trying to be lazy.
5408702	5437411	another spinoff show if you're a fan of World of Warcraft or even if you're not and you like really obscene chat join me and my pal Extifer for the best little horde house in Azeroth or horde house for short we're too poor for a website but you can find us on iTunes or whatever podcast engine you use just look for horde house H-O-R-D-E H-O-U-S-E by the way speaking of World of Warcraft I understand a lot of my guildies are listening at least that's what X-Link just told me so hi guild Grats on level 9
5438671	5439512	Why aren't you in chat?
5439652	5440432	Oh, Beijing, level 9.
5441913	5442974	Slash's Pop just perked up.
5442994	5443494	Whoa, hey.
5444155	5444695	Wow News.
5444895	5445736	Yes, they just hit level 9.
5446236	5449178	We were really close, and everybody's doing their alts right now, it looks like.
5449258	5451579	So you get lots of guild leveling from that.
5452199	5463026	All right, but we'll save the rest of the WoW chatter for the best little horde house in Azeroth, which usually releases Thursdays-ish, depending on our taping schedule, which is really erratic.
5463366	5466229	Although I will say this, Extover told me he loved the live show.
5466829	5469132	Loved the live show and kind of wants to do it again.
5469192	5471654	So you never know what might happen.
5471814	5474757	We might have to storm the OLR studios more than once a week.
5475270	5475510	All right.
5476431	5487101	Anyhow, let's move on to some rapid fire news and lots and lots of news that we just don't have time to talk a whole long time about because, you know, we've got to fit in Nintendo rants for Loki.
5487141	5487842	So, Loki.
5489043	5491986	Armored Core 5 was announced and it's kind of cool.
5492226	5493627	Well, it's been announced for a while.
5494048	5498292	But they announced that it's going to have team-based online multiplayer, which is pretty cool.
5498692	5500393	It's expected to come out over here.
5501874	5509317	I guess they're saying it's 2012 in North America and Europe and late 2011 in Japan.
5509898	5511218	But the game looks pretty awesome.
5511238	5518742	Kind of reminds me a little bit of the Crossing Chromehounds with the Armor Core 4, which is pretty cool.
5520815	5531140	Chromhounds had that cultish following to it, but unfortunately not a strong enough following to necessitate a second game, right?
5531480	5531780	Yeah.
5533201	5538783	It was kind of like their version of a North American armored core.
5538963	5539784	Just stick with armored core.
5540184	5542305	The problem with Chromhounds was that it was slow.
5544008	5564679	slow mechs, slow everything whereas Armored Corps is just kind of fast and fast paced, lots of missiles and yeah so that'll be kind of cool and expect that next year I guess Namco announced that yes, guess what, we're going to do another Ridge Racer this current generation not going to wait for another console to come out Ridge Racer!
5565339	5571962	Ridge Racer Unbounded and that's going to be on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC in 2012
5573303	5575825	The game had a little teaser trailer for it.
5575945	5581248	Of course, no actual gameplay, but it basically kind of resembles Burnout.
5581768	5588673	And it's actually being developed by Bugbear Entertainment, who of course put out the game flat out.
5588873	5592055	So they kind of know something about destructible racing games.
5592815	5595197	And I don't know, it looks kind of neat.
5596238	5596818	I like Burnout.
5597458	5598699	Ridge Race is kind of cool.
5600000	5601401	Ridge Racer drifting with Burnout.
5601758	5606924	Which of course, what story about Ridge Racer would be incomplete without It's Ridge Racer!
5608145	5609487	Ridge Racer!
5614632	5626915	And then this is not too unexpected, but Project Dark, which was a working title for, of course, this new game, Dark Souls, was announced in the latest Famitsu magazine.
5627375	5633736	It's basically going to be kind of a successor to Demon's Souls, but not in a way.
5635797	5637677	They're actually saying that they're making the game harder.
5638837	5642098	And they said, I guess...
5643218	5647961	Similar, it's going to be similar in style, but not necessarily a sequel to Demon's Souls.
5648322	5654686	And players will be able to create their own characters, though they're no longer, I guess, different job classes.
5654926	5657428	I guess just tweaks to the world design as well.
5657868	5661591	The world is no longer divided into levels, instead it's being one large area.
5662251	5664833	And there's going to be cooperative and competitive play as well.
5664853	5666114	Will it be as fucking hard?
5666174	5666694	Because oh my god.
5666714	5667435	It's going to be harder.
5667855	5668135	Oh god.
5668195	5668756	Oh god.
5671212	5672975	Seriously, Demon's Souls is awesome.
5673355	5676199	Couldn't tell you much about it, though, because I keep getting killed.
5677233	5677893	Horrifically.
5678774	5679834	Over and over again.
5680634	5682775	It's not a forgiving game.
5683696	5684176	Let's see.
5684276	5687297	What other cool tidbits did they have about it?
5688418	5699922	Of course, they said that the online system will be returning and it's been highly enhanced to allow users to share experience and they said grow together in the world.
5700402	5705564	Although I'm sure that means going to other people's games and trying to kill the other people like you could in the original.
5708426	5709527	That's my birthday.
5730325	5731445	Wow, that's right, it is.
5731545	5735046	So you're getting an awesome game as a present for your birthday from Squeenix.
5735967	5737067	It's going to retail for $30.
5737507	5745349	And of course, if you haven't heard, this is the original Final Fantasy 4 and the After Years, which came out originally on mobile gaming over in Japan and later on the Wii.
5745729	5749970	I played about, I don't know, half of it on the Wii, but there was a lot of download episodes you had to do.
5750331	5751371	And I beat like two of them.
5751691	5755252	But yeah, it'll be nice to have the entire collection on the PSP.
5755732	5770912	this story almost makes me a little sad because I have Final Fantasy 4 for the DS the 3D one that they did played the first hour of it gorgeous love it my favorite Final Fantasy and now it's like I feel that I shouldn't play that and finish that because this is coming out
5771172	5773074	Even though the art design is totally different.
5773174	5783502	You know, I really liked the 3D Final Fantasies, which is weird because I'm usually not into the 3D stuff, but I love the art style on the PSP ones.
5783963	5790588	It's just so sharp, and they've just retouched those sprites, and this is the same look that they gave Final Fantasy 1 and 2.
5791228	5794871	And apparently there's supposed to be new effects with the magic and everything, and there's some...
5795872	5809378	I know it's supposed to be rapid fire news, but let me see if I can do a quick, quick, quick shot of the trailer here, which was available somewhere.
5809398	5811699	Let me see if I can find it.
5812958	5815181	I might have to search YouTube for it, so maybe I'll show you later.
5815221	5816002	Remind me after the show.
5816482	5819286	Alright, let's move on though with other releases.
5819406	5822190	Tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad.
5822650	5825133	New school Tapper, not the old school Tapper.
5825514	5828137	Yep, that's right, it's a brand new Tapper game that's going to be coming out
5828878	5829639	Root Beer Tapper
5845040	5845520	DarkSakura.com
5872478	5874639	But when I heard about this, I was like, oh, yeah, another.
5874919	5877339	Yeah, this would be like Yara's Revenge turning into a first-person shooter.
5877359	5877859	That would be great.
5878139	5882201	But then I heard, like, Don Bluth doing all the art, and I'm like, oh, now it just went, like, 80s awesome again.
5882501	5886262	Yeah, to bring it back to Don Bluth, he did The Secret of NIMH movie.
5887222	5888002	And Xanadu.
5889042	5889522	Oh, God.
5889762	5893043	And All Dogs Go to Heaven, and I want to say Ferngully.
5893543	5894324	Was that him or no?
5894484	5895604	I think...
5896843	5897263	Perhaps?
5898024	5898384	IDK.
5898524	5899124	Anyway, that guy.
5899364	5899804	He's awesome.
5901145	5903746	Alright, moving on to a story about Castlevania.
5903826	5908928	You know, Castlevania Harmony of Despair is one of those games that's available on Xbox Live Arcade.
5909288	5914691	Well, there is a new stage that's available for 240 Microsoft points.
5915211	5917472	It's based on an original Famicom
5918072	5944527	Konami title, Getsu Fuma Den so there you go, 160 points if you want to actually play as the character Getsu Fuma it has 8-bit graphics though and I guess it's kind of old school sorry I didn't mean to do the loud but this is kind of what it looks like here in the game kind of neat those almost look like little Metroids that you're fighting there so there you go
5947799	5949542	That's coming out soon.
5951305	5951765	Moving on.
5952607	5954049	DarkSakura has some quick stories for us.
5954069	5956373	And then the Twitter topics is twitter.com slash OLR.
5957319	5960461	Well, we talked about Pac-Man in Part A. Ms.
5960501	5969485	Pac-Man is going to be coming out for iPad, and then there will be a free Valentine's Day update for Pac-Man on the iPhone.
5971046	5976249	It's more Namco love in the form of Pac-Man, so that's cute.
5977289	5982712	And then, this makes me happy, Puyo Puyo will be on Virtual Console in Japan, and it will have online multiplayer.
5983552	5986614	So, I guess Nintendo's sort of getting it, but not really.
5988075	5990037	Virtual Console and Online Multiplayer
6003113	6004775	You could play two people.
6005155	6007138	It was on the Sega Genesis, right?
6007298	6012626	I know, but Nintendo never adds anything to their games, so it must have been on the original.
6012646	6015970	They must have foreseen the internet long ago.
6016010	6019135	There were four-player versions, though, that came out on Nintendo 64 and Saturn.
6019460	6027963	I'm glad a landmark game such as Puyo Puyo... Yeah, it's like, Puyo Puyo is amazing, but of all the games, I don't understand.
6028743	6030063	But they like to keep us confused.
6030143	6040947	Maybe they're waiting to see how this does, and then they're going to go back and do everything else and re-release it for eight more dollars with online multiplayer and all that shit that we should have had the first time.
6041806	6042406	Right, DarkSakura?
6043206	6043427	Yes.
6044127	6045347	It's such a fun game.
6045527	6046268	Such a fun game.
6046868	6050289	And then, we have a little bit of something else.
6050409	6052550	We have Back to the Future on PS3.
6052570	6053470	It has a date.
6053990	6057551	It will be February 15th on the US PlayStation Network.
6058292	6063133	It will be $20, $19.99, and you get all five episodes on launch day.
6064354	6065894	The rest are going to be staggered, of course.
6067195	6067635	Pretty cool.
6067895	6068595	Good voice acting.
6069215	6070656	That dude sounds really dead on.
6071657	6072197	That's what I hear.
6072217	6074419	I watched an interview with him not too long ago.
6074459	6075039	It was pretty cool.
6075419	6075680	Awesome.
6076400	6076540	Yeah.
6076740	6077021	All right.
6077461	6078442	Let's get to the tweets.
6080043	6082525	Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
6082545	6083986	If you're not following us, why not?
6085171	6085411	All right.
6085972	6097179	We asked some questions earlier this week, kind of, you know, since we're coming up on our 400th episode, and, you know, lots of people are saying, yay, Gratz on 400, because I don't know what other video game podcasts that are weekly have gotten as high as 400.
6097679	6098180	I'm not sure.
6098220	6099661	If they're out there, I don't know of them.
6099681	6100401	You'll have to tell me.
6101182	6105184	So, you know, we're excited, and we have no plans to quit anytime soon, so who knows?
6105224	6105865	We might just make 500.
6106645	6106986	We'll see.
6107366	6111148	Anyhow, we were asking folks, what was your favorite moment of the past 400 episodes?
6111188	6112749	We asked that question on Twitter earlier this week.
6113070	6114791	The Seg said, when I was on the show.
6115691	6142508	of course, Deekman said Rob coming out to the OLR to go fans, I don't even remember that actually, I mean it had to happen at some point but I don't know, I was just kind of always the gay one, Rob boycotting the Xbox, I think that's when I got really mad at my Xbox, red ringing of death like three days after I bought it and then I think it red ringed again, I was really mad Loki's Mac rant that's like every week E3 2006 I think it was, my first show, sorry no dates
6143468	6145409	Alpha Cananagram says, one of them wasn't to go.
6145590	6146710	It's Pizza Man.
6146810	6147811	Do-do-do-do-do.
6148131	6148592	Remember that?
6149112	6149532	Good times.
6149572	6150873	That was one of the older shows.
6151574	6154696	Dark Tetsuya says, Karaoke Revolution, 69 and 120.
6155056	6156997	Those are the episodes number that's happening.
6157397	6161960	The April Fool's Day pre-show 2007 with the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show.
6162000	6162561	Remember that one?
6163201	6166363	And the death of the soundboard table in episode 307.
6166423	6169926	Remember when intern Drew knocked the whole damn table over?
6170426	6170686	Yes.
6170906	6171947	Yes, I remember that too.
6171967	6172588	That was awesome.
6173688	6199204	they've still never found his body then we asked what should happen in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio you know what should happen in the next 400 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio ZakuPilot256 said dance party come on that happens every week it's just after we've gone off the air KidmanProject says the inauguration of President Cat Blade3 says I want to see Rob get married and Jamie and Dan have a little demon baby that plays video games at age 1.5
6201511	6201992	It'll happen.
6202412	6204393	A demon baby will happen.
6206375	6209917	Actdeft says, what I hope happens is that you get to 1,000 episodes.
6210398	6212980	Congrats for making it this far and here's for 600 more.
6213680	6224929	But at 1,000, guys, it's seriously over because by the time we get to 1,000 episodes, let's see, if it took us almost 10 years to get to 400, we'll be getting close to like 45 by the time 1,000 comes out.
6225009	6225629	I mean, close to 50.
6226130	6226270	Yeah.
6227952	6232076	The holodeck ought to be out by then and then there's really no more need for OLR.
6234918	6236780	The OLR will cease to exist.
6236800	6239041	We won't be able to drag Rob out of the holodeck.
6239062	6239782	Exactly.
6240162	6241964	I'll be playing one-hand games in the holodeck.
6244997	6247099	What do you want to see in the next 400 episodes of OLR?
6247179	6250742	Alpha Cananigram says some on-air smack talk from Loki's kid.
6251563	6252063	It could happen.
6252103	6255106	If we go another 10 years, the kid could come in here and say something.
6255706	6256087	We'll see.
6256887	6257308	Let's see.
6258228	6259930	DarkTetsuya says three words.
6260370	6261611	Loki as Tingle.
6262532	6265193	or at very least the return of Rob's Mr. Spanky.
6266033	6268734	See, people wouldn't understand the Mr. Spanky joke anymore.
6269774	6274556	Mr. Spanky was really funny when he was a character in DDR.
6275096	6276176	But now it doesn't make sense.
6276356	6277437	We don't have the pictures anymore.
6277497	6280218	I feel like there needs to be a sock puppet to accompany that.
6280458	6281218	There kind of was.
6282018	6286220	You have to understand, DDR on the PC had downloadable characters.
6286260	6287280	It was kind of this neat thing.
6287680	6293362	and one of the characters was like this full-on bondage guy in outfits named Mr. Spanky.
6293882	6295663	And so I used to do an impersonation of Mr. Spanky on the show.
6295683	6297164	Like Voldo, basically, sounds like.
6297284	6297644	What's that?
6297824	6299745	Yeah, he was dressed like Voldo.
6300225	6301145	Yes, kind of.
6301485	6305967	But he was like Folsom Street Fair, big, burly, like, bear guy.
6306047	6307148	So, I don't know.
6307188	6309688	It's kind of like half Mexican wrestler, half pornography.
6309728	6310429	I don't know what to tell you.
6311369	6315792	RedTheHaze says, next 400 episodes?
6316293	6323538	Someone gets into a coma, Evil Twin steps in and steals the show, Robs then steps out of the shower, and it was all a dream.
6325659	6328321	It was all just a dream, just a horrible, horrible dream.
6330863	6337107	Actually, that tweet though makes me think that maybe I should give you guys a preview of the new theme song of OLR.
6340689	6341489	Let me load it here.
6341509	6342590	Let me see if I can get it.
6343050	6343550	Here we go.
6344090	6345611	So the new theme song for OLR.
6345651	6346071	Here you go.
6352834	6353094	Get it?
6353114	6354055	Because it was all a dream?
6354595	6355415	Get it, anyone?
6356876	6357356	We're old.
6357756	6359637	I thought that you were going to just put on the Daytona song.
6359657	6361218	Do you remember who shot JR?
6364939	6366520	Rob, do you remember who shot JR?
6367820	6368801	His sister.
6368921	6369061	Yep.
6370811	6371471	Who's his sister?
6371531	6372692	And who killed Laura Palmer?
6373613	6373873	I don't know.
6373893	6374574	I didn't watch Twin Peaks.
6374714	6376955	It was her dad possessed by Bob.
6377195	6377495	All right.
6378236	6379937	I just totally ruined Twin Peaks for all of you.
6379997	6380878	Actually, no, it's a great show.
6380958	6382459	I knew that going into watching Twin Peaks.
6383119	6385741	And by the way, both those shows, like 10, 20 years old.
6386061	6388343	No, like Twin Peaks is like fucking 20 years old at this point.
6388383	6391125	So like if you didn't already know, like I'm not going to save you from spoilers.
6391725	6392445	All right.
6392746	6393486	Moving on.
6395147	6395527	Let's see.
6395608	6396548	Let's get to some tweets.
6397109	6398149	Oh, back to the Twitter music.
6398990	6400571	Some like tweets for topics tonight.
6401271	6407856	Hatch71 tweeted us and says, Can't wait to hear the discussion on Sony's continued persecution of the hacking community.
6408417	6409718	I like the way he phrased that there.
6410098	6411299	The persecution.
6411939	6413400	Yeah, it gets worse, actually.
6413701	6413901	Really?
6413941	6415222	Do we have a story on it coming up later?
6415722	6416803	No, but I have one.
6416823	6418164	You want to sum it up for us?
6418564	6421746	Yes, they are actually now trying to go after everybody.
6422647	6423027	Literally.
6424348	6426730	Let's see here.
6427831	6428852	Find the exact one here.
6429472	6430353	Sony is looking for you.
6430373	6436397	It says apparently over at the website, PSX Scene, the latest court documents, because they've been putting up all the court documents, kind of like WikiLeaks.
6437678	6438898	They're pretty much going after everyone.
6438918	6455950	They're planning to subpoena several sites, including PSX Scene, YouTube, Twitter, PayPal, and Slashdot, in order to attempt to locate the whereabouts of Team Failoverflow and other hackers like Kakaroto, Wanekoko, and Graf Chocolo, Hermes, and Camus.
6456030	6459012	Those are a lot of the guys behind some of the custom firmwares and stuff.
6460273	6469518	They can go after them all they want, but the thing is, a lot of these guys aren't even from the US, and the DMCA does not apply to them.
6472480	6483446	And on top of all that stuff, too, if this court case comes out where this guy finds it okay to be able to jailbreak PS3s or whatever, then this isn't going to matter anyway.
6483908	6485089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6505635	6507556	I didn't mean to download the Kesha.
6507636	6510357	It just infected my computer.
6510777	6520241	I think I slept with someone and suddenly I got a Kesha infection.
6520281	6521181	That sounds like a disease.
6522041	6522601	I'm sorry.
6523842	6526343	I caught Kesha.
6526423	6527343	Here's something better.
6527763	6531325	If you want to follow up with that Sony is hunting everybody down.
6533394	6535816	Linux has been brought back to firmware 3.41.
6536317	6539099	Nothing public yet, but they've brought it back.
6539520	6545506	And not only is it brought back, but now it has full access to all the resources of the PlayStation 3.
6545886	6549410	So it's Linux better, I guess.
6549750	6551071	It's Super Linux!
6551612	6552533	Linux evolved.
6552633	6553614	Linux evolved.
6554595	6555355	It knows!
6559482	6562225	Big thanks to all the people that are tweeting about our 400th episode.
6562265	6562906	Really appreciate it.
6562926	6566529	There's a lot of you guys on Twitter that are like, yay, 400, episode 400, and so forth.
6566829	6570593	And I love all the pictures that they have of a giant enemy crab.
6571293	6571914	Wait, what?
6572414	6573615	Oh, for the Sony stories.
6573675	6574136	I was like, what?
6574356	6576298	I didn't get any giant enemy crabs on Twitter.
6576638	6576818	No.
6577879	6580882	MadCatz is making a replacement fight stick panel for Mortal Kombat
6593334	6595696	This is a tweet from our pal TigerClaw who always promotes our show.
6595716	6596296	We appreciate him.
6596917	6605784	He says, or I'm sorry, this story says that there is a Mortal Kombat Tournament Edition arcade stick, but I guess it has kind of like a unique layout to it.
6606244	6614491	So MadCatz came out and says there's going to be a replacement panel for the current Tournament Edition fight sticks that will let you have the arcade perfect controls.
6614891	6615452	Here's the deal.
6615532	6619355	Remember, like Street Fighter has like six buttons, but Mortal Kombat has like...
6619815	6623100	Well, it also has six if you count the run button, but they're in like a different arrangement.
6623140	6623721	It's like an X.
6624968	6626069	It's all pump-it-up style.
6626149	6627850	High-low punch, high-low kick.
6627870	6628310	Exactly.
6628330	6629271	And block is in the middle.
6629311	6632993	It kind of makes an X. And then run is kind of like awkwardly off to the side.
6633533	6634914	So there you go.
6634954	6635534	So that's kind of cool.
6635554	6636635	They're making a new overlay for that.
6636655	6637555	That's kind of awesome, actually.
6638416	6638656	All right.
6639116	6644479	And Sterlok is sending us a tweet about what we can do in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
6644859	6646340	Just keep doing what you're doing.
6646760	6648841	The show just keeps getting better and better.
6649342	6651503	Here's to another 400 episodes of awesome.
6652343	6653204	Oh, you guys are awesome.
6654996	6658477	SJ100Matt says, we need t-shirts within the next 400 episodes.
6658537	6659318	We probably do.
6663899	6666520	Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, except I have to point this out.
6667041	6670122	SalaciousPop, you know how I told you the guildies were listening to tonight's show?
6671122	6675484	Yeah, I just got a text there from one of our guildies there, Spike.
6676004	6677424	Raging at Kesha hate.
6682401	6685103	Which, by the way, have you seen that toy that they sell in Targets?
6685163	6689785	This little, uh, dancing little, uh, like a Valentine's Day doll that you can give somebody?
6690105	6698050	Speaking of which... Almost sounds like the real thing.
6698470	6700131	Look at that.
6701271	6702012	Alright, moving on.
6703288	6704609	How about some actual gaming news?
6704649	6705669	Back to more video games.
6723760	6733503	You may remember back Final Fight Double Impact where there was kind of this unannounced DRM in place.
6733883	6738724	Basically, you had to be connected to the internet in order to play the game.
6739365	6743166	So if you downloaded it and say you want to play it offline or if your internet cut out...
6744466	6745087	That sucks.
6745147	6748629	And then, of course, Capcom apologized for it and stuff.
6749110	6751872	But really what they were apologizing for is that they didn't tell you about it up front.
6751932	6755275	Because Bionic Commander 2 Rearmed has the same DRM in place.
6755355	6758017	You have to be connected to the internet in order to play this game.
6758577	6762641	They've done that because they don't want people sharing the game.
6762861	6768966	Apparently there is a way you can share the game up to five times by recovering your accounts and stuff like that.
6769646	6798972	and um so people buy a copy and then they share it with you know four other friends and stuff um and so now they have a note on the game listing it says note you must log into the PlayStation Network each time you play the game uh it says while Final Fight Double Impact um I guess they had like a online co-op mode Rearmed does not have an online co-op mode or an online mode at all it's an offline game so it's just kind of a dick move if you ask me
6800293	6803054	Well, distributing their game is also a dick move.
6803074	6804134	Yeah, but you know what, though?
6804174	6806575	The thing is, this is pissing a lot of people off.
6808636	6816959	Some people may not care about it and will purchase the game, but some people actually are just not purchasing the game regardless of they didn't even care about sharing the game.
6816979	6818579	Does the Xbox One have the same requirement?
6818699	6819320	I don't think they do.
6819660	6820160	Interesting.
6820700	6822200	You know, I could see where people would be mad.
6822220	6823921	Probably because you can't share the game back and forth.
6824101	6828782	Because what if, like, you have to, you know, what if your PS3 isn't hooked up to go online?
6828822	6830882	But then I think, well, you've got to go online to get the game.
6831462	6834163	So I guess not having an internet connection.
6834183	6836523	Well, okay, let's play Devil's Advocate here.
6836583	6840064	Say you take your PS3 to a friend's house and say, oh, I really want this game.
6840144	6845265	You go to their friend's house, hook it up to their internet connection, download the game, and then you take it home and you're like, crap, can't play it.
6846415	6867488	I realize things are different now but like I know back in the day like especially with the Dreamcast I used to have to run a gigantic cord across the entire house and hook it into my Dreamcast if I wanted to play so you know it wasn't always online and I think some people are still kind of doing that with PS3 even though it has built-in Wi-Fi just some people in some places are a little bit behind the times you know it happens
6868308	6871291	Especially if you're on Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi can be sketchy sometimes.
6871631	6871872	True.
6872032	6873293	You get drops every now and then.
6874394	6878498	Have they said what happens if you start up the game and then your Wi-Fi just cuts out?
6878538	6880981	Because I've had problems with my internet connection in the past.
6881001	6881902	I think you get kicked out of the game.
6881982	6886266	Oh my gosh, that's just like the Ubisoft one that they got torn a new one over.
6886286	6886626	Yeah.
6887647	6899316	This is Capcom, the new face of Capcom They do cool shit and then they start copying games and doing DRM schemes It's like, who are you, Capcom?
6900477	6902619	Seriously I don't even know you anymore
6904079	6906340	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6925228	6926189	Why aren't they getting in?
6944548	6952294	E3 Expo 2011 show management has placed caps on this year's media badge assignments due to the tremendous number of requests for media badges, etc.
6952694	6963083	We require that sites be fully launched, operational for six months, and that the website receives a minimum of 8,000 monthly unique impressions as a baseline for each media badge issued.
6963683	6970125	Quantcast.com, for example, currently has your site listed at approximately 10,000 monthly uniques for the month of December 2010.
6971326	6976867	Based on the above, we can approve two media badges for site that provided this info at this time.
6977347	6977788	Wait a second.
6977928	6980288	For every 8,000, though, but they only have 10,000.
6980368	6981429	That's not 16,000.
6982409	6987711	So maybe they're being nice or maybe they hit the cap for one and then I don't know.
6988291	6991293	So, but there's a lot of people out there that are really upset about this.
6991393	6998778	And, you know, to be honest, if OLR wanted to go, we probably wouldn't be able to under these conditions because I looked up our site on one of these.
6998838	7003281	I think we have like 800 hits or something, but that's like really wrong.
7003541	7005542	Like, I don't know what these sites use to measure.
7005723	7007344	Maybe you know more about this stuff, Salacious Pop.
7007364	7014228	Some of them, some of the websites that you do the tracking, you actually have to put an embed code or whatever, some sort of code that's in your webpages.
7014248	7014488	Ridiculous.
7015629	7016830	So, yeah, I mean, come on.
7016930	7019132	Our podcast gets downloaded more than that.
7019873	7021835	Plus, we're a podcast.
7022775	7034305	We don't have really a website that caters to... I mean, there's people that work very hard on our website, but mostly the website is a place for our show to be delivered.
7034366	7039630	And occasionally a little story that kind of kicks it back to old school LR about old school songs or whatever.
7040010	7040051	So...
7041952	7044814	These sites would not measure our download shows.
7044874	7046796	Now, granted, I haven't asked for an E3 pass.
7046956	7049958	I haven't had an official rejection, so it's hard to say.
7050819	7054101	I almost wonder if maybe I should register as broadcast media if I want to go.
7054562	7062047	But at the same time, seriously, all the other indie shows I know are getting told no, or they're getting one badge.
7062487	7067111	And I'm kind of like, well, if no one's freaking going to E3 this year, then fuck it.
7067191	7068452	I'll read about it on the internet.
7069052	7072455	Part of the fun of going to E3 is getting to see everybody.
7072495	7079340	Seriously, it was fun going to E3, but honestly, last year, I didn't miss it.
7079500	7082203	I watched all the press conferences, which is great.
7082363	7083664	I got to watch the press conferences.
7083704	7088427	That's better than going to E3 because I didn't get to watch the press conferences when I went to E3.
7088948	7093812	I didn't get invited to the press conferences, so you had to watch them streamed.
7093892	7095513	Honestly, streaming was great.
7095973	7096694	I got to watch that.
7096954	7100296	I got all the coverage I possibly wanted to, you know, absorb in there.
7100536	7101917	Didn't have to wait in lines for games.
7102477	7103878	Granted, yeah, I didn't get to play demos.
7103918	7105679	I didn't get to try out the 3DS and stuff.
7105739	7108080	But, eh, whatever.
7108220	7109540	You know, I don't really care.
7109941	7111962	There's two ways you can kind of look at this.
7112142	7117144	And one is that, you know, the big sites are getting bigger and the small sites are getting smaller.
7117264	7124568	Like, how are independents and startups supposed to compete if E3's not going to let them in because they're not already a big site?
7124628	7125669	I mean, this is just letting...
7126489	7133731	OneUp and IGN have more quote-unquote exclusives to mix in with the stories they copy from small sites.
7134091	7134832	Let's be real.
7135132	7136892	Where do they get their information?
7137272	7143754	They either get granted exclusives because they're big sites or they scour the internet up and down and get them from the little sites.
7144474	7149996	We know because we've had stories taken from our site and put on these sites before, oftentimes without credit.
7151454	7153519	I'm just saying, how did they get to be so big?
7153739	7157768	You know, because they have all that type of manpower, etc., etc., corporate funding, blah, blah, blah.
7158589	7160213	So on that end, it's kind of bullshit.
7161089	7165312	But on the other hand, I understand why E3 kind of needs to clamp down.
7165432	7168754	Because there are a lot of people getting in that probably shouldn't be getting in.
7168834	7170516	Especially as media.
7171116	7182024	I was going to say, yeah, but there's a lot of sales associates and stuff like that over at retail stores and stuff like that that are getting in that maybe don't really necessarily need to be there.
7182464	7184205	But, I don't know.
7184245	7185666	At the same time, it's just like...
7186807	7188128	But where do you draw the line?
7188348	7189268	Where do you draw the line?
7189469	7195972	I think if you meet the qualifications of having the business license and everything like that, you've obviously established yourself as a legitimate thing.
7195992	7197713	You should at least get one or two.
7198393	7208919	But I understand if Joe's PodunkGameBlog.com tries to get 20 badges, I get why that's a problem, especially with these stories about people are selling their badges and everything.
7209299	7212181	Way to go, few bad apples for ruining the barrel for the rest of us.
7213001	7217526	Truth be told, if you really wanted to go to E3, this goes to anybody.
7217566	7219888	If you really wanted to go to E3, you could still.
7220249	7221109	You know how you have to do it?
7221170	7223152	You pay $400 and you just get one of the badges.
7223472	7226855	It's not really an advertised thing, but you can totally go on there.
7226955	7228697	And they say like industry or whatever.
7228757	7230219	You could say you're a student or whatever.
7231160	7234223	If you're willing to throw $400 at them, they're going to let you in.
7235956	7236636	Why wouldn't they?
7237236	7237856	You know what I mean?
7237936	7244598	So again, despite the traffic our site gets, if I really wanted to go, I could pay $400 and go.
7246598	7255360	And honestly, media badges, even if you have a media badge and you're not an IGN or 1UP or something like that, you're just going to get treated like shit.
7256340	7258821	Seriously, they're like, oh, who are you?
7259121	7259821	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
7259941	7261021	We're not giving you an interview.
7261401	7265442	You may get a few scheduled meetings with some of the
7266242	7284291	I think the largest ones we got into like Sony, Bethesda and stuff like that but you know Sony Online not Sony Computer Entertainment but like they really don't give a shit about most of the press especially unless you're a big site because that's where the traffic is
7285348	7292475	You won't be invited to the closed door presentation where they're only allowing 10 people to see Cooking Mama 5, Gladiator Axe Battle.
7293036	7295938	You know, so you don't get those hush-hush meetings.
7296939	7298841	By the way, there's another problem I have with this.
7300803	7309867	I kind of think it's a little bit, I mean, the way they're measuring is also kind of the part that peeves me a little bit because it's really unfair to podcasters and so forth.
7309927	7314609	And plus, like I said, that website tells you we get 800 hits, unique hits.
7315189	7319691	I could whip up stats that tell you the number is much higher, like astoundingly higher.
7319731	7322812	And look, I'm not trying to have an EP conversation here or what have you.
7323032	7324813	I just, I have facts to back it up.
7325393	7334101	We have the number to get everybody in this room into E3 if they would take our stats, which are, I believe, more accurately measured than any of this stuff.
7334661	7336363	But, you know, whatever.
7337844	7343209	Anyhow, so this isn't a me, me, poor me, because if this is the way it is, you know, E3, it's a private show.
7343249	7344150	They can do what they want.
7344950	7349774	But if nobody's going, then at the same time, what do we owe E3?
7350015	7350275	I mean...
7352512	7354013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7377765	7392161	can't afford a big booth at this show they can't afford to compete with the big guys maybe this is a week for the indie shows to celebrate the indie games and maybe maybe that's something we'll have to consider for this year
7395026	7423569	so uh also I wanted to say this I kind of don't want to spend $400 to go to E3 or whatever whatever it is I mean again to be fair I haven't even tried yet I haven't got told no yet if none of my friends are going I'm just gonna fucking go to PAX like that's where it's at you know that's where all the gaming people are and you know PAX at this point is you get to see a lot of the same demos that are already at E3 and it's more of a nerd convention and so forth there you go PAX is way more fun than E3 mhm
7426050	7430872	I kind of miss what they did in 2006, I think is what it was, during E3.
7430912	7432452	Where it was like, hey, guess what?
7433493	7436454	We have this awesome demo on the show floor for Lost Planet.
7436574	7437114	And guess what?
7437174	7438914	It's also on Xbox Live Marketplace.
7439214	7439855	Go check it out.
7439875	7440935	You don't have to go to E3.
7440995	7443696	You can check out some of the demos that are going to be on the show floor right here.
7444516	7446076	Just get a chance to play them.
7446737	7447497	That's awesome.
7448357	7450919	We will see what develops in this story.
7451200	7452381	Speaking of develops.
7453281	7454362	What's that?
7454582	7466172	I still have a dev console that still has access to a certain net that are partnered with different publishers out there.
7466192	7470015	A lot of E3 demos pop up on tube.
7471116	7477940	I bet we hear more information on this before the show actually hits because, again, you go look at some Twitters out there.
7477960	7482943	There's a lot of negative buzz on it right now, so I don't think E3 is going to like all that negative buzz.
7483444	7484925	They don't give a shit because guess what?
7485005	7488107	At the end of the day, they get their coverage on all the big sites, and you know what?
7489207	7489848	They don't give a shit.
7489868	7493250	Indie blogs might be little, but they're loud.
7494608	7495729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7521226	7523008	It actually is from SNK.
7523128	7524408	It's not Nintendo related.
7525909	7538417	SNK Arcade Classics Zero for PSP is... Excuse me, I got ahead of... Radio's biggest nightmare.
7538718	7539258	I know, right?
7540619	7543681	It's supposed to be released on April 21st.
7544361	7549845	This one is basically going to be 20 SNK games that came out before there was Neo Geo.
7550936	7554082	One of them being Psycho Soldier.
7555845	7559451	I could just tell from the cover because it was the game that Athena and Kenzo came from.
7560413	7562777	I love that game because she sings through the whole thing.
7562817	7563278	It's pretty fun.
7563678	7563859	Anyway.
7566408	7584424	Icari Warriors, Athena, Psycho Soldier, POW All kinds of cool games It's going to be really, really neat I love me some old school SNK So here's a list of... It looks like most of the games, or all of them maybe We have Icari Warriors, Dogon...
7585764	7611451	Douglas Silken, Ikari Warriors 2, Ikari 3, The Rescue, Athena, Psycho Soldier, Sasuke vs. the Commander, Tank, ASO, Prehistoric Island in 1930, Bermuda Triangle, Vanguard 2, HAL 21, Marvin's Maze, Guerrilla War, POW, Street Smart, SAR Search and Rescue, Touchdown Fever, Gold Medalist, and Super Championship Baseball, the Overseas Edition.
7612611	7613071	Cool stuff.
7614696	7617377	Rob, you totally have to find the music for Psycho Soldier.
7618417	7620978	I'll have to find it later because I'm setting up for our next segment.
7621358	7621838	Okay.
7622098	7623998	But what's your favorite game in that pack?
7624018	7626139	Because you're a Neo Geo fangirl and why?
7626719	7630500	You know, I love Psycho Soldier even though it's actually really not that great of a game.
7630880	7633501	It just makes me laugh because you're singing through the whole thing.
7633521	7638242	It was one of the first arcade games that I'll digitize singing to go on continuously through the whole game.
7638502	7638722	Mm-hmm.
7640842	7643083	It was such a fun little bad game.
7644343	7646443	Well, that and I also have to add Ikari Warriors, you know.
7647544	7649004	I love Ikari Warriors.
7649044	7650625	That game is so awesome.
7651025	7653505	It was incredibly glitchy on the NES.
7653925	7657066	Man, making that cartridge dirtier made it more fun.
7658166	7659947	It's like, ooh, what glitches are going to happen now?
7661861	7667067	Alright, since it is episode number 400, we thought we would do something special for you guys.
7667167	7668828	We're going to do a little game here.
7668848	7672332	We haven't done it in quite a while, but it's time for us to play it and bring back tonight.
7672392	7676777	It is time for... Video Game Match Game!
7676857	7677437	Yay!
7678732	7689318	The way a video game match game works is that we're going to get two contestants, one via Skype and one in the chat room, and they are going to do their best to match the answers provided by our celebrity panel here in studio.
7689819	7693661	Most number of points wins, and we actually have a prize to give away tonight.
7694141	7696242	So, hopefully it doesn't end in a 0-0.
7696643	7697223	We will see.
7697663	7700845	Alright, so we have already solicited folks in chat.
7700885	7703186	They're typing, pick me if they are going to play.

7755514	7758296	Getting our contestants here for the match game.
7758316	7759757	We got four questions tonight.

7763700	7764701	Oh, here comes the calls.
7764741	7765942	Let's see who we got on the line.
7766262	7767343	Hi, it's Orange Launch Radio.
7767363	7767703	Who's this?
7768752	7769332	Hey, this is Kaijudo.
7769352	7771073	Yep, that's what I was calling about.
7771093	7771313	Great.
7771333	7771853	Yeah, vaguely remember.
7771873	7772634	I do remember the game show.
7784717	7786258	I'm not that familiar with it.
7806601	7807181	DarkSakura DarkSakura
7834582	7836282	Which is true, my bedroom is the back room of the house.
7836902	7837483	Next to the vault.
7838203	7841003	Alright, next up, Arcadian42.
7841103	7844644	Hello, people of Earth.
7847545	7850245	And then finally, well, we have Sky.
7850265	7852626	Hi, I have no mic.
7854366	7856906	Sky doesn't know how to run a radio show because he has no mic.
7857366	7859987	Obviously, when he talks off mic, you can't hear him.
7861294	7862595	He says he hates all of you, by the way.
7864437	7865117	Finally, Alan.
7865838	7867459	I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
7871662	7873204	Obscure match game reference, sorry.
7876107	7877508	Let's get to the match game itself.
7877808	7878689	Lovely introductions.
7878729	7880170	Alright, I got Frisbee up to speed here.
7880230	7880751	So here we go.
7881231	7882112	Question number one.
7882152	7883293	Kaijudo, you're still there, right?
7884014	7884514	Yep, I'm here.
7884614	7885155	Okay, thank God.
7885175	7885975	I wouldn't want to lose a caller.
7886015	7887056	Here comes question number one.
7887276	7888597	Now, Kaijudo, this is very important.
7888898	7890339	Don't yell out the answer.
7890559	7891500	Just think about it.
7891820	7894742	Because our folks here in studio have to also come up with their answers.
7895063	7896964	And we will say ding as we're finishing.
7897385	7899286	I will ask you to fill in the blank when we're ready.
7899526	7899787	Alright?
7900447	7901728	I gotcha, just like the game show.
7901828	7902969	You got it, just like the game show.
7903009	7904289	You have to write it on a little card.
7904330	7905150	You just make believe.
7905170	7905931	Alright, here we go.
7906011	7908372	Question number one.
7909493	7916157	Loki congratulated his co-hosts on a 400th episode and a job well done.

8237891	8240033	Which, unfortunately, is also not a match.
8240053	8242196	Because you had meatballs earlier, so you had to buy the meat.
8242476	8242636	Yeah.
8242756	8243077	Alright.
8243838	8249063	So, after two questions, the score is zero to zero.

8259259	8260060	Question number three.
8261140	8266583	Rob was sad to hear that he'd need 8,000 listeners to get into E3 this year.
8267444	8273747	He wrote an appeal to the E3 board saying, Dear E3, give me a media badge.
8274508	8278870	I may not have 8,000 listeners, but I sure as hell have 8,000 blank listeners.
8285609	8287990	You need 8,000 people to go to E3 this year.

8334227	8334667	All right.
8335287	8341308	And Frisbee says, I sure as hell have 8,000 players in my guild.
8344680	8346660	First off, you're really wrong, but that's okay.
8347801	8349562	I like that they're both WoW references.
8349942	8351683	All right, here we go.
8351883	8353363	I sure as hell have 8,000.

8358846	8360166	Inches of E-peen.
8361107	8362507	True, but not a match.
8362627	8362928	All right.

8389756	8390556	What's a rage point?
8390776	8391117	I don't know.
8393138	8394159	I'm not the angry one.
8394199	8394559	He is.
8394859	8396440	He's the angry one, Arcadian.
8396780	8397461	I'm not angry.
8399802	8400283	Oh, my turn.
8401664	8402504	I sure as hell have 8,000.

8405106	8406967	I said gold and I meant Warcraft.
8407067	8407688	That's a match.
8408148	8409549	Kaijudo is on the board.
8410209	8411050	One point.
8411530	8413651	Kaijudo matches on 8,000 gold.
8414091	8414591	There it is.
8415072	8415952	So it is tied up.
8416652	8417693	One zip.
8418253	8419034	No, that's not a tie.
8419154	8420795	This is why I'm not a game show host.
8421195	8422315	It is not tied up anymore.
8422335	8424096	I'm just so used to these things ending in a draw.
8424536	8428098	It is now Kaijudo pulling ahead one to nothing.
8428639	8430720	Kaijudo, there is still one more question to go.
8431400	8432641	You have to maintain your lead.
8432761	8434783	Frisbee, this is your chance to catch up.
8434803	8435143	You ready?
8436484	8436764	Alright.
8437805	8438626	Here we go, Frisbee.
8438666	8439626	Here we go, Kaijudo.
8440047	8440907	Last question.
8442108	8450395	The listeners of OLR sat in the chat room skipping the Super Bowl to listen to OLR's 400th episode.
8451135	8459362	They all agreed that the show was going fine, but that a landmark show such as this was in desperate need of more blank.
8464670	8471874	It is the landmark 400th episode, and everyone agrees that the show is going fine, but this show is in desperate need of more blank.
8472374	8472694	Ding.

8474435	8474715	Ding.
8475996	8477197	Alright, Arcadius is ding.
8480438	8481399	Kaijudo's thinking.
8481439	8482319	Frisbee's thinking.
8484761	8485141	Alright.
8487562	8488082	Let's see.

8665076	8666578	Just play a little Big Planet 2.
8667199	8678759	If you ever wanted to develop your own games and you got lost with Game Maker 8 or RPG Maker is just a little too confusing for you, then pick up Big Planet 2 and you'll be able to make the games that you've always wanted to play.
8679279	8680640	and play GoldenEye Source.
8680920	8681760	I keep pumping that game.
8681781	8682741	You guys need to try that.
8683321	8686223	I will put it on my list right after I finish up with the Dragon Age 2 demo.
8686563	8692146	Alright, Kajudo, I need you to send an email to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com right away, okay?
8692266	8692867	So I have your email.
8693127	8693347	Got it.
8693547	8694107	Alright, do it right now.
8694227	8695188	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
8695248	8695708	Alright, thank you.
8696569	8696749	Later.
8696769	8697329	You're welcome.
8698231	8700313	All right, congrats, Chaijudo, and congrats, Frisbee.
8701074	8705619	We're going to open up the Skype line for more calls a little later on tonight, but don't call in right now.
8705660	8707502	We're going to get to some more news stories.
8707522	8711326	We're not quite ready for the rest of the calls just yet.
8711406	8714209	So let's go to another news story from Loki.
8714469	8715671	Hope you guys enjoyed Match Game.
8717351	8724755	THQ is talking a little bit about their sales of the UDraw tablet, their peripheral that kind of resembles something that you might see with Mario Paint.
8725676	8732540	They've sold 1.2 million UDraw units in the third quarter of their fiscal year, of course.
8733060	8735342	And, of course, they want more UDraw games.
8736082	8764467	they're actually looking to kind of change up their business strategy a bit trying to step away from some of the kids and I guess movie cartoon based stuff that they have coming out THQ does a lot they have like Nintendo license so they do a lot of Spongebob and crap at Nicktoons and all sorts of stuff that comes out with that
8766908	8769270	Which would be good, because I don't like selling it each year.
8769850	8773113	Have you ever made anything that's been really good for everyone?
8773413	8774293	The You Don't Know Jack game?
8774314	8778576	For everyone?
8778616	8784000	Saints Row, Red Faction, a lot of the Volition stuff through them is pretty cool.
8784060	8786102	UFC, people like UFC.
8786422	8789484	So they do have the mature stuff, but as far as casual family stuff,
8790586	8798665	I just remember back in the day 10-15 years ago they were putting out all these crap games that no one seemed to like.
8803130	8804270	What was that movie?
8804350	8804931	Home Alone.
8805111	8805951	Some sort of Home Alone.
8806111	8808112	Oh god, Home Alone was terrible.
8809432	8810373	The games were not fun.
8811533	8811973	Alright.
8812593	8814814	Well, those U-Draws seem to be doing pretty well.
8814894	8816015	I mean, I see them all over now.
8816435	8819776	Yeah, they're doing pretty well and it'd be nice when there's more software out there.
8819876	8823557	If they did a Mario Paint game that used U-Draw, that'd be pretty awesome.
8823977	8828299	Do you think it might be something Nintendo tries to show off at the Big Expo later this year?
8828820	8829761	I think it would be nice.
8852193	8852874	Thanks for watching!
8871906	8877172	Now, before you get all PO'd that you're going to have to buy this character, it is going towards a good cause.
8878073	8891547	The money that they raise from this character will be donated to charities devoted to breast cancer research, and that is according to The Behemoth, because obviously, February is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and you see a lot of pink ribbons that people wear, so what better than a pink knight?
8891787	8892388	I like this.
8892548	8893909	This is good news for gaming.
8894209	8895150	This is a great story.
8895250	8896091	So check this out.
8896131	8899775	Even if you, you know, just on principle, check it out.
8899795	8900235	They're so cute.
8900275	8902037	I know, and the Pink Knight gets a lollipop.
8902598	8902898	Yeah.
8903058	8903378	Awesome.
8904039	8907042	By the way, the Pink Knight will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
8907142	8911186	Just hasn't happened just yet, but it will happen hopefully this month.
8911987	8913068	So check that out.
8913428	8914309	I think that's a great cause.
8914729	8915190	Good story.
8915802	8921106	Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open up the mailbag and we're going to dive in headfirst to the mailbag.
8921166	8924669	DarkSakura's going to pull out a few emails and read them for us live on air.
8924709	8928352	Just make sure she doesn't read the two guys that just sent me their emails' addresses.
8928972	8929833	Well, we don't have them yet.
8930033	8930113	Oh.
8931838	8932919	So, first email.
8933920	8935281	And now my voice decides to go out.
8935861	8936642	Hi, OLR.
8936682	8940385	I just wanted to pop you guys a message to wish you congratulations on reaching episode 400.
8941406	8951574	It's difficult enough just to listen to or watch 400 episodes of something, but here you guys have successfully put forward the dedication and drive to broadcast that many truly an awesome achievement.
8952555	8954537	I also do need to congratulate him on his fantastic grammar
8970555	8974317	I just love the name Snake 361 as the title.
8975818	8976639	It's very clever.
8977840	8983403	Hey, if you can't listen to all 400 episodes of OLR, I don't have time to play 359 other Snake games, okay?
8986514	8987315	Thank you for watching!
9014815	9015696	which I wasn't here for.
9016797	9017317	That's true.
9017397	9018958	No, I was here for the fourth episode.
9018978	9020059	You came back for the fourth.
9020099	9021160	You were gone like the second or third.
9021180	9022261	That was the Harry Potter closet.
9022361	9023182	Yes, anyhow.
9023622	9023822	Okay.
9024963	9025483	Ah, memories.
9025583	9027065	Was that the Mel episode?
9027205	9027725	Did he come out?
9027745	9028906	He came out pretty early on.
9029266	9029426	Yes.
9030407	9034328	It's a great time every time, and I've enjoyed every minute that I've spent with OLR.
9034408	9037689	Thanks, Jamie, Matt, and Rob for being awesome enough to bring us Orange Lodge Radio.
9038149	9043550	And also, if you've ever participated in chat or called into the show, thank you as well for helping to make the show what it is.
9044130	9048751	You'll be hearing from me again soon, and hopefully I'll see many of you at PAX East 2011.
9049471	9050812	Stop by my booth and say hello.
9051432	9055433	Still awaiting the budget for Golden Girls Death Squad, AaronYYR.
9057301	9058702	I don't know if he wants us to say his last name.
9058943	9063447	You know they do have those crowdsourcing websites now.
9063587	9064188	That's true.
9064928	9065849	I have to look into that.
9066530	9067851	We reported on that last week.
9067891	9068392	That's awesome.
9068672	9069913	Thank you for the well wishes.
9070033	9070474	Appreciate it.
9070514	9073817	And best of luck with Snake 361 and you better come on the show and plug it.
9073857	9074037	Yes.
9075098	9075779	Next email.
9075879	9076820	Greetings, OLR.
9076880	9080103	Congratulations on reaching your quadricentennial episode.
9080984	9086308	I've been listening to your show on and off for years now, and every time I come back, it's like returning to old friends.
9087169	9088090	Yeah, we're getting old.
9089431	9089932	Maybe you.
9090012	9090752	I still look gorgeous.
9093315	9093855	Bitch.
9094996	9096037	Yeah, so?
9097098	9100041	You guys always manage to brighten up a dull bus ride in the morning.
9100181	9101282	Oh, I'm glad I'm good for something.
9102614	9105875	I'm never able to listen live due to the time difference.
9105996	9108497	I'm in the UK and I doubt tonight will be any different.
9108817	9112398	But I hope it's a fun show and I'll be looking forward to it in the podcast feed.
9112919	9115760	Hope you lot are around for many more shows to come.
9115860	9116880	Catastrophic Moggy.
9117781	9118381	Thank you very much.
9119241	9119902	I like the name.
9119962	9120662	That's very clever.
9121802	9123303	Hey, DJ Ranma S here.
9123443	9127465	I tried to round up the staff to wish you guys happy 400, but we had a slight problem.
9127865	9128645	So here, enjoy.
9129166	9129546	It's an MP3.
9130543	9132306	That means I have to go in the mailbag and pull that up, don't I?
9132326	9132747	Yes, you do.
9132787	9133708	All right, we'll come back to that.
9133768	9134630	I'm going to pull that up right now.
9137071	9139954	Alright, congratulations on your 400th episode.
9140034	9145740	As a long-time listener and a first-time writer, I thought I would share one of my favorite memories from listening to OLR.
9146260	9158472	Although I cannot pinpoint when exactly I started listening, sometime in 2006, my favorite memories include a wonderful discussion about Uno on Xbox Live as the words draw for bitch have graced every game I have played ever since.
9159153	9160654	Keep up the amazing work.
9160714	9161054	Hey Kuro!
9161154	9161274	Huh?
9161295	9161415	Kuro!
9161435	9161515	Yes?
9161555	9162435	Have you heard from Sailor Flare?
9183556	9184959	Um, actually, I haven't.
9185179	9186221	Do you know what happened to her?
9186701	9187723	I have no idea.
9187763	9190688	She said she's supposed to meet us online and record the bumper for OLR.
9190728	9191309	It's their 400th episode.
9193046	9193887	Do you want to give her a call?
9194447	9197729	Um, I tried calling her, but I don't know where she lives.
9198069	9201332	She can't get a signal or anything like that.
9201412	9207116	I sent her a text, and hell, I've gotten on the roof of my house and said it smokes.
9207136	9209417	You've got mail.
9209477	9213600	I was just about to say, that's where that little bee thing on your computer is.
9214541	9216022	Yeah, let's check it out and see what it is.
9218001	9220643	Hey Ranma, hey Kuro, it's Sailor Flare.
9221103	9229949	Listen, I would be with you guys right now, but there are some rabid, angry fanboys, and they are attacking the studio, and I need to do my part to ward them off.
9230650	9233492	Moon Tiara Magic!
9236674	9241777	Um, I didn't think it was possible for fanboys to find studios.
9241837	9242658	That's, um...
9247388	9249209	I think we need to find a new location.
9250569	9252150	I don't even want to remember this happened.
9252871	9254031	That makes two of us so.
9254171	9255592	Orange Lounge Radio, happy 400.
9255752	9257293	We gotta find new real estate now.
9257954	9259435	Alright, see you later.
9259455	9260735	Congratulations.
9260755	9262516	Love you guys.
9262556	9263897	That was nice.
9264117	9265078	That was so nice.
9265938	9270141	Only you guys could gay up this show more than I can with a Sailor Moon reference.
9272542	9273583	We have two more emails.
9275188	9276068	And by the way, thanks guys.
9276428	9278049	This comes from Mike.
9279229	9280749	It's subject 3DS.
9281730	9286191	I was extremely happy to hear the Final Fantasy 4 might be getting a re-release on the 3DS.
9286811	9289472	It would be the main reason to get a 3DS for me.
9289572	9295353	It has always been a three-way tie for me between 7, 6, and 4 for my favorite Final Fantasy.
9295793	9298434	Every console I have bought was to play a Final Fantasy.
9298794	9300454	PlayStation for 7, PS2 for 10, and a PS3 for 13.
9303175	9307137	I just hope that Squeenix will fix the shitstorm known as 14.
9308317	9311138	I played it and it has potential, just not in its current form.
9311558	9316420	The story is just as awesome as 11, but everything else is what it holds back.
9317020	9322062	It might have been adequate pre-wow, but now it's either clone wow or don't even try.
9322622	9325944	Thanks for reading and making me laugh until I puke when the podcast is updated.
9327825	9345722	you're welcome whatever you do you don't have to share pictures of that please yeah you know what though as far as like all the MMOs have to copy WoW not necessarily DC Universe seems to be doing okay and it's very different than WoW just so you know so there you go
9346562	9361390	Oh, and Kaijudo, yes You got the right email Okay, last one Alright This is from Rababa I got the following note from PSN this week Why do I keep thinking of Dead or Alive on pause?
9361890	9373936	Sports Illustrated 3D Coming soon Visit the video store now for an exclusive sneak peek At the 3D Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues Featuring the hottest models from around the world Offer available to US residents only
9374136	9375358	Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue 3D
9391380	9392861	The internet is for porn
9415049	9419373	So I really appreciate you guys kind of making up our extended family here at OLR.
9420034	9421976	And, you know, what else can I say?
9422056	9423738	You guys kind of keep us motivated.
9424038	9428383	All those days where I'm like, you know, I could be doing something else on Sunday nights.
9428943	9431005	I haven't been goth dancing.
9431185	9431325	Yeah.
9434128	9437250	in 10 years because of OLR.
9437590	9439972	I could go goth dancing again if I'd quit OLR.
9440312	9446456	But then I get some email that's just awesome, you know, and it's like, oh, yeah, that's why we do OLR.
9447296	9448617	And to watch Loki play Gal Gun.
9448637	9449778	That's the other reason I do OLR.
9450318	9450698	All right.
9451539	9461004	Even though we are all sunshiny, happy, rainbowy, and, you know, fluffy kittens, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a little bit of angst in the form of the FUs of the week.
9476559	9480182	I really didn't have an F you until, uh, tonight.
9481604	9489811	Um, I, F you, and this is gonna, F you to political correctness.
9490832	9491233	I said it.
9492514	9494916	F you to people getting offended over shit that has nothing to do with them.
9497679	9498059	That's it.
9498900	9499260	Alright.
9500121	9500601	Moving on.
9500681	9502283	Loki, your F you of the week.
9504015	9507716	F you not being able to read Japanese, so I hit replay level instead of continue.
9508456	9509977	I just don't understand that.
9510337	9511377	I don't want to play this level again.
9512938	9516119	My F you of the week goes to the fact that this weekend just flew by.
9516219	9521200	Like, yesterday I'm at work, it feels like, and now it's all, ah, I gotta do it all again tomorrow.
9521720	9522440	So, whatever.
9522760	9524201	At least I like my job, so, you know.
9524861	9529065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9548701	9549501	And Salacious Pop?
9549521	9551502	Sort of a boring answer, but just F you to the economy.
9551522	9553782	Hey, I think a lot of people are with you there.
9553802	9555682	Alright, there it is, the FUs of the week.
9577714	9582718	Let's move on to just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, which is going to be interesting tonight.
9583138	9585960	All right, we'll do the Skype line as long as we can tonight.
9586380	9592164	We might have to put a time limit on calls tonight, just so you know, because if the match game was any indication, we got a lot of people wanting to call in tonight.
9592444	9593605	So we might have to do a little time limit.
9594085	9597188	All right, Loki, sorry, not FU, news story.
9598229	9602995	The movie site First Showing is reporting that there's a Zombies Ate My Neighbors film in development.
9603076	9604177	Yay!
9604357	9610606	Apparently based on the old 16-bit game, which I forgot is actually developed by LucasArts.
9610866	9613090	That would be awesome if LucasArts put that out.
9614912	9616133	That game was great.
9616713	9618494	There needs to be trampoline levels.
9618714	9621016	It's a flick being described as a horror comedy.
9621196	9625578	More specifically, John Hughes meets Judd Apatow meets George A. Romero.
9626879	9629861	Honestly, I think it'd be an excellent movie.
9630061	9632802	The whole thing was a parody on kind of the horror genre anyways.
9632902	9638606	And it was absolutely ridiculous with like 50 foot tall babies and zombies and werewolves.
9638726	9640907	And I think there were aliens in there as well.
9641553	9645155	That's a game that I should have played but just missed completely and I still have no idea why.
9645375	9646856	But I definitely remember the hype around it.
9646916	9647717	It's on Virtual Console.
9647737	9648197	It's awesome.
9648898	9649618	I don't have a Wii, but yeah.
9649638	9651599	Wait, did you just pimp Nintendo's Virtual Console?
9651619	9652120	I think you did.
9653621	9655382	Well, they put out some games.
9655462	9656582	They just stopped now.
9656963	9657863	I had to call you on it.
9657903	9658263	I'm sorry.
9658343	9658704	Well, fine.
9658724	9659324	Download the ROM.
9659844	9660685	Fuck paying them money.
9662352	9662732	There you go.
9663513	9665554	Now there's the Loki answer I was looking for.
9666435	9667636	I think it could make a cool movie.
9667696	9673260	I think if they kind of don't try to keep it as the video game, I think the name has enough recognition.
9673300	9673980	Just keep the story.
9674020	9675421	Don't even bother.
9675862	9681106	I think there's enough people that just would have no idea there was even a game that exists that would go see the movie.
9681466	9685209	And then you would get the game again because it would tie into the movie.
9685229	9687130	But, of course, movie tie-in games always suck.
9687330	9694595	And here's the thing, though, about it, though, is you don't even need to, like, have game times, because the whole thing is just basically a spoof of, like, the horror genre.
9694995	9705882	It's basically, it's like Monster Squad, actually, a little bit, because it's all the shit, horrible things that can happen in, like, horror movies all happening at once.
9706283	9716269	There's zombies attacking, there's evil dolls, there's werewolves, there's giant babies, there's, I think there were giant ants and stuff, like, all sorts of crazy shit going down all at once.
9717830	9740602	what you need well it seems like the theme of it was all of the um all of the really awful horror movies that came out in the 50s that were all metaphors for communism the giant ants and whatever yeah exactly yeah right all right i played through that whole game that had like i think there was like over 100 levels in the game it was ridiculous
9743576	9748798	Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Beatles, or at least one of them.
9749159	9753120	Ringo Starr, one of the ones that's still left and still kicking.
9753961	9758002	Ringo Starr apparently has...
9759563	9763905	registered a trademark that indicates that his name has been trademarked.
9764146	9775852	Ringo, his name, has been trademarked for downloadable computer games via the internet and wireless devices, toys, namely toy vehicles, plush toys, pet toys, and skateboards.
9776812	9779754	So I have no idea if Ringo is going to start getting into skateboarding.
9780074	9781776	Daddy, I want the Ringo vehicle.
9782477	9783419	Which seems a little odd to me.
9783499	9789467	I would understand if there was a Ringo music game or something coming, like a drumming on your iPad type of thing.
9789927	9791529	But skateboards and pet toys?
9791930	9794994	Clearly he's trying to protect the name from something.
9795014	9796316	That's what this strikes me as.
9796916	9801638	Ringo could kind of be like, I don't know, like a new ring toss game or something.
9801678	9801998	I don't know.
9802658	9803238	Roll with me here.
9803578	9807140	It could be some new game and maybe he doesn't want to lose that on his name.
9807200	9808640	So maybe that's why he trades market.
9808960	9812502	But then again, are you allowed to trademark something if you don't have a plan to use it?
9813002	9813442	I guess so.
9813482	9815003	There's a lot of squatters and so forth.
9816643	9821825	By the way, of course, the attorney has been asked on why Ringo Starr trademarked the name and no comment.
9823055	9823535	No comment.
9824635	9829377	The last time Ringo was heard in a video game news story, it was with the Beatles rock band.
9829737	9835559	He was talking to Jimmy Fallon about it and said, the graphics are great, I love the game, I love the music, but it's for young folk.
9837379	9841720	His 15th studio album came out last year called Why Not?
9843101	9843461	Why not?
9844501	9845261	Make a video game?
9845301	9845681	Why not?
9846462	9847322	Ringo skateboards?
9847362	9847942	Sure, why not?
9848542	9848962	There you go.
9849443	9851103	Would you buy a Ringo skateboard, Slicerspot?
9853146	9856587	If I didn't have the self-esteem to buy the Tony Hawk one, then yes.
9857888	9860729	Gotta keep the bar low sometimes.
9860749	9865650	Alright, well of course there's the folks in chatroom that are coming up with all these Ringo games.
9865890	9868051	DarkTest Studio says RingoStars Pro Skater.
9868971	9871212	Frisbee says RingoStars Wasteland.
9871672	9873413	Frisbee, RingoStar Underground.
9874173	9877654	SSJ100Matt is bringing up that Sarah Palin filed a copyright on her name.
9879235	9881156	Does that mean they can keep making the Nalen Palin?
9881396	9883057	Or is that illegal now?
9883438	9884318	The Palin porns.
9884678	9885239	Have you seen these?
9886159	9889421	Sarah Palin like rejuvenated the porn industry.
9889602	9890062	Did you know that?
9891104	9895728	Well, there's that one actress that looks exactly like her that's like, yes, this is my moment.
9895928	9896568	Who, Tina Fey?
9897829	9898650	Not Tina Fey.
9900071	9906356	But she could do this Nalen Palin and then just roll right over and do the 30 Rock porn.
9906517	9911481	Well, they make those really awful Deer Hunter games for PC that are like $9.99 brand new
9913442	9914643	They always come out with a new version.
9914663	9915723	She should just license that.
9915783	9916764	Except it'll be Moose Hunter.
9916824	9917845	Sarah Palin's Moose Hunter.
9918805	9919245	Available.
9919265	9919826	Or Wolf Hunter.
9920786	9922127	But that one would have to be a helicopter game.
9923120	9925941	DungeonBuster in our chat room is suggesting Ringo ate my neighbors.
9927702	9928983	That's a possible video game.
9929563	9932345	All right, Skype line is open.
9932805	9938068	Orange Launch Radio on Skype or our Skype line phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9938348	9942470	Please don't be offended if we move through your calls quickly tonight because I think there's a lot of people that want to get in.
9942870	9950394	So, Loki, while we wait for the calls coming because there is about a minute and a half delay between time we say something and the time folks hear it as it encodes through the interwebs.
9950814	9952675	Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories for us tonight?
9953335	9981007	um yeah let's see other than uh we talked a little bit about how Linux is making its return to 3.41 uh you can also get Linux via the custom firmware 3.55 it's a bestest it's not quite as awesome as the uber Linux that's on 3.41 but uh you know beggars can't be choosers I guess um let's see other fun stuff we can talk about here um
9983643	9995913	Again, the phone number is 1-877-GAME, O-L-R, G-A-M-E-O-L-R Or, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio And the phones are starting to light up Let's get to them Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9997354	10002999	Hi, this is Red the Haze from Houston, Texas Red the Haze, congrats, you're the first one to get through tonight What's on your mind, buddy?
10004320	10009524	Yeah, I'd like to greet you a happy Chinese New Year If you didn't notice, it's this weekend
10010351	10011373	Oh, that's right.
10011433	10013235	I totally, it slipped my mind.
10013576	10019404	You know, I had an ex who was Chinese and it was kind of, you know, it didn't go so well.
10019484	10022208	So I've had to block a lot of that out of my mind.
10022268	10022909	No, it's okay.
10022969	10024010	You know, it's just, you know.
10025603	10029564	I'm not Chinese, I was in a club last night where they had line dancers there Line dancing?
10052588	10057411	Yeah, line dancing, like dragon dancing, you know, but it was kind of weird.
10057751	10065055	I was thinking because you said you were from eastern Texas, maybe they do the whole, like, you know, country line dancing, the whole, like, electric slide and all that stuff.
10065095	10065715	Yee-haw!
10067316	10071879	We got a lot of Asians down there, so we got an Asian thing down there.
10072059	10072419	That's all right.
10072439	10073520	We live in northern California.
10073560	10074660	It's the same story here.
10076822	10077102	All right.
10077142	10079103	So what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?
10080846	10101472	Yeah, regarding to the Super Bowl, I was talking to my girlfriend who works for a Canadian cable provider, and she's been getting a lot of calls about the Super Bowl up there, and it seems that a lot of people from Canada are complaining that they're not getting the U.S.
10101532	10102132	commercials.
10104484	10105024	Weird.
10105564	10112346	Now, you gotta tread lightly with Super Bowl chat around here because that is our competition tonight for our landmark episode.
10112406	10114626	But Canada getting ripped off.
10114706	10116247	Canada getting the big shaft.
10116287	10117647	Well, now that's interesting to me.
10118107	10121788	So why would Canada... Because, you know, what did Canada do to deserve that?
10121808	10123028	Do you find big shafts interesting?
10123128	10123368	I do.
10123708	10126629	Why did Canada... What did Canada do to deserve that?
10127209	10130710	They just sit up there and they're all peaceful, making maple...
10131850	10132791	They're free healthcare.
10133011	10133971	Yes, exactly.
10133991	10134811	They're hurting no one.
10134971	10137873	If Doritos spent $30 million on a commercial, they should see it.
10138473	10139293	Exactly.
10139493	10142034	It's that popular these days.
10142074	10142474	Come on.
10142815	10148477	Well, maybe something's going on where the Canadian broadcaster wanted to sell their own damn commercials.
10148537	10151398	I mean, can't your Canadian friends just go on YouTube and see the same shit?
10151498	10153899	I mean, that's how I watch stupid bull commercials.
10154761	10157282	Yeah, that's what they've been instructed to tell them.
10157322	10158643	Just go on the internet.
10159524	10162025	It just comes off as that.
10162085	10164206	The internet exists for that kind of thing, you know?
10164806	10165567	Also for porn.
10166207	10167448	Well, now here's my question.
10167488	10169649	Was Betty White in any of the commercials this year?
10173157	10174278	I don't know.
10174718	10175259	I wasn't watching.
10175299	10176960	I was playing Dead Space and listening to you guys.
10176980	10177160	Go ahead.
10199724	10202125	I'd like to congratulate you guys on the 400th episode.
10202165	10204725	I've been a long-time listener, first-time caller.
10205626	10206466	My favorite line.
10206506	10206746	Yes.
10207246	10207586	Excellent.
10207826	10209267	Well, thank you so much for calling the show.
10209327	10210027	Really appreciate it.
10210307	10213128	Quickly, what video game... Oh, you already said Dead Space.
10213168	10214668	What other video games have you been playing this week?
10216809	10217169	Mag.
10217909	10219810	I don't want to trash talk about it.
10219870	10221950	I play with people regularly on it.
10222010	10225231	I've spent 300 hours on it.
10225451	10226031	Oh, my gosh.
10226612	10227832	There's a Mag 2 on the way, isn't there?
10229758	10231820	No, we're playing on the PS3.
10231840	10238425	We're going to jump to Homefront, which sounds like a better deal, considering that the multiplayer has better incentives.
10239246	10240547	It's not Call of Duty.
10241027	10242388	I have to keep an eye out for that.
10242649	10244790	In the meantime, I've got to get to other calls, but thank you so much for the call.
10245171	10246752	Congrats on getting through first on your first call.
10246792	10247633	That's quite an accomplishment.
10248173	10248593	Take care, buddy.
10248613	10249254	Thank you.
10250120	10253562	STO 100 Matt in our chat room is confirming Betty White was in one of the commercials.
10253762	10254882	So now I need to know.
10254942	10256103	Who won the volleyballs?
10256243	10256883	By what score?
10256903	10257723	Should I ask?
10258004	10258304	I don't.
10258524	10260605	I think the green people.
10261045	10261745	The cheese heads?
10262286	10262526	Yes.
10262626	10265547	I think the cheesy people won by like three points or something.
10265727	10265947	Okay.
10266167	10266347	Yes.
10267088	10270389	Do you have bets going on the Super Bowl or something?
10270489	10270989	All right.
10271009	10273751	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.
10273771	10274031	Watch.
10274071	10277732	I totally probably got that wrong and everybody in chat is going to be like, Rob, you're so dumb.
10278153	10278433	All right.
10281033	10291899	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio SSJ100Matt says the NFL Network commercial with the different TV shows wait a minute, does that count?
10293640	10305467	showing like a two I think showing a two second clip of Hot in Cleveland might not count although I will say that show is pretty fucking funny but meanwhile we have another show on the line or another show, another call on the line hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10306610	10307471	Oh my god, Rob.
10307751	10308472	Rob, it's Ranma.
10308532	10310434	I have a bone to pick with you right now.
10310695	10310935	Okay.
10311837	10314620	Where do you get off saying that we gave up the show?
10315240	10317442	No, you have no right to do that.
10317622	10320305	Don't make me get nasty up in here because I will, girlfriend.
10320565	10320885	I will.
10321826	10322927	Oh, no, you didn't.
10322967	10324588	Yes, I did.
10324689	10326270	You did not call into this show.
10327531	10328472	Yes, I did.
10328772	10331234	Don't make me because I got my hag right here.
10331455	10333096	Yo, we will bring it, sister.
10333116	10335018	Girl, I will pull that weave.
10335258	10337200	I will pull that weave right on out of your head.
10337700	10341101	I'll rip that pulse while I'm picking it already is, alright?
10341501	10342541	I'm not the one.
10342641	10343961	I am not the one.
10344502	10345082	Oh, girl.
10351583	10352983	You have to... Yes, I do.
10353063	10353563	Yes, I do.
10353703	10356364	Hold my earrings, alright?
10356404	10357044	Hold my earrings.
10357444	10361385	You have to admit, the Sailor Moon thing, a little bit gay.
10361685	10362405	A little bit gay.
10363145	10363986	And I can say that.
10365166	10365306	So...
10366536	10368258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10386235	10390979	Alright, you ever play RPGs and you give the characters names?
10391580	10394942	I tend to name them after the various anime characters and so forth.
10395363	10400007	Now, what are the craziest names you've given the characters?
10401280	10408022	My Final Fantasy 1 party was probably fuck, fart, poop, and ass.
10410003	10414644	Speaking of Final Fantasy, my roommate's playing through the four heroes of light.
10414884	10419325	He named the main hero Dipshit and named the princess Gonorrhea.
10419745	10425147	He's at the scene where the king tells him, Dipshit, go find my Gonorrhea right now.
10427313	10428094	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10446610	10447171	Thanks for watching!
10463106	10478566	I think Oregon Trail is the first game of people of this generation that really were able to do that with the names but in Final Fantasy 7 if you give Aerith in particular the most raunchiest name you could think of, lols for days you will get your money's worth
10481079	10485204	It seems like the trend is like you get the lulls off of any of the Final Fantasy games.
10485264	10486986	Like my roommate played Tactics.
10487567	10490030	I don't know what the character's name was.
10490050	10491111	I think it was Head.
10491892	10494796	One of the scenes where the guard's like, you will give us Head now.
10497899	10499822	And what possessed this question?
10502569	10513401	I don't know, I'm just, we're just watching TV, you know, and my roommate's telling me he's playing the game and he's showing me this, and I'm like, I wonder if the OLR peeps have ever done this.
10513922	10516705	I was just throwing something out there for good conversation.
10517005	10517646	No, it's all good.
10518477	10519638	You'll have to excuse me.
10519658	10523361	I'm tearing up a little bit.
10524402	10528305	Because Flaming Clint just died.
10528325	10532649	Dude, I cheered.
10534010	10539174	It's really tragic because I used Flaming Clint as my healer in the party.
10540135	10544618	I can't believe that Sephiroth just went and stabbed Flaming Clint right through the abdomen.
10544658	10544879	It's just...
10545848	10546569	It's just wrong.
10546889	10547489	Right in the middle.
10547909	10548690	It's just wrong.
10550071	10551712	Flaming Clint, I love you.
10556535	10556996	Are you happy now?
10557036	10557676	You wrong, man.
10557896	10558417	You wrong.
10558777	10559738	Funny, but wrong.
10561699	10564061	Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Ranma?
10564621	10565362	Not necessarily.
10565522	10567463	Oh, um, Sakura-chan.
10568224	10568424	What?
10568484	10569224	Hi.
10570085	10571646	Jovedaya says hi.
10572106	10572747	Hi.
10573107	10574308	Happy birthday, Jovedaya.
10574878	10575719	Happy birthday.
10579263	10579864	She heard.
10580885	10581306	All right.
10581586	10583068	We got to get some more calls, Ranma.
10583308	10584009	Have a good one, buddy.
10585270	10585551	All right.
10587775	10591978	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10593019	10594120	Skype line is open right now.
10594180	10595341	Look what happens on calls.
10595481	10595942	Like, look.
10596982	10600005	Every gamer has a voice and sometimes that voice takes us right to the crapper.
10600946	10603027	Did you hear my crying in the other room?
10603448	10604188	Oh, yes, you did.
10604749	10605769	You don't have family over to you.
10607330	10607710	Oh, good.
10608851	10609992	The kids aren't visiting today?
10610813	10611554	Oh, just Jamie?
10611674	10612394	Oh, well, screw her.
10612774	10613055	All right.
10615717	10617919	Well, he can't do that right now because we're doing the show.
10618839	10619120	Sorry.
10619480	10620341	I love our chatters.
10620841	10625945	Brad from Prod Culture in chat just said, so he pierced Flaming Clit?
10629968	10633131	Oh, God, I love the listeners.
10635191	10639776	Hi, it's Marissa Hi Marissa Welcome to the program
10653277	10653957	What's on your mind?
10653977	10655218	Hey, how are you guys doing?
10655238	10656559	It sounds like fun over there.
10656999	10662923	I'm good, but I'm... I had an emotional moment a minute ago, but I'm all better.
10663543	10667686	I just, I figured out... Seriously, Rob was shaking and crying.
10667946	10668586	I know, I did.
10669067	10672829	I just figured out how to unlock the safe and get Smelly dumped to join my party.
10674110	10675030	So I'm okay now.
10678573	10680255	You mentioned Oregon Trail earlier.
10680275	10681476	You have to join my trail.
10681977	10683678	It actually sounds kind of dirty.
10683859	10684720	It's a freaking Facebook team.
10684740	10686942	I have you join my party so you can die of dysentery.
10687744	10688744	It's a Facebook game now.
10688784	10693086	I actually tried the game on Facebook this week and it's weird.
10693806	10695206	It's not what I remember.
10695306	10696367	It's so different.
10696447	10700988	It's trying to invite your friends and it is exactly what I thought.
10701068	10706549	You can name your party members after Facebook friends and then spam their walls when they die of dysentery and so forth.
10707990	10714131	All they're trying to do is milk the Facebook point system because basically to survive the game you have to give them actual money.
10715432	10715612	But
10717314	10731321	I don't have anything of an important relevance to say other than typing jokes and boob references right now but I want to wish you a happy 400th and I'm so excited your show makes my week and you two have to come down here soon and visit
10732007	10732827	I really do.
10733247	10735688	I need to come stay with you on the 13th.
10736328	10742290	I may have a week off in June suddenly where I'm doing nothing and I had planned to come to LA.
10743510	10745251	Oh, what an invitation it is.
10745311	10746991	Yeah, I don't have shit to do, I guess.
10747051	10747952	I'll see you.
10748372	10752233	This news bulletin just in, E3 has been moved into Marissa's pants.
10752393	10752873	Yay!
10753333	10754574	Yay, it's a party!
10755034	10758155	Oh, and by the way, Marissa, I'm very sorry to do this to you.
10759115	10759175	Oh.
10760143	10760663	What is this?
10760943	10761504	What are you doing?
10762805	10765227	Why didn't you warn me before you heard me?
10765247	10766327	Take that, Vuvuzela.
10766347	10769870	By request of the chat room.
10771311	10771912	What is that?
10772032	10772973	I didn't get it.
10773113	10779798	It's her stupid Vuvuzela app on the iPhone that I hate, and whoever made that can die in a boat fire.
10779818	10781459	Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
10781739	10785783	She's going to have to play the melodica for me sometime.
10786721	10788261	I've been playing my melodica.
10788582	10789262	I love it.
10789922	10790722	I'll play it on the show.
10790742	10796564	I hope that you need to learn how to play Aerith's theme on the melodica so I can cry.
10798084	10807647	But Marissa, I hope you're able to come up to the show and bring your assets, your big, voluptuous brain, of course I mean, back to the show.
10808287	10810308	All right, well, congrats.
10810728	10813189	And yeah, may there be 400 more.
10814409	10814769	Thank you.
10814809	10815349	We'll try.
10815470	10816470	We'll be old, but we'll try.
10816890	10817931	Marissa, have a wonderful night.
10817951	10818571	Thanks for calling.
10819011	10819251	You too.
10819271	10819732	Chat soon.
10819932	10820972	Bye.
10824274	10824534	Ciao.
10824594	10826835	I played my melodica on air.
10827915	10831517	I have wanted a melodica forever, and Marissa got me a melodica, and I love it to death.
10831537	10832458	Can you play chopsticks?
10834038	10834458	Okay, wait.
10834478	10835579	She's going to try and play chopsticks.
10835599	10835899	Here we go.
10838160	10838440	Come on.
10838520	10838921	You can do it.
10847290	10847890	I don't remember.
10848070	10849830	I don't remember how to play this.
10849870	10852071	I'm throwing up the horns.
10852111	10853351	You need to go to rock.
10853611	10853871	You know what?
10853891	10856332	You need to write the new OLR theme song on the melodica.
10859753	10860013	Alright.
10860853	10862594	Now you need to put that thing away.
10864174	10865054	DarkSakura, put it away.
10866055	10867015	Jamie, put it away.
10870516	10872496	I was trying to play Final Fantasy stuff.
10872537	10875357	Butterfly, Dom Dom Aram, any of the Romani classics.
10875377	10877558	Yeah, can you do Dom Dom Aram, Dom Dom Aram.
10877598	10878558	All right, look, we got another call.
10878918	10880238	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10880258	10880598	Who's this?
10882179	10883099	You guys are old.
10883139	10884399	I don't know if I should be talking to you.
10885379	10886079	Hi, Bobby.
10886159	10887240	How are you, my friend?
10887860	10888500	I'm doing good.
10888520	10888820	I'm only $278, $400.
10889000	10889700	It's like past the hill.
10889720	10889840	I know.
10895830	10897771	We fell off the earth, actually.
10897851	10899192	We're that far past the hill.
10899292	10899712	I don't know.
10899772	10900593	I don't know what to tell you.
10901213	10904675	And you notice how I was like, I was going to call in next and then Ranma called.
10905336	10909158	And so I let somebody else go in between because I know I can't follow that up.
10909438	10909699	Uh-huh.
10910039	10910219	Uh-huh.
10912529	10915450	Well, Ranma always brings a certain something special to the show.
10915490	10916870	I don't know what else to say.
10917590	10919451	But I will say, I also own a melodica.
10919851	10920131	Do you?
10920251	10920751	Oh, God.
10920791	10921732	Yes.
10921972	10923832	Well, now we might have this whole week off.
10923852	10924873	Bobby, we need a duet.
10925053	10929934	We're going to have this week off in June where we're not doing anything, so maybe we need to have melodica con.
10930414	10937218	I used to know how to play the whole opera thing from Final Fantasy VI.
10937258	10938619	That's what I was trying to remember how to play.
10939099	10940420	Except it's in a bizarre key.
10941201	10942562	So I was like, I don't remember!
10944525	10944745	I love it.
10944805	10945446	That sounds awesome.
10964643	10977032	I got a 32-key, I think, soprano melodica from Marissa, who has been with me when I've gone to several music stores looking for melodicas.
10978073	10979354	So you know what's next on the list?
10980889	10981469	An auto harp.
10982990	10983590	Or a theremin.
10983650	10985071	I was going to say, when are you getting a theremin?
10985091	10986031	I thought you wanted a theremin.
10986071	10988232	I do want a theremin, but I can afford an auto harp.
10988332	10993795	I know that Bobby is one of the biggest band nerds I know, but I don't think he called in to talk about melodicas tonight.
10993835	10994695	What's on your mind, Bobby?
10995535	11005219	I got home from where I went tonight and wanted to wish you guys happy 400th because I didn't create any audio like I said I would because I'm a bad person.
11005319	11007780	I forgot to do audio for the last FNG, so it's all good.
11008421	11008581	So...
11009661	11011341	Well, thank you so much for the call.
11011421	11013742	And of course, a big thank you, Bobby.
11014302	11017903	This show almost died a few years ago, actually.
11018183	11027345	And when Live 365 kind of made it impossible for us to keep continuing to do a radio station with kind of the new unrealistic rates that they were going to charge for our audience.
11027925	11031566	And you were obviously really the person who...
11032006	11053715	I mean other folks might try to take credit for it but you were the guy that brought us to All Games Radio a couple years before and helped kind of facilitate us coming on in a more you know kind of permanent way where our live show is now kind of exclusively here so for that we and the rest of the OLR listeners really thank you for helping this show reach 400 because otherwise it probably would have ended around 278 so
11055819	11064505	You're welcome, and you guys are keeping me on because all your listeners tune in early to me, and so I can use that as my numbers even though they're not really listening to me.
11065106	11065646	So it's awesome.
11065666	11066387	It works both ways.
11066427	11070910	Well, Bobby, I hate to say it, but sadly we don't even have 8,000 people tuning in, so I don't know what you're going to do.
11072191	11074072	I haven't gotten my rejection letter yet.
11074192	11074653	You're waiting.
11075593	11075873	Bobby.
11076193	11076993	I'm prepared.
11077274	11077554	Bobby.
11078234	11078454	Yes.
11078914	11079754	We are your fan club.
11081315	11083475	It's not an E3 without Bobby either.
11083495	11089216	I can really mean that because dude's gone to like what, the last 15 in a row or something like that?
11089397	11090817	This would be my 15th.
11091217	11092277	This would be your 15th.
11092477	11092657	Yes.
11092877	11094238	And they are going to say no to this man.
11094298	11094798	Possibly.
11095518	11098041	Yeah, we don't know yet.
11098421	11105348	I got the optimistic reading of the emails that if you have below 8,000, that's still one.
11106369	11112256	It's over 8,000 to get the second one, but those are all blogs and stuff.
11112416	11117141	And I wonder because they do make the distinction in the application form of podcast.
11117441	11118002	Oh, interesting.
11118462	11119323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11136367	11142130	I could get 8,000 people to listen, and you could get 8,000 people to listen, but they're not going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
11142290	11142810	Exactly.
11143491	11149373	And hopefully most of our audience is smart enough not to have spyware tubulars installed on their computer.
11149693	11150134	Exactly.
11150494	11151014	It is a little bit.
11151034	11152495	The way they're measuring it is kind of janky.
11152855	11160138	But, you know, again, and we said this earlier, and I know you were at your party, so you probably didn't hear this, but, you know, it's mostly a case of a few bad apples ruining the barrel.
11160338	11163140	And I see why E3 feels like they need to take this step.
11163880	11165801	But it's just kind of like the wrong step.
11166141	11167801	Like, you should have gone left instead of right.
11167881	11168402	You know what I mean?
11169402	11172083	Well, I mean, I'm already told I'm not allowed at GDC anymore, too.
11172183	11174844	So it's like E3 was really all I had left other than PAX.
11175944	11178245	Because GDC took this step two years ago.
11180291	11181452	There is neatness.
11181572	11185718	I like getting to hang with the developers and get to see some of the stuff.
11185758	11189883	You know, when I played Warhammer Online for the first time, I was getting to talk to developers and stuff.
11189903	11190504	It was kind of cool.
11190564	11197854	But, you know... But, you know, if somebody's really serious about getting into E3 in terms of...
11198314	11198935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11216270	11221692	So you could, with an exhibits only badge, you really could have done the exact same thing you did last year.
11221712	11222792	You didn't need a press badge.
11222832	11224512	Bobby, I'll tell you this.
11225313	11225953	I'll tell you this.
11226413	11228533	Even with my exhibits only, I got into press events.
11229394	11229614	Yeah.
11230834	11233955	As long as they know you, it doesn't matter what your badge says.
11235347	11249060	all I had to do was flash them a card that says I do this podcast and they're like we want you exactly so I think it'll be fine if you really really want to go and yes I really really want to go thankfully I got a refund
11249755	11250936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
11267274	11267554	What?
11267815	11269075	I've got my DDR Freak stuff.
11270496	11270716	Oh.
11271016	11272417	Yeah, you might be able to do with that.
11272797	11277400	Yeah, so, I mean, I didn't get mine the other year, and I think it's because of my name change.
11277780	11278160	Interesting.
11278340	11278561	So.
11279741	11281022	And besides, I want to go to Anaheim.
11282062	11282283	Yes.
11282303	11282723	Disneyland.
11282903	11284784	He wants to go to the place that we always talk about.
11285164	11285404	All right.
11285624	11291007	Well, Bobby, I've got to let you go so we can squeeze some more calls in, but we'll see you next week as we do every week.
11291308	11292208	So have a good one, buddy.
11292849	11293109	You too.
11293409	11293589	Later.
11294926	11297087	Well, we let Bobby go a little long, but that's okay because you know what?
11297147	11300609	He always has us on his show every week and helps promote us.
11300729	11304211	And I know as much as he thinks it's us promoting him, it does work both ways.
11304571	11306412	So he can take a little more time.
11306832	11311735	All right, 877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
11312015	11312776	You can give us a call.
11313096	11314557	We got time for a couple more calls, right?
11314617	11315637	We're not done yet.
11316558	11317678	We don't have the fight out of us yet.
11318039	11319339	Maybe one more call, actually.
11319399	11320220	I'm looking at the time.
11320260	11322681	This is starting to go on two hours by the time we finish.
11322861	11323842	I need to make an announcement.
11324002	11324302	Yeah, what?
11324662	11325562	My mom is amazing.
11326403	11326643	Really?
11326963	11327163	Yes.
11327663	11328644	Well, she had you.
11328664	11330544	Aww.
11331985	11333345	Hers is the womb that bore me.
11334906	11337247	That's right.
11337327	11339267	So we are waiting for the delay to catch up.
11339287	11340788	Do we have any other last minute stories real quick?
11340828	11343329	I forgot to ask earlier.
11343349	11347350	Or maybe I did and I just... MTV Games has shut down.
11348371	11349291	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
11350126	11350967	Sucks to be them!
11351527	11353048	AOL's buying the Huffington Post.
11353128	11354389	Let's get at least one more call in here.
11354729	11355869	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11355889	11356230	Who's this?
11357410	11359091	Hi, this is Spazinator.
11359211	11359932	Spazinator!
11359952	11360812	What's on your mind, my friend?
11362213	11365755	Um, well, two really quick hits.
11366035	11369498	I want to keep it short and sweet just in case you want to get one less call.
11370718	11371199	Excuse me.
11371219	11375361	Just want to congratulate you on 400 shows and hope you have
11379614	11382775	and more shows to come in the following years.
11383876	11398200	Other than that, just want to point out to those that have PlayStation Network accounts, there's more free wheels on their usual spots.
11398321	11402022	Nothing overly exciting, but hey, they're there and they're free.
11402967	11404468	Hey, I like free stuff.
11404529	11408112	And as Salacious Pop said earlier, F you to the economy.
11408572	11410354	Free stuff is always appreciated, right?
11410614	11411655	Yes.
11411675	11413517	Oh, yeah.
11413657	11416119	Well, that's pretty much it.
11418966	11419927	Thanks for playing the show.
11419987	11420947	It's a really great show.
11421207	11421667	Thank you.
11422228	11423248	You guys help make it up.
11423308	11424008	It's your show too.
11424448	11425369	Well, thank you, Spazinator.
11425629	11426209	Have a good one, buddy.
11427330	11427590	Sure.
11427610	11427890	Bye-bye.
11428470	11436174	You know, I like that he kind of calls in and says what's free on PlayStation because I don't have time to follow all of it.
11436594	11441196	So, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and some voices need to know of all the free stuff.
11441996	11442556	Why not?
11442596	11443737	Let's do another call.
11443857	11444937	He kept it so short.
11444978	11445878	Let's do another call.
11448082	11463086	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call Alright, I'm trying to type in chat so that they know And I spelled guess wrong So I was trying to type with a microphone You need a mic?

11502278	11505480	Just released 243 this week and got a few more coming.
11505760	11506160	Nice.
11506601	11510403	By the way, I heard the shout out for Horde House on like 240 I think it was, so thanks for that.
11510923	11511784	Well, no problem.
11511804	11514186	You know, Glenn's a big WoW nut, so...
11515640	11517321	It's natural, we talk about it a little bit.
11517681	11521804	I have no idea what the hell he's saying half the time, but he talks about it.
11522464	11522825	Nice.
11523385	11527207	So, well, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
11527287	11528768	Any video games in your world?
11529949	11534472	Well, I can't rag on you about WoW too much because it's been DC Universe for me.
11535032	11537814	Well, how high are you in DC Universe now?
11537834	11541276	Are you like level 30 or whatever the cap is yet?
11541696	11542236	23, 24, something like that.
11542397	11543057	You're getting there.
11543377	11544598	You play a hero or a villain?
11545752	11546393	Hero right now.
11546573	11547234	Hero right now.
11547274	11548355	And who's your mentor?
11550817	11551217	Wonder Woman.
11551718	11552939	Oh yeah, mine was Wonder Woman too.
11554000	11556843	Because she's awesome.
11556863	11561467	What do you think of that whole Wonder Woman pilot that I guess is being sold to NBC?
11561527	11563069	This is the kind of thing you talk about on your show, right?
11563089	11564470	What do you think about the Wonder Woman pilot?
11565471	11567633	Well, I'm interested in seeing it.
11569648	11593701	it's true you gotta see it before you can really make a judgment I guess that's true you know there's some revivals you kind of like raise your eyebrow at and you're like really kind of like the Knight Rider one was kind of like really but then like Battlestar Galactica like I'm sorry it was way better than the original like way better oh no no in my big fat geek opinion it was better but I understand there's still a lot of love for the original too I love the new one though oh my gosh
11594335	11597758	How can you not like a chimpanzee in a robot dog costume?
11598219	11598859	Where do I begin?
11600080	11603584	You know, I almost bought DC Universe this week.
11603644	11607387	I had the PS3 copy in my hand, and I was like, I should buy this.
11608088	11608708	Yes, you should.
11609269	11610930	Maybe I shouldn't.
11611371	11611531	Right?
11611571	11612231	We were at Target.
11612252	11614073	We went shopping.
11614253	11614914	Go for it, man.
11615174	11617356	But I just wanted to call in and say congratulations.
11617376	11617797	You guys have...
11619264	11619944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11647282	11648002	It's DragonCon.
11648022	11649223	You wouldn't have to look too damn far.
11649523	11649823	All right.
11650003	11651524	DragonCon has a little bit of everything.
11651984	11652305	Oh, yeah.
11652925	11654506	Bobby would like it if we went out to DragonCon.
11654526	11655406	That's in his backyard.
11655426	11656326	I know.
11656347	11656787	We would be.
11657487	11657847	I know.
11657987	11659108	We could crash at Bobby's.
11659908	11660689	We could go to Bobby's.
11661869	11662109	All right.
11662469	11662830	Brad.
11663150	11665751	Which was the name of a Supernatural episode this season.
11665891	11666511	Oh, you nerd.
11666551	11666812	All right.
11667052	11668232	Brad, thanks so much for the call.
11668252	11668733	Have a good one.
11669133	11669733	You too, guys.
11669773	11670053	Later.
11672534	11672935	All right.
11674135	11675496	Should we do one more call?
11677205	11683468	Yes Alright, we'll do one more call We just can't stop Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
11685749	11688130	Legend of Zaku What's on your mind, my friend?
11689331	11706379	First of all, I'd like to say happy 400th to you guys Happy 400th to us Thank you Happy 400th to you too, Zaku You've been here for a lot of it, so thank you Yeah, at least a good 80, you know, like 75% of it But yeah Good enough
11706989	11714273	Alright, let me see, I'm trying to think, because I've been out of like the whole, you know, I've been out of like the recent gaming news, aside from that new PSP announced.
11714974	11726941	But I mean, from what I heard, a lot of the devs are just like, you know, they're creaming in their pants over how it's like, you know, like a generation ahead of the current smartphones out there.
11727901	11733905	Which just, which, you know, the way I see it, they're just paying a lot of lip service to Sony.
11735086	11746532	I mean that's the whole point is it because right now there have to be nimble against not only Apple but whoever else is releasing any new Android tabs that could just rival what Sony's going to end up releasing.
11748032	11750494	I mean we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
11750534	11755816	We really don't know how the new NGP will perform when they release it.
11756357	11762820	But I can tell you this, I mean dual core phones are going to be here in a little bit.
11764011	11774988	So you're going to have all these game developers, the ones that are not targeting the PXP, the ones that have targeted the iPhones and high-end Android phones, they're going to have to start capitalizing it.
11775028	11777092	So that way, you know, they have...
11777785	11778586	and so on and so forth.
11800769	11807590	With iPhone 5, I'm sure, kind of like a hybrid thing for AT&T and Verizon on its way in the summer.
11807710	11809691	So, I mean, it's just crazy times.
11811351	11817192	Verizon only got the hand-me-downs, per se.
11817232	11820673	AT&T still has a ton of exclusives now.
11821433	11826795	Whenever a new iPhone comes out, Verizon will get it months afterwards.
11827075	11828915	Well, too early to tell.
11830865	11836968	But so far, that's the indication that I've seen so far that, you know, AT&T will still have it.
11837228	11841810	It doesn't have its, like, you know, full exclusivity, like, it's the only carrier where you can buy it.
11842190	11846572	So it'll probably have what, you know, they'll have, like, a compromised, like, a timed exclusive.
11847232	11857397	But you do realize that, you know, as I said, Google's already, you know, already has, like, Android 3.0 out, which is, like, their tablet version, which is supposed to, like,
11858188	11865476	Harold in the era of $300 tablets that pretty much rivaled the iPad for a matchup to that.
11876325	11882427	They just have to bring something that you can't really get on an iPhone or high-end Android phone.
11882827	11889009	Basically, something that not only surpasses PS2, but just barely touches PS3 graphics.
11889349	11891469	Something that melts faces with awesomeness.
11892930	11893310	Exactly.
11893370	11899072	Well, you need something that's kind of a hybrid in between the PS2 and the 360.
11899592	11902953	If you get that on a small package like an NGP,
11904457	11908138	and you're pretty much a step ahead of the competition.
11908638	11910558	Last question, Zaku.
11910758	11911958	Do you think they'll succeed?
11911978	11923401	Sony, I mean, the way I see it is that they never had this much heat from anyone outside of Nintendo.
11924001	11931282	Because now that Apple's creeping up, you know, Apple and the other manufacturers are creeping up, they have to, like,
11932350	11934751	You know, they have to make sure they hit another home run.
11935411	11942334	The PSP sold really well, but there are more iPhones out there than PSPs, and that's a fact.
11942374	11943834	There are more Android phones out there.
11944415	11948516	There's a lot more high-end smartphones than people who have PSPs.
11948636	11949997	Well, we will see.
11950397	11955079	Buddy, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.
11955259	11956279	Take care, my friend.
11956799	11957740	We'll see you on episode 700.
11960469	11961270	Yeah, definitely.
11987321	11998255	Pax East, DragonCon, Pax Prime, ASEN I do want to go to ASEN We dug out actually all of my old costumes and I found my Tamari fan
12000184	12002765	WonderCon Season Comic-Con
12026502	12027783	I have a friend that goes every year.
12027983	12028203	Really?
12028484	12028944	Yeah.
12029384	12030806	Then again, she works in the industry.
12031526	12031826	Alright.
12032407	12034408	I'd have to get some help from my friends over there.
12034889	12040233	AkumaJP, Kitsune, somebody might need some help if I were to come out there for Tokyo Game Show.
12041374	12046138	Because you guys can clearly tell I can't even read the Japanese release dates right.
12048000	12049741	I'd have problems navigating around there.
12050188	12051729	Alright, that's going to do it.
12051769	12053809	We've got to wrap up episode 400 of this show.
12053869	12055350	Sadly, it's not a marathon tonight.
12055390	12056590	We can't go all night long.
12056891	12058591	But thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight.
12059011	12059772	Got to go around, though.
12059972	12061652	I'm assuming all the last minute news is done.
12063113	12065834	If so, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
12066694	12067855	So, Loki, we'll start with you.
12067895	12068635	Your final thought tonight.
12070315	12071596	Galgan's a weird game.
12071696	12075297	Hope I don't get visited by Chris Hansen.
12075377	12082980	Salacious Pop, since you have the microphone, thank you so much for being here tonight in this very special episode because you're a special guy.
12084621	12085901	Any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?
12087498	12091340	I'm eagerly anticipating our trip to the Noodle House after this.
12091921	12092681	Are you hungry?
12093361	12093601	Yeah.
12093842	12094542	Alright, that's alright.
12095302	12097304	Arcadian, thank you for being here.
12097464	12099004	Appreciate your support as always.
12099024	12105288	You've kind of been there since day one as well, way back in the Arvigil days, so you've watched us grow up right in front of your eyes.
12106989	12108250	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
12108550	12111872	I'll go over what my game of 2010 was, and that was Nier.
12111892	12116154	It has a very good story, very good characters, and very good music, and
12116534	12117214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
12145640	12151106	Yeah, and one thing about it is that the female character swears in almost every scene she's in.
12151986	12155290	And I think it's something that would appeal more to older players than younger players.
12155370	12157672	Younger players probably wouldn't like the story as much.
12159454	12165460	Some of the characterizations probably wouldn't really ring true to them or wouldn't really kind of mix with their experience.
12165580	12168042	But older people would probably think would like it a lot more.
12168943	12169883	Alright, so noted.
12170724	12172804	That's a hell of a final thought, but I'll have to check that game out.
12173745	12180527	My final thought is, gosh, A, I could use some Pinkberry, but sadly they're closed.
12181227	12189190	And B, thank you guys for listening for the past 400 episodes, or whenever you joined, even if this week was your first show.
12189890	12190851	Thank you so much for listening.
12191431	12192411	DarkSakura, your final thought?
12192671	12193772	Baskin-Robbins is open.
12195492	12197033	We get an afterbirth to do still.
12197389	12199871	Alright, thank you guys so much for downloading our show.
12199951	12200791	Thank you for tuning in.
12200832	12203173	Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
12203513	12207756	I mean, as we kind of joked about earlier in the show, we're not the biggest show on the internet.
12208077	12210639	We don't have millions of dollars backing it up.
12211039	12216743	We stay here every week though because of you guys and no corporation can put a stop to that.
12217063	12234862	so thank you guys so much for your support if you like what you hear just tell friends about the show it's word of mouth really helps leave us a nice five star review on iTunes we haven't gotten one of those in like months so we would definitely appreciate some of those or whatever podcasty program you used to listen it would be most appreciated
12235322	12252732	thank you guys so much and guess what just because tonight was a landmark show episode 400 doesn't mean it's over yet we'll be back to do it all again next week here at Orange Lounge Radio episode 401 goodnight everybody you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
