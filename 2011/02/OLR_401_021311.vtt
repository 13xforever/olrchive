00:00.000 --> 00:19.080
Today, February 13th, 2011, there will be no more hero games at Activision.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.680
A survey hints at details on Dance Central 2, and could your PlayStation 3 games soon

00:23.680 --> 00:32.160
require a serial number registration?

00:32.160 --> 00:35.160
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.160 --> 00:38.340
where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:38.340 --> 00:42.760
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.480
First up, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
Hi.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.120
How are you, Miss Sommers?

00:48.120 --> 00:49.760
I am dropping stuff.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.760
Oh no.

00:50.760 --> 00:56.200
That's not a good way to start off the 401st episode of our show into the next 100.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
Think we'll make it to 500?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
Sure.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Why not?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
Why not?

01:00.200 --> 01:01.200
Exactly.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
I got nothing else to do.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
I got nothing better to do.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Why not?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
All right.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Hello.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
All right.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
How are you, Loki?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
I'm fine.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
Good.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
Good to hear.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
How's the baby doing?

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
It's doing okay.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.520
I enjoy reading the wife's blogs about the baby.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.880
That's interesting because I don't have a child, but it seems like everybody around

01:20.880 --> 01:25.000
me, not everybody, but many people around me are starting to enter that, take that step.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
It's kind of interesting to hear the stories.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.760
You will see posts once a month.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.280
And it just reminds me, I'm getting old.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.680
So have you thought about what the baby's first video game should be?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.720
Well, he's already played Grand Theft Auto, so.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.120
Wait a minute.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.200
You let your baby play Grand Theft Auto?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Yeah.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.960
He can't really hold the controller well, but he had it at the point where he had one

01:45.960 --> 01:50.520
hand on the left analog stick and the other hand on the trigger and he was driving around.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.080
So technically that is playing Grand Theft Auto.

01:54.080 --> 02:01.120
Granted, he doesn't know what he's doing, but he had an Xbox 360 controller and he played.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.720
He didn't kill anything.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.240
He just was driving around.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.360
That's a story to tell him when he's like 13.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.520
Did you know your first game was Grand Theft Auto?

02:10.520 --> 02:16.280
Because by then they'll be up to Grand Theft Auto 17 or whatever.

02:16.280 --> 02:20.640
Anyhow, let's also introduce the ever-present fourth guest on our show.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.480
We don't have anybody else in the studio tonight, sadly, but we do have of course the chat room.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.960
We are the show where every gamer has a voice and have been that way since 2002.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.040
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be if you want to join us in our chat room.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.360
We do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after

02:37.360 --> 02:40.760
the Bobby Black Wolf show, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.120
But if you want to join our chat room, you can do that at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.580
What's this?

02:46.580 --> 02:47.580
You took video.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.580
Oh my.

02:48.580 --> 02:52.600
You actually have a little picture of Josh playing the 360 controller.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.600
That is adorable.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.200
That is really adorable.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.080
By the way, my secondary theme for tonight's show.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
What's that?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
That's so cute.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
What's that, Darcy?

03:02.080 --> 03:04.640
Is posting random stuff in the chat room.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.480
posting random stuff in the chat room just because?

03:07.480 --> 03:14.460
Yeah I found a neat article in Cracked about Easter eggs hidden in albums and I think we

03:14.460 --> 03:18.720
need to start doing Easter eggs in our episodes.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
Our episodes need...

03:19.720 --> 03:23.760
Like we have an epic burp and you run it through a spectrograph and it's a picture of a puppy.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.720
We need to have a wrong answer of the show actually to steal a bit from the new You Don't

03:28.720 --> 03:31.720
Know Jack game, which we'll get into in a little bit because it is that time of the

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
show.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.720
How was your gaming week?

03:33.720 --> 03:36.920
My gaming week was good.

03:36.920 --> 03:47.600
I played on my Worgen, who I'm actually doing the leveling stuff, like the profession leveling,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.840
which makes real leveling so much slower.

03:50.840 --> 03:55.000
Seriously, I'm like, this is why I didn't do this crap before.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.760
Of course now I'm doing all that crap on my level 85 character, so I'm like ehh.

04:02.760 --> 04:08.400
I also have Final Fantasy III on the DS, which is pretty cool so far.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.880
I'm very happy with it.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.560
Wow, it's a couple years old at this point, which no problem with that.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.720
I mean sometimes we don't get around to playing games for years, so that happens.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.280
But what put you in the mood?

04:20.280 --> 04:23.880
Just you're like, I want an RPG where I can fight or run.

04:23.880 --> 04:29.560
We were at Dimple and we had some leftover credit because we traded in a ton of our old

04:29.560 --> 04:32.460
DVDs that we had either replaced or just were crap.

04:32.460 --> 04:36.280
Local music chain, by the way, which also sells games used new.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.140
So we were like, well, let's just go ahead and use up our credit.

04:38.140 --> 04:41.240
So I picked a game and Dan picked a game and then we said, well, let's use our discount

04:41.240 --> 04:42.240
card.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.120
It turned out we still had $5 left when we were done because we thought we were using

04:46.120 --> 04:47.120
it all up.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.360
So we still have credit there, so I guess we're going to go back and get that again.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.320
I still have no idea what the discount card's for.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.360
I probably have like a ton of stuff on that card.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.400
You get like a random 50% off on your purchases or something.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.800
Am I a bad person because I don't really shop at music stores anymore.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.440
Not since Tower Records went under.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.800
You know, that was, that was my chain was Tower Records.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.680
I used to buy import CDs from Tower Records.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.600
This is before the Interwebs or when Interwebs was all dial up, right?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.360
When, when Orange Tons Radio had a 56k friendly stream, right?

05:13.360 --> 05:14.360
That's that was a while ago.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.440
That's when I was shopping at Tower Records before they went under and maybe Virgin Megastore

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
once in a while.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.580
Oh, Virgin was awesome for import CDs, but now I have an activator at Virgin.

05:22.580 --> 05:25.440
When I buy CDs, like it's Best Buy.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.160
Does that make me a bad person?

05:27.160 --> 05:30.700
When I buy CDs, I go on Amazon.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.960
And I buy the MP3 downloads.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.040
If I bought, if I want them that badly.

05:36.040 --> 05:39.620
Actually this might make me really bad, but the last CD I bought was the Tron soundtrack.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.620
I bought that at Target.

05:41.620 --> 05:47.160
So well actually the last CD that I bought was the Tron soundtrack and I bought it on

05:47.160 --> 05:48.160
Amazon.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.080
So there we go.

05:51.080 --> 05:56.520
I like having the MP3s, you know, we are trying to downsize our packaging.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.520
This is perfect.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.280
And on top of that, Amazon tends to have like $5 specials, like they had CeeLo Green's album

06:03.280 --> 06:06.200
for $5.

06:06.200 --> 06:14.000
And they're all DRM free on top of it, which is, I mean now iTunes is too and you can convert

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
from their format, but it really is just super convenient to get it all on Amazon.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah I was, I was playing some Final Fantasy III while I was waiting around for stuff.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.080
And I started Oregon Trail today and I'm like, oh, the Facebook one?

06:32.080 --> 06:33.080
I didn't like it.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.280
I played it for like five seconds and I was like, this just, this is overcomplicating

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
it.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
This game has died of dysentery.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
Exactly.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
I think that's the best way to put it.

06:40.280 --> 06:46.160
The thing that gets it is that buying the tickets, now I'll just go download an Apple

06:46.160 --> 06:48.040
MU and play it that way.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.720
The magic is gone.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
The magic is kind of gone.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.400
I have some friends that are into it on Facebook.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
That's cool.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
That's what you're into.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
Look, I have no right to judge anyone.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.240
I've been playing that Knights of the Clicky game for forever, although I haven't touched

06:58.240 --> 07:01.080
it in like a week, but I wasn't feeling Oregon Trail.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
I'm three weeks clean on it, Rob.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.080
Are you really?

07:03.080 --> 07:05.000
You should get like a sober sticker for that.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
That's amazing.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Good for you.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.880
Um, speaking, rewinding the MMOs a bit, like I don't want to dwell on wow too much, but

07:11.880 --> 07:15.200
I will tell you one thing I've kind of been looking at as a lot of Warcraft players and

07:15.200 --> 07:18.560
other MMO players have been looking at, there's this new game coming out called Rift.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.600
Have you read it at all about this game?

07:20.600 --> 07:24.040
Is it like based based off of the tabletop rifts?

07:24.040 --> 07:30.120
I'm not sure because I don't know enough about that scene, but look at some of the YouTubes

07:30.120 --> 07:32.480
on Rift and tell me what you think.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.200
Also while you're at it, look at videos because we were doing this the other night.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.400
Look at videos for Guild Wars 2 and tell me what you think because I played Guild Wars

07:39.400 --> 07:40.400
for a while.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.800
Guild Wars 2 much different than Guild Wars 1.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.520
Take a look and see if either of those might woo you from wow for a little bit.

07:47.520 --> 07:52.440
Well, it better not because Dan doesn't want to buy any more games.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.560
Well the good news is Rift has an open beta starting like really really soon.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.240
So take a look at those while we talk about it.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.160
Look at some of the videos on YouTube, especially some of the PVP looks really pretty.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.240
I know you're not into PVP, but it has both.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.520
I've started doing PVP.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.520
Have you really?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.520
Well I've done the battles.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.520
Oh.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
I need to get you back on Horde House and talk about that.

08:09.520 --> 08:15.860
Because our friend and listener got me PVP gear.

08:15.860 --> 08:16.860
Good times.

08:16.860 --> 08:17.860
Good times.

08:17.860 --> 08:18.860
Alright.

08:18.860 --> 08:19.860
Let's move on to Loki.

08:19.860 --> 08:20.860
How was your gaming week?

08:20.860 --> 08:22.480
Didn't play a whole lot this week.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.760
Mainly just a few things, sword and poker too.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.820
Still playing that in iOS and it's this last dungeon taking forever, but it's fun still

08:32.820 --> 08:38.640
and I just unlocked more weapons I can buy, but they're really expensive so I have to

08:38.640 --> 08:41.860
grind some more dungeons for that.

08:41.860 --> 08:47.880
And then I played Marvel vs. Capcom 3, a little bit of that.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.120
Yeah, that too.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.040
That's an awesome, awesome, awesome game.

08:53.040 --> 08:58.680
I'm not very good at those types of games, but it is somewhat button masher friendly.

08:58.680 --> 09:04.720
I wouldn't say I'm just like a button masher, but I don't have any real strategy into it,

09:04.720 --> 09:05.720
you know?

09:05.720 --> 09:09.840
It's just like, okay I know the basic moves and stuff like that.

09:09.840 --> 09:10.840
Let's see what happens.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.400
I feel it out.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.160
No like 50 hit combos for me or anything like that.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.040
Did you say you're just feeling it up?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
Feeling it out.

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
Okay, I was gonna say, cause there's some pretty, you know, boobtastic characters in

09:21.040 --> 09:22.040
there.

09:22.040 --> 09:27.800
Um, and then, you know, Grant the thought of, you know, usual.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.800
That's a must for you.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.800
Exactly.

09:29.800 --> 09:36.360
I will replay that at work, so, you know, obviously I'm gonna play more of that.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.360
Alright, that it?

09:37.360 --> 09:40.480
Um, I think so.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.840
Let me go to the chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.880
I was just noticing there real quick, the dwarven women don't look like men.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.880
You're watching a video for Rift, I see.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.440
Actually, I wanted to talk about it, cause our chatters are now mentioning the game.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.160
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com starts us off saying, the MMO Rift is not

09:57.160 --> 10:02.520
based off the PnP1 Dark Soccer, I'm assuming that means pen and paper, but I think it's

10:02.520 --> 10:07.960
being sued because of the name, so there's a whole little Rift going on there.

10:07.960 --> 10:14.760
But, really though, I don't think they have our thing, because the game is Rift, and it's

10:14.760 --> 10:19.880
abbreviated, and this is just Rift.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.120
Derek H., our pal from Dead Pixel Live, also on the All Games Network, wants to plug, he

10:24.120 --> 10:27.960
actually had the executive producer of Rift on last week, so if you want to check that

10:27.960 --> 10:33.520
out at deadpixellive.com, you can hear that whole little interview.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.840
How did he get all these big name interviews when we weren't looking?

10:36.840 --> 10:37.840
That's pretty awesome.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
Good for you.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.680
Let's see, chat.orangelandradio.com for more comments here.

10:42.680 --> 10:46.680
Ziba is saying, I am loving Rift and can't wait for Guild Wars 2.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.680
So both those games are getting a lot of buzz.

10:48.680 --> 10:54.640
And of course, everybody's always gonna ask, which one of these is gonna be the WoW killer?

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
Probably neither.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.280
I'll tell you, you know what, I will tell you what the WoW killer will ultimately be.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.980
I can already tell you, I will look at my crystal ball, I will tell you what game is

11:02.980 --> 11:03.980
the WoW killer.

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
You ready?

11:04.980 --> 11:05.980
WoW 2?

11:05.980 --> 11:06.980
No, WoW.

11:06.980 --> 11:07.980
WoW 2?

11:07.980 --> 11:08.980
Yeah.

11:08.980 --> 11:09.980
WoW is the WoW killer.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.880
Wait and see.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.200
That sounds very suicidal.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.960
Well, no, because, well, who?

11:16.960 --> 11:17.960
More like a...

11:17.960 --> 11:19.180
How did the Roman Empire fall?

11:19.180 --> 11:21.180
Because the Roman Empire.

11:21.180 --> 11:27.560
More to quote an old Loki quote, an old old Loki quote, ow, I just shot myself in the

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
foot.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.280
Why are you shooting me in the foot?

11:30.280 --> 11:31.560
Rob, can I pet this?

11:31.560 --> 11:34.560
Oh, is that Guild Wars 2 now you're looking at?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
Yes.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.520
It's a great radio, by the way, when you're sitting there going, ooh, pretty.

11:37.520 --> 11:41.400
You should post some of those links in chat just so people can take a peek for themselves.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.600
No, you have to imagine it.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.640
This place makes Stormwind look like an easy to navigate one lane street.

11:48.640 --> 11:53.480
All right, let me talk about my gaming week and some of the games I play this week.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.480
Mostly the same type of stuff, it's been somewhat of a slow month in gaming, just like it has

11:57.480 --> 11:58.480
been movies.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.560
There's not been a lot of new stuff, so, you know, more WoW, yeah, okay.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.780
But I did play one new game.

12:02.780 --> 12:06.040
One game kind of came out and it was kind of one of those blink and you might have missed

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
it games.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.760
I played You Don't Know Jack, the brand new game that just came out from THQ with Jellyvision,

12:11.760 --> 12:14.600
of course, who made the old You Don't Know Jack.

12:14.600 --> 12:18.240
So maybe it's not really a brand new game because it's more like, hey, remember the

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
90s?

12:19.240 --> 12:20.760
Because these games were huge in the 90s.

12:20.760 --> 12:25.240
You Don't Know Jack and You Don't Know Jack the Ride, which I want to say originally was

12:25.240 --> 12:27.040
a Sierra thing.

12:27.040 --> 12:28.520
I could be wrong on that.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.960
Somebody might correct me on that in the chat room.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.760
But that could explain why the long hiatus.

12:33.760 --> 12:38.400
But regardless of how it happened, THQ has now put out a You Don't Know Jack game for

12:38.400 --> 12:41.760
the current generation of consoles and it's everywhere.

12:41.760 --> 12:47.200
It's PC, it's 360, PlayStation, it's everywhere.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.320
And the 360 is the version I played and I was at a little party with some friends last

12:51.320 --> 12:54.240
night and we were playing the new You Don't Know Jack game.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.840
And the good news is it is pretty much what I remember.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.640
It is a funny, quick, polished trivia game.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.840
Lots of jokes, just kind of like run one after the other.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.520
That almost kind of dry sense of humor.

13:07.520 --> 13:12.440
I don't want to say British sense of humor, not that dry, but just really like no nonstop

13:12.440 --> 13:13.440
pun after pun.

13:13.440 --> 13:18.720
And there's these weird kind of like pop culture references to the whole thing and a lot of

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
it's very current.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.760
Like, what is the internet love more than anything right now?

13:22.760 --> 13:23.760
Kitties.

13:23.760 --> 13:29.560
So there's, you know, this whole bonus game, I will say, or a themed question that involves

13:29.560 --> 13:32.440
kittens acting out a movie and you have to guess what movie it is.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.480
It's really funny.

13:33.480 --> 13:39.360
So yeah, a lot of that same old humor, same announcer that they had back in the day, Cookie,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.560
is still there.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.400
The game is 30 bucks, so it's a nice little deal.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.200
73 episodes for 30 bucks.

13:48.200 --> 13:52.760
So that is a little bit like, oh, I kind of thought these games had more questions in

13:52.760 --> 13:53.760
the nineties.

13:53.760 --> 13:58.840
So that is a little bit of a tiny step back because it's 73 episodes for 30 bucks.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.840
So what, 50 cents an episode, 40 cents an episode maybe?

14:02.840 --> 14:04.640
You can also download expansions.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.360
I believe three are planned right now.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.180
One is up already, 10 more episodes for five bucks.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.380
So that is 50 cents an episode.

14:11.380 --> 14:17.800
So the value of this game, I would really ask you how much value you're going to get

14:17.800 --> 14:19.480
in like a party atmosphere.

14:19.480 --> 14:23.760
Now the good news is you can play this on Xbox Live, but I think this would be the absolute

14:23.760 --> 14:28.560
worst possible game you could play on Xbox Live with strangers.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.560
I really do.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.360
I think it would suck all the fun out of the game because you know you're going to have

14:32.360 --> 14:36.660
people out there with a finite number of episodes who already know the answers to all the questions

14:36.660 --> 14:37.660
and so on.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.240
I just think that part, it might be a little bit ridiculous.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.660
However, playing with trusted friends, I think it could be a great Xbox Live game.

14:44.660 --> 14:49.200
So one of those, and of course when I say Xbox Live, obviously PlayStation has its comparable

14:49.200 --> 14:50.200
thing.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.320
PC does not, which I find very interesting, but that's why the PC version is only 20 bucks.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.320
So even more value there.

14:56.320 --> 15:01.240
And also, I mean, there's not a lot of people that would play that multiplayer on a PC.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.720
You know, wouldn't it be kind of hard to play that multiplayer on a PC?

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
No, not really.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
It's where I play my WoW.

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
So it's...

15:06.720 --> 15:10.500
Yeah, but I meant like, you know, with friends, you know what I mean?

15:10.500 --> 15:14.040
There's no real, you're not going to have like four controllers or something like that,

15:14.040 --> 15:15.040
you know?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.040
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
I get what you're saying.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
Yeah.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.760
It's a little tough there, I guess.

15:19.760 --> 15:20.760
I don't know.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
I don't own the PC versions.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.760
I don't know how they do it.

15:22.760 --> 15:23.920
I don't know if you can have the little buzzers or whatever.

15:23.920 --> 15:29.040
I do hear, though, on the PlayStation 3 version, you can use the actual game buzz controllers

15:29.040 --> 15:30.640
and you don't know Jack, which is nice.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.640
That's cool.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.800
You can get a little more use out of those things.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.880
I think single player will only be funny for so long.

15:36.880 --> 15:41.720
The good news is it is a funny game, so you'll get your lols out of it.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.120
But I think the game works best in a party atmosphere.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.880
So I think the question would really be, are you going to be able to bring this to a party

15:48.880 --> 15:50.720
and get use out of this?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.440
If so, it might be worth your money.

15:52.440 --> 15:58.040
And I think it's been mildly successful so far, because I mean, it sold okay, but it's

15:58.040 --> 16:01.840
something I could figure that will probably drop in price relatively quickly.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.400
Something to keep in the back of your mind, the way they did the episodes is a little

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
weird.

16:06.400 --> 16:11.400
If you take your game from place to place, you're more likely to see repeats, so just

16:11.400 --> 16:12.520
be careful.

16:12.520 --> 16:17.660
If you really want to be smart, copy your game data to a memory card or a USB stick

16:17.660 --> 16:19.840
if you're going to take the game from place to place.

16:19.840 --> 16:22.980
That way the game remembers what episodes you've already seen, otherwise you're really

16:22.980 --> 16:24.760
setting yourself up for repeats.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.600
The game is pretty good about knowing which episodes you've already seen, especially if

16:27.600 --> 16:29.400
you're going to go on Xbox Live.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.640
But if you take it from one place to another, it's not going to know, because it's a new

16:33.640 --> 16:34.960
Xbox, right?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.640
And there's nothing to read from.

16:36.640 --> 16:42.320
So you're going to see repeats, because you only have so many episodes in the beginning.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.160
So I just kind of wanted to throw that out there, just a word of caution.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.820
The way they did that is a little weird.

16:47.820 --> 16:53.760
So You Don't Know Jack, very polished, very funny, constant giggles from the group we

16:53.760 --> 16:55.020
were playing with.

16:55.020 --> 17:00.840
I think it's a good value, you know, 50 cents for a game is, you know, gosh, you go to Dave

17:00.840 --> 17:04.960
and Busters and throw them way money faster than that on those stupid crane games or skeeball

17:04.960 --> 17:05.960
or whatever.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.320
So I think it's a decent value.

17:08.320 --> 17:14.040
Maybe a few more questions for the buck or maybe a different way to randomize them or

17:14.040 --> 17:16.080
something, maybe could be the feedback.

17:16.080 --> 17:20.560
But I will save that for You Don't Know Jack 2, which I do hope happens at this point,

17:20.560 --> 17:22.660
or whatever they're going to end up calling it.

17:22.660 --> 17:26.180
So I definitely give the game a favorable review, especially if you like these game

17:26.180 --> 17:27.300
show games.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.720
This blows that seen it shit out of the water.

17:30.720 --> 17:36.160
Like seriously, like this is the like definitive trivia party game.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.520
The only possible contender maybe is Buzz on the PS3.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.400
And if you have the Xbox, you don't really have that.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.360
So this this blows that seen it shit out of the water.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.720
This is much better.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.080
So take a look.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.740
Anyhow, that was really it for my gaming week.

17:49.740 --> 17:53.080
So let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.960
Some housekeeping.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.400
There was some I don't want to say late breaking news, but it just happened a little earlier.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.340
We're competing against the Grammys tonight.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.500
You know, last week it was the Super Bowl.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.080
Tonight it's the Grammys and two weeks.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.080
It's what the Oscars.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.560
It's like we just can't fucking wait.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.840
But no one cares about everything is on Sunday.

18:08.840 --> 18:12.180
So every all the good stuff is going to be on YouTube if you want to see Gaga hatch out

18:12.180 --> 18:13.180
of an egg.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.180
It'll be on YouTube later.

18:14.180 --> 18:19.080
I need to think of a good name to call the Grammys because I have the Super Bowl.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.080
Yeah.

18:20.080 --> 18:25.040
So Grammys should be the shammy's.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.980
I like Kathy Griffin's the shmemmies or whatever.

18:27.980 --> 18:28.980
That's for the daytime Emmys.

18:28.980 --> 18:29.980
Yeah, exactly.

18:29.980 --> 18:32.040
Or the this the technical ones or whatever.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.760
Anyway, besides by the way, speaking Kathy Griffin, just because I love that bitch.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.000
I got to give a shout out.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.640
She hears she's going to have a brand new show on Broadway, really.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.880
It's only going to be on for like a week in March, but it's called Ready.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.540
Best name for a show ever ready.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.240
Kathy Griffin wants a Tony.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.040
Anyhow, but this isn't the Kathy Griffin podcast.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
I love her.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.980
She's just really fucking funny.

18:54.980 --> 18:57.160
I will listen to her like stand up while I play.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.160
Wow.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.160
Like I listen to a lot of random stuff.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.160
I play.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.160
I listen to podcasts.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
Wow.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.160
I listen to wow.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
Podcast while I play.

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
Wow.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.160
It's very meta.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
Whole thing.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Very meta.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.160
Anyway.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.080
Like like when I was in Blade's Edge and we were on Blade's Edge.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.080
Yes.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.080
Very meta.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.080
What was I going to say?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
Oh yeah.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.080
The Grammys.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.080
That song won a Grammy.

19:19.080 --> 19:23.640
The Baba Yetu from Civilization 4, which is a really great song if you've never heard

19:23.640 --> 19:24.640
it.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.640
I'll have to fire up a clip here.

19:25.640 --> 19:26.640
I wasn't really prepared to play it.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.640
Oops.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.240
It won a Grammy, which is funny because the song is actually kind of old.

19:30.240 --> 19:35.640
Like it's been out for a little while because Civilization 4 was kind of what it was written

19:35.640 --> 19:36.640
for.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.640
But here's how it works.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.960
You see, it didn't win for being in Civilization 4.

19:39.960 --> 19:47.720
The artist, Christopher Tin, put it in his recent CD that he released and the CD, the

19:47.720 --> 19:51.800
song from the CD won and I believe he actually won a Grammy for the whole CD as well.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.280
He won two Grammys tonight.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.800
So here's a clip if you've never heard this.

19:55.800 --> 20:00.220
Like seriously, if you haven't played Civilization 4, A, you're missing one of the best pieces

20:00.220 --> 20:05.320
of PC games ever, and B, you haven't had a chance to just sit on the title screen and

20:05.320 --> 20:06.320
listen to this.

20:06.320 --> 20:22.600
This song just kind of like make you feel like, oh yeah, I'm going to rule the world.

20:22.600 --> 20:33.200
This is going to be a military victory game.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.080
Oh my God, this is offensive to Islam.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.080
Shut up.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.600
That was a little big planet.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
My mistake.

20:39.600 --> 20:44.680
Anyhow, by the way, if you've never played Civilization, you are missing out.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.480
It really is like the greatest frickin' one of the, one of, I shouldn't say the greatest,

20:48.480 --> 20:51.840
but one of the greatest game series there is.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.520
And I even think, like, if you're like a console, you're like, I don't do games on PC, maybe,

20:56.520 --> 20:57.680
wow, that's it.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.800
Even the console games are really worth your time, and I think they're great entry-level

21:00.800 --> 21:02.320
Civilization games anyway.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.320
But I digress.

21:03.320 --> 21:08.000
Congratulations, Christopher Tin, on his two Grammys, which is, if you think about it,

21:08.000 --> 21:11.200
kind of the first time that a song written for a video game has ended up winning a Grammy,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.160
even if it took a weird way to get there.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.160
So congrats.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.160
That's amazing.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.200
All right, let's get into some more video game news tonight, the stuff that's not late-breaking

21:19.200 --> 21:21.520
but still is going on in the world of gaming this week.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.800
Loki's gonna start us off, as always.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.800
Yeah.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.120
Okay, so this is kind of funny, and although it was fixed, and I'm sure that the person

21:29.120 --> 21:35.560
that runs Kevin, you know, runs Kevin Butler's fake account for the fake person probably

21:35.560 --> 21:37.480
didn't understand what was going on here.

21:37.480 --> 21:47.200
But anyways, the person that ran the Kevin Butler on Twitter accidentally reposted the

21:47.200 --> 21:51.680
key for, or one of the keys to the PlayStation 3.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.840
Remember the whole lawsuit going on, because the keys got leaked out.

21:54.840 --> 22:00.840
Anyways, this is the key that turned out to be one used in the hack through the USB dong,

22:00.840 --> 22:03.680
which I don't think anyone even really uses anymore.

22:03.680 --> 22:10.320
But nonetheless, they retweeted it, so let me guess, you sank my battleship, and then

22:10.320 --> 22:13.240
they retweeted the key.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
So it was...

22:14.240 --> 22:15.240
46DC.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.240
Oh, forget it.

22:16.240 --> 22:21.880
Yeah, so, of course, you know, it was later removed off the Twitter account, but it is

22:21.880 --> 22:22.880
still funny.

22:22.880 --> 22:27.600
Kind of like, oh, hey, someone's not paying attention.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.480
Hopefully no one got fired over it, but, you know, still funny.

22:31.480 --> 22:37.240
Well, like, if you don't know what it is, which I'm sure whoever runs this account on

22:37.240 --> 22:41.000
behalf of the Kevin Butler character probably didn't know what it was.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.600
I mean, you know, if I didn't do this show, I wouldn't know what that is.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.720
Actually, even doing this show, I would look at that and go, why is someone speaking to

22:47.720 --> 22:48.720
me in hex?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.000
Like, what is your problem?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.600
Exactly, and it doesn't even look, I mean, come on.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.920
That does not look anything like battleship numbers.

22:57.920 --> 23:04.120
Well, I mean, but if you're kind of that snarky character that Kevin Butler's supposed to

23:04.120 --> 23:07.800
be, it does look like that a little bit, so.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.960
Huge Sony faux pas, or they'll get over...

23:09.960 --> 23:15.040
I think that the funnier thing about this is that all these blogs are reporting on it

23:15.040 --> 23:17.200
with a screenshot of the tweet.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.840
So now the tweet has been seen by, like, ten times as many people as would have seen it

23:20.840 --> 23:22.640
originally.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.560
I don't know why it's really funny, but it is.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.560
It's irony, Rob.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
There you go.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
Irony.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.240
So, before we get into the next story, I got derailed by something in the chat room.

23:32.240 --> 23:36.360
I just think this is kind of neat, like, I only have kind of heard of this.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.080
Like, have you ever heard of this thing called Get Glue?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
I've never...

23:40.080 --> 23:41.080
It's like a Foursquare.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.160
Imagine, like, Foursquare for just stuff.

23:44.160 --> 23:49.600
Like a video game you're playing, or you could check in if, I mean, you know how Foursquare

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
works?

23:50.600 --> 23:51.920
You check in to, like...

23:51.920 --> 23:53.240
And then you cheat while you're driving by?

23:53.240 --> 23:57.920
I'm at Pinkberry, and I'm checking in so I can be the mayor, and if my friends are nearby,

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
I'll get a text message.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.520
Well, now they have this thing called Get Glue where you can check into movies you're

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
watching or whatever.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.560
I just got told that Orange Lawn's Radio has a Get Glue page, and we have people that check

24:06.560 --> 24:08.560
in to listening to this on Sunday night.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.040
I just thought that was really cool.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.120
So I want to give a shout out to that.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.520
So if you're listening to this on the podcast or whatever, you should check in on Get Glue.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.520
Sweet.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.500
That'd be a nice way to help spread the word of O-L-R. And I noticed that some of the related

24:19.500 --> 24:23.600
ones happen to be, like, All Games or Video Game Outsiders, which is also on the network.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.600
It's just kind of funny.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
And For Real.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.840
Yeah, I've never...

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
Who's For Real?

24:27.840 --> 24:30.400
Is that the...

24:30.400 --> 24:33.400
Is that the band from the 90s that did I Like to Move It, Move It?

24:33.400 --> 24:34.560
Is that who For Real is?

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
I think it is.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
I think it is.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.560
All right.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.560
Anyway.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
Sorry.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.560
I'm getting off track.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.560
That's a little obscure, Rob.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
It is very obscure.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
All right.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.560
Yes.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
Well, it says they were on the...

24:45.560 --> 24:48.360
No, it's the one that did...

24:48.360 --> 24:50.000
It was a remix of something.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
It was on Max.

24:51.000 --> 24:57.400
I just don't remember what the hell it was now.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.320
I'm telling you, For Real did I Like to Move It, Move It.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
This is so stupid that we're having this conversation.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.840
Oh, Highs Off of You.

25:03.840 --> 25:04.840
That's what it was.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.840
Did that song, I guess.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.440
I don't remember.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.440
Moving on.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.960
Away from the 90s and into today.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.760
Let's talk about the Xperia Play.

25:15.760 --> 25:20.320
The Xperia Play is the Sony PlayStation phone, for lack of a better term.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.520
This is basically what it is.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
It's kind of cute.

25:22.520 --> 25:27.320
It's like a little PlayStation Go, but this time it actually has a phone in it, so there's

25:27.320 --> 25:30.080
kind of like a lot of purpose to be getting this.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.240
Xperia Play is, of course, the new smartphone.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.840
It is coming out in early spring.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.720
It will be on Verizon's network.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.920
That's what they're saying.

25:37.920 --> 25:45.280
There was a Sony Ericsson MWC 2011 press conference where this Xperia Play got its launch window.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.280
It's going to be coming out in March.

25:47.280 --> 25:52.640
The U.S. will be one of the first destinations, and Verizon will be the first carrier for

25:52.640 --> 25:53.640
the phone.

25:53.640 --> 26:00.120
They don't say that it will be the only carrier for the phone, just that it will be the first.

26:00.120 --> 26:04.760
So it's been a pretty good year for Verizon so far, between the iPhone and this.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.960
Yeah, but carrier makes me think of a disease carrier.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.280
I imagine some of the other carriers will be getting this, too.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.520
And for folks that are maybe like, I'm not feeling the iPhone.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.720
I'm more of a gamer.

26:15.720 --> 26:19.800
I think this is going to be a pretty good choice for them.

26:19.800 --> 26:24.400
Now, by the way, just so you know, the Xperia Play, it's supposed to be preloaded with what

26:24.400 --> 26:28.500
they are saying is a legendary PlayStation 1 game.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.440
It's also going to come with 50 different games from 20 publishers.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
Not built in.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.440
You're going to have to buy them.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.000
The legendary game is supposed to be Ridge Racer.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
It is.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.240
No, they're not saying that.

26:38.240 --> 26:41.640
That's just according to Kazurai.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.480
They haven't said exactly what the game is yet.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.480
So it's probably Ridge Racer.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.880
It could be, but that would be a Namco game, so I don't know.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.840
I kind of think it would come from Sony's first party itself.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.440
So I don't know.

26:54.440 --> 26:59.400
I'm going to just, I'm going to say, I'm going to be weird and say Twisted Metal.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.400
I don't know why.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.280
It seems like an easy game to put there.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.280
So we'll see.

27:05.280 --> 27:12.000
Uh, by the way, I think it will be something from Sony in house.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.120
I don't think it's going to bring the third party into play.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.120
It's going to be Irritating Stick.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.120
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:17.120 --> 27:21.120
I don't know why when you said that I thought Grand Theft Auto.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.120
And I do that all the time.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.020
No, but Grand Theft Auto should be on there.

27:24.020 --> 27:25.520
Those two games couldn't be any more different.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.520
You're right.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Grand Turismo would be a good choice.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.520
It would be a very good choice.

27:28.520 --> 27:32.520
Just so you know, most of the games that will be coming out for the device, they are ports

27:32.520 --> 27:33.800
of course of other games.

27:33.800 --> 27:38.480
I noticed there's actually a little Guitar Hero logo in here, which is really funny considering

27:38.480 --> 27:40.560
what we're going to talk about in a minute.

27:40.560 --> 27:46.240
But yeah, some of the other games that will be there, Assassin's Creed, Dead Space, Battlefield,

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
FIFA.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.640
A multiplayer FIFA game in mobile.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.640
What's that?

27:51.640 --> 27:52.640
So, all right.

27:52.640 --> 27:56.640
All right, well let's move on with some more news.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.680
Actually, wait, before we do, anyone going to get one of these here in studio?

27:59.680 --> 28:00.680
Anyone in chat?

28:00.680 --> 28:01.680
No.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.680
Going to pick up the Xperia?

28:02.680 --> 28:03.680
No.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.680
Yeah, I know.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.680
It's kind of like...

28:05.680 --> 28:06.680
I have a PSP.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.680
I have a PSP.

28:07.680 --> 28:08.680
I have an iPhone and I'm locked into the iPhone contract.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.680
I can't go run out and get another phone.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.680
I wouldn't care anyway.

28:10.680 --> 28:11.680
You know what?

28:11.680 --> 28:14.100
I keep getting flashbacks to the N-Gage.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.280
And that was pretty bad.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.200
I think this will be better than the N-Gage though.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.680
Let's be real.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.680
Let's be for real.

28:20.680 --> 28:25.560
If you want to play PlayStation 1 games on the go, just buy a PSP.

28:25.560 --> 28:31.000
Hell, just buy a PSP-1000 and you can do it just as well.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.160
Except you don't have the dual sort of analog sticks, you know what I mean?

28:39.160 --> 28:42.880
If I want to play PS1 games on the go, I'll just bring my PS1 with me.

28:42.880 --> 28:43.880
Amen.

28:43.880 --> 28:50.000
And get a mobile monitor, which I think I've still got one somewhere.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.760
I'm a little bit disgusted though, Rob.

28:52.760 --> 28:53.880
Why is that?

28:53.880 --> 28:56.520
That is about our next news story.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
Disgusted.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
Completely.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
Well, out with it.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
What's going on?

29:00.520 --> 29:07.040
Well, I'm sure many people know already, but the Hero franchise has gone...

29:07.040 --> 29:14.060
Activision is discontinuing development of Guitar Hero for 2011 and disbanding their

29:14.060 --> 29:16.000
business unit.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.840
And guess what else is included with that?

29:17.840 --> 29:21.040
That's going to be DJ Hero as well.

29:21.040 --> 29:27.200
They're not going to be releasing the new download content packs beyond what they already

29:27.200 --> 29:29.920
have, and nothing new will be made.

29:29.920 --> 29:35.600
However, you can still download everything that's there now.

29:35.600 --> 29:42.320
And basically they're saying that they've seen rapid declines in that genre, but really

29:42.320 --> 29:46.160
I think that Rock Band does it better.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.160
Alright.

29:47.160 --> 29:52.880
Well, I mean, let's be honest though, is this really a surprise?

29:52.880 --> 29:53.880
No.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.840
Uh, yes, it is a surprise because I would have thought that they would have still tried

29:57.840 --> 29:58.840
to whore it out.

29:58.840 --> 30:03.280
I mean, even if sales have dwindled a little bit, you know, why kill off the whole thing?

30:03.280 --> 30:07.080
Well, I know why they killed off the whole thing.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.320
Because investors tell them what to do.

30:09.320 --> 30:13.440
Well, I mean, honestly, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, big surprise.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.840
Like you know, this was all over.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.720
It was, this news was so big it was on CNN.

30:17.720 --> 30:18.720
It was all over Twitter.

30:18.720 --> 30:22.280
It might have even been a trending topic for all I know, but all these people were going,

30:22.280 --> 30:23.280
R.I.P.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.280
Guitar Hero.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.280
Dead and gone.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.280
We hardly knew ye.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.300
And it's kind of like, um, did anyone buy the last game in the series?

30:30.300 --> 30:32.400
Did anyone buy Warriors of Rock?

30:32.400 --> 30:35.040
I think we picked up the Green Day one for five bucks at Dimple.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.040
That's Rock Band.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.040
That's not even Guitar Hero.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.040
Oh, not Green Day.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.800
The other, it was one of the...

30:39.800 --> 30:41.120
Van Halen, Metallica?

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
Yeah.

30:42.120 --> 30:45.880
It was a, it was a Guitar Hero one.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.400
And let's be real, five bucks for that Van Halen one is probably about all it's worth.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.200
Like it was really a terra bad game.

30:51.200 --> 30:52.200
Let's, let's...

30:52.200 --> 30:53.200
It was so bad.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.200
It was an obvious milking of the franchise.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.400
So bad that they gave it away free to, you know, inflate the numbers of, um, the Guitar

30:58.400 --> 31:03.360
Hero 5 series so they could say, hey, look, look how many Guitar Hero units have sold

31:03.360 --> 31:04.440
for the franchise.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.040
Way more than Rock Band.

31:06.040 --> 31:10.360
Granted, they had way more versions come out than Rock Band.

31:10.360 --> 31:15.360
So, um, it's still disappointing.

31:15.360 --> 31:20.120
I mean, because I don't think that they're done.

31:20.120 --> 31:23.120
I think they're done with this.

31:23.120 --> 31:28.360
But when they see an idea where they can make some money, they're going to go after it.

31:28.360 --> 31:32.240
And I have a feeling that the next game they do is going to be similar to Dance Central

31:32.240 --> 31:36.000
because I don't think they want to be, you know, out of the market.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.760
But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Dance Hero.

31:39.760 --> 31:43.480
What's interesting is that I see, uh, some folks in chat and of course, Black Wolf jumping

31:43.480 --> 31:44.480
in.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.480
I bought Warriors of Rock.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.480
I knew there'd be somebody.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.480
There'd be like one person that bought it.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.800
I mean, it didn't, it didn't sell to zero copies.

31:49.800 --> 31:50.800
It sold some.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.760
But what I'm just saying is that this decline has been a little bit obvious for a while

31:54.760 --> 31:55.760
now.

31:55.760 --> 31:59.360
I think a lot of people out there that were the same ones touting R.I.P.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.800
Guitar Hero were kind of rolling their eyes a little bit at the franchise and how it kind

32:03.800 --> 32:05.840
of has gone the past couple games.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.880
There's been nothing really that new in the series for a while now.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.200
And I kind of hate to say it, but DJ Hero was going down a very similar path.

32:13.200 --> 32:18.080
I mean, the last game in the series wasn't terrible, but I didn't see where there was

32:18.080 --> 32:20.880
really a future in DJ Hero either.

32:20.880 --> 32:26.560
Well, um, unfortunately, one of the things we weren't going to be talking about as how

32:26.560 --> 32:30.600
they were saying that their digital downloads were up 20%.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.820
I think those could have been up a lot more if they'd, you know, kind of gone the rock

32:34.820 --> 32:39.440
band route and used their business model where they put out a few games and put out a ton

32:39.440 --> 32:40.440
of download content.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.640
Because, to be honest, there's not much coming out for Guitar Hero.

32:44.640 --> 32:47.680
You may have one pack a month, and that was it.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
If you're lucky.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.240
DJ Hero was, for the first one, was much worse.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.520
It had five.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.740
I think five packs come out.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.740
If that.

32:55.740 --> 33:06.440
And then, DJ Hero 2 had about the same within a relatively short time frame, but I don't...

33:06.440 --> 33:14.400
You know, we were talking a little bit how they're basically going to, you know, cease

33:14.400 --> 33:20.560
putting out download content for Guitar Hero and stuff like that.

33:20.560 --> 33:25.440
But honestly, I don't think anyone would have noticed if they stopped because they weren't

33:25.440 --> 33:27.760
really doing much to begin with.

33:27.760 --> 33:33.720
So, it's kind of, kind of sucked, but, you know, they really kind of let that slip through

33:33.720 --> 33:34.720
their hands.

33:34.720 --> 33:41.240
Yeah, I mean, I'm, again, I just, I just don't think the series was kind of going anywhere.

33:41.240 --> 33:46.200
It just was kind of on a one-track direction, and I, again, I really challenge a lot of

33:46.200 --> 33:48.200
these developers to innovate!

33:48.200 --> 33:50.640
That is how you're going to keep your games more interesting.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
That's what Rock Band did.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.120
Well, but, see, here's the thing.

33:53.120 --> 34:00.280
Rock Band, I mean, it's the last band standing, so to speak, but, unfortunately, they didn't

34:00.280 --> 34:05.200
really innovate enough, I guess, with Rock Band 3, with the keyboard and everything.

34:05.200 --> 34:08.680
Or they're not, well, here's the thing, or they're not marketing it well enough, I guess.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.600
It's not selling as well as the last one, period.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.600
That's what I mean.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.600
Okay.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.600
Well, I'm just saying, you know, because you're saying they didn't innovate.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.600
I mean...

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
Well, let me take a step back.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.280
Maybe they innovated, but they're not letting people know that so well.

34:23.280 --> 34:27.800
Like I don't really see a lot of Rock Band 3 being marketed as, now you can really learn

34:27.800 --> 34:29.000
to play an instrument.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.760
You can really learn to play keyboard.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.960
Like, you know, it wasn't on the daytime talk shows like I kind of thought it would be,

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
and so on.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
I don't know.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.720
I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to say that, like, Rock Band hasn't really innovated.

34:40.720 --> 34:47.200
I think it is, it's done certainly more than Guitar Hero did, which is why it is now standing

34:47.200 --> 34:52.400
alone, so to speak, although I don't think there'll be a Rock Band 4 this year.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.400
I don't think so either.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.960
I would go so far as to say there's not going to be another Rock Band until there's another

34:55.960 --> 34:59.160
series of consoles, but we'll see.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.160
Anything's possible.

35:00.160 --> 35:05.120
I honestly think it would be smart to support the current Rock Band and just put out more

35:05.120 --> 35:06.120
content.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.120
Mm-hmm.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.120
Well, that's what, yeah, that's definitely what they're doing.

35:08.120 --> 35:13.480
I mean, there's, I honestly don't think there is a need to put out a new console game because

35:13.480 --> 35:18.280
their, you know, business model right now is just putting out tons of content for it.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.200
So why do you need a new version?

35:20.200 --> 35:21.200
You don't need a new version.

35:21.200 --> 35:25.760
They're making money that way, and on top of that, it is fairly cost effective.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.760
Because Activision's plan was kind of the opposite.

35:27.760 --> 35:32.360
Well, we'll force them to buy a new copy of the game, or a new version of the game, because

35:32.360 --> 35:34.480
we're not going to put out a lot of content for it.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.960
So the only way you're going to get new content is by spending the $60 to buy a brand new

35:37.960 --> 35:39.960
game.

35:39.960 --> 35:44.200
Some interesting questions from chat here, uh, DDR Dollar Bill says, Guitar Hero started

35:44.200 --> 35:49.200
doing the DDR type scene where they made new songs but didn't advance the series much.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.560
Kind of interesting though, DDR is still alive to tell the tale, so to speak.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.480
DDR is still kickin'.

35:55.480 --> 36:00.360
Yeah, DDR and Konami also promise that they're going to support DDR with tons of download

36:00.360 --> 36:02.480
content, and they never fuckin' do.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.840
Or for Karaoke Revolution, never had a ton of download content on a regular basis like

36:06.840 --> 36:07.840
they promised.

36:07.840 --> 36:11.800
I'm thinking also DDR probably has a much lower budget than the Guitar Hero games, and

36:11.800 --> 36:14.760
I don't think there's as high of an expectation there.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.760
And I think in the end, that's what's kept DDR going all these years.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.760
Well, if you shoot low, you're gonna-

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
And the weight loss thing.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.760
Well, I guess-

36:19.760 --> 36:21.180
Everybody thinks you're gonna lose weight playing DDR.

36:21.180 --> 36:25.240
If you shoot low, then I guess you don't really have that high expectation, and it's easy

36:25.240 --> 36:26.660
to meet your goals.

36:26.660 --> 36:30.440
But at the same time, if they tried harder, they may get a better result out of it.

36:30.440 --> 36:34.800
But instead, they're just like, oh well, not that many people like it anymore, oh well,

36:34.800 --> 36:39.520
let's just put a half-assed product out in the market, and then we'll call it done.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.200
Let me bring up this other comment from our chat room.

36:41.200 --> 36:45.360
Izam in our chat room at chat.orangelandraday.com says, although I think a good question here

36:45.360 --> 36:50.720
is can Konami take advantage of the Void and try to get Guitar Freak Strawmania stateside?

36:50.720 --> 36:54.440
And my answer is a resounding giant no.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.960
I'm gonna be bluntly honest with you, I don't want him to do it.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.400
I don't want him to do it.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.560
I don't think the games are as good as Guitar Hero.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
Said it.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.440
Might make you mad, but let's be real.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.440
People know.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
People are not gonna get those games here.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.920
Konami missed that whole thing.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.800
And two words, Rock Revolution.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.960
That was their attempt to bring those games stateside and don't think it wasn't.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.720
And it was a hot mess to say nice.

37:18.720 --> 37:24.000
Let me put it this way, and I put it in my Twitter, if they want a second attempt at

37:24.000 --> 37:29.280
the guitar games and stuff like that, if you put out a decent release now, it might actually

37:29.280 --> 37:31.040
work, because you're not gonna have a lot of competition.

37:31.040 --> 37:36.680
Granted, you're gonna have Rock Band's competition, but you gotta...

37:36.680 --> 37:41.480
We tell our customers that we have tons of people trying to get into the video game or

37:41.480 --> 37:46.160
movie market and stuff like that, and people that want to sell on eBay and stuff.

37:46.160 --> 37:50.080
And we tell them, you've gotta have a niche, because you're competing with people that

37:50.080 --> 37:52.280
have been established in the business for a long time.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.840
Well, same with the music game genre.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.840
You gotta have a niche.

37:55.840 --> 38:00.920
Obviously, you're not gonna be able to compete with the large library that Rock Band has.

38:00.920 --> 38:06.880
You're gonna need to come up with either original songs, which granted, Konami is great at original

38:06.880 --> 38:07.880
songs.

38:07.880 --> 38:12.760
Their Konami originals are just awesome, and they have, for guitar games, they have a huge

38:12.760 --> 38:16.560
library of stuff that they can put in there.

38:16.560 --> 38:23.360
A lot of people in the US may not necessarily get it or be really enthusiastic about some

38:23.360 --> 38:25.000
of that stuff, but so what?

38:25.000 --> 38:30.240
Just put it in the game as well, and put some good licensed songs from the US in there.

38:30.240 --> 38:36.520
And maybe don't fuck up the interface system with grey buttons or your stupid drum controller

38:36.520 --> 38:38.520
nobody wants to use.

38:38.520 --> 38:43.920
Just use the peripherals that are out there now, put out some good software, and that's

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
it.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.880
And hell, call Guitar Freaks, because you know what?

38:46.880 --> 38:47.880
You've got that franchise.

38:47.880 --> 38:48.920
You have the rights to that.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.160
Why not?

38:51.160 --> 38:54.840
Tigerclaw in our chatroom says, if Konami were to kill DDR, OLR and the rest of the

38:54.840 --> 38:58.360
computer would go on a RAM page and go on a global-sized boycott.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.840
No, not really.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.200
To be honest, no.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.960
I'm kind of surprised that news hasn't already come out.

39:04.960 --> 39:05.960
Not to be a pessimist.

39:05.960 --> 39:10.720
I know a lot of you still love your DDR, but I'm gonna be just...

39:10.720 --> 39:12.100
Let's not mince words here.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.280
It's not the same game I loved ten years ago.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.280
It's not.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.100
Well, their idea of innovation is seriously for DDR.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.100
Let's add eight arrows.

39:22.100 --> 39:23.520
We'll do eight arrows.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
Awesome.

39:24.520 --> 39:27.200
Because you know that was so awesome when you did quads.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.520
Remember quads?

39:29.520 --> 39:33.640
Four panel, you know, four DDR panels to play on?

39:33.640 --> 39:34.640
Yeah, that was terrible.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.880
And it was, you know, created by an algorithm.

39:36.880 --> 39:42.960
There wasn't actually any original steps for that, and you couldn't make edits for those.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.000
And they wanted you to buy four fucking pads for that.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.560
Sorry, that's not gonna happen.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.680
Anyway, back to the Activision news.

39:50.680 --> 39:55.480
I will say, I'm a tiny bit sad that means there's probably not gonna be that DJ Hero

39:55.480 --> 39:56.480
game on the 3DS.

39:56.480 --> 40:01.280
I mean, I don't know if that's already in the can, so to speak, but I am assuming that's

40:01.280 --> 40:03.000
not happening at this point.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.720
And that would have been interesting to see that, like in the portable market and the

40:06.720 --> 40:10.360
whole 3D thing, but eh, oh well.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.800
Probably would have just been a cheap knockoff of the console games anyway.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.800
Oh well.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.800
What can you do?

40:15.800 --> 40:18.800
Anyhow, Loki, what else you got for us?

40:18.800 --> 40:23.080
Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about Activision and the fun stuff.

40:23.080 --> 40:27.280
Of course, they're reducing their headcount by 500.

40:27.280 --> 40:32.160
I think you can kinda guess where that's coming from.

40:32.160 --> 40:37.800
And they're saying they're making specific or significant investments elsewhere.

40:37.800 --> 40:43.560
Our headcount at the end of the year is probably not gonna be materially different given that

40:43.560 --> 40:47.680
we're ramping up development teams around Blizzard's new MMO and around Call of Duty

40:47.680 --> 40:48.680
initiatives.

40:48.680 --> 40:53.800
Yes, because you have to understand, this is why Guitar Hero and the whole hero franchise

40:53.800 --> 40:54.800
went away.

40:54.800 --> 41:04.380
It's because I can sink, if I'm Activision, I can sink say 50 million dollars into a couple

41:04.380 --> 41:08.840
Guitar Hero games and maybe not make quite as much money back.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.920
Maybe I'll make back my investment.

41:10.920 --> 41:15.560
Or I can sink 50 million dollars into a couple Call of Duty games and they're gonna sell

41:15.560 --> 41:16.560
like hotcakes.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.280
So, that's where they're gonna put their money.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.480
And then this is the other thing that didn't really make any sense to me, but I guess,

41:23.480 --> 41:26.920
hey, you paid for the license, so why not?

41:26.920 --> 41:28.720
Spider-Man!

41:28.720 --> 41:31.720
There's gonna be another Spider-Man game.

41:31.720 --> 41:36.920
Because I don't know, the last Spider-Man game did so well.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.740
So there you have that coming in 2011.

41:39.740 --> 41:45.760
And also, I guess, two TV license titles as well.

41:45.760 --> 41:51.280
They're saying that they're gonna see a new Family Guy game, because god, the last Family

41:51.280 --> 41:55.440
Guy game was so wonderful, and a Wipeout game.

41:55.440 --> 42:00.200
Which to be honest, they did have a Wipeout game already, and it was not good.

42:00.200 --> 42:06.620
So awesome, way to go.

42:06.620 --> 42:11.360
That's totally awesome, just to keep that shit around.

42:11.360 --> 42:15.400
Well I mean, there is that new Spider-Man movie that's coming out next year or whatever,

42:15.400 --> 42:18.440
the one they're filming right now with the whole reboot.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.640
This isn't just based on that though.

42:20.640 --> 42:21.640
Really?

42:21.640 --> 42:25.240
Yes, because this is just, it's gonna be like Shattered Dimensions or something.

42:25.240 --> 42:26.960
I would have thought it was tie-in.

42:26.960 --> 42:31.280
Kind of going back to this, I was actually reading, there was a letter to, well I guess,

42:31.280 --> 42:36.200
a letter from the editor, and the newest Game Informer that, this is obviously before the

42:36.200 --> 42:41.760
whole Guitar Hero stuff went down, but he was complaining about how they just basically

42:41.760 --> 42:51.160
let Bizarre Creations just go under, and their reasoning for it was because of the failed

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
Bond game.

42:52.160 --> 42:56.320
They're all, well first off, why the fuck are you trying to make a Bond game?

42:56.320 --> 43:05.980
The Bond franchise has kind of lost its appeal years ago, and this is a game that not necessarily

43:05.980 --> 43:12.040
this company would be good to make a title for, maybe a good racing game instead.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.520
Well, I don't know about the, because honestly I thought that first Daniel Craig Bond movie,

43:16.520 --> 43:19.120
Casino Royale, which a couple years ago was really good.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.080
It was like, it was a nice swift kick in the pants.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.920
A lot of people were very skeptical about it, and it was really good.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.680
But I think the biggest problem was that they were putting out a Bond game when Bond wasn't

43:27.680 --> 43:32.760
really in people's minds, because Quantum of Solace didn't do as well, and some would

43:32.760 --> 43:36.940
argue it probably wasn't as good of a movie either, and this new Bond game, Bloodstone

43:36.940 --> 43:39.280
or whatever it was called, came out like two years after that.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.200
People were not thinking about James Bond.

43:41.200 --> 43:44.120
People were not looking for a James Bond game.

43:44.120 --> 43:46.880
People were kind of looking at that going, what the hell is that?

43:46.880 --> 43:47.880
What is this?

43:47.880 --> 43:54.240
And on top of that, they released it one week, one week before Call of Duty Black Ops.

43:54.240 --> 43:57.180
I mean, they knew it was gonna suck.

43:57.180 --> 43:58.680
They knew it.

43:58.680 --> 44:02.360
And so they just kind of set them up to fail, and they got rid of them.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.240
By the way, there is a new Bond movie now coming out.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.080
They finally confirmed they're gonna do a new Bond movie, and hopefully it'll be as

44:07.080 --> 44:11.600
good as Casino Royale was, and I wonder who's gonna make the game tie in for that one.

44:11.600 --> 44:14.360
Oh, it's gonna be Activision, because they had the lights to the Bond franchise.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.460
But how did Goldeneye end up doing for him?

44:17.460 --> 44:18.460
That did okay, I think.

44:18.460 --> 44:19.460
Did it?

44:19.460 --> 44:21.200
But I mean, come on, it's just Goldeneye.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.960
All it is is Goldeneye re-skinned with Daniel Craig on it, and that's it.

44:23.960 --> 44:27.160
It probably sold more than the other one, sadly.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.160
That's not Bazaar's fault?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.440
No, it's not Bazaar's fault.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.560
Bazaar's fault, or there was really no fault to them anyways.

44:33.560 --> 44:37.360
Yeah, they could have made the game as great as possible, but when you put it out a week

44:37.360 --> 44:42.880
before fucking Call of Duty comes out, no one's gonna pay attention to that.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.240
They're gonna be like, fuck that, I'm getting Call of Duty.

44:46.240 --> 44:51.940
The biggest problem, I think, with Blur is that it came out the exact same time as Split

44:51.940 --> 44:55.760
Second and Modnation Racers, and people just didn't want to buy all those racers.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.800
And Red Dead Redemption.

44:57.800 --> 45:05.240
So I mean, Blur, I'm sure, was a pretty good game, but it's just timing, and Activision

45:05.240 --> 45:06.800
I don't think cares.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.400
And it's just, it's frustrating.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.800
Oh, and by the way, I don't remember if this was mentioned before, but remember that Seven

45:15.800 --> 45:19.640
Studios, the one that put out that game Scratch, well yeah, Activision bought them and then

45:19.640 --> 45:21.520
dissolved them.

45:21.520 --> 45:22.520
So if you had any-

45:22.520 --> 45:23.520
Did Scratch even ever come out?

45:23.520 --> 45:28.680
Nope, it never came out, because they bought the studio, and then they fired them all.

45:28.680 --> 45:31.060
So that's awesome.

45:31.060 --> 45:32.060
Way to go Activision.

45:32.060 --> 45:34.320
Way to get rid of your competition, that's something.

45:34.320 --> 45:36.680
Alright, well, jeez, let's-

45:36.680 --> 45:41.320
Oh, and then one more thing I was gonna mention too.

45:41.320 --> 45:44.380
One other thing they said they weren't gonna put out this year, a new Tony Hawk game.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.480
Because the last two Tony Hawk games were terrible, so finally they learned a little

45:47.480 --> 45:48.480
bit.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.120
No new Tony Hawk game this year.

45:50.120 --> 45:53.640
All they need to do is go back to Pro Skater, and they'd be just fine.

45:53.640 --> 45:59.440
Alright, I see you talking in our chat room, Dark Soccer, to the listeners about James

45:59.440 --> 46:00.440
Bond.

46:00.440 --> 46:05.680
Yeah, we were discussed, a couple of us had the same first Bond movie we saw in the theater.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.680
That was A View to a Kill.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.320
The 80s one, right, yeah.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.160
With Duran Duran doing the intro, and Grace Jones.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.440
Grace fucking Jones.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.440
I love her.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.860
Fierce, fierce human being.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.860
Just like-

46:16.860 --> 46:17.860
Vicious.

46:17.860 --> 46:20.540
Vicious to the word fierce, and she invented fierce.

46:20.540 --> 46:22.000
There is no other.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.640
When you look in the dictionary, there's actually no words, it just automatically links you

46:26.640 --> 46:30.160
mentally to Wikipedia about her.

46:30.160 --> 46:32.960
They should've made- you know what?

46:32.960 --> 46:36.580
That's how Bazaar could've sold a million billion of the Bond game, is just make it

46:36.580 --> 46:37.580
all about Grace Jones.

46:37.580 --> 46:38.580
There you go.

46:38.580 --> 46:41.840
Now I have to go on Wikipedia and look up Grace Jones.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.240
Alright, let's move on.

46:43.240 --> 46:46.440
You know how they could've sold a ton of games?

46:46.440 --> 46:47.440
What?

46:47.440 --> 46:48.440
Smash Brothers Bond.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.440
That'd be awesome.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
Right.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.440
Getting a little silly now.

46:52.440 --> 46:56.120
Alright, uh, hey, the Xbox Live house party is coming very soon.

46:56.120 --> 47:00.400
You might remember this is the whole little, uh, let's do the summer of arcade promotion

47:00.400 --> 47:01.720
at a different time in the year.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.720
Actually this is like their third one.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.720
You know, seriously?

47:03.720 --> 47:09.620
They need to host this with Kid N Play, I mean, I'm sorry, they need to dig them out

47:09.620 --> 47:13.440
of wherever rehab center they're in, and just seriously.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.840
I apologize if I'd taken someone's story later, I don't think I am, I don't think this is

47:16.840 --> 47:20.780
coming up tonight, but there's been more and more furious rumors this week that Xbox is

47:20.780 --> 47:26.960
planning on launching like a TV network within Xbox, which some time ago Conan was wooed

47:26.960 --> 47:31.480
to be a part of before they decided to stick with something a little more traditional.

47:31.480 --> 47:38.120
It would not be beyond all reason that Kid N Play could do some type of house party.

47:38.120 --> 47:42.320
That sounds like, for some reason I'm just reminded of USA is up all night for some reason

47:42.320 --> 47:49.760
when I run this year, I kind of hope if they do, do you end up having an Xbox network?

47:49.760 --> 47:56.320
They have Xbox all night or something ridiculous, like fucking old school yo MTV raps, you know,

47:56.320 --> 48:02.800
with fucking eighties rap stars and just covering, you know, re just music that's really old.

48:02.800 --> 48:07.600
Imagine that Grace Jones was in a movie with Tim Curry was she really in 2001 that was

48:07.600 --> 48:13.840
like the most fierce gay movie ever called wolf girl.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.760
Sounds like apparently she was in Peewee's Playhouse Christmas special.

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
Awesome.

48:17.760 --> 48:18.760
And in the Beastmaster.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.360
Look, can I talk about the house party?

48:20.360 --> 48:23.720
I realized Grace Jones was not invited to the house party, but I still want to talk

48:23.720 --> 48:26.120
about some of the awesome games that are coming out.

48:26.120 --> 48:30.080
It's all starts this week, February 16th, the first release comes out.

48:30.080 --> 48:32.960
Hardcore uprising comes out first.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.640
It's a game that is kind of like Contra.

48:35.640 --> 48:39.080
It's really, really like Contra, but it's not $15 for that.

48:39.080 --> 48:44.040
Bejeweled Blitz is the next game on February 23rd, 800 Microsoft points for that.

48:44.040 --> 48:48.480
Beyond Good and Evil HD is on March 2nd for 800 Microsoft points.

48:48.480 --> 48:52.960
Torchlight comes out on March 9th for 1200 Microsoft points.

48:52.960 --> 48:57.280
And lastly, but not leastly, Full House Poker on March 16th for 800 points.

48:57.280 --> 49:02.560
Is that the one versus 100 replacement or is that a different poker thing?

49:02.560 --> 49:06.600
It's similar to the one versus 100, I guess, with poker.

49:06.600 --> 49:07.600
Interesting.

49:07.600 --> 49:10.880
Yeah, that's what I thought that was all about, but now they're going to chart.

49:10.880 --> 49:11.920
It's not really free.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
It is going to cost you.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.480
It's going to cost you 800 points for that.

49:14.480 --> 49:16.680
I am most looking forward to Absolutely a Torchlight.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.320
I think Torchlight is an awesome game on the PC.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.400
I'm kind of curious how they're going to translate that to console.

49:20.400 --> 49:24.080
I think a lot is going to have to change in translation, so I'll be very curious about

49:24.080 --> 49:25.080
that.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.080
So, there you go.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.800
The Xbox Live house party starting this week.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.320
No Kid in Play this year.

49:30.320 --> 49:31.320
Maybe next year.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.760
What else you got for us besides links to Grace Jones' Wikipedias?

49:33.760 --> 49:36.960
Well, now I'm reading about Studio 54.

49:36.960 --> 49:44.000
Well, according to EA, 7% of mobile gaming is done on the toilet.

49:44.000 --> 49:50.400
They did some research and this is actually from EA Mobile.

49:50.400 --> 49:58.720
They basically said there were five different percentages of when people tend to play their

49:58.720 --> 49:59.720
games.

49:59.720 --> 50:03.080
They also went over some myths.

50:03.080 --> 50:08.680
So according to the research, 47% of the time is people playing at home, 12% of that time

50:08.680 --> 50:15.800
is during a commute, 14% while at work, 7% in the restroom, and 3% during school hours

50:15.800 --> 50:17.560
and 1% at the airport.

50:17.560 --> 50:22.640
Actually we have a clip of Dark Sakura playing on her mobile phone here.

50:22.640 --> 50:23.640
No.

50:23.640 --> 50:24.640
No.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.640
No.

50:25.640 --> 50:26.640
No.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.640
No.

50:27.640 --> 50:28.640
No.

50:28.640 --> 50:29.640
No.

50:29.640 --> 50:30.640
No.

50:30.640 --> 50:31.640
No.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
No.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
No.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.640
No.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.640
No.

50:35.640 --> 50:53.740
So there actually was a shirt that I almost got one time that says iPhone changed the

50:53.740 --> 50:54.760
way I pee.

50:54.760 --> 50:58.920
I thought that was pretty funny.

50:58.920 --> 51:04.080
I used I I admit I used to play my you know phone sometimes at work

51:04.080 --> 51:07.960
But I think this one might have actually been a little more appropriate for mobile gaming

51:07.960 --> 51:09.960
Now

51:09.960 --> 51:28.880
Oh now flush

51:30.360 --> 51:35.600
Can I be real though? Let's let's be real. I'm kind of surprised the number isn't higher

51:35.600 --> 51:37.600
I

51:38.160 --> 51:40.160
Think that's only 7%

51:42.520 --> 51:44.440
Namco is having a sale right now a

51:44.440 --> 51:49.840
Variety of companies are having iPhone game sales right now where you can get a lot of like pretty good iPhone games really cheap

51:49.840 --> 51:52.680
and one of the games I bought this week was pac-man championship edition and

51:53.600 --> 51:57.880
You know it's it's a pretty faithful translation controls could be a little better

51:57.880 --> 52:06.120
You know with like actual tangible buttons, but whatever, but I'll tell you I probably played most of that game. I

52:06.320 --> 52:08.400
play a lot of solitaire on the toilet I

52:11.920 --> 52:18.480
Will freely admit this my toilet game of choice solitaire and reading my facebook

52:18.480 --> 52:28.180
Loki what's your favorite mobile game to play on the pooper? I don't play games on the toilet really really

52:28.180 --> 52:30.180
I don't what do you do you just sit there and think?

52:30.740 --> 52:32.740
It doesn't take that long

52:35.460 --> 52:38.380
He probably doesn't have any bowel issues

52:38.380 --> 52:43.920
I was gonna say like you know it doesn't take that long every night. I can put the game down

52:43.920 --> 52:47.840
I'm gonna for that monster poop. I

52:49.040 --> 52:51.040
mean seriously it's a I

52:52.360 --> 52:54.800
Don't need but sometimes if I'm playing a mobile game

52:54.800 --> 52:59.000
I kind of don't want to leave like you know Alan will be banging on the door you okay in there

52:59.000 --> 53:02.600
You did you fall in you all right, and I'm just like no. I just I just beat level two

53:05.920 --> 53:08.280
There was one other game that actually I

53:09.200 --> 53:10.440
I

53:10.440 --> 53:18.260
Did play extensively in the bathroom, and that was angry birds? It did walked by the bathroom and hearing the tweet noises

53:18.260 --> 53:21.240
He's like are you playing that game in there again? Yes?

53:22.240 --> 53:23.880
so

53:23.880 --> 53:25.880
angry birds on the toilet oh

53:30.520 --> 53:35.640
Here, but hey how about those other myths by the way hmm the myth the top mobile games are all casual

53:35.640 --> 53:40.600
No they said that their biggest performers there was

53:40.960 --> 53:49.080
Epics infinity blade and dead space which were at the top of the App Store and that one size game fits all platforms and not so

53:49.840 --> 53:51.560
because

53:51.560 --> 53:52.880

53:52.880 --> 53:57.720
the Android ones are specifically having to be redone for working on the Android and

53:58.840 --> 54:03.040
Brands don't matter and he says yeah, they do the top iPhone games are all brands and

54:03.040 --> 54:06.720
This is as good as it gets and he said no. There's gonna be better

54:08.520 --> 54:14.360
I'll tell you sometimes I might choose to sit when I pee just to get one more level down and cut the rope

54:14.560 --> 54:19.200
We don't need to know about your pee habits. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Maybe all right

54:19.200 --> 54:24.280

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
game with

55:03.240 --> 55:05.320
Anthromorphic I guess

55:06.800 --> 55:13.040
Consoles because they have a hyper dimension neptunia the special edition with an art book in there, but they have

55:13.840 --> 55:15.840
chicks

55:15.880 --> 55:17.880
Not really

55:17.880 --> 55:24.000
Resembling consoles, but representing different consoles in that game, and it's like the console wars for real. That's on PlayStation 3

55:25.320 --> 55:27.860

56:12.660 --> 56:16.620
Download content of course. It's paid unlock content actually. I don't think it's pay

56:16.620 --> 56:19.500
I think it's just time delayed for people that don't have

56:20.020 --> 56:25.000
Special editions. Oh all right whatever, but it may be pay maybe we'll see

56:27.880 --> 56:35.680

But that will be coming out on PSP next week's or the week after next that's it

56:56.680 --> 57:01.360
Alright going on to Japanese release dates, and what's coming out in Japan this week

57:01.360 --> 57:02.440
Well Marvel vs.

57:02.440 --> 57:07.480
Capcom 3 is getting its release in Japan this week as well that'll be out on the Xbox 360 this week

57:08.280 --> 57:12.720
Also on the 360 this week two worlds to the Japanese version and a game called Catherine

57:13.040 --> 57:15.480
This is a game from Atlas that is coming out

57:15.480 --> 57:20.880
It's the personas team first game for the HD system, so it's about

57:21.640 --> 57:25.440
Vincent is a wishy-washy salary man a little too afraid to be tied down

57:26.120 --> 57:31.840
Facing the appeals of marriage from his longtime girlfriend Catherine all he wanted to do is to escape and one night

57:31.840 --> 57:37.040
He succeeded into the arms of the of the beautiful young Catherine. There's Catherine with a K and Catherine with a C

57:37.040 --> 57:41.500
That's this this sounds good kind of weird, but it could be kind of awesome to it

57:41.500 --> 57:48.560
It is a strategy game, and there's like these guys with sheep heads. It's kind of a scary game like when you say persona

57:48.560 --> 57:50.840
I think oh, it's gonna be the preenies, but no this is like a

57:51.280 --> 57:53.280
No, it's a creepy erotic game

57:53.800 --> 57:55.800
sort of hot

57:55.800 --> 58:00.840
I like night trap all over again all right moving on to the

58:01.320 --> 58:04.960
PlayStation 3 and the release is coming out over there on the PlayStation 3 of course

58:05.200 --> 58:07.840

Nintendo Wii this week nothing there is nothing on the Wii this week, but next week

58:24.980 --> 58:25.840
There's a Gundam game

58:25.840 --> 58:31.560
We'll get to that next week also the 3ds is just around the corner in Japan only a couple weeks away

58:31.880 --> 58:35.680
And for those you guys that are probably gonna be importing that over here as well in fact

58:35.680 --> 58:39.080
I don't know what this is but one of the games on 3ds is showing up this week

58:39.320 --> 58:45.320
Like I don't know if they just want people to buy it early or what's going on, but um haku yoki zusoroku

58:45.320 --> 58:51.040
DS comes out this week me. That's one of those things like unlock something extra on the 3ds who knows I don't know

58:51.880 --> 58:52.960
and

58:52.960 --> 58:54.400
on the Sony

58:54.400 --> 59:01.120
PSP if you're sad about guitar hero having gone under you might be a fan of this series DJ max

59:01.280 --> 59:07.840
Portable 3 is a very big release for the music game fans this week on the PSP that is in regular and limited edition

59:08.660 --> 59:10.660
also monochrome and

59:10.840 --> 59:14.320
My Mary may with be get price reductions this week

59:14.320 --> 59:21.840
That's really what it's called, but DJ max portable 3 look at that all the great kpop songs in a beat mania

59:21.840 --> 59:24.240
esque style interface, but on your PSP

59:25.120 --> 59:28.680
Definitely a lot of cult fan. There will be a lot of people listening to the show that import that game

59:28.680 --> 59:31.880
I am sure that's it for Japanese release dates. How about

59:32.920 --> 59:39.120
Overseas in the old country a few things we have on the 16th hardcore uprising on

59:39.900 --> 59:42.120
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and

59:42.920 --> 59:44.920
We also have on the 18th

59:45.720 --> 59:50.200
crash time for our Xbox 360 death smiles and

59:50.200 --> 59:53.900
Then Marvel vs. Capcom 3 we also have pop cap hits

59:54.580 --> 59:57.760
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and death smells is pretty cool

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.680
I think I know what a lot of people will be playing this week death smiles no

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.180
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is totally worthy by the way

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:09.860
Well, that's right. You had a chance to check it out early too. Huh? What'd you think worthy?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.600
but Tatanoko

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.740
vs. Capcom fighting scheme not as great

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.220
interesting really

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:22.300
Yeah, I wasn't too fond of that when I played Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. It's very mash friendly

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.140
Hey sounds good for me. I love button mashing

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.940
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.940
But we're not there just yet Loki

01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.540
Sony's claiming that the Gran Turismo Academy

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.700
Yet one little

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.300
Event contest that they have going on right now where people race and report their times

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:47.460
I guess the Gran Turismo 5 on different tracks for different specific categories

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.580
With a chance to win a spot as a real race driver

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.500
apparently they say round two was ruined by cheaters and

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:02.140
Won't count so they're moving everybody the round three, but here's how they claim it was

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:10.220
Cheated apparently the track has a nice little s turn in it and so people were cutting corners in the track driving off-road

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:12.220
You

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.620
Know it's a design the track

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:20.340
It wasn't actually something that people use like a mod or something like that to cheat in they were just cutting corners off-road

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.940
That's cheating

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.620
Well, they're like putting real bracing you we've got a penalty for that

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:32.060
Well, maybe somebody spent a long making their game should have penalized exactly

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.380
Maybe if you had spent all that time, you know perfecting your game

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:40.380
Maybe you should have I don't know added a penalty for cutting the track like that. It's interesting though

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.660
Like I realize Gran Turismo is supposed to be like the real-deal racing simulator and all that but like games like Mario Kart and shit

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.340
And even things like blur you're kind of encouraged to do shit like that or burnout especially burnout

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:57.900
Off-roading is is encouraged and rewarded. You know, I mean if you can get a game fuel that entire fucking game was off-roading

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:03.300
You know, I mean, it's not even a glitch. I mean, it's just a part of the track you cutting out the track

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.300
Yeah, it seems

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.660
Seems a little silly to throw

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:15.940
That that's what I have to say about that. I think your competition's stupid. Although it's interesting because isn't the like

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.360
Prize or whatever for winning the competition like to race a real car

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:25.140
I hope that they race on that track with the s-curve and drive the fucker off-road. Well, that'd be hilarious

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.340
Maybe they don't want people that are gonna do that

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:32.820
I'm gonna do that. Anyways, that's what I would do. I'd drive that thing straight into a wall

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:40.220
Oh expensive car crash. You might also get set on fire and I don't think you really want that you have a fire suit

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.220
It's fine. I

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.780
Don't know

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:51.580
Around three though this start on Monday. So whatever. We'll see how people cheat on that real soon. Yeah

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.420
Alright, let's move on to

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.740
Some more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get into the classic game of the week

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.020
which of course is dark soccer diving into the vault and

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.340
Finding a game that she thinks you guys should be playing but first off a story real quick on

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.060
Dead Space 2 and I think this is kind of interesting because

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.540
There's this gamer and his name is Gareth Garrett. I think I hope I'm saying that correctly

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.900
He is a gamer who happens to have cerebral palsy

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.940
And he wanted there to be more

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.980
Customizable controls in this game because what he's trying to do is he's trying to play this game on his PC

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:32.060
and he has to use his chin to move the mouse and

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.060
Unfortunately, he's not able to walk forward with the mouse and you know

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:41.740
This is kind of the bummer with a lot of games that have custom or don't have customizable controls

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.400
There's a lot of times they're customized really weird and people want to change them

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:47.140
so

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:52.700
He thought it's a little weird the Dead Space 2 doesn't allow me to do this when tons and tons and tons of games do

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.260
Allow me to do it and they went and they made an internet petition

01:03:56.260 --> 01:04:01.180
20,000 players signed this petition and

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:06.460
visceral games who made a Dead Space 2 says we hear you and

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.340
executive producer Steve Pappoutis

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.340
Sorry, if I said that wrong said that there will be a PC version patch

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.300
Enabling full control remapping it will be coming out soon

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.860
There is some full remarks that were made

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:27.940
the Dead Space 2 team is aware of the issue that disabled players are having with Dead Space 2 PC in fact a number of

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:34.180
Folks on our team is are so passionate about getting this fix done that they are currently working hard to allow players to remap key

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.420
Bindings to the mouse which should help disabled players. Enjoy the game

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:43.660
That's very cool. I'm glad that they listened especially with that reason being in place a little silly

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:49.980
It wasn't there the first time hello customizable controls is a very standard thing in this day and age. However

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:57.340
Maybe this lesson will help other developers learn it, right? There's there's a lot of games though that really need to have I

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.300
Still you remember how pissed off I got the very very first time

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.820
I played World of Warcraft and found I couldn't use my mouse. Uh-huh or controller

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:09.660
Oh, yeah, because I've been playing Final Fantasy 11 on a controller and I've been playing PSO on a controller

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.740
so

01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:19.940
They should oh, they should just allow any kind of custom controller to work. I think there's a mod for

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.960
Warcraft where you can use a controller, but it's not officially supported

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:27.060
keyboard now, but

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:34.520
But I I mean, I really think that that games need to not limit people in how they can control right that if

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.220
You can map anything out on a keyboard

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:42.660
Then you should be able to map it out on a gamepad as well and I think it's all this this type of story is a very

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.260
Humbling thing I think too for the developers who have to kind of stop and go. Oh, yeah

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.820
Not everybody is

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:54.260
This fortunate as I am to have every you know, the ten fingers and ten toes doing you know

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:57.620
what they what it does, you know what I mean, so it's

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.740
It's a little bit humbling and just a reminder

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:04.860
Customizable controls go a long way in helping more people play your game

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:09.660
All right, let's move on to a segment. We do here every week on orange lounge radio

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.820
It's a chance for dark soccer to dive through the vault

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.900
Find a video game that she says hey you ungrateful kids

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:23.180
Hey, listen. Hey, listen, stop watching those crappy Grammys get off my lawn and

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.180
Play this classic game right now dark soccer

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.180
What is the classic human week?

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:36.500
The game is star Perotia, which I had the hardest time finding because a lot of places romanize it as Perotier

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:42.560
Which makes sense because it's a parody of star soldier and I've talked about this game before but I haven't used it as a classic

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.780
Game, I checked. All right. Let's take a look

01:06:44.780 --> 01:07:00.620
I love the music in this game, by the way. At any rate, you can tell it's all, you know, CD audio

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.740
Because this was on the PC Engine CD-ROM as I said, it's parody of star soldier

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:14.660
which is sort of in the same vein as Proteus, but I don't think it's as silly as Proteus and it only came out in Japan and

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:18.820
They were going to be bringing it out in North America as fan as a star soldier, but they did not

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:26.620
It actually had a release through the virtual console in Europe on May 16th 2008 and

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:33.500
Of course, it was released in America on August 11th 2008. So you guys can actually play this game now

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.940
It's pretty funny. So it's a vertically scrolling shooter like the star soldier games and

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.540
has the collecting power-ups to create your weapons and

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.980
different bosses and mini bosses and you know horizontal shooting, you know with your

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.940
vehicle of choice this one also has a

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:58.140
High-score time attack mode that were in star soldier, but now for the parody part

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:04.240
It's really cutesy has very cartoony type of graphics and not very violent like

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.420
when you kill an enemy, they don't die they just wave white flags and

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.060
You can choose one of three different vehicles

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:15.900
you can choose the para Caesar from star soldier or a giant flying bomber man or

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:21.600
A PC Engine that shoots hue cards and CD-ROMs at the enemies

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.980
This game is super adorable cute. I

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:31.760
I love this game and I remember when my friend we were visiting my friend who lived in Berkeley at the time

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:36.080
Like right now they're finding the origami monster. Hey, it looks like one of those tangrams. Yeah

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:45.140
But a friend of ours, you know was breaking out the most bizarre for PC Engine collection and saying play this and it's pretty fun

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.820
This is actually one. I'm looking for a legit. I have a copy of it

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.580
but it's a fun little game and

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:57.000
And I mean, it's just I love parody games. I love games that are fun

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.860
You know good solid games that don't take themselves too seriously. I

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:05.700
mean, I love the proteus series a lot more than this obviously, but

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.000
This one's just really fun

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.780
And on top of that I like that all the little guys that they talk to in the intro a little bomber man guys

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:22.140
And they're outfitting a PC Engine, you know big smiley face with a copy of Superstar Soldier. So it'll fight

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:26.560
It's pretty funny. I have a little sexy lady standing on the stage in the background there

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.980
Like I think one of the enemies you fight in this is like a black bomber man

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:40.140
And all kinds of stuff. It's really a fun little game and I love the music in it. The music's great

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:47.220
There's the giant fish. I think that's who's played who plays a maraca apparently. Yeah, it plays maracas. All righty

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:53.460
So yeah, it's totally worth it. You can get it on virtual console. I totally recommend it. It's

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.220
Officially listed as star protea. I learned it as star protea. So

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.300
It doesn't matter. It's written as

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:08.880
Stop food. Oh, yeah. All right. There it is your classic game of the week star protea protea or whatever you want to say

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.420
soldier

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:16.500
And it is available on virtual console. Yes, it is an America came out again on

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.460
August 11th 2008. All right

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.780
There you have it your classic game of the week and now as a part of the show

Anyway, that doesn't stop some of our live people from kind of watching it with one eye and listening to this show with their ears

Or what have you we're still here

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:24.980

Maybe more talk about Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.260
I don't know, but first a little update on our spin-off shows if you like orange on radio

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:46.980
You might like some of our other shows to dark Sakura. What is your spin-off show that you have going on now?

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.440
Well, we'd exactly say it's a spin-off

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.680
but

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.680
Whatever the other show you do

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.640
Comic insanity and today we had a special guest on the show

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.480
We had PJ Perez who is the publisher for pop goes the icon

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.280
very cool and

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.720
I also host this with Mar and Marvel or as we all know her as Tiara and

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.140
Shadow or Dan shadow or whichever name he's deciding to go by this week

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:24.100
Nice, so we we we go live on Tuesday at infamous NF a mo us dotnet awesome

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:30.280
It's been off show that I do is called the best little horde house and Azeroth or horde house for short if you're a fan

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.400
Of World of Warcraft you'll probably like this show

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:38.020
It's myself and extra for being really lulsy about the game and this week was some PvP centric talk

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.500
So if you are into PvP at all you might want to check out this week's show

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:48.100
But of course all the Warcraft news and everything going on in the world of Warcraft on horde house. Check it out on it

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.260
It's very fun. We're not cool enough to have a website yet. Maybe someday. All right

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:56.700
Let's get into some rapid-fire news some quick quick stuff that just didn't make the show

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:03.160
Otherwise and definitely your last chance to get those Twitter topics in we'll be getting those right after the quick fire news stories

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.500
All right

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:11.960
Well project M a kind of a homebrew effort to make Super Smash Brothers brawl play a little bit more like Super Smash Brothers

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:13.560
Melee

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.380
Has released its first demo now

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.700
What's kind of cool about this hack is it doesn't require that you have any sort of mods done to your system

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.900
all you need to do is dump it onto a SD card and

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.500
Pop it into your

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.620
Wii and away you go

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:34.940
so you can download that from project M's website, which is project M that smash mods calm and

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:42.180
I believe that you do need a card though. That is less than two gigs in size in order to be able to have the thing

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.700
work

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.700
Yeah, check it out. It's

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.740
really more for like kind of the hardcore Malik player because there's a lot of

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.180
Tweaks and stuff in there that most average people probably wouldn't get so

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.980
That is out there to check out

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.500
In case you have a

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:04.540
Netflix disc for your

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:09.900
PlayStation Wii well, unfortunately, it's not gonna work after February 16th and

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.620
I

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:14.620
Guess you know, they're gonna

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:21.660
Send out they send out an email to all the members saying that the disc will cease to function and that's it. So oh

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:30.540
Well, but of course you can always download the streaming software via the Wii shop channel because that's why they're getting rid of

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.900
This there is another option for you. So

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:40.140
Be sure to do that if you want to still stream stuff on your Wii and then finally

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:48.820
So cool stuff coming to Rock Band via the Rock Band Network some tracks from Super Meat Boy are making its way out

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.300
And these are coming from Danny

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.380
Baron Ouski

01:14:54.380 --> 01:15:00.460
he did the soundtrack for Cannibal and Super Meat Boy and the tracks that are confirmed to be coming the

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.180
Battle of little slugger

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.060
Kano salt and those are going to be released as

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:14.500
Remixed extended versions and then the beat is blues will get him. I guess a retro remix for that release

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:19.540
That's gonna be awesome because the music from Super Meat Boy is great. Yes, just saying

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.100
It's gonna be probably some really hard stuff. Yes

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:29.060
In fact their comment or his comment was I wanted to have some stuff in there for people who delight in 100% teen

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.460
expert dragon force

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.180
Give you an idea how hard it's gonna be nice

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:40.300
All right, awesome and they're expected sometime after February 15th, very cool

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:48.260
All right. Well, let's get to some other news and this kind of sorta has to do with that same thing except

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:52.300
It's not Super Meat Boy. It's Rock Band and what is coming out this week on Rock Band?

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.380
the good news is despite all of the stuff that's going on with

01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:02.700
Guitar hero Rock Band is still kicking with some expansions and I like this this week is the February

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.380
heartache duets pack

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:10.540
Which I think is great which includes Bonnie Tyler's total eclipse of the heart

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:15.100
I can think of no better duets than that one. That's do we have pretty awesome leader Ford?

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:20.180
No, we do have an emotion with obsession. So these cool Bonnie

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.100
Bob Bo B with Haley Williams with airplanes

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:31.420
I don't like the paramore chicken human league with don't you want me lady antebellum would need you now

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:36.420
Stevie Nicks would stop dragging my heart around. Oh, no, that's a good one by far the coolest

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.740
No, this just blows all the others out of the water. You ready?

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.940
paradise by the dashboard light by meatloaf

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.760
Outstanding absolutely outstanding, but we just cured sure me out with that list

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:53.820
Well, this might be something even sure me could enjoy

01:16:54.340 --> 01:17:00.740
It's hitting the blogs this week about a three-year-old named Oliver Smith who was playing a game on the Nintendo

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:07.620
We that his mom bought him Victoria's the mom's name the game is on the European version of the Wii

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:13.740
It's called countdown, which is based off a television show that they have over in Britain and basically you unscramble words

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.320
You know they show up in whatever format, and then you unscramble them

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:20.760
Yeah, the kid got a word

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.300
shah

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:27.240
S I T E D and you know what that unscrambled into

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.640
You know shitheads. That's right shitheads

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.880
So this little three-year-old got exposed to that word and of course according to the angry mother

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.160
I couldn't believe my eyes as the world was as the word was slowly unveiled as an obscene insult

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.240
Oliver is a really bright kid, and we play this game to help him build up his word bank

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.520
He was already asking what the word meant

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.200
Nice

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.920
Somebody let that one slip by in the dictionary whoops

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:58.640
But if you expose your children to it early, then it's not as special older, and they won't be as inclined to say it

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.480
And this last one god. I don't even really want to report on it

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:10.320
But it's just kind of sad because of everything we have going on guitar hero and all that yep karaoke revolution glee volume 2

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.520
It's coming

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.400
20 more songs

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.680
From part 2 wow and one only 20

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:24.520
That's that that's some effort right there. Yep. Yeah, I can even see in one of the little screen caps here

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.760
Can't touch this I wonder what song that could be

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:29.640
Yep, so if you like glee

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.720
This is them all dressed up as Lady Gaga, so I want your love so you can sing to bad romance

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.760
whatever

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.200
whatever

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.560
big whatever

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560
Dark soccer, what do you have for us a?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.280
Bunch of crap actually not crap

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:49.480
Final Fantasy 1 & 2 is coming to PlayStation Network in Europe, and it will be 7 pound 99 and

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.680
They're going to be the UMD versions that came out in 2008

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:59.360
which as far as I recall weren't very great and

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.160
Then there's going to be a new DDR game for iOS. It's going to

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.440
Be dance dance revolution freedom, and it is free and has four songs

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:15.000
And I like that the tap to start as a thumbprint. That's actually cool

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.640
but I

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.600
Don't know it looks interesting. Maybe I'll give it a try if it's free why not shoot and then

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.480
It looks like our fading arcade infinity is actually for real closing its doors

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.920
So they're gonna be closed on February 26 as opposed to fake closing their doors like we had a couple months ago

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.560
yeah, they're closing on February 26 2011 and

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:46.560
They it's actually LA County denied their application for business license extension

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.440
So

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:54.880
They have to close the county wants them to close shop

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.640
Pay for a new license and wait for all of the hearings and City Council votes in

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:05.960
In order for it to stay open which could take a up to eight months. Why did they have like such?

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.720
Like what's their problem with this arcade? I mean seriously. It's like they hate them

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.720
Well, they're saying it's not the money. It's just how long AI would have had to remain closed so

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:21.100
It's going away. I hate you LA

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.080
Officially well, that's just it's you know we haven't talked about this when the news came up the first time

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:32.880
It's just kind of sad to hear about these arcades closing. You know what I mean, so no, but

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:41.480
I'm sure there'll be no a shortage of little arcades where ticket-spitting machines come out and all that stuff whatever

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.020
Let's move in to the Twitter topics

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:53.800
Every week you guys send us your tweets at twitter.com slash O L R. We like to read some of our favorites here on the show

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.000
So getting into some of the tweets sent to us tonight. There's a few gosh

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.040
There's tons of tweets tonight, and I getting into the first tweet here from eternal rapture says

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.140
Listening live for the first time tonight because I live in the UK. I'm staying up till 5 a.m.. For you guys

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.400
It's way past your bedtime. I hope it's a three-day weekend or something

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.640
Act F tweets us and says since Bobby yet to won the Grammy it was nominated for I think it's only fair to have it on

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:24.220
Ol ours. I love this song this week. Don't you think so yes? I'm all for having like actual content on the website

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.220
That would be amazing so

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.840
moving on

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.480
seg

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.920
Sending us a tweet saying the only relevant Grammy news

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:40.080
I'm sorry is that it oh no is tweet us the only relevant Grammy news is Christopher Tinn winning one for Baba yet to

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.860
From Civ for which is very relevant. I agree as extremely relevant

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.280
Glad to hear it

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.280
All right

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.260
Jake Jake ll sends us. Sorry. That's spam tweet

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.720
Get an NFL game for free who cares

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.120
Let's see

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:08.560
Blue swim sends us a tweet here saying Loki have you seen the new earth defense force insect Armageddon trailer pesticide gun

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.900
No, I haven't seen it yet. Well. How about that blue swim sends us a link to that little video right here

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:18.440
So we can take a look at it hold on let me pause this and turn this up

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:45.680
No, it sucks about that game is it's been delayed

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.620
In a game god damn it the fact is delayed to June

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.820
You mad

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:58.140
Yes, I am not mad with disappointed and a couple from Tiger Claw here

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:03.740
I guess a Plants vs. Zombies board game is actually happening. What a board game

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:09.140
That's a little strange, but kind of not surprising a lot of this stuff usually crosses over into other worlds

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:14.120
So yeah, there's a Plants vs. Zombies board game. It was spotted at Toy Fair 2011

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:19.740
it's going to be a two to four player game with 80 zombie guards cards excuse me 40 plant cards and

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.500
Different game boards on which you place these plants and battle the various zombies

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:30.640
You know I got to play that on an iPad. Yeah the other day, and I wanted an iPad after that

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.220
the iPad works a little better those versions than the

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:41.680
Other ones anyhow also a tweet from Tiger Claw telling us that the world of Starcraft mod

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.240
You remember this this was somebody taking Starcraft 2 and making a custom mod in it

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:51.620
That was world of Starcraft and Blizzard did not take too kindly to this we talked about this on Hoard House a little bit

01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:54.140
This week it is now called Starcraft universe

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:59.200
So it has a name that I guess is a little less threatening to Blizzard or what now Sony gets pissed off

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:05.300
We'll see so yeah, it has its name changed and there you go and

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:10.820
Lastly SSJ100 Matt says his tweet tonight saying resident hockey fan with some hockey game news

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:17.340
NHL 2k11 is available now for the iPad for $5 so if you're into hockey check that out

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.380
You know it's not blades of steel though that that will always be the best hockey game as far as I'm concerned

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.060
There you go

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.700
Last time we got a couple last-minute tweets

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:32.020
I'll read these silver Sonic tweets us on Twitter and saying I just linked this in the chat room

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:37.820
But did you hear the story of the 11 year old boy in the UK that spent 1 million pounds on?

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:42.100
Xbox live no I didn't he links us the story here, I guess

01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.780
the 11 year old kid

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:49.380
Racked up a 1,000 pound debt on the debit card through the Xbox

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.860
He bought accessories and new games on the consoles after it saved details of a previously registered card

01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:00.900
It's hard to get those cards off there. Yeah, it is

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.060
Wow

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:04.900
but I mean

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:08.020
Why is she kind of letting the kid run rampant with this?

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:13.100
There's this little picture where her and the kid are kind of posing together looking all I don't know

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.740
I don't want to say all kind of frumpy I guess and

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:21.460
what's interesting is that he I guess she showed the thing to the kid and

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:29.020
When he when she says when I showed him he burst into tears he unplugged the Xbox and said he didn't want it anymore

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:33.620
I haven't punished him because he feels bad enough, and I know he won't do it again. I

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:37.640
I don't know though. I don't work at two jobs, and I'm a single mother

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.380
Why did you put the card in the house

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:50.420
Parental things that they can you know enable to where you can disable live purchases, right? Well, yeah

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:55.820
You know if you don't pay attention on how to set you know controls on your consoles

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.760
And you can only blame yourself for when someone spends money on

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.920
Don't pretend. Oh, I didn't know

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:10.200
That's it for tweet tweets tonight twitter.com slash olr if you want to follow us on Twitter and send us some tweets for next week

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.300
Let's move on with some more gaming news Loki

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.440
Have no patience for those type of people

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.200
This is kind of ironic. I guess someone suing Sony this time so Sony suing other people

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.720
apparently LG has

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:31.720
You know sent a lawsuit to Sony regarding their system the PlayStation 3

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:38.280
They claimed that certain electronic devices having a blu-ray disc player and components

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.720
They're violates four of its patents and that includes

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.080
I guess a lot of devices like Bravia TVs, but the only piece of hardware

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:53.040
I guess they were singling out was the PlayStation 3 and they actually have a specific model, which is the 100 and gate

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.160
hundred and sixty gigabyte system that says

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.360
They filed the complaint with the US International Trade Commission

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:10.800
Which has the power to block imports of products that violate US patents and says ensure LG is looking to

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.680
Have the ITC keep the ps3s off American shores

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.620
They said they've also filed a civil suit against Sony in federal court in California

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:28.320
Making similar claims and seeking cash compensation for unauthorized use of its inventions

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440
Interesting very

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.060
It's kind of funny though. And now I think of it because wasn't Sony the one that came up with like the blu-ray format

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:45.880
Anyways, I thought they were the ones that kind of developed that stuff. I could be very wrong on that though. But um, oh

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640
well karma bitch

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.520
Sony is just loving the litigation thing lately. I don't know

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.920
Yeah, I said you're in California suing the pants off people that really don't need to be in California

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.920
Then might as well get sued yourself. Sounds good

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.260
Keeps busy

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.320
All right

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.520
Well moving on with this this rumor just never stops

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.680
This rumor is always around and it's when is Apple getting into gaming when is Apple getting into gaming?

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.960
It's kind of like well, they're already in gaming if you consider the iPhone, but okay, how about the consoles?

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:20.640
When are they gonna get back into consoles? Cuz I guess you could say the Pippin but I think Apple would rather not talk about

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.240
That but yeah

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:22.680
I

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:25.720
One of the rumors that keeps coming up is the Apple TV because you know

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.640
they've sold this device for very cheap and it's kind of way to get Apple connected to your television and

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.920
Now the rumors are coming up again that perhaps Apple TV games are more real than you think but how?

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:42.480
Let me put it this way the Apple TV isn't even powerful enough to run games on it

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.480
I mean, I know it's I think it's uh

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.480
Intel atom

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.600
CPU but I mean is that

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.200
Comparable to like an iPod or something or iPhone. I mean can can they run?

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.000
I mean would they even be able to have the horsepower to do that?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.800
I don't think you'd be talking top-of-the-line stuff here

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.920
I don't think you'd be playing exactly Gears of War on one of these things, but maybe either some type of

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.820
device between your iPhone and this like maybe you can talk to the iPhone and kind of like

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:15.460
God, which a PSP is supposed to do with ps3 where you beam images from one source to the other

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.780
That makes sense

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:17.460
That would be cool

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:24.740
now if you could stream games from say your iPod or iPhone or something like that and then play them on the Apple TV with a

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.620
Controller right a physical controller. Mm-hmm. Although

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:34.380
At the same time or just like a physical controller for my iPod would be awfully nice

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:38.820
They actually had that there was stuff that they cover but they were selling this device

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:44.140
I was for like 80 bucks or someone's a Bluetooth device actually snaps onto your iPod or actually is even for any

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:50.060
Mobile device that supports Bluetooth, but it had like kind of a you know a PlayStation setup

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:54.420
You know directional pad two analogs and you know four buttons or whatever

01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:58.700
Could I use my remote control as a tangible controller perhaps? I don't know

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.780
Well, wait, I didn't even tell you where this rumor comes from and because you're gonna laugh at this

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:07.720
This is why this is a rumor all over again. There's beta code out there for the new iOS

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:14.820
4.3 because you know, they regularly do updates to iOS and so forth. Well 4.3 apparently in the code references

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:21.480
ATV games and people think that means Apple TV because ATV and

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.040
The code I guess also talks about

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:28.080
controllers of some sort

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.560
leaderboards

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.660
scheduling games and of course a storefront I

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:38.580
Mean this news isn't like shocking. I think this is kind of one of those matter-of-time types of things

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.860
But it's interesting to see what sort of things they have planned

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.940
I think there would be a new Apple TV that would help facilitate this

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.460
We'll see the price points awfully nice of the Apple TV

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:53.140
You mean if they're trying to get people to bring it in as like a game console true hell if they even drop the price

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:58.700
Like say another 20 bucks 79 99 that would be pretty, you know appealing to people that aren't necessarily

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.700
You

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:05.700
Know into gaming and the other thing which would be kind of cool and I'm not too sure on the whole

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:11.460
I don't know too much about the Apple TV other than the fact that you can stream shit from your PC your Apple or you

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:17.340
Know iTunes or whatever to it and stuff. Can you run apps on there already on the Apple TV can like I say

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:21.860
Browse Google or something, you know do Facebook and stuff like that

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:26.620
You can do on like the iPods and the iPhones and stuff. Can you do that stuff already?

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.620
on Apple TV

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.100
You can do

01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:34.860
The song. Yeah, I think you can do like movies and stuff. I think so

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:39.940
Okay, well you can do movies, but you can't run like apps. You can't do like no Facebook or anything. No, okay

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:46.060
So that would be interesting if they did that because then they would be trying to compete with like Google TV and stuff like that

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:52.420
I think and if you throw gaming in there, that could be interesting seeing as it's way cheaper than Google TV. I

01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:59.220
Don't know it would be smart for them to do that if they're that's because it gets people to bring that shit into the house

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.500
You know for the gaming and then they can sell them on

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:08.660
Hey, look, you can you know, we could buy TV shows or you can buy this this could be a real stretch here

01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:14.580
But maybe this is part of what the whole iPad 2 thing has to do with because you know

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.580
We haven't heard a lot out of iPad 2

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:23.740
Besides that it's supposed to have this front-facing camera and might have the nice retina display. Maybe we haven't even we were haven't really heard

01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:29.260
Anything but a bunch of rumors, but you know, there'll be that inevitable press conference at some point. So

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.580
Could this maybe tie into that somehow they were saying even that

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.500
the

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.060
3.4

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:41.420
Or was it 4.3? I'm sorry the new

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:48.620
New firmware where it was supposed to be coming out this week from what I heard or that was rumored like the 15th

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:58.220
All right, well we will see what develops of this whenever they decide to do another press conference over at Apple and announce what all

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.100
The lemmings will be buying next

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:04.060
Which will probably include myself. Don't get me wrong Dark Sakura. What do you have for us in the meantime?

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:10.580
Well, it looks like there has been an alleged Dance Central 2 survey

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:12.420
that

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.420
might be looking at a

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:17.100
feature list

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:19.100
so basically

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:25.780
Kotaku says that it has an email survey for Microsoft Game Studios that has a list of those features that it's in

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:33.540
pre-production and that it would have the ability to create custom dances and play as backup dancers or singers and

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:39.500
Then you can replay entire sequences and get specific feedback on your dancing

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:45.940
and then they're also having a fitness mode and an online offline multiplayer contest and

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.280
That you will have a social aspect to it

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.860
so

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:57.460
God, does this mean that you can put a video of yourself like dancing through captured via the Kinect?

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.860
I don't know like somehow automatically just

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.660
Sounds kind of scary to me a little bit

01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:11.340
Well, you know they want that whole community thing and after all they've been you know

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:17.380
Doing the first party Kinect games and take pictures of you, which I'm surprised you can't share those pictures

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.580
You know with like Facebook and stuff

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.980
At least I'm unaware that you can

01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:23.860
easily

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:29.100
Because I would think that they would want to do something like that and wasn't there some sort of feature that was supposed to be

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:33.940
Coming where we can do screenshots from games and stuff like that and like share them on Facebook and that kind of crap

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:38.940
Because wasn't there like when they were talking about the whole Facebook integration stuff and it's like hey look

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:44.980
I just you know, blah blah blah in Tiger Woods and here's a screenshot of me hitting the hole in one or some crap

01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:50.500
This is kind of where gaming is going more and more and you know

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.620
We start talking about the next generation of consoles

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:58.020
Don't be surprised if this whole social network stuff is even more so a part of it

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:01.620
This doesn't really surprise me at all. I'm kind of surprised with rock band 3

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.540
That seems to be like one of the things they left out

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:07.980
I was always convinced that rock band 3 was gonna have a whole like upload your performance

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:14.860
I think like sing sing star have the sing star has that sing star has that and Def Jam rap star has that come on Konami you've

01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:16.980
Got components for a good game in there

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:22.420
It just doesn't really do any rap stars one of the better music games has been put out recently. It really is

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.480
It's just it's they have the potential. They're just like

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:30.060
Do it

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:33.580
This is kind of disappointing I suppose

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:38.220
Um crisis 2 has been leaked online including multiplayer

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:45.460
it's not the final version of the game, but it's a near final build of the game including multiplayer and

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.860
also

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.380
apparently I

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:51.380
guess that there's

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:53.820
some other things including that

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:59.740
It doesn't have the DRM on it that there's a way to bypass it and that kind of stuff

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:04.580
I believe there are some stuff that's placeholder in it like some of the sound effects some of the assets are missing

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.580
but it is quite playable and

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:12.300
Is floating around out there for those unscrupulous types that may want to download that and check it out

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.380
Or you could you know support the game

01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:21.360
Or you can do them also all the dev tools are included with it, too

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.660
So that's kind of which means that came from the inside

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.900
Well, yeah, it's development copy obviously came from the inside

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:34.100
That's got to be frustrating though for the company as a whole like what a way to kind of screw over your co-workers

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.100
It's a month before it comes out. Awesome

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:42.780
Yikes, they're gonna have to be doing some damage control on that. Yeah, it

01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:50.900
That I think the the same thing happened with the last crisis game as well that it leaked out before it came out

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:52.900
I remember I

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:58.660
Remember that it did and I just didn't care though because I was a time when I actually was building computer for crisis

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.780
and

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:08.140
So I actually got crisis with my graphics card that came with my computer. So it wasn't such a big deal for me, but

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:12.340
That's gotta suck. It's I mean

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.580
It would have sucked even more if it was on consoles

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:20.300
Because that would have been terrible. But let's see here. I was just gonna read there was a

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:25.820
They're talking about comments though. What's not exactly working in it and stuff?

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:30.060
Apparently

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.500
Let's see, there's yeah assets missing there's temporary

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:39.380
Sounds and stuff for certain things and it's buggy

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.180
Which is not surprising

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.020
Hmm

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:51.220
Well, I don't know you think this could be damaging for the entire series in the future

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:55.820
I mean could this jeopardize I mean could this jeopardize more than just crisis to

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:01.300
Well, no, but I think that they definitely need to make sure that they

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.360
What they should have done is

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:12.780
If they are having people internally working on this stuff that they should maybe watermark them so that they know where they came from

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:17.220
You know like movie studios and stuff like that do that with film

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:22.200
Copies it sent out to theaters that way if they see a pirated one on the internet

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.180
They can go and find you know, the watermarks that are hidden within it and go

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:32.380
Okay, this came from such and such theater now. We know who to go kill, you know same with this

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:37.080
This is a development copy. It got leaked from the inside. So you got to find out who leaked it. I

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.440
I I'm just imagining what the temporary sounds are like

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.160
Like you shoot somebody goes. I don't think it's anything like that

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.280
I think if it's anything it's probably stuff from the original crisis game, you know

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.480
Just like stuff like that if I was a developer, I'd put in funny sounds too as my placeholders. I

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:03.080
Kind of want to check out the game though, honestly though, cuz I like the first one

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:05.720
I just couldn't finish it cuz it was so goddamn buggy

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:07.480
Mm-hmm

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:11.180
It's why I'm picking up the next one console though Xbox 360 all the way

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.200
All right

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.440
well one more story for you guys before we get into some of the other segments here about the

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.440
This is kind of along the same lines because this could be an effect we might see in the future for this whole piracy

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:29.260
I don't know. I'm just saying companies are doing what they want to do and this is about

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.680
PlayStation 3 games possibly

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:39.640
Getting serial numbers now, this is some sources that we're speaking with the site PS 3 cents, which is Dutch

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.120
Sony is going to implement a

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:46.160
Serial code security system for future ps3 game releases

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.920
This would be very similar to what you already know on PC titles

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:54.040
you get a long code that comes in the box you have to enter that in in order to play the game or install the

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.680
Game and that code can be used on up to five consoles

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.000
Now, of course folks are saying well, you're just basically

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.880
Slowing down the inevitable people are gonna find ways to hack around those serial number requirements

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:11.520
Anyway, and then you just piss off those folks that buy this stuff legitimately and you've just killed the use market as well

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.400
So awesome. I hope they don't do that because that's it's just dumb

01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:23.640
What's interesting is that Kotaku actually called Sony on this for comments and Sony told them we are looking at a few options

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.280
Not ready to confirm our next steps. Oh, yes. They are looking in flat-out. Deny it

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.000
Yeah, if they would have said we don't comment or you know, no, that's not something we're doing

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.440
Yeah, they are looking at that as an option

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:44.060
So awesome that that's a terrible idea because I can tell you right now those serial codes really stop people hacking PC games

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:48.840
I mean that stuff gets broken like a day after it comes out. So I'm sorry that is

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:51.840
Terrible as a terrible idea

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.800
I

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.480
Yeah, yeah, and you know what the problem with that is and it's not even gonna necessarily stop piracy

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:01.880
It's gonna stop people buying your console is what it's gonna do. It's gonna stop people

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:08.020
Especially people, you know, like the hardcore gamers out there that have multiple consoles. You know what? Fuck it

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.840
I'm just not gonna buy this game on the ps3

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:14.940
I will buy it on the Xbox 360 or whatever other consoles are out there. I kind of I agree

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:20.080
That's exactly what's gonna happen because I think Sony would be surprised how fast word is gonna travel like that

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.920
And if you know it starts to get out there

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.600
Well, you can't sell back your used games so they don't sell for as much you can't let friends borrow your games

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.360
I can't do anything piracy on their games sell three is not a huge

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.040
I mean, let's put it this way the Xbox 360 has had piracy on it for a

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:43.320
Very long time. You don't see them going to dramatic, you know, very drastic measures like this

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.940
You know whereas ps3 piracy is just kind of getting around

01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:52.980
And it's kind of cumbersome because blu-ray rips aren't exactly the smallest things to download

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:59.020
I mean, it's we're talking like, you know, some games being 20 to 50 gigs in size. That's not

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:05.180
Convenient for a lot of people to just download and pirate granted it people could do it

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.860
and there are people out there that will do it, but

01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:10.940
it's a lot of

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:17.720
The hoops that jump through basically and to go this route and kind of punish everybody that owns a ps3

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:23.220
It's a really dumb idea. I mean if they think it's necessary then great go go that route

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.940
But don't be surprised that there's a huge backlash over it

01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:32.080
I'm looking at our chat room at chat that orange lounge rated calm to try and see some of the comments here

01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:37.660
Gamer girl in our term says dude, that doesn't surprise me. They're trying to put serial numbers on humans now, too. So

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.740
That might be a little bit too sci-fi for me. I don't know

01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:45.580
Let's see Frisbee says more of a reason for me not to buy a PlayStation 3 and its products

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:51.500
dark Tetsuya says why is it the Earth's measures only seem to harm the legit users and

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:56.500
Read the haze says rumors from no-name site something plausible from a no-name site

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.020
Well, you never know, you know, there's been things we've reported on in the past that

01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.020
You know, they call us a no-name site

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:08.440
So, you know whatever like I know we're not on the a-list of internet gaming websites

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:13.900
We're more like on the f-list, which is fine if but their console gets completely hacked open anyways

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:22.580
You know assuming they lose this court case and it sets some sort of precedent or whatever that jailbreaking a console is okay. I

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:30.000
Mean, let's just say that they do implement some sort of serial code or whatever that can be tracked

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.620
I mean right now people have found ways to get past even the you know

01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:38.540
Firmware checks because the newest firmware that's out there obviously breaks all the hacks that are out there

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:43.060
Well people have found ways around that even and they're still able to connect to the PlayStation Network

01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:47.660
so if they can find a way around that they could probably find a way around the authentication thing and

01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:51.700
Then it doesn't even matter and on top of all that

01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:57.560
How the hell are you gonna work that authentication thing in to people that don't have access to?

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:03.360
Online if your console is not connected to the internet, then you can't play your damn game that you bought so

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.160
How's that gonna work I?

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.840
Can say this for a business

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:16.680
Looking into something is not the same thing as implementing it and I think that they're smart to look at their options

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.720
But if they do implement it then that's when it gets stupid

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:25.600
They they do kind of owe it to these third parties that you know some of them having a lot of problems

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:31.020
You know we just reported on that crisis story or whatever. They do kind of owe it to them to keep their system safe, so

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.200
No

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:39.000
Alright, well, let's get to the mailbag and every week you guys send us emails and dark soccer likes to dive into the email bag

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:42.500
And read some of her favorite emails, so dark soccer. I want you to get to it

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:50.520
Well today's emails. Oh you actually just got one more while I decided to check, so I'm gonna read it to you

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.080
We got a lot of emails today Rob

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.160
Which I guess is good in contrast to how it's been before

01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:02.920
Hey, Olr. This is red the haze longtime listener since 2007 if this email makes you in time for

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:10.120
Makes you in time for your February 13th show as to I'm typing this last minute

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:15.840
I called for the first time last week on your 400th show to congratulate you and I spoke about the Super Bowl sorry Super Bowl

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.980
And I would like to apologize to you guys about that

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:23.700
Olr is one of my favorite podcasts, and I felt bad in talking about something not game related or even food related

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:25.780
So I came up with a last-minute gaming question

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:30.900
My question is this I'm about to join the Air Force soon when I finish basic training and go to tech school

01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:35.580
I won't be able to game on the consoles for a while and only be allowed to have a laptop or PC

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:43.600
Can you guys recommend a gaming laptop or pre-built PC and some PC gaming controllers since the wire 360 controllers d-pad is crap

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:50.800
For some emulator action I would also I would say right away probably the best gaming specific laptops out there are the alien

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.080
There's you're gonna pay some money for them. I'll say that might not be the best option though. It's super expensive to do that

01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.360
Let me say just right off the top of my head. Those are probably the best

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:06.800
Laptops for gaming other than that as they build it yourself. I I would just look at what the specs are different laptops

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:09.640
I know everybody likes alien aware as a gaming laptop

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:16.920
But they're fucking expensive and seriously, like I have an aces Republic of gamers laptop or whatever works great for games

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:23.440
It's I mean the one I bought to preach, you know low-end, but you know, I can run Grand Theft Auto in it

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.880
Which is a very un I guess

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.760
It it could use some work as far as enhancing the game

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.880
Spec wise make a run crisis fine chugs on Grand Theft Auto, but um

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:42.680
you know, you can just don't spend a lot because those aces are the not the aces, but the

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:50.240
Alienware ones can be like over a thousand dollars. Well, my PC my PC is this what do I have again? I have a

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:56.920
An HP quad core that I picked up a couple years ago for 800 bucks with the monitor and all

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.400
and all I had to do was put in the new graphics card and

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.800
power supply and

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.600
It I play everything I want to play and I do all my graphics work and it's just fine. I

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.440
Well, I mean you guys have seen what games look like on my computer they run really well

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:20.240
Well, also if you've seen he's playing a running emulators, right? Oh, yeah, you don't need anything super high

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.600
If you're running emulators, remember that especially when it comes down to Maim and stuff the main things

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.680
you're gonna want to focus on are the speed of your CPU and

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:34.080
Do most emulators will run on a frickin netbook. Well that that's true

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.680
They will but I'm talking about Maim here Maim. You're gonna really need to focus on one thing

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.200
It doesn't matter if it's dual core quad core because most of the main bills don't support

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.520
You know the multi threading and stuff like that, but you're really gonna have to focus on

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.600
the actual

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:53.320
Core speed of it. So, you know you want something that's you know high twos to

01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:59.120
Threes if not, I don't think they have fours out there but dance had Maim running just fine on his quad core

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.280
Just you know, I want to jump in here

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:03.320
Well, yeah, but I'm saying you know a lot of stuff though, that's fine

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:09.320
But like if you're trying to run really high-end Maim stuff like, you know, gauntlet legends or something like that

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:12.480
I mean that's gonna require a four gigahertz processor

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.520
Let me jump in here because read the haze is actually in chat right now in our chat room and say it says money isn't

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.980
A problem. I'm willing to spend 1k plus so that there you go. That's probably your answer

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:25.220
Otherwise, I would say kind of two things here. I have a Toshiba that I bought on sale for like 400 bucks

01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:30.820
During a 4th of July sale at fries like two years ago, and it runs Wow cataclysm

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:35.780
Like, you know, I can't play max graphics settings, but I can get away with playing few PC

01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:40.780
Yeah, I can play Starcraft 2 on it on low settings too. So it ain't gonna get away with some of the newer stuff

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.540
It's just like I won't get that pristine gaming experience

01:48:43.540 --> 01:48:49.080
Well, that was only foreign about keep in mind with my with my lower and it was under spec for Star Trek online

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.620
But I played Star Trek online just fine

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:56.900
It looks shitty but it played and that's all I cared about and I I love this comment from salacious pop in our chat room

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:00.620
And maybe the best feedback is actually gonna come from our chat room on this because I haven't bought a laptop in a while

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:05.420
But this is pretty much how I did it when I bought it and this is what salacious pop says in our chat room to

01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.740
Be honest, just look at what's on clearance at Best Buy that has a name-brand

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:15.940
ATI or Radeon card and then Google benchmarks and I think that's the smart thing to do is don't go in there and impulse buy

01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.180
Something or don't buy something just because it's on sale

01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:22.180
Google those things get reviews on them

01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:29.180
See what they're capable of and try to make the best informed decision you can but if you want me to recommend you something right?

01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:33.660
Off the cusp. Oh my gosh technology changes so fast. It's really hard for me to say something

01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:37.260
I think the Toshiba I bought two years ago. They probably don't even make anymore. It's probably an even better one

01:49:37.260 --> 01:49:38.820
That's 400 bucks now

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:44.660
The I like that laptop Loki has it's pretty nice the aces my little dinky netbook

01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:48.880
No, I run SNES ROMs on it all the time. Yeah, so and I read them in Linux

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.300
So, of course, it's running more efficiently than it would be had it been in Windows. So sadly

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.300
I'm not gonna be able to name that definitive laptop for you, but I think you got tons of options

01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:02.260
Just do your best to make an informed decision when you go shopping don't in action. Do not impulse buy

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:09.260
Thank you guys for all your hard work and passion for gaming. I wish you all the best. Bye. I love you guys all hearts

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:16.100
P.s. Forgive any grammatical mistakes as to I've been up for the last 20 hours finishing up a special Valentine's video

01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:21.940
For my GF and forgot that you guys are on right now as I'm typing this letter much love read the haste

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:27.100
Oh, hey, you know if you want to spend a lot of money on a computer or something do your own case mod

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:33.100
Just build a fucking, you know regular computer inside of like a you know, nice, you know

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.460
a durable like suitcase type thing you could totally have a cutout Air Force logo and show your

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:45.420
A really nice case mod for see that's the thing high-end laptops are so fucking expensive

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:49.700
And if you're like, you know, they're saying like there's some there $3,000 for $3,000

01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:54.100
You can build a nice PC and nice monitor if you spend just a little bit of time

01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:59.860
You know putting together even a very crude, you know case mod for it. It would be really nice. I

01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:05.460
I there was one of Dan's friends that built his PC out of a giant toolbox

01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.540
And it was pretty cool

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:10.820
but next email

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:15.140
This is from rubba. I was listening to up

01:51:15.780 --> 01:51:22.100
396 where you read my email about the 3ds and lazy eye. I was really wrong in stating. It's a muscular disorder

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:26.740
I had all sorts of causes. No, it has all sorts of causes and there are all sorts of treatments

01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:30.020
I shouldn't talk about things. I know little about so I am correcting myself

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:37.220
When you were doing the listless, I thinking horror game genre games lawns dark deathmatch

01:51:37.220 --> 01:51:39.580
The graphics would look like those airplane safety cards

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.660
Davros speak and spell spell

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:44.080
exterminate

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:48.000
Teddy Ruxpin soul-stealer. Hi, I'm Teddy Ruxpin and you have to sleep sometime

01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.380
That was pretty funny

01:51:51.620 --> 01:51:53.620
nice and

01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:57.780
Teddy Ruxpin dolls were pretty scary back in the day. Just so you know, they were freaky

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:02.460
We also got another one from Rob a button since it's short. I'll read it. I just got TDU, too

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:05.740
I haven't played enough to check out the clubhouses and such I can say

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:10.660
That despite the claims of any modeling system the games driving feels very much like the original TDU

01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:15.120
My only criticism of the gameplay so far is that it is very difficult to see intersections

01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:17.540
Do cops know how to drive off-road this time?

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:23.440
Because that was hilarious in the last one. Oh, there's cops chasing at me. I'm gonna drive off-road. I can't get me

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:30.380
The other news is that GameStop is giving out codes for TDU to casino to the first purchasers of the game

01:52:30.380 --> 01:52:34.940
The only problem is the day it was released. None of the casino codes worked

01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:41.420
I discovered that the codes weren't activated until February 9th at the earliest. It was really great being able to find

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:48.860
That on the Atari support forums, but they never put it in on the news feeds on their site or in the in-game news feed

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.900
rubba-buh

01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.900
That's poopy

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.060
Okay email from

01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:03.500
CMD whoever hey guys a couple of days ago. My mother purchased on pre-order for me the Nintendo 3ds

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:08.320
It is selling for 350 Australian. I guess it's a UD Australian

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:14.920
In which includes the 3ds one game and an accessories pack. So March 31st. I'm going to be super happy. Keep up the good work

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.720
Good for you send us one

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:25.760
Hey guys Moulton Brown here, I'm writing to congratulate you on your 400th episode. Keep up the awesome work

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.760
My weekends are never the same without you

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:34.480
I'm not really writing in with game related questions or news, but just some comments one to Loki over comment

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.560
You said a couple of episodes ago about a court's decision to allow the suit against J hat

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:42.600
The idea that a court has jurisdiction against a person whose online activities

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:45.840
Has a presence in their state is not a new or random thing

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:52.160
If I remember civil procedure correctly, depending on what the website is doing directly advertising and soliciting customers

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:57.080
I think is the message board site where the owners and other parties can communicate with each other or being a

01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:03.540
Neutral site that just allows users to look up information will influence whether the court feels they have jurisdiction over a party

01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:09.460
the more the site seems to directly advertise and solicit customers the more likely it is that the court will find they do have

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:14.620
Jurisdiction over the party who owns slash uses the website because the party has purposefully availed themselves

01:54:14.860 --> 01:54:19.920
To the privilege of doing business in the particular state. This means that the party voluntarily

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:26.180
Subjected themselves to the jurisdictions of courts in that state a court can see J hats website as soliciting customers

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.320
Because it was advertising a service the ability to jailbreak your ps3. I

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.600
I wouldn't say it's a service because all he was doing is sharing information

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.820
That's not really, you know, hey, I'll jailbreak your you know ps3 for you. I

01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:44.040
Think it's a matter of perception, but it does have a point there

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.840
Well, it's however the court decides to see it and I can understand that they were sitting

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:52.420
You know bringing him to California because his websites hosted in California, but that's not the case

01:54:52.420 --> 01:55:00.020
It was all because he communicated on Twitter, which pretty much everybody on the planet does nowadays and he had a PayPal account

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.260
Which he had a donation thing on his web page

01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:09.220
That that that was their criteria for it really it was because hey, guess what?

01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:12.020
they have a lot of lawyers on retainer in California, so

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:14.540
that I

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:19.560
Don't know whatever, you know, it's still going through and I remember there's some extra

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.480
You

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:28.080
Know stuff going on with the case right now where they you know now he's surrendered his hard drive and stuff

01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.200
to the courts for

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:37.700
You know Sony to go through as well as you know with his lawyer present, of course, and then they were actually trying to subpoena

01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:45.800
Google and Twitter and stuff to find out who the hackers were and fail overflow, but they were denied

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:52.520
So they can't really figure out who those other people are at this point and it doesn't matter anyways

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:58.800
Because they're not in the United States. So you can't I mean the laws are different. So I think the translation is

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:05.180
It doesn't matter. Anyways, everybody's like, oh no, I hope he you know, delete his hard drive stuff

01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:09.240
And I hope all this stuff. He didn't think he did anything wrong and you know

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.200
He's out to prove that and so he has nothing behind. Yeah

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.200
I

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:30.800
Don't like that bitch. I don't see her. I don't like that bitch. I don't see her

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.560
Yeah, that's pretty much me and Rama

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:38.160
Hey Rama

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:42.680
Bitch bitch. All right, someone can say the word bitch over and over

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.600
Three on my nickname since Rob makes fun of my nickname from time to time

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:51.500
I felt I had to explain it when I was trying to figure out a nickname for America's Army

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.500
I created molten brown an homage to my eyes

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:59.060
Which kind of look mahogany on the edges the closest color I could think of but as you get closer to the people the color

01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:03.860
Lightens up significantly. I always thought my eyes had a molten feel to them

01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:09.940
Like they're a like there was a flame behind my eyes and that the color that caused the color to lighten

01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:15.680
Additionally when I'm angry or happy my eye color seems to lighten up as if the fire is being turned up a notch because of

01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:19.400
How I am feeling so I thought molten brown made sense as a nickname. That's poetic

01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:24.820
Okay, that's all for me. Why don't I feel like crap for going straight to like the poop reference but

01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:29.860
Pun intended take care. That's a nice story now. I feel like

01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:36.220
I'm like molten brown myself. This message is brought to you by snow the only substance I can think of that's beautiful

01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.220
But consistently makes me want to punch someone in the face

01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:41.860
That's a good way to sum it up

01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:43.660
Excuse me

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:46.940
This one is from catastrophic moggie

01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:49.940
Hi, olr. I'm sure this week

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:54.820
You'll all be a buzz about the news of the deaths of guitar hero and DJ hero

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:57.620
So I thought I'd pass on a bit of news that's got me excited

01:57:57.620 --> 01:58:02.180
I was more than a bit miffed when I heard that the 3ds was region locked

01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:07.340
I often import DS games because they are cheaper and usually released long before they are in Europe

01:58:07.340 --> 01:58:10.220
That is if they remember to release them here at all

01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:14.780
I know it might sound silly but I also prefer the cases that are used in the u.s

01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:19.420
Much better than the ugly bulky semi-clear cases we get here. I like actually like the

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:23.620
European cases honestly, but I see your point

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:29.540
Anyway, what I am getting at is that I was seriously thinking about whether I'll bother getting a 3ds

01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:33.020
I mean only got 360 a couple months ago and still have tons of games

01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:36.300
I want to try but I read that cave stories being released on

01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.900
it well that threw a spanner in the works and

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:43.180
The concept art looks really impressive

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:47.300
See you guys around catastrophic moggie. I have to look at this now. I

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:52.580
I want to see what the art looks like. Okay cave stories Wow

01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:57.220
Wow pretty

01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:00.340
Okay, Jamie wants this

01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:03.820
I'm gonna link it in the chat room because it's pretty

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:07.380
It's really pretty

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:13.420
Because I I was I I tried cave story, but I thought it was kind of meh, but this is pretty

01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:16.660
There you go, everyone. Take a look in there

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.060
And

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:27.780
Now for our next email and by the way, thank you catastrophic moggie for sharing that link is it's pretty

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:34.500
Anyway, next email up. Hey, olr sing as the mailbag has been somewhat skimpy on average for a while now

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.620
I thought that it's in an email this week covering a few topics first off

01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:42.820
There is a free video available on PSN iTunes and the Xbox Live zoom marketplace

01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:44.820
Which is the pilot of mr. Sunshine?

01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:49.940
It's easy to find on PSN and iTunes if it takes a little hunting to find it via Xbox Live zoom

01:59:51.540 --> 01:59:52.700
Excuse me

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:54.060
Let's send my related note

01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:59.340
I found out a cool little deal that I'm sure the dark soccer would make use of since she's a Marvel fan. Yep

02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:03.900
Assuming that there's Target stores out west and sales are nationwide not just reasonable

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.420
They have Planet Hulk on blu-ray for dirt cheap

02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:12.180
At least at my favorite Target the shelf tag listed is $10 hell of a ring up to 750

02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:16.380
Movies, especially blu-rays don't get much cheaper than that new or used after seeing it

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:21.100
I was awestruck over how gorgeous the animation was and how good the voice acting was all in all it's a good

02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:27.260
Bye as a side note if you were able to do so try picking up the animated Dante's Inferno movie released in tandem with the game

02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:31.220
It was equally as good as Planet Hulk now if you're a fan of certain voice actors

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:35.060
I should mention that both Mark Hamill and Steve Blum have roles in Dante's Inferno

02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.620
See I would be interested in seeing Dante's Inferno

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:42.620
but I am NOT a Hulk fan at all because Marvel has just gone overboard with Hulk and

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:48.180
Every single freaking issue that Hulk should have nothing to do with Hulk was in spider-girl

02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:53.180
What do Hulk and spider-girl have in common, but that's not an argument for this podcast

02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:58.580
So probably no Hulk for me, but I did like the the ultimate Avengers once those are cool

02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:00.980
As for the last topic

02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:06.600
I assume that you have already covered the story about Activision giving guitar hero the axe as well as shredding Tony Hawk

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.440
puns fully intended in my honest opinion

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:15.320
It's about time Activision really ran those two franchises into the ground and frankly they haven't learned that quality is greater than quantity

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:20.120
Where they went wrong with guitar hero at least is the fact that they are inundated

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:27.200
They inundated the market with poorly supported via download content titles every year like clockwork now if they'd followed EA

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:33.960
Harmonix lead and use the rock band business model they would have fared better and the bottom wouldn't have fallen out of the music game

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.080
Market, I bet that within two to three years time the Call of Duty series

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:43.380
Will likely suffer the same fate it isn't too far of a stretch to predict that happening

02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:47.080
Thanks for taking the time to read this email errors and all it's appreciated

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:52.640
PS although I haven't fully put it together in time for this week's show hopefully by next week if possible

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:57.320
I'd like to initiate a little contest open to PA US PS 3 owners

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:02.860
Sorry everyone else you wouldn't be able to make use of the prize even if you won due to how PSN is set up

02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:06.700
It'll be one winner and who who will get some videos from you

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.920
USPS and video store anyone has a ps3 and is in the US banter. I just need to come up with a wordy trivia question

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:15.760
Hey, hmm

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:22.520
That's shiny and last one happy 401 is it wrong that I play Angry Birds on the toilet at work

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:25.640
This is from Mike. No, it's you and everyone else

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:34.440
And that's it. All right. Thank you very much for the emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:39.080
This is the place to send your emails to have them read next week here on the program

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.880
Maybe I'll still have my you know disease voice

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:49.160
All right, we got a few more news stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the skype line

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.780
Oh, but before we get to those we have to get into the F use of the week

02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:57.820
It's the part of the show where we get angsty as we've done for the last 400 weeks

02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:21.720
Dark Sakura my f you goes towards people not understanding the difference between

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:28.880
making a comment about an article and then spamming your Facebook with a bajillion comments

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.240
Arguing a political point that you really don't care to discuss

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.440
so

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.640
Forget it if it happens again, I'm gonna do what I did this time and delete it

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:45.120
This is the form of me my wall me your wall you

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:50.120
Respect my authority Facebook is serious business. That's why I'm back on my journal. I

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:55.160
Never left live journal. I don't know why people are I realize

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.600
Journal, but I ignored it for a little bit

02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.720
Here's that I realize there's a lot of creepy shit on live journal like I get that like I get the lol the Harry Potter

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.840
Stuff, but you know, that's not what everybody's into just say it

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.360
Anyhow, Loki

02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.480
I know I was mad at something earlier this week. I just don't remember it was so

02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:22.760
No F you to drama I suppose good fallback option, I guess

02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.160
Effie to dance 360 for breaking

02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.440
Dance in the back going yeah

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:38.880
If you did that little audio boo-boo, I just had they're going on there if you did not being perfect and if you did the fact

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.960
I don't have tacos right now. It's talk with something. Oh

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:46.400
Sure, but you're gonna help me want you to my ventrilo. Oh

02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:50.440
Yeah, I can help fix that for you though. I'll be fun. Um

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:54.960
Otherwise, I actually I don't have a lot to be bad about things are fine right now

02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:00.800
I don't know if you did the fact that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you. I'm not gonna be able to talk to you

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.200
I don't know if you did the fact that I'm separated on Valentine's Day

02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:10.160
Not like separated like in that context might be separated by distance, but it's just a day

02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:15.400
I mean, you know the meanings come on Rob somebody got decapitated. So no, no, it's

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.920
All right

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:23.840
Anyhow, let's get back into a couple more gaming news stories and then we're gonna get to your calls

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:26.760
Should be fun tonight

02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:31.760
Um something I really like about little big planet is the wonderful community made levels

02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:34.200
And of course, you know with a little big planet one

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.200
They had some pretty awesome stuff that they did with

02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:41.400
Contra which I hope they remake those for a little big plant to and time all together. That'd be really awesome

02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:48.920
But now they're doing something very similar to the contra thing where they have a project that's a collaboration between a bunch of different members

02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:55.280
They have one that's actually being done between 12 of the community members. It's called Hansel and

02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:03.480
Gretel bot it's a seven level little big planet to adventure that has cutscenes and everything and they say that the

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:07.600
Level design is on par with that with the first

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:12.220
Roll the single-player campaign that's with little big planet, too

02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:17.360
So definitely worth checking out and it will be out hopefully soon

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:20.000
so

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:23.640
That's pretty sweet. They actually covered it on the PlayStation blog as well. I

02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:24.880
I

02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:28.680
Need to not let that game slip through the cracks. I still have not bought little big planet, too

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:29.840
I really want to play it

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:31.560
It looks like they're doing a lot of amazing things

02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:35.680
But maybe one of the F use I should give is that I don't have like shit tons of money right now

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:41.360
So, you know buying a $60 game is hard to justify. I did buy a $30 game though. So

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.080
but

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:46.820
Yeah, I have to really be picky-choosey on what video games I buy so

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.520
Maybe I'll like rent it or something. I don't know

02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.880
Anyhow, one more story for you guys

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.480
Then we're gonna get to the Skype line one eight seven seven game

02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:00.840
Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio do make sure if you're gonna give us a call on Skype you do call

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:07.080
Echo one two three first to test your setup and remember the other rule of radio if you're gonna call a radio show

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:12.120
Mute your radio once you get through. All right, one more story for you guys though, and it has to do with dogs and kitties

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:18.280
Nintendogs plus cats is one launch tiles for the 3ds and the breeds have been revealed

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:24.920
Revealed and of course there are going to be several different versions of the game, duh

02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:31.960
One of them is toy poodle and friends which comes with a toy poodle a Pembroke Welsh corgi

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:38.560
Cornish Nouser boxer bull terrier Labrador retriever Shih Tzu Jack Russell and Pomeranian

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:45.900
Pomeranian, excuse me. I'm not a dog person. Excuse me French Bulldog and friends comes with French Bulldog Shetland sheepdog

02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:52.660
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Chihuahua Dalmatian Yorkshire Terrier German Shepherd Husky and Basset hound and

02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:58.420
Shiba Inu and friends which will be golden retriever and friends for those of us here in the US and Europe

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:06.580
Shiba Inu golden retriever beagle mini pincher dachshund Maltese Great Dane pugs and cocker spaniels

02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:10.340
Your Great Dane will die in two years. Mm-hmm. So there you go now

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:15.260
I don't really see what the cats are yet on if the cats are the same in every game or what the deal is

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:18.180
But I'd get which everyone has a mouth in it

02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:21.260
Because they were worshiped

02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:26.700
One of that sure me too more information is available on the Japanese site nintendo.co.jp

02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:34.180
More information is available there. I will probably get the one with a Welsh corgi in it, even though it's a frickin poodle

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:40.540
Well, I want one with a big big fat. Sure me in it. I don't want this game, but I

02:08:40.540 --> 02:08:47.040
I feel compelled to buy this game. I really don't want this game. I don't cuz I don't either and I feel compelled to buy it

02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.040
I do

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:54.040
Imagine chinchillas, it's gonna be one of those games that I play for like a day and then I get so sick of it

02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:59.720
I know me too. But maybe if we both get suckered into it, we can at least like trade cat toys

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:01.080
That'll be fun, right?

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:07.040
But it's gonna be it's just gonna be like any console release with me where I buy a bunch of games

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:11.780
I play them a little bit and I get bored with them except for like maybe one or two. That's really good

02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:17.540
I did it with the Xbox 360. I bought like almost all launch titles and it really shouldn't have because

02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:20.200
most of them I didn't give a shit about

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.360
But whatever, you know

02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.640
Gotta support the devs I guess I

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:31.260
Just want that sure me the game

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:36.840
That's my new dream game. Everybody is fat. Sure me. What would happen in fat? Sure me the game

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:41.980
You get to poker and have her make really weird faces at you and then you'd have to clean up her litter box

02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:45.900
And then you'd also have to figure out ways to keep her from shitting on the kitchen floor

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.940
And you'd be very careful not to talk about the tester

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:54.180
Very she's not in the room so we can talk about it all we want. All right, let's go to the phones calls already coming in

02:09:54.180 --> 02:09:59.180
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, this is excellent kicks link. How you doing, buddy? Hey doing good

02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:03.800
What's that be better be better if I know I wasn't getting gypped off or you don't know Jack for the PC

02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:08.380
And it's kind of funny because the creators are poking fun at PC people, but that's all right. How so

02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:11.420
Well, I guess apparently on one of the forums

02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:17.380
that's when the guy took a screenshot of the Twitter account for you don't know Jack and when the guys replied by

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:19.500
Because he was they're asking

02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:24.660
if they were if they were willing to pay more money if they can get more than it's two players local and he goes are

02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:29.500
More are more PC players who've had to fit in the more to more than two out of keyboard. Oh

02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:37.420
Like wow, I was like really serious that is kind of funny it's a little bit funny. Yeah

02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.580
I don't know if they

02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:44.500
legitimately did a purpose or they kind of did it kind of like a test run to see how many people buy it and maybe

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:49.660
Put it down the road as possibly a DLC or a patch or something or what they're gonna do

02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:57.180
but I hope they really seriously do just want it to because it doesn't feel like the full experience without like four players that I'm

02:10:57.180 --> 02:10:59.100
used to playing beforehand

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:02.180
But you know before the speaking of beforehand though

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:05.860
We didn't have back in the 90s all this Xbox Live stuff and all that fun stuff

02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:08.380
Like if you didn't have other people to play with in the same room

02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:09.820
It just yeah

02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:14.220
But at the same time too though if I have four people at the bed here at the house and I want to play with

02:11:14.220 --> 02:11:17.580
Four people like my next-door neighbors for example, then I can't do that

02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:20.700
I can only play with one person at a time like if I were to play something else

02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:23.900
It's not like me and my girlfriend versus my two neighbors

02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:29.520
It said it will be either me my girlfriend my girlfriend versus one my neighbors or you know or me versus my girl

02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:34.580
You know, I'm saying though. It's yeah, I get two people be left out. You are getting the shorter end of the stick

02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:36.860
Of course, it is ten dollars cheaper for what it's worth

02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:45.020
Yeah, but still I'd rather pay the if it was the extra ten four to two still I would I would definitely pay that because

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:47.300
It still feels a little left out

02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:48.220
But at the same time too

02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.840
I hope they do something about that because at the same time to a lot of people a lot of people are complaining about it

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.420
Right. I'm sure a lot more people were too and it was like one of people like me

02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.460
For example who bought on day one. It didn't know this

02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:02.840
I might have been a little hesitant and be like well screw this I'll wait to the steam has on sale then buy it

02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:05.540
But at the same time too, though

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:10.620
It's a great game and definitely worth 20 bucks and a steam achievements for the PC and it's definitely worth to buy

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:17.260
I'm also swords first swords and poker one and two are back on the iTunes

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:24.020
For to purchase if anybody wants to purchase them. I just recommend highly recommend them for to do so

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.660
It was like Loki said I have a shit ton of fun

02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:35.140
I guess I could say personally playing those two games and I always bounce back and forth between the first and second one and it's

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:38.600
A lot of fun. So if you're in a card game to definitely buy those is such an awesome

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.280
Seriously, now that's on the App Store. You need to buy it. It's like 99. Yes. It's oh they came back. They came back

02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:50.440
Yes, yeah sword poker two and sword poker one. Seriously, go buy it on the App Store. It will it'll take over your life

02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.880
It will I'll check it out. That's a pretty big endorsement. I'll have to look in that both of them are about

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:01.580
Five to six dollars. I think I know the second one's like three and I think the first one's two

02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:06.040
So yeah, you're looking like five it's still worth it for that dollars

02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:13.000
I've worked like worth of money probably like at least 50 hours into the first one are or the second game already

02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:16.240
Yeah, I'm like a few hours in the second one

02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.400
But I'm going through and still trying to finishing up the first one and the first one is just as bad as the second

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:22.840
So, but it's a lot of fun. It was very challenging

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.800
Well, let me take it back to you

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:28.660
Don't know Jack for a minute as somebody who played it like a long time ago these tech issues aside

02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:32.880
Were you really happy to see this come back? Is this a worthy upgrade? Yes, and yes

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.880
and it has all the pretty much old features like a few new things that it as well, but

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:43.920
Anybody's a trivia fan definitely buy it. It's worth it's worth the money. Do you think will be the support system?

02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.360
Do you think it will be the first of several revival games?

02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.160
I hope so and I hope so in a good way not in a bad way because they did they did pretty decent job

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:54.900
Like I said before I just really wish that there was four players

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.040
They could do something like that down the road or maybe add another one with it

02:13:58.040 --> 02:13:59.720
Then yes, they'll be awesome

02:13:59.720 --> 02:14:04.120
And then the fact that it has DLC and stuff that's gonna be attached to it that would make it even more so. Mm-hmm

02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.940
Because now instead of buying like you don't know jack sports now, it's like oh you can get to sports DLC for it

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:15.880
so definitely and also I bought NBA Jam for

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:20.920
The iTouch and iPad and it's wonderful. It's really

02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:25.120
Yeah, I think on the iOS though those games would kind of blow

02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:30.440
No, it's it's a little smaller, but it it for me. I like it

02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:37.360
Same way as NBA Jam, so it has a lot of unlockable stuff, so I'm playing it for quite a while

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.600
So all right well, buddy

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:41.200
We're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls

02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:44.880
But enjoy the you don't know jack even though you didn't get it on Xbox 360

02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:48.600
So I can't play with you, but I guess life goes on sorry hopefully meet one day PC

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:51.400
So you always have Wow to play definitely although?

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:58.080
I was playing it for a while, and then I went back to Wow are you interested in rift at all any interest in rift?

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:03.560
Maybe maybe maybe all right all right gotta let you go so we get more calls. Take care, buddy. It's all right. Bye

Oh, hi, you know it's ready. Who's this?

02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:28.600
Bring back all these memories of like old games. I used to play like Street Fighter

02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:31.720
Metal Diggers Mortal Kombat

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.640
King of Fighters

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:36.440
Final Fantasy

02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.440
Dark Stalkers

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:40.680
Double Dragon

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.680
net sure

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Ninja Gaiden

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
nobody

02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:51.240
Virtual Fighter

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:59.780
You should turn down your speakers dude now you know I want to see how long you can keep going what other what other old

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:10.900
classic games

02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:15.180
Like what's the point seriously? I don't even understand

02:16:16.260 --> 02:16:19.780
Well, thank you very much to the caller from area code six one two six seven zero

02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:23.900
Maybe I'll give the rest out later all right. Let's take some more calls

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:27.020
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.660
Hey, this is DR dollar bill. Hey, what's on your mind?

02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.580
Hey

02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:36.660
Hey, um just quick just quickly. I didn't get to do this quick um

02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:41.940
First off. I was trying to remember the if you didn't know Jack the original PC version

02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:44.820
I don't think there was four players even on the original version

02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:48.460
There wasn't I think it was three on the original version. Oh

02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:54.620
yeah, so I kind of says his like his thing about it should be in four players, but if

02:16:54.620 --> 02:17:01.220
You know if it was based on the same concept. I I'm trying to picture four people holding the keyboard together

02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:03.900
It just seems kind of crowded don't you think?

02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:08.940
At one keyboard yeah, that might be a little bit comfy

02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:13.180
Yeah, I mean the online multiplayer

02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:19.020
I agree with they should do that, but on a local machine that and no no just didn't seem right

02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:25.340
But you used to do three on one keyboard, and I seem to remember the buzzer keys were like Q

02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.460
Spacebar and like right bracket or something they were kind of like spread out

02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:34.780
So you could sit kind of in an interesting arrangement and do it for might be getting a little comfy

02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:38.540
But you could like give a person the mouse and they could like click it. I don't know

02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:41.180
That'd be a good one, okay

02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:46.260
All right that one and it was something else and I oh yeah

02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:49.620
Just really quick because I'd heard it begin to show you guys were talking about

02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:54.580
DDR and guitar hero how like they both seen them were falling one point of the

02:17:55.420 --> 02:18:00.380
Continuously kind of same game, but very little evolution between the two mm-hmm like you know our DDR

02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:06.280
Just slowly didn't really evolve much. Just maybe some different step shots and maybe a couple different modes eventually

02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:10.140
But it's still alive a lot longer than guitar hero

02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:15.500
Did we actually figure out what might like what was some ideas like why this was so?

02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:21.940
Run that by me one more time like like how's the DDR still survives um

02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:27.820
One theory that we had is that the games are simply lower budget because keep in mind Konami

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:30.660
They do license songs now, but they don't license quite as many

02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:31.540
It's like ten songs

02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:34.580
Maybe in a game and they use their in-house team for the rest of it

02:18:34.580 --> 02:18:37.360
And I think the expectations just aren't quite as high

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.860
And I think they still sell quite a few through the whole weight loss thing like it's not we fit

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:47.740
But certainly I was even listening to a morning show here locally where somebody brought up

02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:53.460
And they were they weren't saying it jokingly like it was some chick who got a we for Valentine's Day

02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:55.460
And she was saying to the host that she was going to

02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:00.280
Play lots of we fit and the host was going you're gonna. You're not gonna play any we fit

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:03.060
You're gonna play it for three days, and then you're gonna be over it

02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:06.300
And you know then you'll say oh, I'm gonna play dance dance revolution

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:10.460
You'll play that two times two so you know the name is still out. There is my point

02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:15.740
Is that you know it's still getting name-checked in some places, but I just think overall those games are lower budget

02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:19.980
And so they have lower expectations, and I think that's why those games to and unfortunately it shows

02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.500
And it's also still very Japan centric

02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:29.940
I think you know Konami closed their offices here in the US are they might have the one in LA

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:35.060
I think they have the one in LA, but they don't have the one Hawaii. They don't have one in North Bay that I'm sorry

02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:39.260
Nor Cal in the bay. They don't have those anymore so most of that

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:43.720
I imagine is coming out of Japan and those games are probably still selling in Japan whereas guitar hero

02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:47.060
What did they have one in Japan and that was it I?

02:19:47.980 --> 02:19:51.540
Didn't think I released in Japan. I didn't think it would yeah

02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:58.120
What guitar hero? I think there was like one. I think one of them did get a localized Japanese release

02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:04.980
But I don't think it was huge. I could be wrong don't like quote me on that or call me an idiot if I'm wrong

02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:08.020
But I want to say one time. I do remember reading about it, so

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.620
Okay, that's cool

02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:14.980
All right wait anybody what's that anything else on your mind, buddy?

02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:22.180
That's all right, I mean, I just didn't have much to say except hi guys hey, what's up? All right?

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:26.940
Well at least you aren't high as hell like the last caller, so all right. I know

02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:30.100
All right, take care buddy. You too. Bye guys. Bye

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:34.980
I'm gonna get stoned and call into this f-list radio show on the internet

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:40.900
1877 game olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.860
We'll take some more calls here in the meantime while we wait for some calls to come in Loki

02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:48.460
Do you have any last-minute thoughts or last-minute thoughts last-minute stories for our listeners tonight?

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:52.220
Yeah, I was gonna see here

02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:58.780
They're talking a little bit more about the Xperia play apparently it's gonna have battery life enough for five plus hours

02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:00.900
Of gameplay, which is kind of cool

02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:08.820
It's got a 5.1 megapixel camera 400 megabytes of onboard a memory as well as you can expand it via SD

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:11.140
memory cards

02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:13.140
Thank you to orange right in our chatroom

02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:19.900
Very knowledgeable, dude when it comes to the music games guitar hero 3 and Aerosmith were released in Japan same as the other releases

02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:21.900
No localization. Thank you for the clarification

02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:24.980
Let's take some more calls

02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:31.220
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hey, it's Ranma and this time Rob. I'm not going to attack you tonight. Thank you

02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:35.100
I appreciate it. You're welcome. All right, so what's up?

02:21:35.660 --> 02:21:41.220
Not too much. Um, I have some interesting topics. I want to discuss. I'll make them brief as possible

02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:46.140
Yeah, but first I would like to give my prediction for episode 500

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:49.720
Okay, what is that

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:56.360
Number one u.s. Lashes pop get married live on the air. I

02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:59.440
Don't know about that. But okay

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:08.120
Predictions predictions. Yeah, and right after we find out Doc Sakura is pregnant and she gives birth live on the air

02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:10.120
No, not happening

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:16.060
And after all is said and done Loki is still oblivious the entire world is he still plays grant depth auto for

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:21.240
Well in two years, they're gonna have grant that thought of five. So I mean, come on

02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:24.740
And we're gonna be playing seems for a three later on this year

02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:29.820
So I'm very excited about that at least a quick break on grand theft auto, but hey, you got to be honest

02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:32.060
so the grand theft auto games we play are

02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:36.660
Not quite the grand theft auto games that other people play. It's

02:22:37.540 --> 02:22:41.560
It's a little different type of an animal that we're playing lots of high

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:47.240
Explosives and people flying through the air and at bus food. There is bus food in this game

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:50.820
It's it's a sight that behold seriously

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:55.960
We'll be making new videos once it's all done too. I can't wait to see those

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:02.980
All right any other lovely predictions we got a ways to go

02:23:02.980 --> 02:23:09.720
Oh, that's all for the predictions. But um, as I've been listening for the last couple of podcasts. I've been trying to catch up. Um

02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:14.700
My quick take on the on the on Sony's neogeo pocket

02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:17.520
Uh-huh

02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:22.680
It says it's going to be 3g and all this enabled. I can see it now

02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:26.000
They're going to market the car the portable console at about

02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:29.080
$400 and

02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:32.160
What they're going to do they're probably gonna partner trip with either

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:40.040
AT&T or t-mobile where you go in and you get the console for $99.99 with a two-year

02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:42.040
I'm contract with it

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:48.640
Yeah, lock them in with a contract that's that's the way to do it that's what they're trying to do with the phone

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:53.300
Yeah, I mean hey it kind of work for the taco. Why not for the NGP?

02:23:54.760 --> 02:24:01.860
Who knows seriously if anyone is serious about you know gaming with 3g on the NGP

02:24:01.860 --> 02:24:09.360
Or even anything like the iPod or I you know iPad whatever don't fucking you know sign up for this shit

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:16.040
Just I mean, I think you just get the cheapest data plan possible. Like I said not to sound like a

02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:23.240
You know pitchman for Virgin Mobile, but seriously $25 a month for you know a phone that I can

02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:28.840
Hack and tether to my iPod if I really need to surf, you know

02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:35.280
I prefer surfing the web on the iPod over my Android phone because it's kind of slow but you know in the pinch

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.040
It works, but seriously though if I wanted like, you know game my laptop

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:44.600
And I got through a week of just you know, using it for surfing the web, but I have my fight

02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:46.960
I don't use it anymore because it's $45 a month

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:51.380
For just data, whereas I can just tether to my phone and I get the same shit

02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:55.060
of course, they don't want you to do that and that's done through like a hack but

02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:59.980
Hey, whatever. It was a relatively easy hack so it can be done by pretty much anybody. Oh

02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:03.700
I know I got my phone is the same way. I could do it with mine

02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:06.500
But now that you know Virgin Mobile or everybody else they're capping

02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:14.020
The how much bandwidth you can spend when doing all this and guarantee if I was gonna be on these 3g networks gaming

02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:20.940
It'll be a funny thing that as their game and they hit their cap and you see a look their network logo saying

02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:28.100
Sorry, you have used up all your bandwidth push this button to add more time there. There's no way you'll run through unless you're gaming

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:32.620
24-7 over 3g and a lot of people have Wi-Fi in their houses

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:38.500
There is not gonna be a time that you're into a cap problem. It's just not fast enough. I mean I

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.540
Just it's gonna be rare to do that

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:44.900
That's why they have those caps in place because those people are using on way more day

02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:49.500
I mean I've tried streaming stuff on my phone and it shows me the kind of data

02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:55.620
It's using but there's your unless you're dedicating, you know, you don't have Wi-Fi in your house

02:25:55.620 --> 02:26:02.060
You're just on this 3g and that's it then maybe I mean it would take some really heavy use

02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:06.860
But for most people where they're near Wi-Fi like I have Wi-Fi my work. I have Wi-Fi at home

02:26:06.860 --> 02:26:08.660
I've you know, there's Wi-Fi here

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:09.180
I mean

02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:16.220
I just have I can bounce on all those with my phone with my iPod and there's very rare times that are in between

02:26:16.220 --> 02:26:18.220
That I actually need to use the 3g

02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:23.900
For anything or you know, you know, my cable goes out or something like that, but fair enough. It's very rare

02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:27.060
so it I don't think that's really gonna be an issue but

02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:30.100
You know, who knows?

02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:32.100
Yeah, pretty much

02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:36.660
All right. Well, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls. All right, cool. That's cool. All right. Take care, buddy

02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:38.660
All right. You got it. Bye. Bye

02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:43.740
All right. We got more calls coming in. Why not? Let's get to it. Hi on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:46.740
Yeah, hi

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:48.920
Hi, am I on? Yes

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.460
Okay

02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:58.660
Yeah, I got a little bit confession to make actually a really bad crack problem and uh, I

02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:04.880
Don't know. I feel that I don't know playing video games sometimes else, but I don't know

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:08.380
Uh-huh. I just don't know

02:27:09.300 --> 02:27:12.140
Well, what cost you to start smoking crack in the first place?

02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:19.100
It was probably the Nintendo coming out with Mario Sports Mix, uh-huh

02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:23.340
Well that that's more of a recent thing. I mean sports mix hasn't really come out yet

02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:26.380
So, I mean have you have you been it's been out for a week Oh one way

02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:28.380
So you've been addicted to crack for a week

02:27:32.180 --> 02:27:35.800
So, let me let me let me ask you a question because I can hear you laughing and everything

02:27:36.220 --> 02:27:40.160
Like so I I know you're like trolling us or whatever. So like what's up?

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:43.500
Like why are you trolling like f-list online radio shows just curious. I

02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:49.300
Mean you don't have an answer

02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:55.940
Not really no, I mean well, I mean I'm just kind of curious

02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:58.660
Why you and your buddies want to like troll this online radio show?

02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.940
I mean like we don't think we're like all that or nothing. We do our show for free

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:07.920
We've kind of worked our asses off for the past nine years to provide the show for free to people on the internet

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:10.540
So I'm just wondering what made it worthy of trolling

02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:13.460
I mean was this something we said or you guys just like really fucking bored or what?

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.920
I think a small penis is involved on the hold on. Let's let's let's let's let the man have a say

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:21.500
We don't need to troll him back. What's what's up? Just people just be real with me, dude

02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:30.460
Well, actually actually we're pretty big fans actually that's uh-huh. So we've been looking at a long time and we just thought you know

02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:34.980

For us working our ass off for free for so many years

02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:53.300
I mean, I don't I mean if maybe like I said something to make the interwebs angry then like cool

02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:57.940
Let us know like what did we say to bring the the wrath of whatever?

02:28:57.940 --> 02:29:10.140
For Chani site you guys are with like what's the deal? Well, yeah

02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:22.180
Just be real dude don't you don't have to like ask your friends for an answer or whatever?

02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:26.160
Like I applaud you for not hanging up the phone like a chicken shit when I called you out

02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:29.500
But like just be real with me. What's up? What is this all about?

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:34.260
Are you don't you have someone you want to promote or plug? Is there a website behind this whole thing?

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:43.420
No to be perfectly honest, this is boredom this boredom dude

02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:48.780
For the record. This is the only time like we've actually done this. I've never

Done anything to you guys like ever before this. This is only been it. This is it

02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:56.180
I usually when I'm bored, I play a game

I know like we're a show about freaking video games like crisis 2 is out on the interwebs for free

02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:08.060

Just I just I don't know. I don't get it dude. Like I just kind of feel like you're wasting your time

I know I'm just saying you got a funny way of showing a pal but I I I

02:30:46.740 --> 02:30:53.780
You know what? I realize it's the internet and that's the type of stuff. We subject ourselves to doing a public show, but I'm just saying

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.300
I've heard a lot worse in my lifetime

02:30:57.620 --> 02:31:01.620
Seriously, like growing up as a gay guy for as many years as I've done and so forth

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:08.220
I suppose you have to do a lot worse in my lifetime. So but anyhow, you have a lovely day

02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:11.300
Thanks for trolling. Yeah, you do. All right. Bye

02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:15.940
At least he's not posting on the internet that I need to get back in the kitchen. I

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.100
I'm not the one that cooks. I still want to know like

02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:26.580
Who is it? Like just tell me Baba bowie. You got his number. What's the deal?

02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:31.320
I do but you know what if I give it but now I'm not saying give it out. I'm saying track it

02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:36.140
There's New York. What I don't I and it's it's one of those like I don't I

Just want to know like was it something is it because you're a bitch dark soccer. You're a bitch

02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:45.880
So they got to troll the show cuz you're a bitch. You know what fuck them

02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:50.780
That's what I have to say. I can be as much of the bitches. I don't even care

02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:54.980
It's giving you more attention than it deserves. I hey we get answers

02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:57.260
That's all

02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:03.900
Alright. Hey who wants to follow that call one eight seven seven game. Oh, lr. Our username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:10.340
You know what the folks in chat seems to enjoy that last call. I don't know. All right. Oh

02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:16.420
Let's talk a little bit more about Activision

02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:21.700
Yes, please. They're focusing there's you know efforts towards now since they're not doing the guitar hero franchise

02:32:21.700 --> 02:32:27.500
They are continuing on with their toy licensing franchise. You know how they did the games of the Zuzu pets is up now

02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:30.240
It's squinkies. Yes squinkies based off of

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:36.320
Some sort of toy that's like those 25 cent machines where you know, there's a little crappy toy comes in the bubble

02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:42.640
Well, they're making a game based off that also they're making a game called Skylanders Spyro's adventure, which has I

02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:50.360
Don't know what the fuck they did the Spyro. It's weird, but they have these toys now that you can buy that will

02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:54.360
Will come with you know

02:32:54.360 --> 02:33:01.240
a couple toys and you basically put these toys on this mat and it scans it in and you get to play as the character that's

02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:04.640
on the toy and the game's gonna cost you $70 and

02:33:06.640 --> 02:33:13.400
What the fuck did they do to Spyro Cersei he looks like he's got he's like roid rage Spyro or something like that. I

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:18.280
Don't know what they did. But yes, there's Activision pooping on your franchises

02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:23.840
But you know kids games, you know, cuz if it's highly marketable, then they're gonna pimp it out

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:26.360
All right. Let's go to some more calls

02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.800
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Legend of Zaku. Hey, my buddy. How are you tonight?

02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:33.600
No, I'm doing pretty good

02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:40.120
just trying to try to wait for the next you know day or so when I had to take the girl out for Valentine's Day and

02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:48.720
Just lamenting over the death of the inevitable guitar hero. We kind of knew that was coming. Are

02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:54.000
You sad are you one of those people that was on Twitter going RIP guitar hero pouring the 40 in your honor?

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.400
There's no not not at all as a matter of fact

02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:02.320
I knew this was gonna happen the first, you know ever since good to our hero 3 came out

02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:04.760
Actually, no more like world tour

02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:10.160
That's when they started to have the whole me to attitude of let's just spend let's just milk

02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:15.040
the you know, the proverbial golden cap dry until we could pummel harmonics, which

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:20.600
In turn never worked out. So this is the thing with Activision and in a nutshell

02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:26.920
They take good franchises and they just run them and just send them straight to hell like what they're gonna do a Call of Duty

02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:33.320
Mm-hmm. I mean when you have five guitar hero games out in a single year, that's almost like one

02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:35.240
That's like one per quarter

02:34:35.240 --> 02:34:40.600
That's that that goes to show that you're just like you just you just don't give a shit about the franchise

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.920
I mean Konami on the other hand

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:49.280
they at least make efforts to innovate and just like, you know, please the the hardcore fanfare and fan base while picking up the

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:54.160
Casuals along the way. Mm-hmm. At least they're they're having some sort of consistency

02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:55.040
I don't know about now

02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:01.240
But when you know during their time with the whole DDR series even with in Bimani in general

02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:08.160
They just kept it a little bit more, you know more consistent and not as bland. Mm-hmm. So, I mean it's

02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:14.720
The way I see it is that harmonics now is tasked with just like try not to you know

02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:21.960
Make the same mistakes as Activision. Obviously, they they're well aware of that but more importantly they have to innovate

02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.880
Because that's what what that's what made them

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.240
That's what made them survive that day and that's what will keep them going

02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:31.240
You know keeping them going forward

02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:40.240
What do you think is the reason why I mean I know you you have been calling into this show for years

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:44.040
Which I totally appreciate don't get me wrong. Mm-hmm, especially in light of last couple calls. We've had

02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:49.240
You you I've called in about like DDR and all this stuff. What do you think about this whole?

02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:56.280
Why is DDR seem to persevere when I'm not so sure DDR really innovates in the way that some other games do

02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:01.560
I mean you still add you still have the I guess what I guess the way I see it

02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:04.360
Is that Konami still recognizes that the hardcores?

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:10.860
The hardcore players are still the ones that they're gonna be picking up DDR a lot more than let's say the casuals

02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:12.860
Why it's by a slight edge

02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:16.740
So you have to please you know, they're trying to please both demographics

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:23.120
So they they have a multi-pronged approach to to you know to their series. Mm-hmm

02:36:23.120 --> 02:36:28.280
whereas Activision just like treats it like shovelware, you know, just try to

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:33.960
Just try to get all the licenses not really innovate in terms of like new gameplay features

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:40.240
Like what I heard was like the most appalling innovation that they had was just the ability to change the guitar skin

02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:46.840
Unlike let's say harmonics which actually allowed you in the third, you know, the third installment, you know

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:50.640
play with with a lot more instruments, you know with like a keyboard and

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.560
And the ability and the ability to to do, you know to play them in pro mode

02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:02.280
Which you know says a lot about them that they're really thinking they're really thinking long-term with that whole franchise

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:07.200
Whereas Activision just cares about how much money can we make with guitar hero in each quarter?

02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:10.480
It's all about the bottom line

02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:16.440
Bills bills on the other hand the way I see it is that Activision is going to you know

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:22.760
it's gonna the faint the same fate will bestow Call of Duty in the next two years and that worries me because

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:29.560
Remember what happened, you know, almost 30 years ago in that in our same industry when?

02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.320
Atari basically

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:38.960
Harold heralded that whole video game, you know the whole genre into into near disaster

02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:44.240
Or the video game crash. I'm pretty sure you know, I have a gut feeling that

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:49.600
Activision will be the ones that's gonna herald everything to mediocrity like in two years

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:53.160
I bet you in two years. They're gonna have like a they're gonna reach a point where

02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:57.580
people are just gonna get sick and tired of video games in general or just

02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:03.020
or just like most of the genres because you're gonna have one particular company that's just gonna like

02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:08.440
They're gonna make everything they're gonna make that genre completely bland and untouchable for years to come

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:16.760
All right, well we're gonna let you go buddy so we can go wrap up the show but thank you as always for your insight

02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:22.060
Cuz I know you're passionate about the music games. So appreciate. All right. All right. Take care buddy. Have a good one. Bye

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:27.600
All right, that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight. Can't say it wasn't entertaining. There you go

02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:31.600
Let's get to the last last-minute stories from Loki

02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:35.120
Don't think I have much left here

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.280
It hasn't been very exciting news week all things considered outside of like, you know

02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:43.840
The more and more and more stuff getting shut down over at Activision. There's not a lot else to it

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.360
Yeah, I think I pretty much covered most of everything

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.760
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much it I think no alrighty then

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:58.920
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts as we get down to the end of the show tonight

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:02.480
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. What's your final thought?

02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.860
You know that face that's really scrunchie that people do for trolls on the internet

02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:08.340
Yeah

02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:15.540
I kept imagining that call just that mouth moving back and forth while that guy was talking and it made me giggle a little bit

02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:16.220
That was pretty funny

02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:21.260
I actually saw a really funny gif of that with the whole you mad you mad you mad like rotating around it and this is funny

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:22.780
so

02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:25.580
The internet it's fun to be a part of all right, Loki

02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:29.220
What's your final thought people need to stop talking like they type on the internet? I mean

02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:31.220
it

02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:37.940
Seriously the YK are is the worst friend whatsoever. I mean, it's just

02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:43.220
Remember how people used to get pissed off at other people and you know with the bonics and shit like that

02:39:43.220 --> 02:39:50.300
It's just getting worse the OMG. It's like okay. Yeah, we understand you mistyped on a keyboard. Haha. That's funny

02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:53.140
You know you don't need to talk like that cuz you sound like an idiot

02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:56.780
I will say one thing we found OMG yogurt, and they were pretty good

02:39:56.780 --> 02:40:04.460
What is up with all these yogurt explosion chains recently? It's crazy. Oh, and I hate Kotaku's new layout

02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:07.060
I should say gawkers new layout, so you know

02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:12.260
Sometimes you don't need to improve something because it's fine the way it was

02:40:13.260 --> 02:40:16.240
See now go troll that that's a reason to go troll well

02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:22.660
Like trolling our websites like I know it's kind of like that's like stalking Kathy Griffith or something

02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:27.500
It's just like seriously who cares I mean no one cares

02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:33.020
And honestly we don't get a lot of page hits so no one's really gonna notice that you're trolling

02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:39.180
It's what it whatever whatever we talk about it the more. They're gonna like yeah, we should do it again all right um

02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:44.140
My final thought I I I want to do more traveling

02:40:44.140 --> 02:40:48.060
And I'm thinking a trip to Seattle would need to be in the near future

02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.260
possibly around Labor Day

02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:52.820
possibly

02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:57.260
Why you still you're telling me a different time thinking of other traveling in March?

02:40:57.740 --> 02:41:02.140
I'm thinking about a particular expo that goes on yes every year all right anyhow

02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:05.460
We'll have to talk about that offline all right anyhow. That's it

02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:10.740

To be that show where every gamer has a voice independent and don't get paid for it, so we're not paid to say anything

02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:46.620
