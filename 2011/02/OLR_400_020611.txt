Tonight, February 6, 2011, Nintendo disagrees with low app pricing, Halo gets remade this holiday, and has Zelda Skyward Sword been further delayed?
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
With me, as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Greetings and salutations.
How are you, Ms.
Summers?
My voice is coming and going.
Yeah.
I will at points sound like a 12-year-old boy.
Mm-hmm.
But I'm doing good.
I'm happy, excited.
A lot of people I know have been getting sick lately.
It's not just you.
Something's going around.
Something's going around.
But it has stolen my voice.
By the way, I noticed you're wearing like a nerdy Star Trek shirt, but it's a red shirt.
That's a bad sign.
But it's engineering.
Okay.
The engineers are smart enough to stay inside.
It's the security guys that keep getting blown up.
Yes.
Plus, I don't know what it is about that shirt, but it is showing off your very adequate bazoom.
Yes.
Thank you.
So congratulations.
Thank you.
All right.
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hi.
How are you, Loki?
I'm fine.
He's a man of many words.
Anything interesting going on for you this week?
No.
No?
All right, it's going to be one of those shows.
We have some guests in studio, so let me introduce them.
Of course, we always have the ever-present fourth guest with us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so you can join us in our chat room.
There are people live.
I do know there's some type of ball game going on right now that people seem to care about, so I know things are a little...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Lots of WoW games, I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Oh, you're no fun.
The volume's turned down.
Well, you can, I think it's implied.
But yeah, and then they fall down with their love for you because you shot them with your love gun.
Oh, great.
Loki's turned it up.
I don't know if it gets picked up on the mic or whatever, but.
Oh, does it come through on our little soundboard now?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, so what's new with you?
Uh, not too much.
Yeah?
Now I'm into crazy work time, so I don't have much time to play games these days.
Crazy work time?
What do you do for a living without, you know, you don't have to tell us where you work, but what kind of work?
Well, I work at two places, and the first place I work five hours a day, every day, all year.
The other place, I work eight hours a day, like six to eight, like nine months of the year.
Wow.
All right.
Busy, busy.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Well, we're going to get around to How Is Your Gaming Week, but I should acknowledge that tonight is a little bit special because it is episode 400 of Orange Lounge Radio.
400 freaking shows.
This show started on June 23, 2002, and here we are over 400 weeks because we're lazy.
We take a lot of weeks off.
Over 400 weeks later, but 400 shows later, here we are at our show.
It's exhausting.
So what are we doing special tonight?
The same shit we've done for a long time.
No, we had something special.
That's true.
We do have one new special thing, but the live listeners don't get to see it.
This is something special for the podcasties.
Meatballs?
Oh.
Well, the listeners don't get meatballs.
No, but we're special.
We get meatballs.
I think originally this was going to be a drunk show, but Loki's got the kid, Rob drives, Jamie's not going to pay to get us all blitzed, and if we took a shot every time Nintendo made a bad business decision, we would just die.
We would be dead.
Exactly.
Remember, a lot has happened in nine years of the show.
I have my gallbladder out for one, so I have no alcohol tolerance anymore.
Remember when I almost died, y'all?
That was hilarious.
You were so skinny, though.
You look so good.
I know.
God, I want to get peccary eyes again.
So which character should we attempt to rape first?
Oh, the one with the bunny ears.
The bunny ears.
Got it.
All right.
What's your name?
I have no idea.
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean that I do now?
Xtasy shot because you shot her in the crotch.
Wow.
I love radio about video games.
but uh we used to kind of start off with how was your week how was your day we didn't just talk about all video games now we do so next thing i'm going to say is i'm going to say the cage match pick goes into rotation all week long here at orange launch radio.com it goes into rotation in our hearts exactly all right uh dark soccer how is your gaming week i hit level 85 like yesterday addict dealer
Congratulations, though.
Thank you.
Now I'm kind of bored, and I'm working on building reps, so I built my Darnassus rep, like, in one night.
And now I have a kitty cat.
Cat.
I'm a kitty cat.
And a meow, meow, meow, and a meow, meow, meow.
And...
Dan got his driving wheel set up for Gran Turismo 5.
He got this sort of stand so that he can put it away when he's done playing.
And he got the seats out of the Honda Prelude, which he is building his driving seat out of.
and that's what Dan's gaming week has been.
Wait, so he actually took seats out of a real car?
It's in the living room.
To build a Gran Theft, I almost said Gran Theft, Gran Turismo 5?
I'll take a picture of it.
Wow, yeah, you should and put it on the little feed.
Yeah, I'll do that right now.
All right, you should.
Wow, that's dedication.
Why is he doing this?
That's insanity.
Just because he can?
Yes.
You let him.
He's your husband.
I don't let him do shit.
He just does it.
Then again, the same goes vice versa.
Does he let you sit in the seat or is he like, no, this is the captain's chair?
I don't care to sit in the seat.
It's a seat on a milk crate right now.
It's ghetto.
And I'm taking a picture and showing you all how weird my husband is.
Alright, you can see those pictures at www.orangeloungeradio.com Alright, Loki, you gotta pause that game and tell us about your gaming week.
How was your gaming week?
My game is weird.
This week I didn't play a whole lot.
I played just Grand Theft Auto, of course.
And...
A little bit of some iOS games I played.
League of Evil, which I didn't really care for that one.
They're comparing it kind of to Super Meat Boy, and I'm sorry, it's not Super Meat Boy.
It's not even close.
It's just kind of almost reminds me of Mega Man, but really hard and basic.
But it's an iPhone game, so what do you expect?
So it's the basic bitch of video games.
It's just kind of lame.
And then there was this other pirate game that was kind of cool with anime people that I played that was kind of fun.
And what else did I try?
Oh, I played more Swords & Poker 2 because that game is just awesome.
I really wish it was still in the App Store.
Puzzle Quest, Poker
and it's really unique fun game if you have a you know gel broken iPod or iPhone or something like that I recommend downloading them even though it is piracy but they're not in the store so I mean I'd say go buy them if you could but you can't so pirate them
Superbowl is so gay
A little bit, a little bit.
Also, Spazinator says, if Loki ever goes a week without playing Grand Theft Auto 4, the universe will implode.
Did you play Grand Theft Auto 4 this week?
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah, I was about to say, have you heard those rumors that the next Grand Theft Auto is set to debut at the big expo in LA in June?
It's not going to be for at least another year.
There's not Grand Theft Auto coming out this year.
You think they might do just a little tease?
What does Rockstar have going on right now?
Well, they've got a bunch of stuff coming out.
They've got L.A.
Noire, which is coming out in spring.
Spring, summer, second quarter, if you will.
Then they've got Max Payne 3 coming out at some point, probably going to be in the fall.
They had something else too that was from Take-Two that was supposed to be coming out.
Um...
I think Max Payne 2 is probably... I think they're going to be putting out L.A.
Noire because that's going to be kind of like their Red Dead Redemption for the year.
And then Max Payne will probably come out in the fourth quarter.
Grand Theft Auto, I would see maybe a...
Ideally, probably next April would be when I could see that.
But I don't know if that's actually going to happen.
They have the engine already.
They'll just build it off of the Red Dead Redemption since it's just an update to the Rage engine anyways.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And it's really fast-paced, and I still kick the crap out of everybody.
And it's really buggy.
It's funny, actually, in Saints Row 2, little-known fact, you can throw the sticky bombs on people and detonate them.
Like, say if I throw three of them on somebody and detonate one and kill them, when they respawn, they still have two stuck to them, and you can detonate it again and they die.
It's great.
It's such a glitchy game, but it's awesome.
Awesome.
Any interest in Chinatown Wars Part 2?
I hate Chinatown Wars.
I just had a feeling.
The old top-down games were great, but I'm sorry.
Chinatown Wars, the reason it existed was because that's all the DS could handle.
I mean...
The PSP games are a perfect example of what they could have done.
It was great.
The PSP games were... I mean, they controlled kind of eh because there was only one analog stick, but it was still funny.
We played that up until Grand Theft Auto... Well, actually, up until Saints Row 2 or Saints Row 1.
We played the PSP versions of Grand Theft Auto to death.
Those things were really fucking glitchy.
Um...
But yeah, I mean, seriously, if there's a new PSP... God, if there's an NGP version of Grand Theft Auto, I'm going to have to pick that out.
We may have to all get NGPs to bust that out, but... I'll be buying every game day one, as long as it's not some crap like Chinatown Wars.
All right, let's check in with our guests and see what they've been playing this week.
Salacious Pop, how was your gaming week?
Pretty good.
Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, Knights of the Crystal, which doesn't really count as a game, and World of Warcraft.
Lots of World of Warcraft.
What's going on in World of Warcraft for you?
I don't want to get too far into the discussion, but...
Yeah, I was in a, I guess a more social casual centric guild and I decided to try and explore a group of people that were more focused on the really hardcore raiding stuff to see if I can, you know, handle that.
And they took me on a raid as a trial.
So I got to see some of the new raid content, did a 25 man, they carried me, I'm pretty much a scrub right now.
But
It was neat to see.
So you turned your back on your friends to go see more pretty internet dragons.
I'm a traitorous maverick.
I'm just giving you shit, obviously, because it's the same guild I'm in.
But I know there's a lot of people that are excited for you, and you can come back and tell us stories.
You can come on Horde House and talk all about it.
Yeah, it's more a Horde House conversation.
All right.
But, you know, it's still, obviously, WoW's a huge game, so got to talk about what's going on there.
So how's Championship Edition going for you?
I mean, breaking records?
I still only play, like, the one mode.
I've unlocked all the other modes.
and I'm like I just want the five minute that's me too I'm the exact same way I go through and I unlock everything and then it's like okay I just want to play this one map over and over because it's it's the one that drives the leaderboards it's on the main Xbox 360 I don't know if this is weird or not but you know how like in the Xbox 360 dashboard you get to see leaderboards but they're only for a certain mode in the game it's usually like the default leaderboard is what you see in that's the one I will try the hardest on and in this case it's usually like stage one or the default board and settings for Pac-Man Championship Edition
And even with the default game style, you can still, you know, on the options before you start up the match, there are eight or nine different visually art, like, you can have the neon or like all green or the 3D model, whatever.
I just leave it on the default.
So visually all the stuff they put into the game, I haven't looked at yet.
All right.
Because there's no reason to.
So you just want to hear the pretty music.
Yeah.
Alright, well let's move on to Arcadia N42 How was your gaming week?
The only thing I really had to play this week was Rock Band 3 Because I got the symbols pack so I could play pro mode So I was doing that And also I got a mic stand so I could sing when I want to sing But I don't do that that often I was going to say, you're kind of a quiet guy And now here I am hearing about that you have to get the symbols and the microphones That you can rock out and sing all in the privacy of your own home
I don't really sing that much just because my voice is kind of screwy and also because there's people on the other side of the wall so I don't want to bother them because my voice is probably sort of deep so it probably goes through the walls so I don't want to bug them.
Nice.
So what was the first song you had to play when you got the cymbals?
Because there's always that one song people got to play in rock band.
I don't know.
I think it's one of the easier songs just so I could get used to the cymbals.
Just go through the training a little bit.
The training is not that much different from the standard trainer for drums.
It just has pretty much the same training but with the cymbals added.
Happy Birthday to Giovedea!
That's right, I saw her angst on Twitter about the whole, some game where people wear these uniforms and they all have numbers on them.
Well, to quote a conversation that was going on on one of the lesbians' Facebook.
Ah, I miss the OLR lesbians.
How are they these days?
seem to do well.
For those that lost track, the OLR lesbians, they were on the show, what, about probably about four years ago at this point.
They moved together to Wisconsin.
One of them already lived in Wisconsin.
I see.
That's right, because they were flying back and forth a little bit.
So they now they now habitate in Wisconsin with their Birkenstocks.
Apparently at this game, they use a racket to hit an orange ball into the net and then they smoke the Rose Bowl.
All right.
Can I talk about my gaming week?
I was sleeping on a Friday That's alright
All right.
Let's move on.
My gaming week.
I made an effort to play some indie games this week.
So I played a few indie games on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
I basically handed the controller to Alan and I was like, pick games that look fun.
So he picked a few games for me.
And probably my favorite out of the bunch that I played was Radiant Games Ballistic.
It's an indie game on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
Thank you for watching!
So, you know, for people that are thinking, you know, their life is lacking geometry wars, especially with the sad news about, you know, bizarre creations shutting their doors, it's a nice little, you know, way to hold you over.
And it's not that expensive.
And the demo is very generous.
So there's no reason you can't check out the demo, which is out there.
So I liked Ballistic.
That was cool.
Some of the games I didn't like so much.
I'm going to butcher the name of this game, but it was something like Maid Chan's Cave Adventure.
Was that the name of it, Salacious Pop?
Do you remember what the name of the game was?
Something like Maid... It was Maid San.
Maid Sans.
And then, like, crazy cave adventure, wild cave adventure, but yeah.
Yeah, it was dumb.
I mean, it was funny for a minute, but it's a really weird mechanic.
Like, it's kind of like... Okay, I guess it's like side-scrollery, puzzle-y.
Yes, you play a maid who explores caves.
That really is what you do.
Yeah.
And, you know, you think, oh, this is really funny.
But you go to collect stars and things, but you have to...
The main mechanic of the game is that you duck to avoid the little zombie dudes that have baseball bats.
Which, by the way, the first time the maid got hit with a baseball bat, I laughed out loud.
It's worth downloading the demo just to see that.
Not that I advocate violence against maids, but it was kind of funny the first time.
Yeah, because the ogre sees you and says something in Japanese and marches towards you.
And then here comes the club thud.
And just the way they do it is...
Now you can hide by crouching, but the longer you crouch, your field of vision gets narrower and narrower and narrower.
So you have to kind of crouch while you wait for the guys to pass you, which is a really weird mechanic.
So yeah, it was okay, but I don't think I would have paid money for it.
But the demo was fun.
Pro tip, if you're going to check out the demo for this game, go into the options, change it to English.
Unless you read and understand Japanese thoroughly, then good on you.
But the first time I played through, I was like, oh, this game's only in Japanese.
Great.
Because I don't understand it at all.
So I'm just like, I see a Y, like the Y button, so I'll hit that and see what it does.
Oh, the game just told me that Y does a high jump.
So, yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Beach, Bubble, Boob, Bobble.
I don't know.
Beachy, booby, anime chick games, which of course Alan downloaded because he saw the anime chicks in bikinis and he was like, oh, it kind of looks like Bubble Bobble.
No, here's the game.
You fly around and you collect colored balls.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's all I'm going to.
You can infer the rest.
And if you go to the... Why do you need to go to the NationalGeographic.com?
It's a joke.
Because that's where we all saw titties.
Well, I don't know.
That's where I saw titties for the first time was in the National Geographic magazine.
I don't know about you guys, but... Were you not breastfed?
And you're gay now, so that's a cautionary tale rather than advice.
What are you trying to say?
There's nothing wrong with it.
I am who I am.
I am proud of who I am.
Even though we've butchered the name of the game, if you go to the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace and look up new, even without even knowing the name of the game, just scan through the tiles and you will immediately know what game we're talking about just by the image.
Boobie Beach Bubble Bobble Boobies.
For the record, I love boobs.
You don't have to be straight or whatever.
Boobs are awesome.
We can all agree on that.
Right, Jamie?
I'm very fond of mine.
There you go.
Everybody can agree.
And others.
One, two, three, four, five.
Five OLR people agree.
Boobies are great.
Right, Alan?
Boobies are great?
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
And I did see the Make a Baby game on there, but I didn't download it for you.
I already had the Make a Baby game.
Okay.
They have a sequel, by the way.
Do they?
Yes, they do.
What's the sequel?
Yeah, that's the one I saw.
I haven't heard of the sequel.
Evil Babies Rosemary's Baby Super Meat Boy I didn't realize not all of the levels are Super Meat Boy Some of them are some of the other characters You have to play the other characters Good times
So, yeah.
I have that on PC, Super Meat Boy, but I haven't unlocked the headcrab yet.
And I'm a huge Half-Life fan, so the fact that I could play as a headcrab, I need to get on that and unlock that.
Because that was the Valve Steam edition.
Alright.
Alright, anyhow.
Let's move on with some housekeeping tonight.
There's actually a little bit of housekeeping tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I miss her, by the way.
Very good job, Miss Tia.
I know none of our listeners probably know her anymore because she was on the show forever ago.
She was on the very last live OLR, if I remember right.
Yeah.
Or it was the first OLR when we married the two shows.
When OLR was a live show and then separately a podcast.
I think she was on the very last live only OLR.
Yeah.
So, miss her.
Anyhow.
Reminiscing about things in the past.
Other things that are going on.
So not only do we have new artwork to represent the show, which will hopefully spread everywhere because we're replacing our old stuff.
The other thing is that I want to give a plug for Dead Pixel Live, which runs on All Games Radio Monday through Thursday at 7 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Pacific.
I was on the show earlier this week.
So check that out.
It was Thursday's episode.
So if you want to go back in this podcasty feed and look at deadpixellive.com,
you can check that out and you were on for a while too oh god yeah I was like on for like an hour he was nice enough Derek over at Dead Beasts Alive has been doing his show a really long time as well and he's daily so he passed 400 episodes a long time ago because he's doing like four of them a week I think for a while he might have been doing five
So he passed 400 a long time ago.
So we had a lot to talk about as much as how do you stay motivated to do a show.
So it was cool because we just kind of BS back and forth for a little while.
And then he had me on for the news.
And we talked a little bit about NGP and some of the other stuff.
So it was fun.
I had a good time.
So I just want to give a plug for that.
And if you want to hear another great show.
I think that's really it as far as housekeeping goes add us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or you can always add us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR lots of tweets this week because we've been asking people about the show and I'll read some of those tweets a little later on in the show
But for now, let's start off episode 400 as we always do with a little bit of gaming news.
So, Loki, what's going on in the world of gaming?
Same old stuff, I guess.
You know, when people run out of ideas for consoles, what's the first thing that happens?
Actually, it's not even really consoles or games or anything related to that, but even in the movie industry.
Remakes!
Hey, if it was good the first time, it'll be good the second time, right?
Yeah, yeah, maybe?
So Microsoft is rumored to be coming out... Well, actually, it's not so much a rumor anymore.
They're going to be remaking the original Halo game, Halo Combat Evolved.
It's coming out this holiday for the Xbox 360.
You'll be getting a kind of a graphical facelift.
They're expecting a 1080p resolution and also possibly 3D support.
Of course, the thought is they're going to be remaking it using the Reach engines, so it'll look all fancy and stuff.
And apparently it's being developed by Saber Interactive, the company that was behind Timeshift and Namco's upcoming game Inversion.
So, neat.
And they said the game is expected to come out on November 15th, which is basically 10 years after the original Halo game alongside the original Xbox.
It's kind of interesting, though, to go along with that, though, and maybe possibly one of the features of the game.
ConnectHalo.com was registered by Microsoft.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Of course, this is a URL that was registered in Microsoft back in June of 2010.
It could be not necessarily that it's going to be a Kinect Halo game, but maybe they were just registering before people cybersquatted on it.
Oh, good point.
Who knows?
And the only thing that the Kinect will recognize is when you dip your knees down so that you can teabag.
Yes.
Nice.
I like that.
Honestly, though, I think it wouldn't be so bad if they had Kinect support, but not necessarily in the fact that you have to stand up and play the whole game that way, but head tracking would be awesome.
Okay.
I see they said, oh, yeah, we can do Kinect and controller games.
Why don't they do head tracking?
I think head tracking would be the easiest thing to support.
and like most of these games you know you just have it where it tracks your head a little bit and so it kind of gives you a little bit more of immersion you don't necessarily need to do it and you know and it would be pretty awesome for any first person shooter
Now, backing up a little bit before we get into this whole Kinect theory, I think you said, you know, this whole thing about the game, this was not an official Microsoft announcement, right?
Like, somebody just blew the lid on their big E3 surprise, right?
Yes.
So, is this some type of, like, insider leak?
Because they went on down to the date.
That's something else.
Well, I think they're guessing on the date.
They're saying, you know, it makes sense because it's ten years from the original, so...
Okay, fair enough.
Let's see here.
I'm going to just pull this up here real quick because sometimes dates don't necessarily jive.
The 15th would be a Tuesday.
That is a release date.
That's usually the typical release date for a lot of these games nowadays.
Which is great because they're finally getting along lines with the movie industry.
They all release them on the same date.
Not if you're Nintendo.
You sometimes do Sundays if you're Nintendo.
They've been doing less Sundays than they have in the past.
But yeah, Nintendo, they have to be special.
I gotta admit, this news isn't totally surprising because I think Microsoft kind of teased this idea when they shut down Halo 2 that, well, you never know, these games might come back.
So this news isn't totally surprising.
But, you know, I think a lot of us thought, oh, it would be an Xbox Live Arcade game, or they're not going to go back and redo the whole damn thing.
I mean, Halo is a pretty good looking game anyway.
Well, they never said it wasn't going to be an Xbox Live Arcade game.
Good point.
I guess anything's possible there.
But if they do all this Kinect stuff, I think they're going to release it as a retail.
It's going to be retail.
They can charge $60 for it.
Exactly.
Go ahead.
It just seems weird to me that we're already going to see a trend of remaking games that...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
A little bit.
I mean, it's not terrible.
But we're already seeing this on the PlayStation 3 a lot.
I mean, it's just like all of a sudden they're like, oh, hey, got a work collection sold well.
Let's remake everything.
Let's just update everything and port it onto the PS3.
Because none of that PS2 backwards compatibility is coming anytime soon.
Or so we think.
And then all of a sudden, boom, look, now you can play those games that you just bought on the...
I don't mind a lot of the remakes, actually.
A lot of them are pretty good, and they bring some bonus stuff to the table.
I know that might sound really weird.
Like, the Hollywood remakes I could do without.
Most of those are poop.
But, like, for instance, Square Enix.
We have a story later in the show about Final Fantasy IV coming on the PSP.
It looks badass.
I can't wait to get it.
I mean, granted, that's one of my favorite Final Fantasy games they ever made.
But, I mean, those Final Fantasy remakes in general, 1 and 2 on the PSP, and then the ones on the DS...
We're all awesome, and all of them are worth having.
Isn't that stuff kind of a head-scratcher, too?
Because, you know, for the longest time on the PSP, and granted, there's a Kingdom Hearts game here and there and stuff like that, but there isn't really a lot of games I'm really interested in.
Also, it's like, oh, by the way, now we're going to put out Final Fantasy IV and the After Years on the PSP.
It's like, whoa, hey, that's pretty cool.
You know, I've got to pick up that.
Oh, hey, Earth Defense Force 2 is coming out on the PSP in Japan.
But, you know, eventually it'll come out over here.
Hey, that's pretty cool.
And then there was one other one.
I can't remember what it was, so...
But, like, I mean, you know, there's, uh, third birthday, you know, new, uh, Dissida game, um, and it's just a lot of cool stuff coming out.
Anyhow, go ahead.
which is cool.
I love Mega Man 2.
It's one of my favorite Mega Mans I ever did and it's really just the NES version but the way they market it on the marketplace and I should have known this because it's just a port of the PlayStation 1 version but it's really just the NES game on the PS1 with some fancy menus and I think the Pocket Station game is in there too.
PSP has that too when you play a PS1 game on PSP
Exactly, same feature.
But yeah, they didn't bother to translate the manual either.
So it's just Japanese, Japanese, Japanese, Japanese.
Great if you speak Japanese, I don't.
Way to go, Capcom, you suck.
So anyway.
Let's look for Roku instead of Mega.
Well, it's just, you know, whereas I support this whole Japanese release of games, I mean, I understand if they don't have the manpower to go in and translate the original ROM.
That is a little bit of work.
What they need to do is they need to give it the same treatment that they would as the Asian regions.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That takes like one person to do that.
I mean, seriously, you don't even need to translate the stuff.
You just kind of figure it out, write it down, create a graphic, boom, done.
What?
That's maybe a day's worth of work.
Oh, but that's way too much for Capcom.
They're too busy implementing DRM and shit.
So, whatever.
All right.
Somehow we got way off base of the original Halo Connect thing.
But as you were talking about with Mega Man stuff, and I made the comment that was pretty funny before the show, and you said say before the show, so I'll just repeat it on the show.
Sure.
We were talking about rehashes and stuff, and I was bitching about the Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition, basically a port of a Super Nintendo game onto the Wii.
And hey, guess what?
They could have charged $8 for it on Virtual Console, but no, they're going to make it.
pay $30 for it.
It's basically like Nintendo taking a giant shit in your mouth and of course all the fans will eagerly gobble it up because it's Nintendo.
And shit in your mouth now also available in teal blue.
So you have that option as well.
Look at some comments from the chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com I'm having to scroll back here a little bit because they said these a while ago.
But DarkTetsuya says, See, I had a feeling Microsoft would remake the older games since the Xbox originals can't connect to live anymore.
Kind of the same thing I was thinking with Halo 2.
But Halo 1 didn't have multiplayer.
I don't know if you guys remember that.
It had, excuse me, it didn't have Xbox Live.
It had, like, LAN support.
The first time I ever played Halo was at a wedding reception.
True story.
And they had a LAN thing all set up with the original Halo.
It was neat.
And then Defective Candy in our chatroom says, I'm a Halo fan, but jeesh, unless it's continuing the storyline, not doing the stupid past, but I'm not into this crap anymore.
Well, technically...
I guess.
Halo 1.
Because Halo 1 lacked Xbox Live, I can see where they want to do this again.
And they can kind of get away with it because it would be bringing something new to the table that the original Halo didn't have.
You know what I mean?
You know, maybe while they're at it, instead of straight porting it over, maybe they can tweak a few things.
Add some maps.
Throw the Halo 2 maps in there.
They need to add in red versus blue mode.
They're not going to add any Halo 2 maps in there because you know why?
Because they're going to release Halo 2 in HD.
Well then charge 1600 Microsoft points for it or something.
I mean, I know, wishful thinking, right?
But who knows.
Anyhow.
All right, let's move on to some other stories.
And yeah, this is kind of along those same lines about rehashes and so forth.
Although not really.
This is more of a dud.
This is about a game coming out on the 3DS.
New Super Mario Brothers was somewhat announced for the 3DS.
I mean, come on, people.
Of course, there's going to be a Mario game on the 3DS.
But it's nice to hear a little bit of a confirmation that it is being worked on because that tells you this game is probably coming out a little sooner rather than later.
In fact, in my mind, this kind of says it's probably one of their E3 games this year, because you know they've got to unveil some big things on the 3DS this year.
Anyhow.
Come on, come up with a new damn game.
I understand, ooh, it's New Super Mario Brothers, and we're porting it through all the different systems.
Well... Come up with a new game.
Don't call it, first off, don't call it New Super Mario Brothers.
That's a stupid name for a game.
Well, that, okay, where to begin?
First, that's not, you know, they haven't confirmed that that's a name.
Let me tell you what's been said.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Probably at least in the top ten games on those respective consoles.
Easily, if not the top five.
Okay, and so that gives them an excuse to come up with crappy names for their games.
That's awesome.
Super take a dump, you know.
It's the Zelda sequel.
So your problem is the name.
I don't want to see that in 3D.
My problem is the name of the game.
It's just like...
New Super Mario Bros.
Wow!
Thank you for putting all that effort in there.
What are we going to call this New Super Mario Bros.
game?
That's genius!
Well, now calling it Luigi's Mansion didn't really work out for them.
Well, that was a different game entirely.
Come up with something new.
Stop porting shit over because you have casual people and playing these systems and stuff.
They had Super Princess Peach.
I don't think that did so hot either.
That's because Princess Peach can't hold her own fucking game unless it was cooking or doing makeup or something.
Wow.
DarkSakura, rebuttal?
She's doing her nails.
Dude, it's Princess Peach.
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you doing your nails.
I was actually cutting out a very painful hangnail.
Oh, okay.
But I have something sharp in my hand.
And this is home turf.
Dude, it's Princess Peach, though.
It's not like we're fucking talking about, like, Lara Croft or some shit like that.
It's Princess Prissy Peach, okay?
Okay.
Hey, I love Princess Peach.
Shut your mouth.
The special abilities are her fucking emotions.
I'm anger now!
Ooh, I'm happy!
I used to joke in Mario Bros.
2 that when she floated in her pink dress it's because she had gas.
Fucking bipolar Princess Peach.
I will take you on in Super Smash Bros.
and I will whoop your ass with Peach.
She's awesome.
No, no, no.
It's all about Zelda in chic mode.
Ah, yes.
Zelda is pretty awesome.
Zelda cosplaying as a gay man.
Can I read the damn quote that led us to this whole thing in the first place?
What are we talking about again?
Halo.
That's right.
Yes, Halo on the 3DS.
Excellent.
Alright, look.
Miyamoto says, yes, so in the interest of adopting a new technology for the Super Mario Bros.
tradition, I am now making a new Super Mario Bros.
game for the Nintendo 3DS system.
By the way, this is out of a Q&A from Iwata on Nintendo's site.
Iwata says, the next stage for the Super Mario Bros.
Preservation Society's activities is the Nintendo 3DS.
Miyamoto, yes, laughs because he's thinking about money.
Yeah.
Miyamoto then stripped naked and landed in a kiddie pool of money and just cried and laughed and screamed.
I will bet you $50 is gonna be fucking New Super Mario Bros.
3D.
That is gonna be the fucking title of the game.
Seriously, that is gonna be it.
New Super Mario Bros.
3D.
That's it.
There's the title.
You mad?
Alright.
I'm just saying... Can I finish the quote?
Can I finish?
Can I finish?
Fine, go ahead.
I want to show everyone as soon as possible what the new Super Mario Bros.
will be like on the Nintendo 3DS I'm finished I'm just saying I want to show you what it's going to be like Turn on the Wii Turn on the DS Done
But by the way, the fact that he says as soon as possible, do you think that expo in June in LA will be the place to see it?
You know what as soon as possible is?
That's Nintendo time we're talking here, okay?
Soon as possible means we're going to announce it as soon as possible, but it may not come out for a couple years.
It all depends on how quickly they can port Mario 64 3D.
Alpha Cananogram in our chatroom says, I remember Miyamoto saying he wanted to remake Super Mario World, I think.
I like Super Mario World.
That was like one of the greatest video games ever made was the original Mario World.
By the way, the new album art kind of pays homage to that, actually.
Kind of funny how that works.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
How about something that doesn't have to do with Nintendo?
How about it?
It does have to do with Nintendo.
God damn it!
But not really.
Well, it's on the 3DS.
I'll leave it that way.
Reimaginings for Pac-Man and Galaga on the 3DS.
We will have Pac-Man Tilt and Galaga 3D Impact.
And they are in the same pack, which is Pac-Man and Galaga Dimensions that are going to be out on the 3DS.
Pac-Man Tilt sort of is a gyroscope type game, so he's in Rainbowland.
Loki paused the game.
I'm waiting.
With championship edition style and it's just very tilty.
You have to watch out because you may injure yourself.
I do not like tilty games for the record.
I don't want to do that on the subway because I'll hit someone.
I love this picture, by the way, of the guy moving the 3DS around and moving it above his head.
There's a little picture there.
Oh, Loki, did you have a comment?
I was just going to say that, I mean...
I know Pac-Man is your staple franchise, Namco.
It's just like Konami trying to shove fucking Frogger down our throats.
Seriously, I don't give a shit about Pac-Man anymore.
I think a lot of people don't give a shit about Pac-Man.
No, no, no, hold on.
Stop.
Stop.
Shut up.
Okay, stop it.
Real quick.
Granted, Pac-Man Championship Edition is pretty awesome.
Because it is like the original Pac-Man.
I don't give a shit about Tilty Pac-Man.
I don't give a shit about Pac-Man in a go-kart.
I don't give a shit about Pac-Man at a party.
I don't give a shit about multiplayer Pac-Man.
I mean, it's just... Pac-Man's cool.
If you want to port it 8 billion times like you've already done, fine.
You know, because people just need to own Pac-Man again, but...
Pac-Man was great.
Can I finish my story, please?
My sensibilities are being offended.
Yes, DarkSakura.
I'm going to finish my story now, please.
Go ahead.
And besides that, pack picks did kind of suck.
Seriously.
Terrible.
Galaga is going to be completely reimagined as a rail shooter, by the way.
I don't know how I feel about that.
The thought that I might enjoy it makes me feel a little dirty.
I'd look at that.
I'd check that out.
You'd hit that.
Let's do a Space Invaders rail shooter in the Time Crisis engine.
Since we're aborting on all these franchises.
Hey, because Yars Revenge is going to be awesome as a rail shooter with anime chicks.
I think I'm done.
No interest in the Battle Royale game, that new arcade table?
That looks kind of cool.
No interest?
No, it's stupid.
I mean, because if you play that game with one person, you're playing the original Pac-Man.
Well, maybe you... Loki, maybe you need to evaluate.
Why don't I have any friends?
Could it be... Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have any friends because I don't want to play multiplayer Pac-Man with them?
Well, those aren't friends I want.
Why won't you play multiplayer Pac-Man with me, man?
What's wrong?
Why won't you play with me?
Because you never let me be Pinky.
Because you like crappy games.
No, it's... Seriously, though, I mean... I...
I had to laugh though with just that arcade cabinet because it's so expensive and it's meant to look like a cocktail cabinet.
Like people still remember what cocktail cabinets are.
Especially kids nowadays don't know what the fuck a cocktail cabinet is and that shit's gonna get broken so fast.
And really, I don't see a big draw to...
Pac-Man in the arcade people don't go to the fucking arcades to play Pac-Man they can play Pac-Man on everything because Namco's hoarded out to everything including Google exactly so why do I need to go to the arcade to play Pac-Man when I can play it anywhere
So how does Ultracade manage to make any money then?
Because it seems like they've done a great job by cashing in on the... There's always someone on the damn Ultracade machine at Dave & Buster's.
Always.
Easy.
Because their cabinets are cheap to reproduce.
Basically, it's a cheap monitor.
They have a cheap computer inside there that's running on an arcade board.
They license everything.
And it gives a good option for arcade owners because you have multiple games in one...
Small Cabinet instead of having a full arcade full of games.
It's basically drop it in and you make money because everybody has a game that they like on there.
And you can kick the machine.
It's fun.
Moving on.
and Alpha Cananogram says, how much is that Battle Royale cabinet?
I don't remember the exact cost, but I believe it's like $5,000, which is ridiculous.
And it's only because there's a stupid touchscreen, you know, HDTV in there.
And honestly, the game sounds pretty.
Great, you know what?
They should just port it to the Microsoft Surface because that just has no software for it.
I remember those.
That was fun.
That was at PAX that one year in that hotel that we weren't even staying at.
Sony's Move server is coming to PC It may be revealed at a Game Developers Conference
Move Server is a software development kit for porting Move controls over to the PC.
Neat idea, I guess.
They already have kind of Move-type controllers anyways for the PC, but I guess if you really want to find another use for your Move controller, then you can go ahead and use it on your PC.
I'd imagine, though, you would need a Bluetooth adapter and, well, obviously, the stuff for the Move, the camera and everything.
Obviously, no software supports it yet, but it's set to be announced possibly on March 2nd.
Am I the only one that doesn't really understand the need for the Kinect and the Move stuff on the PC?
I don't know about you guys, but my PC is in my bedroom, and it's kind of in a space where I don't really want to move around.
That's my place to get fat, is I sit my butt in that chair, and I have my feet up on the desk, and I'm playing World of Warcraft.
Click, click, click, click, click.
I don't play Kinect in my bedroom at the PC.
Who would do that?
Um, well... Maybe a paraplegic.
The Kinect, I mean, I think is gonna entice people more to hook it up to the PC because of all the cool, neat things you can do with it.
The Move is really just another controller.
It's like the Wii.
And honestly, the Move wasn't that exciting when it came out on the PlayStation 3.
I mean, it's a decent controller, but it... And I know that they're really pushing hard for it to be like a first-person shooter and a hardcore accessory...
but honestly the hardcore players out there they see right through this shit and they're not going to just go buy their stupid looking machine gun looking thing to plug this thing into just because it's supposed to it doesn't make you more accurate in these first person shooter games it's just kind of weird but I don't think that you're going to see a lot of super innovative stuff with this I mean the same type of stuff that you would see with this you can do already on the Wii Remote with a Bluetooth adapter so um
I don't know, I'm just kind of scratching my head with it.
But hey, whatever, you know.
They can go, hey, look, we're on PC too.
Yay.
I just kind of saw this as trying to beat Microsoft to the punch in kind of officially supporting the... Because they clearly, Sony sees, oh, people want to have these motion controllers on their PCs.
That's awesome, but the thing is, though, is it... I mean, what are you going to be able to do with it?
That's my thing, is what are you going to be able to do with it?
I mean, the controller, it's pretty accurate and stuff, but it doesn't do all the cool, nifty, like, you know, 3D scan stuff that you can do with the Kinect.
It's just, you know, good.
Now I have the Vision Camera support or whatever.
Or not the Vision Camera, the PlayStation Eye.
You know, big deal.
Now I can have a webcam.
I mean, it's just, I don't.
I don't see the point.
I would be kind of curious though.
I don't know if you actually need the eye camera.
I wonder if you can just use normal web cameras to kind of ask like the eye.
That would be kind of neat.
See if you could do that.
But I don't know.
Whatever.
I guess it's good that they have another option.
I just don't see a lot of, you know, unless it's other than indie games and stuff like that.
I don't see a lot of people like adding support for this for their games.
I just don't think that's going to happen.
Again, if you have to buy all this other stuff to make it work, like the Bluetooth adapter or whatever, well, I guess computers haven't built in these days, right?
A lot of computers haven't.
I mean, laptops and stuff haven't built in.
Not so much actual PCs and stuff like that.
But, I mean, that stuff's cheap.
It's not too expensive to add a Bluetooth adapter.
And if you're really interested in this stuff, and hey, you may have one for a headset or something like that.
So, great, but...
I don't know.
I guess it's neat to have the option, but I just don't see a lot of people using this.
I think that the Kinect is going to be a lot more popular when it comes to this stuff.
I mean, you'll see a lot of cool move hacks and stuff.
Granted, they could have come up with... I mean, it's Bluetooth.
They could have come up with custom drivers and stuff for the move controllers and everything, but you don't see anyone doing that because no one cares.
It's just like, I don't think anyone's going to really care when this comes out for PC.
All right, well, let's move on since Loki is such a fan of Nintendo tonight.
I just have to get his opinion on this story.
One of the big games that Nintendo was hawking at last year's E3 was Zelda Skyward Sword.
Well, it looks like that they might be kind of pushing that game again at the Expo this year because it looks like Skyward Sword is going to be a little while before it comes out.
It's clearly the first quarter of the year.
It's not happening.
Second quarter of the year is looking a little grim because they have said that The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has been in the process of being remade for Nintendo 3DS and this Nintendo 3DS version is expected to hit the market earlier than Skyward Sword.
And that's what Satoru Iwata says in a recent financial report piece.
Come on, folks.
I mean, remade.
All they're doing is just porting the assets to the fucking 3DS.
That's all they're doing.
Ooh, remade.
I thought at one point Nintendo was touting how easy it was to port games over the 3DS.
Anything with the Z-axis.
It's just all it is is just some core engine stuff that they're rebuilding and then all the assets and stuff they're just porting on over.
I don't think that they're really up-resing a lot of the stuff that's on there.
They're just kind of straight porting it over and then tweaking the engine a little bit to have it all run in.
The Skyward Sword stuff, I'm not surprised.
I mean, look at how long Metroid Other M was delayed.
I mean, it was just kind of getting pushed back and back and back for a while.
And same with a lot of the other games.
And I would not be surprised if something like this doesn't come out.
I mean, because a lot of times I think that they're...
They promise a lot of games that come out, and then they just don't have them.
And so they're like, okay, well, crap.
What's it going to be our holiday game or something like that?
And then it'll get pushed to November or something like that.
Because really, they haven't announced a lot of stuff.
I mean, sure, there's going to be stuff at E3, but...
I don't know.
It's just they're going to be looking for that big holiday title.
Sell more systems for the Wii.
That's kind of my thought too.
They say in this that Miyamoto's team is entering the final completion stage of the Wii title, whatever that means.
But this kind of makes me think that maybe part of the reason for this delay is so that they have something to show on the Wii this year at that big expo.
You know what I mean?
Like maybe there's not a lot else scheduled to be coming out on the Wii.
Maybe Just Dance 3?
I don't know.
No, I mean...
I think some things I could see them doing, like New Super Mario Bros.
2, I could see them doing something like that, just because they already have the engine built, and it's basically just building new levels for it, maybe tweaking and adding some new things on their new abilities or some shit like that, and everyone will go buck wild over it.
They've been promising Pikmin forever, so they'll make me a new Pikmin game, but honestly...
I mean, I just can't get too excited about Pikmin, I'm sorry.
I mean, I think this year is going to be a lot of 3DS games.
Of course.
You're going to see a lot of stuff that they've already announced that's not coming out, like the Kid Icarus game again is going to be another focus of E3 because it's probably going to be their... I'd be willing to bet that's one of their holiday titles for the 3DS.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have a problem with mobile gaming.
He has a problem with how cheap mobile games are, like for iPhone and this type of app games.
It's basically quoted saying that one of the biggest risks in the industry is inexpensive games that are disposable from a consumer standpoint.
as in oh crap 99 cents I'm fine with it I'm done with it and basically it removes the idea of you know value from the game because now you're so saturated with things that are so cheap that you expect everything to be so cheap what an amazing fucking metaphor for the state of games on the Wii yeah I mean here's the problem irony much you know the problem with that thought though is that what if those cheap games are really good
Well, see, that's what he said.
Well, now that's not possible.
He used Angry Birds as an example of the diamond in the rough.
Every so often you come up with something that's exceptional, but for the most part, they're all just cookie cutter crap.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow!
People are selling games and making money.
Why didn't I think of that?
Wow!
Why isn't my $20 copy of Let's Go Cook Some Shit in my kitchen not selling well?
Why?
What, people don't like math tutor games?
What's wrong with them?
Why isn't this selling?
I mean, come on.
Because Nintendo has to put forward this illusion of quality with things that they put out.
And yeah, I agree.
A lot of it's crap.
However...
They do have their corporate image to uphold.
It's part of who they are, part of their branding.
They stopped caring about quality when that fucking seal left their goddamn boxes.
And you know how many years ago that was?
A long time ago.
They don't give a shit.
It's all about what will people want to buy?
What can we make them want to buy?
Oh, hey!
Let's port some GameCube games over and add Wii controls to them.
For the record, I do see people buying that shit.
Exactly.
They're making money.
Exactly.
They're making money.
Then why are they bitching about somebody using a different business strategy to make money?
Because they didn't think of it first.
They didn't think of it first and because it's competing with their market and now they're saying, well, how do we justify these games that are possibly crap like this for $20 when these people are selling something similar that may be better than our product for $1?
They can't.
You know, I got to say, though, to some extent, I think he has a point because a lot of the mobile games on the iOS system are pieces of shit.
Like a lot of them are truly terrible games.
Yeah.
A friend of mine once said that trying to find a good app game at that price point is like trying to get honest nutrition from a vending machine.
More often than not, you're getting a melted Snickers.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hence like Steam sales.
That's another big thing.
I get great games for $4 or $10.
I find it hard to excuse the fact that people are saying, well, there's a lot of crappy games out there on the iOS store.
Yes, there are.
And you know what?
If you do some research and before you purchase your games, you don't have to buy all those crappy games.
Same with the more expensive games.
If you do your research, you don't have to buy the expensive games.
But at the same time, he's basically saying, well, these games are cheap and there's no good cheap games out there.
That's not true.
The difference being is that... In the case of some of these games that are on there for dirt cheap, they're made by a couple of guys who are just hanging out and like, oh, let's put a buck on it.
We have to put something on it, so let's do a dollar.
They just do it for fun.
You know, those little games come out.
Sometimes there'll be a company behind it.
With most of Nintendo's stuff, you're looking at basically developers.
People who have to pay employees to develop this.
You know, bigger companies.
You're dealing with a corporate structure.
The other thing to look at, too, is that, you know, yeah, they have the DSiWare, but most of their games are still physical games.
You have to pay for materials.
You have to pay for packaging.
There's a designer that goes into designing the box.
You've got someone doing the manual.
You have a technical writer writing everything that goes in the manual.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
But I'm a consumer.
I don't give a crap about that.
And that's the thing.
If they have this option to release a game for $10 instead of, say, $30 just because they can avoid all those costs, why don't they do that?
Because if they market it well enough, they will have no problem selling that.
I guarantee if there's a good game that came on DSiWare, there's blogs that cover that shit every week of what comes out.
People will be aware of it.
People will buy it.
And that's it.
Same with Xbox Live Arcade.
There's tons of stuff that's $10, $20.
There's great games.
For the most part, if they put out something that's going to be half the price to market and they raise the price of it $10, chances are they're actually going to end up making more money that way.
Here's a question.
You bring up a good point about really everything that goes into making a video game.
But as the industry kind of moves towards this digital distribution thing, I think as a whole, I think in the next generation of consoles, you're going to see more direct downloads of games.
Hence why we see GameStop starting to already come up with their plan B, so to speak.
Shouldn't these people in the middle kind of be worried?
Well, no, I see things definitely going that way.
But for right now, with what they have now, I think that, and keep in mind Nintendo, for all the innovations that they like to bring in, they are very reluctant to change.
How long do they stick with a cartridge?
I mean, really?
They do have that reluctance to embrace something new as far as marketing and distribution strategy is concerned.
But, I think that, you know, they're probably going to be another 10 years late like they were before, but they're going to eventually catch up to it.
Right now, that's not in the way that they operate.
That's not in how they do business.
And they can't really see anything outside of their own box.
They may think that they're innovating in the way games are played and the way things are doing.
They're looking at...
The way we can innovate what we have now within this little cube.
Not meaning to bring up the GameCube, of course.
But they've always been about their own proprietary hardware and their own proprietary way of delivering the games.
They've been about doing things the Nintendo way.
And if you look over the course of the years, their business model really hasn't changed.
there hasn't been any real change in their strategy they've still kept things they want tight control over everything they want things to be to the Nintendo standard even if the game is suck all of the releasing of that game is done to Nintendo standard so I think it's also another way that they you know I mentioned their branding before I think it's actually a way that they protect their corporate identity too is by having such tight control over how everything goes out unfortunately that's money out of their pocket
That's the way it goes.
They can't see outside of their own business model to see a way that another business model could work for them.
They're afraid to change.
They're afraid to take a risk.
I kind of agree and I don't want to go too far off track but you know companies afraid to take risks that's something we've covered before and that is why Konami is not making the most profitable guitar game although they could have they could have wanted to take some risks they had it they had it in I had it in my hand all right anyhow let's move on we got to travel the world and talk about release dates of games that are coming out very soon let's start in the US Loki
This week, taking some serious risks on Nintendo Wii, Mario Sports Mix.
It's a sports game with Mario and other people and some Square Enix characters as well.
People love their Mario games.
Brain and Body Connection.
This is a game that's kind of similar to the Brain Age game that was on the Wii.
That was on Xbox 360 supporting the Kinect, or I should say requiring the Kinect.
Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 this week.
Junior Brain Trainer 2 on Nintendo DS.
This is pretty awesome.
Finally making its comeback, You Don't Know Jack on DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360.
Oh my god, that's this week?
That's this week.
Holy crap, yay!
Is there like a demo or anything for this?
I don't know if there's a demo.
Actually, I heard there's probably a video on some website.
But I've heard if you pre-order it, it's $30 and it's going to be like $40 after pre-orders.
Something like that.
I don't think so.
That's just what someone said on the message board.
They dropped the price on it.
They probably told people to make some more pre-orders.
Trinity, Souls of Zillow on PlayStation 3.
That's from... Looks like a Tecmo.
Um...
and Zuzu Princess.
Yay!
Another hamster game.
And then about a week from today, Dragon Quest 6.
Yeah, Dragon Quest 6, Realms of Revelation.
Realms of Revelancy.
Sorry, can I look at this preview real quick for You Don't Know Jack here in studio?
I just kind of want to check this out because I used to love this game so much.
Back in 2012, you see.
Wow, that's an old logo.
Jellyvision.
Yay.
You Don't Know Jack!
The trivia party video game is back!
And all new for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC!
Everybody's favorites are still there!
Twisted trivia questions, the dis or dat, screw your neighbor, and the jack attack!
Plus all new face-melting features and surprises, including online play!
From socialism to social networks, from bigamy to Bigfoot, from war games to drinking games, it's... You Don't Know Jack!
Yeah, I gotta buy it.
Damn it.
I'm trying to save money, but I need this.
I need it.
Will your liver explode if you don't have that, Rob?
Possibly.
My spleen will be painin'.
It's only 30 bucks, though.
That's not that bad.
Does it make your liver quiver?
It's only 30 bucks.
You heard the man.
Does it make your heart fart?
It's half the price of what I paid for that crappy Tron game.
Anyhow, anything else this week, Logie?
All right, let's move over to Japan and talk about what is coming out over there in Japan this week.
On the 8th of February, the Asia regions are getting Test Drive Unlimited 2.
Sometimes the Asia dates sneak their way onto my list.
But on the 10th of February, actually in Japan this week, Entakuno Saito, Students of Round, comes out this week.
I'm not sure what that is.
It's an RPG game on the Xbox 360.
Uh, looks like, um, kind of neat.
Looks like you can have, like, a party of six people, and you can kind of use your, uh, D-pad to use, like, you know, attacks or spells or items.
This looks like it might be very old-school, uh, RPG.
It doesn't look like it has kind of all the newfangled stuff in it, so.
Uh, it's called Entaku no Saito, Students of Round, is what it's called, Loki.
Students of Round.
Yes.
That's Summoned in Final Fantasy VII.
Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare finally makes its way to Japan this week as well.
So if you are in Japan and you like yourself some Red Dead Redemption, check it out.
PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
LittleBigPlanet 2 finally makes it your way as well as Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare.
And Sengoku Musou 3Z comes out in a regular and like a special limited edition.
So if you are a fan of these games, this is the third one in the series from Koei.
I think it's like a Dynasty Warriors-esque kind of game.
It's more Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
Oh, yes.
You can choose between all these different characters.
It looks like there's like 20 different characters.
Basically, if you see Sengoku in the name, that's what it is.
All right.
Moving on to some of the other consoles.
Going to the Nintendo Wii, Sengoku Mosou 3, Moshuden, which means scaled-down version.
I just made that up, but seeing as it's on the Wii, it probably is a little bit different.
Something legend.
Side story.
That's Gaiden.
Nothing on the DS this week, obviously, because they're still warming up for the 3DS out there.
So the only other system that I would really mention is the PSP, which has Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 3 coming out this week from Bandai Namco.
So check that out.
Music Game Fans, DJ Max Portable 3 is out next week.
Thought I'd throw that out there.
This looks a little bit like that Final Fantasy Crisis Core, kind of, but a different set of characters.
This whole Tales of the World.
I wonder if that's the Tales of blank series, kind of on the PSP.
Don't know.
How about Europe?
Well, for Europe, we have on the 8th, EverQuest 2, Destiny of Velius on PC, and Explodemon on PlayStation 3.
On the 11th, we have Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PS3 and Xbox 360, and Dr. Kawashima's Body and Brain Training on Xbox 360.
We also have Edna and Harvey the Breakout on PC, Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC, and Trinity Zil-O-Zero for PS3 by Koei.
All right.
Just a couple more news stories for you guys.
Then we got the classic game of the week.
And it's a good one for episode 400.
People are going to be tingly in their special places.
I hope so.
Let's move on with a couple quick stories before that.
We talked last week about how Sony announced the PlayStation suite, which will bring PlayStation 1 emulation.
to the Android platform.
Well, there's rumors that they may be expanding the suite to cover other operating systems, including the iOS format, as well as Windows at a later date.
So it might be kind of cool to have an official PlayStation 1 emulator.
I can't imagine how that won't be cracked, but okay.
Actually, we have plenty of emulators out there now that I think of it.
They're even saying that it's possible that other Sony products like the Sony Internet TV powered by Google might also get some support for it.
That might be kind of neat, I guess.
Make some really cheap PlayStation 1 players, I guess.
Yeah, so they have a completely open stance to it, they say.
So that's pretty neat.
I can totally see him doing that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Angry Birds is apparently making its way onto the 3DS.
That's right.
Rovio, who makes Angry Birds, they're trying to bring Angry Birds to just about every platform that's out there, and of course that would include the 3DS.
They spoke with 3DS Focus, and they are saying that they're going to bring out their games on the 3DS as download titles later this year, including Angry Birds Rio.
There you go.
So they're going to be in Rio.
Aw-inspiring 3D.
Angry Birds is also out for the PS3 and the PSP if you're curious.
Come on!
It's Angry Birds, a 2D game.
Does that really need to be in 3D?
Maybe you can be behind the bird while you shoot things.
I don't know.
That's dumb.
It is a little dumb.
Alright.
Let's get into a segment we like to do on the show here where we walk into the vault...
and pick a game.
It's the classic game of the week.
It's DarkSakura's opportunity to find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be worshipping this game.
Or at least check it out.
It's the classic game of the week.
This is another game that we should introduce by menu, Rob.
I will try.
Not everybody's going to recognize it, you know.
I know, but the people who do will get special brownie points.
Here we go.
Let's fire it up here and look at some of the music or at least some of the ambience from this game.
Ah, memories.
Best mini music ever.
Yay.
Alright, what is it, DarkSakura?
I'm dying.
It's Beatmania!
Yay.
It is the game that started it all.
This gave us the whole Bimani thing.
This gave us Orange Lounge Radio.
G. Konami, what were you thinking?
But it started off in 1997 and really got big in 98.
I remember back in the day having the emulator BM-98 on my computer so I could play Beatmania stuff at home.
That was my first Beatmania experience with BM-98.
and from there we've had Beatmania 2DX, we've had Beatmania 3, we've had DDR, Parapara, Dance Maniacs, so many, so many.
But let's go ahead and focus on the original Beatmania.
You had five keys and a turntable and everybody was right side pride.
Back in the day.
And so basically the little platforms would scroll down on your screen and you had to hit the corresponding button or scratch at the right time.
Or a combination of buttons.
With a very interesting kind of low quality video playing in the background that was typically just repeated scenes over and over again.
It was the PlayStation 1 after all.
Well I'm talking about the arcade one too, shoot.
Yeah.
But yeah, we had... It came out on the PlayStation.
They had the really nice controller and the dinky controller.
And I started off with the dinky controller and then bought a nice controller.
And we had all kinds of versions.
But we'll go ahead and talk a little bit about Beatmania's second mix in Beatmania, which was the first one that came out on the PlayStation.
We had practice mode, where you could practice...
Free Mode, and Expert, Expert Plus, and Easy.
That was actually available in third mix.
Expert Plus was offered in sixth mix.
And, of course, Boss Battle, where you would... That was just so much fun, watching the... Actually, you'd also have your tutorial mode, too, where they would tell you how to play.
Beatmania 3 had that, too.
Beatmania 3 had an effector pedal, which I don't think I played a single song on that game that actually used the pedal.
But it did also have the effector sliders, which was really neat.
and the cabinets were there was a standard cabinet and a mini cabinet the standard I'm sure is the one that most everyone's seen which is the 29 inch screen the mini cabinet had the 20 inch screen and basically I think one was space saver and the other but the mini cabinet they didn't get too many released in the US if you can find an American Beatmania that's made of the mini cabinet probably kind of worth some money I think
However, you can go buy, you know, old Beat Mania machines for like, what, 300 bucks at Metreon?
Seriously.
But I remember back in the day when we would get new Bitmoney games and would trek across California to, you know, go to Milpitas or Sunnyvale or I remember going for a DDR, for when DDR Max came out, going to San Diego and looking for one there while I was already there.
But yeah, we've got also all kinds of different versions that have come out.
We've had Beatmania, actually the US Beatmania, which is actually Beatmania 2DX.
The 7 key with the switchable turntable had a Beatmania mode in it, which basically is just 5 key, but I'm not going to pick on that.
There were versions for the Game Boy Color and the Wonderswan Color, which we knew somebody who had that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Konami Ho Konami.
They were kind of late to jump on the Beatmania bandwagon in the U.S.
They didn't listen to their fans.
Well, a couple of them listened to their fans, but nobody listened to them for quite a while until they were like, oh, I see you're importing it.
Let's bring it out.
Gee, DDR is suddenly selling over there.
Maybe we should have got on that a while ago.
Yeah.
The first official Beatmania game in the US, you guys, was a port of 2DX Nights Tile.
Sorta.
It kind of used that interface and had a mishmash of games.
No, we actually had Hip Hop Mania.
Oh yeah, the crappy, I don't even acknowledge that in the arcades.
But it is Beatmania.
Yeah, it's true, it's true.
And it came out relatively early enough, and we had one of those at our VGL.
And it was... Let me just go back into the list of the games.
And keep in mind, I probably have most of these.
I remember when I went hunting down a Club Mix.
Because that, in my opinion, is the best.
Can you play Salamander Bee Crush Mix?
Yeah, I can play Salamander Bee Crush Mix.
Hold on.
I didn't see which one you were playing.
Oh, you were playing Overdoser?
No, you had some video of it.
Oh.
Let me actually do this video.
The only cool part of this one is the beginning of it.
I don't think this is somebody filming their TV.
I think this is actual... Oh, they are filming their TV.
Oh, well.
Oh, there's this one, actually.
This is an actual... There we go.
Yeah, that...
which really only at the beginning sounds like salamander music right but I mean they did have all kinds of remixes from their you know old games in that too but here's all the different versions um as far as arcade releases we had Deep Mania, Deep Mania second mix, third mix, complete mix which was Hip Hop Mania over here we got that as Hip Hop Mania
We had 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, Time To Get Down, which actually had a lot of good music.
There was Complete Mix 2.
No, take that back.
That was the one that we had.
Because it had 321 Stars in it, remember?
Anyway.
Club Mix, Beatmania featuring Dreams Come True, which was a little J-pop band back then.
Beatmania Core Remix.
There was 6th Mix, UK Underground Music.
7th Mix, Keepin' Evolution, and Beatmania The Final.
And in Korea, there was BeatStage, BeatStage 3rd Mix, BeatStage Complete Mix, BeatStage 4th Mix, The Beat Goes On, 5th Mix, How To Get Down And in North America, we had Hip Hop Maniac Complete Mix and Complete Mix 2 On the PlayStation, I'm gonna read them all It's episode 400 and I can't
Beatmania, Beatmania Append, the Ebisu Mix, which I have, Third Mix Mini, the Append Third, these are all Appends, which basically, if you had the first game, you bought the Appends and you'd swap them, which made it a pain in the ass if you were on an American system trying to get them to play and having to do the disc swaps and all this crap, which I found my way around.
You get a little thing that plugs into the back.
There was GoToMix, 4th Mix, 5th Mix, Best Hits, Dreams Come True, GoToMix 2, Glowing Global, which was actually pretty cool.
Club Mix, The Sound of Tokyo, which was also fun.
6th Mix, and Beatmania Europe.
For Game Boy Colors, Beatmania GB, GB2 Gotcha Mix, and GB2 Gotcha Mix 2.
WonderSwan, there was Beatmania for WonderSwan, there was a bajillion Baymoni pockets which I was talking about little monochrome LCD screens and they were little but the fun thing about that is there was an anime song mix that was all stuff from anime by Go Nagai which is like Cutie Honey and Mazinger Z and you know
there was a Tokimeki Memorial version because you know Konami owns Tokimeki Memorial a bunch of anime, there was a Hello Kitty mix there was Enjoy Georgia's Signature there was Tiger's version, Kawaii version which means cute but it had to do with magazine Tokimeki 2, Love Stories, Konamix Best Hits 2000 and Tiger's version 2 which was for the Hanshin Tigers baseball team baseball's a big deal and that's it
Thank you for watching!
I just remember, and this is actually literally how I got into it, is probably February of 98, on, I think we were actually on the old Pentium 2, the overclocked 60 to 120 computer Dan had, and one of my friends saying, hey, there's this game out in Japan, but we can't get it, but here's an emulator.
And it was BM98.
Nice.
And then...
I need to download BM98 again.
Your classic game of the week.
Beatmania.
Available in the arcade or on many, many, many, many, many different home releases on the PlayStation.
Oh, love to be.
Oh yeah.
Alright, that does it for your Classic Game of the Week and it also brings Part A of the show to a close.
But don't go anywhere, guys.
In Part B tonight, we've got a lot.
It's probably going to be a very long Part B tonight.
We've got your Twitter topics, of which there's a lot to get to tonight.
So get your Twitter topics in.
We'll get those and we'll get the FUs of the week, of course.
The Skype line as well and...
You know what?
We figured it's episode 400.
We got a lot of people in the house.
Let's do a match game tonight.
Oh, well, our match game returns tonight.
And we actually have a legitimate prize to give away tonight.
So it's pretty cool.
So we're going to give that away when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this Sunday evening, February the 6th of 2011 at allgames.com for our 400th episode of our show.
So welcome you guys.
And Loki is in the house.
He's playing Gal Gun tonight.
And he's been playing it pretty much during the entire show and he's not ranting about something Nintendo.
So Loki, what do you think so far?
Like right now he's in like a music room or something.
I don't know, shooting girls with love.
It's a weird game.
I don't know.
I don't really know what's good.
I don't really know what's going on, but I know that they have this focus mode where you're doing something to parts of girls, and then they orgasm, and it causes the other girls to orgasm, or whatever.
They faint with love.
It's an orgasm, okay?
Hot.
Infectious orgasm game.
It's strange.
Fun!
Yeah, I can see why they got rid of the panty shots, though, because it would have been porn, pretty much.
Now, we were talking earlier about one-handed games.
Do you think Galgun could be a one-handed game?
Uh...
with a special controller, maybe I mean, because you'd have to
It's hard because you have to aim with the left analog stick and then you have to shoot with the A button.
I was going to say, if it had an auto-fire, then yeah, because then you could just... Auto-fire maybe, and they have a zoom.
You could probably do it with some sort of special remappable nunchuck type controller or something where you have a shoot button as a trigger and maybe you could do a one-handed then, but no, it's not a one-handed game.
Alright, well... I love this new video capture card thing, it's awesome.
We're gonna get into some rapid fire news here in just a little bit, but first we'd like to do little plugs for our side projects, of which we have a couple of them.
DarkSakura does a comic book podcast every week with her pals.
Comic Insanity
When do we get an OLR app for Android?
When someone makes it for us.
Because I don't know how to do that crap.
I don't either, but you got it for Comic Insanity.
I didn't do it.
Okay, we need to talk to your peoples.
I'll have my people contact us people.
I don't know, would chatters like that?
I don't know, what would we do on an iPhone or Android?
Twitter and Facebook connection and links to the forums.
Maybe like exclusive content, like topless pictures of Shermie?
Jeremy's always topless.
She's such a whore.
I mean, not really.
If you don't know, by the way, Shermie is, of course, DarkSakura's cat.
She's very fat and sassy.
I got her to play this morning.
You got her to play what, WoW?
No, I dangled a string, and she's like, bat.
That was fun.
Good times.
My cats used to lose their mind over the laser pointer, and now the best that they'll do is if you wiggle the laser dot, they'll do the, with their arms, they're like, I'm gonna reach for it, but that's it.
I'm not chasing that shit anymore.
I'm too old.
So, bat, bat.
Did I tell you about when I got Shermie one of those?
She hated what she did.
No, she looked at the little dot and then she looked right up at the pointer.
Realized how it worked and didn't try anymore.
Shermie just don't care.
She's smart when she's trying to be lazy.
another spinoff show if you're a fan of World of Warcraft or even if you're not and you like really obscene chat join me and my pal Extifer for the best little horde house in Azeroth or horde house for short we're too poor for a website but you can find us on iTunes or whatever podcast engine you use just look for horde house H-O-R-D-E H-O-U-S-E by the way speaking of World of Warcraft I understand a lot of my guildies are listening at least that's what X-Link just told me so hi guild Grats on level 9
Why aren't you in chat?
Oh, Beijing, level 9.
Slash's Pop just perked up.
Whoa, hey.
Wow News.
Yes, they just hit level 9.
We were really close, and everybody's doing their alts right now, it looks like.
So you get lots of guild leveling from that.
All right, but we'll save the rest of the WoW chatter for the best little horde house in Azeroth, which usually releases Thursdays-ish, depending on our taping schedule, which is really erratic.
Although I will say this, Extover told me he loved the live show.
Loved the live show and kind of wants to do it again.
So you never know what might happen.
We might have to storm the OLR studios more than once a week.
All right.
Anyhow, let's move on to some rapid fire news and lots and lots of news that we just don't have time to talk a whole long time about because, you know, we've got to fit in Nintendo rants for Loki.
So, Loki.
Armored Core 5 was announced and it's kind of cool.
Well, it's been announced for a while.
But they announced that it's going to have team-based online multiplayer, which is pretty cool.
It's expected to come out over here.
I guess they're saying it's 2012 in North America and Europe and late 2011 in Japan.
But the game looks pretty awesome.
Kind of reminds me a little bit of the Crossing Chromehounds with the Armor Core 4, which is pretty cool.
Chromhounds had that cultish following to it, but unfortunately not a strong enough following to necessitate a second game, right?
Yeah.
It was kind of like their version of a North American armored core.
Just stick with armored core.
The problem with Chromhounds was that it was slow.
slow mechs, slow everything whereas Armored Corps is just kind of fast and fast paced, lots of missiles and yeah so that'll be kind of cool and expect that next year I guess Namco announced that yes, guess what, we're going to do another Ridge Racer this current generation not going to wait for another console to come out Ridge Racer!
Ridge Racer Unbounded and that's going to be on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC in 2012
The game had a little teaser trailer for it.
Of course, no actual gameplay, but it basically kind of resembles Burnout.
And it's actually being developed by Bugbear Entertainment, who of course put out the game flat out.
So they kind of know something about destructible racing games.
And I don't know, it looks kind of neat.
I like Burnout.
Ridge Race is kind of cool.
Ridge Racer drifting with Burnout.
Which of course, what story about Ridge Racer would be incomplete without It's Ridge Racer!
Ridge Racer!
And then this is not too unexpected, but Project Dark, which was a working title for, of course, this new game, Dark Souls, was announced in the latest Famitsu magazine.
It's basically going to be kind of a successor to Demon's Souls, but not in a way.
They're actually saying that they're making the game harder.
And they said, I guess...
Similar, it's going to be similar in style, but not necessarily a sequel to Demon's Souls.
And players will be able to create their own characters, though they're no longer, I guess, different job classes.
I guess just tweaks to the world design as well.
The world is no longer divided into levels, instead it's being one large area.
And there's going to be cooperative and competitive play as well.
Will it be as fucking hard?
Because oh my god.
It's going to be harder.
Oh god.
Oh god.
Seriously, Demon's Souls is awesome.
Couldn't tell you much about it, though, because I keep getting killed.
Horrifically.
Over and over again.
It's not a forgiving game.
Let's see.
What other cool tidbits did they have about it?
Of course, they said that the online system will be returning and it's been highly enhanced to allow users to share experience and they said grow together in the world.
Although I'm sure that means going to other people's games and trying to kill the other people like you could in the original.
That's my birthday.
Wow, that's right, it is.
So you're getting an awesome game as a present for your birthday from Squeenix.
It's going to retail for $30.
And of course, if you haven't heard, this is the original Final Fantasy 4 and the After Years, which came out originally on mobile gaming over in Japan and later on the Wii.
I played about, I don't know, half of it on the Wii, but there was a lot of download episodes you had to do.
And I beat like two of them.
But yeah, it'll be nice to have the entire collection on the PSP.
this story almost makes me a little sad because I have Final Fantasy 4 for the DS the 3D one that they did played the first hour of it gorgeous love it my favorite Final Fantasy and now it's like I feel that I shouldn't play that and finish that because this is coming out
Even though the art design is totally different.
You know, I really liked the 3D Final Fantasies, which is weird because I'm usually not into the 3D stuff, but I love the art style on the PSP ones.
It's just so sharp, and they've just retouched those sprites, and this is the same look that they gave Final Fantasy 1 and 2.
And apparently there's supposed to be new effects with the magic and everything, and there's some...
I know it's supposed to be rapid fire news, but let me see if I can do a quick, quick, quick shot of the trailer here, which was available somewhere.
Let me see if I can find it.
I might have to search YouTube for it, so maybe I'll show you later.
Remind me after the show.
Alright, let's move on though with other releases.
Tapper is coming out on the iPhone and the iPad.
New school Tapper, not the old school Tapper.
Yep, that's right, it's a brand new Tapper game that's going to be coming out
Root Beer Tapper
DarkSakura.com
But when I heard about this, I was like, oh, yeah, another.
Yeah, this would be like Yara's Revenge turning into a first-person shooter.
That would be great.
But then I heard, like, Don Bluth doing all the art, and I'm like, oh, now it just went, like, 80s awesome again.
Yeah, to bring it back to Don Bluth, he did The Secret of NIMH movie.
And Xanadu.
Oh, God.
And All Dogs Go to Heaven, and I want to say Ferngully.
Was that him or no?
I think...
Perhaps?
IDK.
Anyway, that guy.
He's awesome.
Alright, moving on to a story about Castlevania.
You know, Castlevania Harmony of Despair is one of those games that's available on Xbox Live Arcade.
Well, there is a new stage that's available for 240 Microsoft points.
It's based on an original Famicom
Konami title, Getsu Fuma Den so there you go, 160 points if you want to actually play as the character Getsu Fuma it has 8-bit graphics though and I guess it's kind of old school sorry I didn't mean to do the loud but this is kind of what it looks like here in the game kind of neat those almost look like little Metroids that you're fighting there so there you go
That's coming out soon.
Moving on.
DarkSakura has some quick stories for us.
And then the Twitter topics is twitter.com slash OLR.
Well, we talked about Pac-Man in Part A. Ms.
Pac-Man is going to be coming out for iPad, and then there will be a free Valentine's Day update for Pac-Man on the iPhone.
It's more Namco love in the form of Pac-Man, so that's cute.
And then, this makes me happy, Puyo Puyo will be on Virtual Console in Japan, and it will have online multiplayer.
So, I guess Nintendo's sort of getting it, but not really.
Virtual Console and Online Multiplayer
You could play two people.
It was on the Sega Genesis, right?
I know, but Nintendo never adds anything to their games, so it must have been on the original.
They must have foreseen the internet long ago.
There were four-player versions, though, that came out on Nintendo 64 and Saturn.
I'm glad a landmark game such as Puyo Puyo... Yeah, it's like, Puyo Puyo is amazing, but of all the games, I don't understand.
But they like to keep us confused.
Maybe they're waiting to see how this does, and then they're going to go back and do everything else and re-release it for eight more dollars with online multiplayer and all that shit that we should have had the first time.
Right, DarkSakura?
Yes.
It's such a fun game.
Such a fun game.
And then, we have a little bit of something else.
We have Back to the Future on PS3.
It has a date.
It will be February 15th on the US PlayStation Network.
It will be $20, $19.99, and you get all five episodes on launch day.
The rest are going to be staggered, of course.
Pretty cool.
Good voice acting.
That dude sounds really dead on.
That's what I hear.
I watched an interview with him not too long ago.
It was pretty cool.
Awesome.
Yeah.
All right.
Let's get to the tweets.
Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
If you're not following us, why not?
All right.
We asked some questions earlier this week, kind of, you know, since we're coming up on our 400th episode, and, you know, lots of people are saying, yay, Gratz on 400, because I don't know what other video game podcasts that are weekly have gotten as high as 400.
I'm not sure.
If they're out there, I don't know of them.
You'll have to tell me.
So, you know, we're excited, and we have no plans to quit anytime soon, so who knows?
We might just make 500.
We'll see.
Anyhow, we were asking folks, what was your favorite moment of the past 400 episodes?
We asked that question on Twitter earlier this week.
The Seg said, when I was on the show.
of course, Deekman said Rob coming out to the OLR to go fans, I don't even remember that actually, I mean it had to happen at some point but I don't know, I was just kind of always the gay one, Rob boycotting the Xbox, I think that's when I got really mad at my Xbox, red ringing of death like three days after I bought it and then I think it red ringed again, I was really mad Loki's Mac rant that's like every week E3 2006 I think it was, my first show, sorry no dates
Alpha Cananagram says, one of them wasn't to go.
It's Pizza Man.
Do-do-do-do-do.
Remember that?
Good times.
That was one of the older shows.
Dark Tetsuya says, Karaoke Revolution, 69 and 120.
Those are the episodes number that's happening.
The April Fool's Day pre-show 2007 with the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show.
Remember that one?
And the death of the soundboard table in episode 307.
Remember when intern Drew knocked the whole damn table over?
Yes.
Yes, I remember that too.
That was awesome.
they've still never found his body then we asked what should happen in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio you know what should happen in the next 400 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio ZakuPilot256 said dance party come on that happens every week it's just after we've gone off the air KidmanProject says the inauguration of President Cat Blade3 says I want to see Rob get married and Jamie and Dan have a little demon baby that plays video games at age 1.5
It'll happen.
A demon baby will happen.
Actdeft says, what I hope happens is that you get to 1,000 episodes.
Congrats for making it this far and here's for 600 more.
But at 1,000, guys, it's seriously over because by the time we get to 1,000 episodes, let's see, if it took us almost 10 years to get to 400, we'll be getting close to like 45 by the time 1,000 comes out.
I mean, close to 50.
Yeah.
The holodeck ought to be out by then and then there's really no more need for OLR.
The OLR will cease to exist.
We won't be able to drag Rob out of the holodeck.
Exactly.
I'll be playing one-hand games in the holodeck.
What do you want to see in the next 400 episodes of OLR?
Alpha Cananigram says some on-air smack talk from Loki's kid.
It could happen.
If we go another 10 years, the kid could come in here and say something.
We'll see.
Let's see.
DarkTetsuya says three words.
Loki as Tingle.
or at very least the return of Rob's Mr. Spanky.
See, people wouldn't understand the Mr. Spanky joke anymore.
Mr. Spanky was really funny when he was a character in DDR.
But now it doesn't make sense.
We don't have the pictures anymore.
I feel like there needs to be a sock puppet to accompany that.
There kind of was.
You have to understand, DDR on the PC had downloadable characters.
It was kind of this neat thing.
and one of the characters was like this full-on bondage guy in outfits named Mr. Spanky.
And so I used to do an impersonation of Mr. Spanky on the show.
Like Voldo, basically, sounds like.
What's that?
Yeah, he was dressed like Voldo.
Yes, kind of.
But he was like Folsom Street Fair, big, burly, like, bear guy.
So, I don't know.
It's kind of like half Mexican wrestler, half pornography.
I don't know what to tell you.
RedTheHaze says, next 400 episodes?
Someone gets into a coma, Evil Twin steps in and steals the show, Robs then steps out of the shower, and it was all a dream.
It was all just a dream, just a horrible, horrible dream.
Actually, that tweet though makes me think that maybe I should give you guys a preview of the new theme song of OLR.
Let me load it here.
Let me see if I can get it.
Here we go.
So the new theme song for OLR.
Here you go.
Get it?
Because it was all a dream?
Get it, anyone?
We're old.
I thought that you were going to just put on the Daytona song.
Do you remember who shot JR?
Rob, do you remember who shot JR?
His sister.
Yep.
Who's his sister?
And who killed Laura Palmer?
I don't know.
I didn't watch Twin Peaks.
It was her dad possessed by Bob.
All right.
I just totally ruined Twin Peaks for all of you.
Actually, no, it's a great show.
I knew that going into watching Twin Peaks.
And by the way, both those shows, like 10, 20 years old.
No, like Twin Peaks is like fucking 20 years old at this point.
So like if you didn't already know, like I'm not going to save you from spoilers.
All right.
Moving on.
Let's see.
Let's get to some tweets.
Oh, back to the Twitter music.
Some like tweets for topics tonight.
Hatch71 tweeted us and says, Can't wait to hear the discussion on Sony's continued persecution of the hacking community.
I like the way he phrased that there.
The persecution.
Yeah, it gets worse, actually.
Really?
Do we have a story on it coming up later?
No, but I have one.
You want to sum it up for us?
Yes, they are actually now trying to go after everybody.
Literally.
Let's see here.
Find the exact one here.
Sony is looking for you.
It says apparently over at the website, PSX Scene, the latest court documents, because they've been putting up all the court documents, kind of like WikiLeaks.
They're pretty much going after everyone.
They're planning to subpoena several sites, including PSX Scene, YouTube, Twitter, PayPal, and Slashdot, in order to attempt to locate the whereabouts of Team Failoverflow and other hackers like Kakaroto, Wanekoko, and Graf Chocolo, Hermes, and Camus.
Those are a lot of the guys behind some of the custom firmwares and stuff.
They can go after them all they want, but the thing is, a lot of these guys aren't even from the US, and the DMCA does not apply to them.
And on top of all that stuff, too, if this court case comes out where this guy finds it okay to be able to jailbreak PS3s or whatever, then this isn't going to matter anyway.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I didn't mean to download the Kesha.
It just infected my computer.
I think I slept with someone and suddenly I got a Kesha infection.
That sounds like a disease.
I'm sorry.
I caught Kesha.
Here's something better.
If you want to follow up with that Sony is hunting everybody down.
Linux has been brought back to firmware 3.41.
Nothing public yet, but they've brought it back.
And not only is it brought back, but now it has full access to all the resources of the PlayStation 3.
So it's Linux better, I guess.
It's Super Linux!
Linux evolved.
Linux evolved.
It knows!
Big thanks to all the people that are tweeting about our 400th episode.
Really appreciate it.
There's a lot of you guys on Twitter that are like, yay, 400, episode 400, and so forth.
And I love all the pictures that they have of a giant enemy crab.
Wait, what?
Oh, for the Sony stories.
I was like, what?
I didn't get any giant enemy crabs on Twitter.
No.
MadCatz is making a replacement fight stick panel for Mortal Kombat
This is a tweet from our pal TigerClaw who always promotes our show.
We appreciate him.
He says, or I'm sorry, this story says that there is a Mortal Kombat Tournament Edition arcade stick, but I guess it has kind of like a unique layout to it.
So MadCatz came out and says there's going to be a replacement panel for the current Tournament Edition fight sticks that will let you have the arcade perfect controls.
Here's the deal.
Remember, like Street Fighter has like six buttons, but Mortal Kombat has like...
Well, it also has six if you count the run button, but they're in like a different arrangement.
It's like an X.
It's all pump-it-up style.
High-low punch, high-low kick.
Exactly.
And block is in the middle.
It kind of makes an X. And then run is kind of like awkwardly off to the side.
So there you go.
So that's kind of cool.
They're making a new overlay for that.
That's kind of awesome, actually.
All right.
And Sterlok is sending us a tweet about what we can do in the next few episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
The show just keeps getting better and better.
Here's to another 400 episodes of awesome.
Oh, you guys are awesome.
SJ100Matt says, we need t-shirts within the next 400 episodes.
We probably do.
Alright, that's it for Twitter topics tonight, except I have to point this out.
SalaciousPop, you know how I told you the guildies were listening to tonight's show?
Yeah, I just got a text there from one of our guildies there, Spike.
Raging at Kesha hate.
Which, by the way, have you seen that toy that they sell in Targets?
This little, uh, dancing little, uh, like a Valentine's Day doll that you can give somebody?
Speaking of which... Almost sounds like the real thing.
Look at that.
Alright, moving on.
How about some actual gaming news?
Back to more video games.
You may remember back Final Fight Double Impact where there was kind of this unannounced DRM in place.
Basically, you had to be connected to the internet in order to play the game.
So if you downloaded it and say you want to play it offline or if your internet cut out...
That sucks.
And then, of course, Capcom apologized for it and stuff.
But really what they were apologizing for is that they didn't tell you about it up front.
Because Bionic Commander 2 Rearmed has the same DRM in place.
You have to be connected to the internet in order to play this game.
They've done that because they don't want people sharing the game.
Apparently there is a way you can share the game up to five times by recovering your accounts and stuff like that.
and um so people buy a copy and then they share it with you know four other friends and stuff um and so now they have a note on the game listing it says note you must log into the PlayStation Network each time you play the game uh it says while Final Fight Double Impact um I guess they had like a online co-op mode Rearmed does not have an online co-op mode or an online mode at all it's an offline game so it's just kind of a dick move if you ask me
Well, distributing their game is also a dick move.
Yeah, but you know what, though?
The thing is, this is pissing a lot of people off.
Some people may not care about it and will purchase the game, but some people actually are just not purchasing the game regardless of they didn't even care about sharing the game.
Does the Xbox One have the same requirement?
I don't think they do.
Interesting.
You know, I could see where people would be mad.
Probably because you can't share the game back and forth.
Because what if, like, you have to, you know, what if your PS3 isn't hooked up to go online?
But then I think, well, you've got to go online to get the game.
So I guess not having an internet connection.
Well, okay, let's play Devil's Advocate here.
Say you take your PS3 to a friend's house and say, oh, I really want this game.
You go to their friend's house, hook it up to their internet connection, download the game, and then you take it home and you're like, crap, can't play it.
I realize things are different now but like I know back in the day like especially with the Dreamcast I used to have to run a gigantic cord across the entire house and hook it into my Dreamcast if I wanted to play so you know it wasn't always online and I think some people are still kind of doing that with PS3 even though it has built-in Wi-Fi just some people in some places are a little bit behind the times you know it happens
Especially if you're on Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi can be sketchy sometimes.
True.
You get drops every now and then.
Have they said what happens if you start up the game and then your Wi-Fi just cuts out?
Because I've had problems with my internet connection in the past.
I think you get kicked out of the game.
Oh my gosh, that's just like the Ubisoft one that they got torn a new one over.
Yeah.
This is Capcom, the new face of Capcom They do cool shit and then they start copying games and doing DRM schemes It's like, who are you, Capcom?
Seriously I don't even know you anymore
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Why aren't they getting in?
E3 Expo 2011 show management has placed caps on this year's media badge assignments due to the tremendous number of requests for media badges, etc.
We require that sites be fully launched, operational for six months, and that the website receives a minimum of 8,000 monthly unique impressions as a baseline for each media badge issued.
Quantcast.com, for example, currently has your site listed at approximately 10,000 monthly uniques for the month of December 2010.
Based on the above, we can approve two media badges for site that provided this info at this time.
Wait a second.
For every 8,000, though, but they only have 10,000.
That's not 16,000.
So maybe they're being nice or maybe they hit the cap for one and then I don't know.
So, but there's a lot of people out there that are really upset about this.
And, you know, to be honest, if OLR wanted to go, we probably wouldn't be able to under these conditions because I looked up our site on one of these.
I think we have like 800 hits or something, but that's like really wrong.
Like, I don't know what these sites use to measure.
Maybe you know more about this stuff, Salacious Pop.
Some of them, some of the websites that you do the tracking, you actually have to put an embed code or whatever, some sort of code that's in your webpages.
Ridiculous.
So, yeah, I mean, come on.
Our podcast gets downloaded more than that.
Plus, we're a podcast.
We don't have really a website that caters to... I mean, there's people that work very hard on our website, but mostly the website is a place for our show to be delivered.
And occasionally a little story that kind of kicks it back to old school LR about old school songs or whatever.
So...
These sites would not measure our download shows.
Now, granted, I haven't asked for an E3 pass.
I haven't had an official rejection, so it's hard to say.
I almost wonder if maybe I should register as broadcast media if I want to go.
But at the same time, seriously, all the other indie shows I know are getting told no, or they're getting one badge.
And I'm kind of like, well, if no one's freaking going to E3 this year, then fuck it.
I'll read about it on the internet.
Part of the fun of going to E3 is getting to see everybody.
Seriously, it was fun going to E3, but honestly, last year, I didn't miss it.
I watched all the press conferences, which is great.
I got to watch the press conferences.
That's better than going to E3 because I didn't get to watch the press conferences when I went to E3.
I didn't get invited to the press conferences, so you had to watch them streamed.
Honestly, streaming was great.
I got to watch that.
I got all the coverage I possibly wanted to, you know, absorb in there.
Didn't have to wait in lines for games.
Granted, yeah, I didn't get to play demos.
I didn't get to try out the 3DS and stuff.
But, eh, whatever.
You know, I don't really care.
There's two ways you can kind of look at this.
And one is that, you know, the big sites are getting bigger and the small sites are getting smaller.
Like, how are independents and startups supposed to compete if E3's not going to let them in because they're not already a big site?
I mean, this is just letting...
OneUp and IGN have more quote-unquote exclusives to mix in with the stories they copy from small sites.
Let's be real.
Where do they get their information?
They either get granted exclusives because they're big sites or they scour the internet up and down and get them from the little sites.
We know because we've had stories taken from our site and put on these sites before, oftentimes without credit.
I'm just saying, how did they get to be so big?
You know, because they have all that type of manpower, etc., etc., corporate funding, blah, blah, blah.
So on that end, it's kind of bullshit.
But on the other hand, I understand why E3 kind of needs to clamp down.
Because there are a lot of people getting in that probably shouldn't be getting in.
Especially as media.
I was going to say, yeah, but there's a lot of sales associates and stuff like that over at retail stores and stuff like that that are getting in that maybe don't really necessarily need to be there.
But, I don't know.
At the same time, it's just like...
But where do you draw the line?
Where do you draw the line?
I think if you meet the qualifications of having the business license and everything like that, you've obviously established yourself as a legitimate thing.
You should at least get one or two.
But I understand if Joe's PodunkGameBlog.com tries to get 20 badges, I get why that's a problem, especially with these stories about people are selling their badges and everything.
Way to go, few bad apples for ruining the barrel for the rest of us.
Truth be told, if you really wanted to go to E3, this goes to anybody.
If you really wanted to go to E3, you could still.
You know how you have to do it?
You pay $400 and you just get one of the badges.
It's not really an advertised thing, but you can totally go on there.
And they say like industry or whatever.
You could say you're a student or whatever.
If you're willing to throw $400 at them, they're going to let you in.
Why wouldn't they?
You know what I mean?
So again, despite the traffic our site gets, if I really wanted to go, I could pay $400 and go.
And honestly, media badges, even if you have a media badge and you're not an IGN or 1UP or something like that, you're just going to get treated like shit.
Seriously, they're like, oh, who are you?
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
We're not giving you an interview.
You may get a few scheduled meetings with some of the
I think the largest ones we got into like Sony, Bethesda and stuff like that but you know Sony Online not Sony Computer Entertainment but like they really don't give a shit about most of the press especially unless you're a big site because that's where the traffic is
You won't be invited to the closed door presentation where they're only allowing 10 people to see Cooking Mama 5, Gladiator Axe Battle.
You know, so you don't get those hush-hush meetings.
By the way, there's another problem I have with this.
I kind of think it's a little bit, I mean, the way they're measuring is also kind of the part that peeves me a little bit because it's really unfair to podcasters and so forth.
And plus, like I said, that website tells you we get 800 hits, unique hits.
I could whip up stats that tell you the number is much higher, like astoundingly higher.
And look, I'm not trying to have an EP conversation here or what have you.
I just, I have facts to back it up.
We have the number to get everybody in this room into E3 if they would take our stats, which are, I believe, more accurately measured than any of this stuff.
But, you know, whatever.
Anyhow, so this isn't a me, me, poor me, because if this is the way it is, you know, E3, it's a private show.
They can do what they want.
But if nobody's going, then at the same time, what do we owe E3?
I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
can't afford a big booth at this show they can't afford to compete with the big guys maybe this is a week for the indie shows to celebrate the indie games and maybe maybe that's something we'll have to consider for this year
so uh also I wanted to say this I kind of don't want to spend $400 to go to E3 or whatever whatever it is I mean again to be fair I haven't even tried yet I haven't got told no yet if none of my friends are going I'm just gonna fucking go to PAX like that's where it's at you know that's where all the gaming people are and you know PAX at this point is you get to see a lot of the same demos that are already at E3 and it's more of a nerd convention and so forth there you go PAX is way more fun than E3 mhm
I kind of miss what they did in 2006, I think is what it was, during E3.
Where it was like, hey, guess what?
We have this awesome demo on the show floor for Lost Planet.
And guess what?
It's also on Xbox Live Marketplace.
Go check it out.
You don't have to go to E3.
You can check out some of the demos that are going to be on the show floor right here.
Just get a chance to play them.
That's awesome.
We will see what develops in this story.
Speaking of develops.
What's that?
I still have a dev console that still has access to a certain net that are partnered with different publishers out there.
A lot of E3 demos pop up on tube.
I bet we hear more information on this before the show actually hits because, again, you go look at some Twitters out there.
There's a lot of negative buzz on it right now, so I don't think E3 is going to like all that negative buzz.
They don't give a shit because guess what?
At the end of the day, they get their coverage on all the big sites, and you know what?
They don't give a shit.
Indie blogs might be little, but they're loud.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It actually is from SNK.
It's not Nintendo related.
SNK Arcade Classics Zero for PSP is... Excuse me, I got ahead of... Radio's biggest nightmare.
I know, right?
It's supposed to be released on April 21st.
This one is basically going to be 20 SNK games that came out before there was Neo Geo.
One of them being Psycho Soldier.
I could just tell from the cover because it was the game that Athena and Kenzo came from.
I love that game because she sings through the whole thing.
It's pretty fun.
Anyway.
Icari Warriors, Athena, Psycho Soldier, POW All kinds of cool games It's going to be really, really neat I love me some old school SNK So here's a list of... It looks like most of the games, or all of them maybe We have Icari Warriors, Dogon...
Douglas Silken, Ikari Warriors 2, Ikari 3, The Rescue, Athena, Psycho Soldier, Sasuke vs. the Commander, Tank, ASO, Prehistoric Island in 1930, Bermuda Triangle, Vanguard 2, HAL 21, Marvin's Maze, Guerrilla War, POW, Street Smart, SAR Search and Rescue, Touchdown Fever, Gold Medalist, and Super Championship Baseball, the Overseas Edition.
Cool stuff.
Rob, you totally have to find the music for Psycho Soldier.
I'll have to find it later because I'm setting up for our next segment.
Okay.
But what's your favorite game in that pack?
Because you're a Neo Geo fangirl and why?
You know, I love Psycho Soldier even though it's actually really not that great of a game.
It just makes me laugh because you're singing through the whole thing.
It was one of the first arcade games that I'll digitize singing to go on continuously through the whole game.
Mm-hmm.
It was such a fun little bad game.
Well, that and I also have to add Ikari Warriors, you know.
I love Ikari Warriors.
That game is so awesome.
It was incredibly glitchy on the NES.
Man, making that cartridge dirtier made it more fun.
It's like, ooh, what glitches are going to happen now?
Alright, since it is episode number 400, we thought we would do something special for you guys.
We're going to do a little game here.
We haven't done it in quite a while, but it's time for us to play it and bring back tonight.
It is time for... Video Game Match Game!

The way a video game match game works is that we're going to get two contestants, one via Skype and one in the chat room, and they are going to do their best to match the answers provided by our celebrity panel here in studio.
Most number of points wins, and we actually have a prize to give away tonight.

Next to the vault.
Alright, next up, Arcadian42.
Hello, people of Earth.
And then finally, well, we have Sky.
Hi, I have no mic.
Sky doesn't know how to run a radio show because he has no mic.
Obviously, when he talks off mic, you can't hear him.
He says he hates all of you, by the way.
Finally, Alan.
I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
Obscure match game reference, sorry.
Let's get to the match game itself.
Lovely introductions.
Alright, I got Frisbee up to speed here.
So here we go.
Question number one.
Kaijudo, you're still there, right?
Yep, I'm here.
Okay, thank God.
I wouldn't want to lose a caller.
Here comes question number one.
Now, Kaijudo, this is very important.
Don't yell out the answer.
Just think about it.
Because our folks here in studio have to also come up with their answers.
And we will say ding as we're finishing.
I will ask you to fill in the blank when we're ready.
Alright?
I gotcha, just like the game show.
You got it, just like the game show.
You have to write it on a little card.
You just make believe.
Alright, here we go.
Question number one.
Loki congratulated his co-hosts on a 400th episode and a job well done.
He then asked, can I finally get paid, please?
Rob and Jamie looked at him and said, well, we never said we'd pay you in dollars, so here, we're paying you in blank.
Well, we never said we'd pay you in dollars, so here we're paying you in blank.
This is a hard one.
I'm going to say... Ding.
All right.

Frisbee says, we're paying you in big boobs.
I don't know how you pay someone in boobs, but we'll find out.
He's doing a little dance to try and demonstrate.
All right, so Microsoft Points and big boobs.
Let's go around and see if there is any matches here.

They're terrible.
Oh, man.
Not a match.
Arcadian, we are paying Loki in?
Programs for a Mac computer.
Programs for a Mac computer.
Also not a match.
And my answer was, we are paying Loki in porn.
Also not a match.
So the score is 0-0.
Good job so far, Kaijudo and Frisbee.
All right.
But that's okay, Kaijudo.
You got three more questions to try and break this tie.
So you ready for them?
I'm ready.
Alright, Kaijudo, that was just a warm-up.
It's okay.
Alright, here we go.
Question number two.
Jamie was excited to hear that not just Final Fantasy IV, but SNK Classics were coming to the PSP.
Too bad her husband Dan sold the PSP yesterday to buy some blank.
Not just Final Fantasy 4, but SNK Classics are coming to the PSP.
Too bad Dan sold the PSP yesterday to buy some blank.
Uh, Ding.
Ding.
Ding slash Spop says Arcadian.
Thinking.
Waiting on an answer from Frisbee as well.
This is tough.
Dan, DarkSakura's husband Dan, sold the PSP for some... Alright, there you go.
Alright, we're waiting on an answer from Frisbee in our chatroom.
He's lagging a little bit.
Of course, there is that delay.
I'm trying to look at Orange Lounge to see.
Paying Loki in boom boom dollars.
Nice.
Alright, need an answer.
Hurry up, Frisbee.
Kaijudo, you have an answer, I'm hoping, right?
Yes, I have an answer.
Alright, there we go.
We got an answer from Frisbee.

Which, unfortunately, is also not a match.
Because you had meatballs earlier, so you had to buy the meat.
Yeah.
Alright.
So, after two questions, the score is zero to zero.
It's eyeballs.
Oh, Kaijudo, Kaijudo, Kaijudo.
Alright, we'll see, though.
You have a chance to catch up.
Here you go.
You ready for question number three?
Alright, you can do it.
Here we go.
Question number three.
Rob was sad to hear that he'd need 8,000 listeners to get into E3 this year.
He wrote an appeal to the E3 board saying, Dear E3, give me a media badge.
I may not have 8,000 listeners, but I sure as hell have 8,000 blank listeners.
You need 8,000 people to go to E3 this year.
We may not have 8,000 listeners, but I sure as hell have 8,000 blank.
Ding.
Ding.
Ooh, that was fast.
Everybody just dinged in real quick there.
All right.
Kaijudo, do you think you know an answer?
I'm still waiting on Frisbee, but are you ready?
Yes, I have an answer.
All right, let's see.
I'm waiting on Frisbee.
Need... I wonder if he's getting help.
All right.
All right.
All right, here we go.
There we go.
All right.
Here we go.
I may not have 8,000 listeners, Kaijudo, but I sure as hell have 8,000.
You have 8,000 in WoW gold.
8,000 in WoW gold.
All right.
And Frisbee says, I sure as hell have 8,000 players in my guild.
First off, you're really wrong, but that's okay.
I like that they're both WoW references.
All right, here we go.
I sure as hell have 8,000.
Let's go to Loki.
I sure as hell have 8,000.
Inches of E-peen.

Rage points.
What's a rage point?
I don't know.
I'm not the angry one.
He is.
He's the angry one, Arcadian.
I'm not angry.
Oh, my turn.
I sure as hell have 8,000.
Gold!
I said gold and I meant Warcraft.
That's a match.
Kaijudo is on the board.
One point.
Kaijudo matches on 8,000 gold.
There it is.
So it is tied up.
One zip.
No, that's not a tie.
This is why I'm not a game show host.
It is not tied up anymore.
I'm just so used to these things ending in a draw.
It is now Kaijudo pulling ahead one to nothing.
Kaijudo, there is still one more question to go.
You have to maintain your lead.
Frisbee, this is your chance to catch up.
You ready?
Alright.
Here we go, Frisbee.
Here we go, Kaijudo.
Last question.
The listeners of OLR sat in the chat room skipping the Super Bowl to listen to OLR's 400th episode.
They all agreed that the show was going fine, but that a landmark show such as this was in desperate need of more blank.
It is the landmark 400th episode, and everyone agrees that the show is going fine, but this show is in desperate need of more blank.

Kajudo, Dragon Age
I got some codes for a sneak peek at the Dragon Age 2 demo that comes out on Friday you have to have a code to get in so you're getting one of those codes
Oh, thanks.
Just play a little Big Planet 2.
If you ever wanted to develop your own games and you got lost with Game Maker 8 or RPG Maker is just a little too confusing for you, then pick up Big Planet 2 and you'll be able to make the games that you've always wanted to play.
and play GoldenEye Source.
I keep pumping that game.
You guys need to try that.
I will put it on my list right after I finish up with the Dragon Age 2 demo.
Alright, Kajudo, I need you to send an email to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com right away, okay?
So I have your email.
Got it.
Alright, do it right now.
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
Alright, thank you.
Later.
You're welcome.
All right, congrats, Chaijudo, and congrats, Frisbee.
We're going to open up the Skype line for more calls a little later on tonight, but don't call in right now.
We're going to get to some more news stories.
We're not quite ready for the rest of the calls just yet.
So let's go to another news story from Loki.
Hope you guys enjoyed Match Game.
THQ is talking a little bit about their sales of the UDraw tablet, their peripheral that kind of resembles something that you might see with Mario Paint.
They've sold 1.2 million UDraw units in the third quarter of their fiscal year, of course.
And, of course, they want more UDraw games.
they're actually looking to kind of change up their business strategy a bit trying to step away from some of the kids and I guess movie cartoon based stuff that they have coming out THQ does a lot they have like Nintendo license so they do a lot of Spongebob and crap at Nicktoons and all sorts of stuff that comes out with that
Which would be good, because I don't like selling it each year.
Have you ever made anything that's been really good for everyone?
The You Don't Know Jack game?
For everyone?
Saints Row, Red Faction, a lot of the Volition stuff through them is pretty cool.
UFC, people like UFC.
So they do have the mature stuff, but as far as casual family stuff,
I just remember back in the day 10-15 years ago they were putting out all these crap games that no one seemed to like.
What was that movie?
Home Alone.
Some sort of Home Alone.
Oh god, Home Alone was terrible.
The games were not fun.
Alright.
Well, those U-Draws seem to be doing pretty well.
I mean, I see them all over now.
Yeah, they're doing pretty well and it'd be nice when there's more software out there.
If they did a Mario Paint game that used U-Draw, that'd be pretty awesome.
Do you think it might be something Nintendo tries to show off at the Big Expo later this year?
I think it would be nice.
Thanks for watching!
Now, before you get all PO'd that you're going to have to buy this character, it is going towards a good cause.
The money that they raise from this character will be donated to charities devoted to breast cancer research, and that is according to The Behemoth, because obviously, February is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and you see a lot of pink ribbons that people wear, so what better than a pink knight?
I like this.
This is good news for gaming.
This is a great story.
So check this out.
Even if you, you know, just on principle, check it out.
They're so cute.
I know, and the Pink Knight gets a lollipop.
Yeah.
Awesome.
By the way, the Pink Knight will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
Just hasn't happened just yet, but it will happen hopefully this month.
So check that out.
I think that's a great cause.
Good story.
Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open up the mailbag and we're going to dive in headfirst to the mailbag.
DarkSakura's going to pull out a few emails and read them for us live on air.
Just make sure she doesn't read the two guys that just sent me their emails' addresses.
Well, we don't have them yet.
Oh.
So, first email.
And now my voice decides to go out.
Hi, OLR.
I just wanted to pop you guys a message to wish you congratulations on reaching episode 400.
It's difficult enough just to listen to or watch 400 episodes of something, but here you guys have successfully put forward the dedication and drive to broadcast that many truly an awesome achievement.
I also do need to congratulate him on his fantastic grammar
I just love the name Snake 361 as the title.
It's very clever.
Hey, if you can't listen to all 400 episodes of OLR, I don't have time to play 359 other Snake games, okay?
Thank you for watching!
which I wasn't here for.
That's true.
No, I was here for the fourth episode.
You came back for the fourth.
You were gone like the second or third.
That was the Harry Potter closet.
Yes, anyhow.
Okay.
Ah, memories.
Was that the Mel episode?
Did he come out?
He came out pretty early on.
Yes.
It's a great time every time, and I've enjoyed every minute that I've spent with OLR.
Thanks, Jamie, Matt, and Rob for being awesome enough to bring us Orange Lodge Radio.
And also, if you've ever participated in chat or called into the show, thank you as well for helping to make the show what it is.
You'll be hearing from me again soon, and hopefully I'll see many of you at PAX East 2011.
Stop by my booth and say hello.
Still awaiting the budget for Golden Girls Death Squad, AaronYYR.
I don't know if he wants us to say his last name.
You know they do have those crowdsourcing websites now.
That's true.
I have to look into that.
We reported on that last week.
That's awesome.
Thank you for the well wishes.
Appreciate it.
And best of luck with Snake 361 and you better come on the show and plug it.
Yes.
Next email.
Greetings, OLR.
Congratulations on reaching your quadricentennial episode.
I've been listening to your show on and off for years now, and every time I come back, it's like returning to old friends.
Yeah, we're getting old.
Maybe you.
I still look gorgeous.
Bitch.
Yeah, so?
You guys always manage to brighten up a dull bus ride in the morning.
Oh, I'm glad I'm good for something.
I'm never able to listen live due to the time difference.
I'm in the UK and I doubt tonight will be any different.
But I hope it's a fun show and I'll be looking forward to it in the podcast feed.
Hope you lot are around for many more shows to come.
Catastrophic Moggy.
Thank you very much.
I like the name.
That's very clever.
Hey, DJ Ranma S here.
I tried to round up the staff to wish you guys happy 400, but we had a slight problem.
So here, enjoy.
It's an MP3.
That means I have to go in the mailbag and pull that up, don't I?
Yes, you do.
All right, we'll come back to that.
I'm going to pull that up right now.
Alright, congratulations on your 400th episode.
As a long-time listener and a first-time writer, I thought I would share one of my favorite memories from listening to OLR.
Although I cannot pinpoint when exactly I started listening, sometime in 2006, my favorite memories include a wonderful discussion about Uno on Xbox Live as the words draw for bitch have graced every game I have played ever since.
Keep up the amazing work.
Hey Kuro!
Huh?
Kuro!
Yes?
Have you heard from Sailor Flare?
Um, actually, I haven't.
Do you know what happened to her?
I have no idea.
She said she's supposed to meet us online and record the bumper for OLR.
It's their 400th episode.
Do you want to give her a call?
Um, I tried calling her, but I don't know where she lives.
She can't get a signal or anything like that.
I sent her a text, and hell, I've gotten on the roof of my house and said it smokes.
You've got mail.
I was just about to say, that's where that little bee thing on your computer is.
Yeah, let's check it out and see what it is.
Hey Ranma, hey Kuro, it's Sailor Flare.
Listen, I would be with you guys right now, but there are some rabid, angry fanboys, and they are attacking the studio, and I need to do my part to ward them off.
Moon Tiara Magic!
Um, I didn't think it was possible for fanboys to find studios.
That's, um...
I think we need to find a new location.
I don't even want to remember this happened.
That makes two of us so.
Orange Lounge Radio, happy 400.
We gotta find new real estate now.
Alright, see you later.
Congratulations.
Love you guys.
That was nice.
That was so nice.
Only you guys could gay up this show more than I can with a Sailor Moon reference.
We have two more emails.
And by the way, thanks guys.
This comes from Mike.
It's subject 3DS.
I was extremely happy to hear the Final Fantasy 4 might be getting a re-release on the 3DS.
It would be the main reason to get a 3DS for me.
It has always been a three-way tie for me between 7, 6, and 4 for my favorite Final Fantasy.
Every console I have bought was to play a Final Fantasy.
PlayStation for 7, PS2 for 10, and a PS3 for 13.
I just hope that Squeenix will fix the shitstorm known as 14.
I played it and it has potential, just not in its current form.
The story is just as awesome as 11, but everything else is what it holds back.
It might have been adequate pre-wow, but now it's either clone wow or don't even try.
Thanks for reading and making me laugh until I puke when the podcast is updated.
you're welcome whatever you do you don't have to share pictures of that please yeah you know what though as far as like all the MMOs have to copy WoW not necessarily DC Universe seems to be doing okay and it's very different than WoW just so you know so there you go
Oh, and Kaijudo, yes You got the right email Okay, last one Alright This is from Rababa I got the following note from PSN this week Why do I keep thinking of Dead or Alive on pause?
Sports Illustrated 3D Coming soon Visit the video store now for an exclusive sneak peek At the 3D Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues Featuring the hottest models from around the world Offer available to US residents only

The internet is for porn
So I really appreciate you guys kind of making up our extended family here at OLR.
And, you know, what else can I say?
You guys kind of keep us motivated.
All those days where I'm like, you know, I could be doing something else on Sunday nights.
I haven't been goth dancing.
Yeah.
in 10 years because of OLR.
I could go goth dancing again if I'd quit OLR.
But then I get some email that's just awesome, you know, and it's like, oh, yeah, that's why we do OLR.
And to watch Loki play Gal Gun.
That's the other reason I do OLR.
All right.
Even though we are all sunshiny, happy, rainbowy, and, you know, fluffy kittens, it just wouldn't be OLR if there wasn't a little bit of angst in the form of the FUs of the week.
I really didn't have an F you until, uh, tonight.
Um, I, F you, and this is gonna, F you to political correctness.
I said it.
F you to people getting offended over shit that has nothing to do with them.
That's it.
Alright.
Moving on.
Loki, your F you of the week.
F you not being able to read Japanese, so I hit replay level instead of continue.
I just don't understand that.
I don't want to play this level again.
My F you of the week goes to the fact that this weekend just flew by.
Like, yesterday I'm at work, it feels like, and now it's all, ah, I gotta do it all again tomorrow.
So, whatever.
At least I like my job, so, you know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And Salacious Pop?
Sort of a boring answer, but just F you to the economy.
Hey, I think a lot of people are with you there.
Alright, there it is, the FUs of the week.
Let's move on to just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, which is going to be interesting tonight.
All right, we'll do the Skype line as long as we can tonight.
We might have to put a time limit on calls tonight, just so you know, because if the match game was any indication, we got a lot of people wanting to call in tonight.
So we might have to do a little time limit.
All right, Loki, sorry, not FU, news story.
The movie site First Showing is reporting that there's a Zombies Ate My Neighbors film in development.
Yay!
Apparently based on the old 16-bit game, which I forgot is actually developed by LucasArts.
That would be awesome if LucasArts put that out.
That game was great.
There needs to be trampoline levels.
It's a flick being described as a horror comedy.
More specifically, John Hughes meets Judd Apatow meets George A. Romero.
Honestly, I think it'd be an excellent movie.
The whole thing was a parody on kind of the horror genre anyways.
And it was absolutely ridiculous with like 50 foot tall babies and zombies and werewolves.
And I think there were aliens in there as well.
That's a game that I should have played but just missed completely and I still have no idea why.
But I definitely remember the hype around it.
It's on Virtual Console.
It's awesome.
I don't have a Wii, but yeah.
Wait, did you just pimp Nintendo's Virtual Console?
I think you did.
Well, they put out some games.
They just stopped now.
I had to call you on it.
I'm sorry.
Well, fine.
Download the ROM.
Fuck paying them money.
There you go.
Now there's the Loki answer I was looking for.
I think it could make a cool movie.
I think if they kind of don't try to keep it as the video game, I think the name has enough recognition.
Just keep the story.
Don't even bother.
I think there's enough people that just would have no idea there was even a game that exists that would go see the movie.
And then you would get the game again because it would tie into the movie.
But, of course, movie tie-in games always suck.
And here's the thing, though, about it, though, is you don't even need to, like, have game times, because the whole thing is just basically a spoof of, like, the horror genre.
It's basically, it's like Monster Squad, actually, a little bit, because it's all the shit, horrible things that can happen in, like, horror movies all happening at once.
There's zombies attacking, there's evil dolls, there's werewolves, there's giant babies, there's, I think there were giant ants and stuff, like, all sorts of crazy shit going down all at once.
what you need well it seems like the theme of it was all of the um all of the really awful horror movies that came out in the 50s that were all metaphors for communism the giant ants and whatever yeah exactly yeah right all right i played through that whole game that had like i think there was like over 100 levels in the game it was ridiculous
Alright, one more story for you guys, and it's about the Beatles, or at least one of them.
Ringo Starr, one of the ones that's still left and still kicking.
Ringo Starr apparently has...
registered a trademark that indicates that his name has been trademarked.
Ringo, his name, has been trademarked for downloadable computer games via the internet and wireless devices, toys, namely toy vehicles, plush toys, pet toys, and skateboards.
So I have no idea if Ringo is going to start getting into skateboarding.
Daddy, I want the Ringo vehicle.
Which seems a little odd to me.
I would understand if there was a Ringo music game or something coming, like a drumming on your iPad type of thing.
But skateboards and pet toys?
Clearly he's trying to protect the name from something.
That's what this strikes me as.
Ringo could kind of be like, I don't know, like a new ring toss game or something.
I don't know.
Roll with me here.
It could be some new game and maybe he doesn't want to lose that on his name.
So maybe that's why he trades market.
But then again, are you allowed to trademark something if you don't have a plan to use it?
I guess so.
There's a lot of squatters and so forth.
By the way, of course, the attorney has been asked on why Ringo Starr trademarked the name and no comment.
No comment.
The last time Ringo was heard in a video game news story, it was with the Beatles rock band.
He was talking to Jimmy Fallon about it and said, the graphics are great, I love the game, I love the music, but it's for young folk.
His 15th studio album came out last year called Why Not?
Why not?
Make a video game?
Why not?
Ringo skateboards?
Sure, why not?
There you go.
Would you buy a Ringo skateboard, Slicerspot?
If I didn't have the self-esteem to buy the Tony Hawk one, then yes.
Gotta keep the bar low sometimes.
Alright, well of course there's the folks in chatroom that are coming up with all these Ringo games.
DarkTest Studio says RingoStars Pro Skater.
Frisbee says RingoStars Wasteland.
Frisbee, RingoStar Underground.
SSJ100Matt is bringing up that Sarah Palin filed a copyright on her name.
Does that mean they can keep making the Nalen Palin?
Or is that illegal now?
The Palin porns.
Have you seen these?
Sarah Palin like rejuvenated the porn industry.
Did you know that?
Well, there's that one actress that looks exactly like her that's like, yes, this is my moment.
Who, Tina Fey?
Not Tina Fey.
But she could do this Nalen Palin and then just roll right over and do the 30 Rock porn.
Well, they make those really awful Deer Hunter games for PC that are like $9.99 brand new
They always come out with a new version.
She should just license that.
Except it'll be Moose Hunter.
Sarah Palin's Moose Hunter.
Available.
Or Wolf Hunter.
But that one would have to be a helicopter game.
DungeonBuster in our chat room is suggesting Ringo ate my neighbors.
That's a possible video game.
All right, Skype line is open.
Orange Launch Radio on Skype or our Skype line phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Please don't be offended if we move through your calls quickly tonight because I think there's a lot of people that want to get in.
So, Loki, while we wait for the calls coming because there is about a minute and a half delay between time we say something and the time folks hear it as it encodes through the interwebs.
Loki, do you have any quick last-minute stories for us tonight?
um yeah let's see other than uh we talked a little bit about how Linux is making its return to 3.41 uh you can also get Linux via the custom firmware 3.55 it's a bestest it's not quite as awesome as the uber Linux that's on 3.41 but uh you know beggars can't be choosers I guess um let's see other fun stuff we can talk about here um
Again, the phone number is 1-877-GAME, O-L-R, G-A-M-E-O-L-R Or, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio And the phones are starting to light up Let's get to them Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hi, this is Red the Haze from Houston, Texas Red the Haze, congrats, you're the first one to get through tonight What's on your mind, buddy?
Yeah, I'd like to greet you a happy Chinese New Year If you didn't notice, it's this weekend
Oh, that's right.
I totally, it slipped my mind.
You know, I had an ex who was Chinese and it was kind of, you know, it didn't go so well.
So I've had to block a lot of that out of my mind.
No, it's okay.
You know, it's just, you know.
I'm not Chinese, I was in a club last night where they had line dancers there Line dancing?
Yeah, line dancing, like dragon dancing, you know, but it was kind of weird.
I was thinking because you said you were from eastern Texas, maybe they do the whole, like, you know, country line dancing, the whole, like, electric slide and all that stuff.
Yee-haw!
We got a lot of Asians down there, so we got an Asian thing down there.
That's all right.
We live in northern California.
It's the same story here.
All right.
So what else is on your mind tonight, buddy?
Yeah, regarding to the Super Bowl, I was talking to my girlfriend who works for a Canadian cable provider, and she's been getting a lot of calls about the Super Bowl up there, and it seems that a lot of people from Canada are complaining that they're not getting the U.S.
commercials.
Weird.
Now, you gotta tread lightly with Super Bowl chat around here because that is our competition tonight for our landmark episode.
But Canada getting ripped off.
Canada getting the big shaft.
Well, now that's interesting to me.
So why would Canada... Because, you know, what did Canada do to deserve that?
Do you find big shafts interesting?
I do.
Why did Canada... What did Canada do to deserve that?
They just sit up there and they're all peaceful, making maple...
They're free healthcare.
Yes, exactly.
They're hurting no one.
If Doritos spent $30 million on a commercial, they should see it.
Exactly.
It's that popular these days.
Come on.
Well, maybe something's going on where the Canadian broadcaster wanted to sell their own damn commercials.
I mean, can't your Canadian friends just go on YouTube and see the same shit?
I mean, that's how I watch stupid bull commercials.
Yeah, that's what they've been instructed to tell them.
Just go on the internet.
It just comes off as that.
The internet exists for that kind of thing, you know?
Also for porn.
Well, now here's my question.
Was Betty White in any of the commercials this year?
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.
I was playing Dead Space and listening to you guys.
Go ahead.
I'd like to congratulate you guys on the 400th episode.
I've been a long-time listener, first-time caller.
My favorite line.
Yes.
Excellent.
Well, thank you so much for calling the show.
Really appreciate it.
Quickly, what video game... Oh, you already said Dead Space.
What other video games have you been playing this week?
Mag.
I don't want to trash talk about it.
I play with people regularly on it.
I've spent 300 hours on it.
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Mag 2 on the way, isn't there?
No, we're playing on the PS3.
We're going to jump to Homefront, which sounds like a better deal, considering that the multiplayer has better incentives.
It's not Call of Duty.
I have to keep an eye out for that.
In the meantime, I've got to get to other calls, but thank you so much for the call.
Congrats on getting through first on your first call.
That's quite an accomplishment.
Take care, buddy.
Thank you.
STO 100 Matt in our chat room is confirming Betty White was in one of the commercials.
So now I need to know.
Who won the volleyballs?
By what score?
Should I ask?
I don't.
I think the green people.
The cheese heads?
Yes.
I think the cheesy people won by like three points or something.
Okay.
Yes.
Do you have bets going on the Super Bowl or something?
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Laundry.
Watch.
I totally probably got that wrong and everybody in chat is going to be like, Rob, you're so dumb.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio SSJ100Matt says the NFL Network commercial with the different TV shows wait a minute, does that count?
showing like a two I think showing a two second clip of Hot in Cleveland might not count although I will say that show is pretty fucking funny but meanwhile we have another show on the line or another show, another call on the line hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Oh my god, Rob.
Rob, it's Ranma.
I have a bone to pick with you right now.
Okay.
Where do you get off saying that we gave up the show?
No, you have no right to do that.
Don't make me get nasty up in here because I will, girlfriend.
I will.
Oh, no, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
You did not call into this show.
Yes, I did.
Don't make me because I got my hag right here.
Yo, we will bring it, sister.
Girl, I will pull that weave.
I will pull that weave right on out of your head.
I'll rip that pulse while I'm picking it already is, alright?
I'm not the one.
I am not the one.
Oh, girl.
You have to... Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
Hold my earrings, alright?
Hold my earrings.
You have to admit, the Sailor Moon thing, a little bit gay.
A little bit gay.
And I can say that.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Alright, you ever play RPGs and you give the characters names?
I tend to name them after the various anime characters and so forth.
Now, what are the craziest names you've given the characters?
My Final Fantasy 1 party was probably fuck, fart, poop, and ass.
Speaking of Final Fantasy, my roommate's playing through the four heroes of light.
He named the main hero Dipshit and named the princess Gonorrhea.
He's at the scene where the king tells him, Dipshit, go find my Gonorrhea right now.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
I think Oregon Trail is the first game of people of this generation that really were able to do that with the names but in Final Fantasy 7 if you give Aerith in particular the most raunchiest name you could think of, lols for days you will get your money's worth
It seems like the trend is like you get the lulls off of any of the Final Fantasy games.
Like my roommate played Tactics.
I don't know what the character's name was.
I think it was Head.
One of the scenes where the guard's like, you will give us Head now.
And what possessed this question?
I don't know, I'm just, we're just watching TV, you know, and my roommate's telling me he's playing the game and he's showing me this, and I'm like, I wonder if the OLR peeps have ever done this.
I was just throwing something out there for good conversation.
No, it's all good.
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm tearing up a little bit.
Because Flaming Clint just died.
Dude, I cheered.
It's really tragic because I used Flaming Clint as my healer in the party.
I can't believe that Sephiroth just went and stabbed Flaming Clint right through the abdomen.
It's just...
It's just wrong.
Right in the middle.
It's just wrong.
Flaming Clint, I love you.
Are you happy now?
You wrong, man.
You wrong.
Funny, but wrong.
Anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Ranma?
Not necessarily.
Oh, um, Sakura-chan.
What?
Hi.
Jovedaya says hi.
Hi.
Happy birthday, Jovedaya.
Happy birthday.
She heard.
All right.
We got to get some more calls, Ranma.
Have a good one, buddy.
All right.
1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
Skype line is open right now.
Look what happens on calls.
Like, look.
Every gamer has a voice and sometimes that voice takes us right to the crapper.
Did you hear my crying in the other room?
Oh, yes, you did.
You don't have family over to you.
Oh, good.
The kids aren't visiting today?
Oh, just Jamie?
Oh, well, screw her.
All right.
Well, he can't do that right now because we're doing the show.
Sorry.
I love our chatters.
Brad from Prod Culture in chat just said, so he pierced Flaming Clit?
Oh, God, I love the listeners.
Hi, it's Marissa Hi Marissa Welcome to the program
What's on your mind?
Hey, how are you guys doing?
It sounds like fun over there.
I'm good, but I'm... I had an emotional moment a minute ago, but I'm all better.
I just, I figured out... Seriously, Rob was shaking and crying.
I know, I did.
I just figured out how to unlock the safe and get Smelly dumped to join my party.
So I'm okay now.
You mentioned Oregon Trail earlier.
You have to join my trail.
It actually sounds kind of dirty.
It's a freaking Facebook team.
I have you join my party so you can die of dysentery.
It's a Facebook game now.
I actually tried the game on Facebook this week and it's weird.
It's not what I remember.
It's so different.
It's trying to invite your friends and it is exactly what I thought.
You can name your party members after Facebook friends and then spam their walls when they die of dysentery and so forth.
All they're trying to do is milk the Facebook point system because basically to survive the game you have to give them actual money.
But
I don't have anything of an important relevance to say other than typing jokes and boob references right now but I want to wish you a happy 400th and I'm so excited your show makes my week and you two have to come down here soon and visit
I really do.
I need to come stay with you on the 13th.
I may have a week off in June suddenly where I'm doing nothing and I had planned to come to LA.
Oh, what an invitation it is.
Yeah, I don't have shit to do, I guess.
I'll see you.
This news bulletin just in, E3 has been moved into Marissa's pants.
Yay!
Yay, it's a party!
Oh, and by the way, Marissa, I'm very sorry to do this to you.
Oh.
What is this?
What are you doing?
Why didn't you warn me before you heard me?
Take that, Vuvuzela.
By request of the chat room.
What is that?
I didn't get it.
It's her stupid Vuvuzela app on the iPhone that I hate, and whoever made that can die in a boat fire.
Thank you, SSJ100Matt.
She's going to have to play the melodica for me sometime.
I've been playing my melodica.
I love it.
I'll play it on the show.
I hope that you need to learn how to play Aerith's theme on the melodica so I can cry.
But Marissa, I hope you're able to come up to the show and bring your assets, your big, voluptuous brain, of course I mean, back to the show.
All right, well, congrats.
And yeah, may there be 400 more.
Thank you.
We'll try.
We'll be old, but we'll try.
Marissa, have a wonderful night.
Thanks for calling.
You too.
Chat soon.
Bye.
Ciao.
I played my melodica on air.
I have wanted a melodica forever, and Marissa got me a melodica, and I love it to death.
Can you play chopsticks?
Okay, wait.
She's going to try and play chopsticks.
Here we go.
Come on.
You can do it.
I don't remember.
I don't remember how to play this.
I'm throwing up the horns.
You need to go to rock.
You know what?
You need to write the new OLR theme song on the melodica.
Alright.
Now you need to put that thing away.
DarkSakura, put it away.
Jamie, put it away.
I was trying to play Final Fantasy stuff.
Butterfly, Dom Dom Aram, any of the Romani classics.
Yeah, can you do Dom Dom Aram, Dom Dom Aram.
All right, look, we got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
You guys are old.
I don't know if I should be talking to you.
Hi, Bobby.
How are you, my friend?
I'm doing good.
I'm only $278, $400.
It's like past the hill.
I know.
We fell off the earth, actually.
We're that far past the hill.
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.
And you notice how I was like, I was going to call in next and then Ranma called.
And so I let somebody else go in between because I know I can't follow that up.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, Ranma always brings a certain something special to the show.
I don't know what else to say.
But I will say, I also own a melodica.
Do you?
Oh, God.
Yes.
Well, now we might have this whole week off.
Bobby, we need a duet.
We're going to have this week off in June where we're not doing anything, so maybe we need to have melodica con.
I used to know how to play the whole opera thing from Final Fantasy VI.
That's what I was trying to remember how to play.
Except it's in a bizarre key.
So I was like, I don't remember!
I love it.
That sounds awesome.
I got a 32-key, I think, soprano melodica from Marissa, who has been with me when I've gone to several music stores looking for melodicas.
So you know what's next on the list?
An auto harp.
Or a theremin.
I was going to say, when are you getting a theremin?
I thought you wanted a theremin.
I do want a theremin, but I can afford an auto harp.
I know that Bobby is one of the biggest band nerds I know, but I don't think he called in to talk about melodicas tonight.
What's on your mind, Bobby?
I got home from where I went tonight and wanted to wish you guys happy 400th because I didn't create any audio like I said I would because I'm a bad person.
I forgot to do audio for the last FNG, so it's all good.
So...
Well, thank you so much for the call.
And of course, a big thank you, Bobby.
This show almost died a few years ago, actually.
And when Live 365 kind of made it impossible for us to keep continuing to do a radio station with kind of the new unrealistic rates that they were going to charge for our audience.
And you were obviously really the person who...
I mean other folks might try to take credit for it but you were the guy that brought us to All Games Radio a couple years before and helped kind of facilitate us coming on in a more you know kind of permanent way where our live show is now kind of exclusively here so for that we and the rest of the OLR listeners really thank you for helping this show reach 400 because otherwise it probably would have ended around 278 so
You're welcome, and you guys are keeping me on because all your listeners tune in early to me, and so I can use that as my numbers even though they're not really listening to me.
So it's awesome.
It works both ways.
Well, Bobby, I hate to say it, but sadly we don't even have 8,000 people tuning in, so I don't know what you're going to do.
I haven't gotten my rejection letter yet.
You're waiting.
Bobby.
I'm prepared.
Bobby.
Yes.
We are your fan club.
It's not an E3 without Bobby either.
I can really mean that because dude's gone to like what, the last 15 in a row or something like that?
This would be my 15th.
This would be your 15th.
Yes.
And they are going to say no to this man.
Possibly.
Yeah, we don't know yet.
I got the optimistic reading of the emails that if you have below 8,000, that's still one.
It's over 8,000 to get the second one, but those are all blogs and stuff.
And I wonder because they do make the distinction in the application form of podcast.
Oh, interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I could get 8,000 people to listen, and you could get 8,000 people to listen, but they're not going to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Exactly.
And hopefully most of our audience is smart enough not to have spyware tubulars installed on their computer.
Exactly.
It is a little bit.
The way they're measuring it is kind of janky.
But, you know, again, and we said this earlier, and I know you were at your party, so you probably didn't hear this, but, you know, it's mostly a case of a few bad apples ruining the barrel.
And I see why E3 feels like they need to take this step.
But it's just kind of like the wrong step.
Like, you should have gone left instead of right.
You know what I mean?
Well, I mean, I'm already told I'm not allowed at GDC anymore, too.
So it's like E3 was really all I had left other than PAX.
Because GDC took this step two years ago.
There is neatness.
I like getting to hang with the developers and get to see some of the stuff.
You know, when I played Warhammer Online for the first time, I was getting to talk to developers and stuff.
It was kind of cool.
But, you know... But, you know, if somebody's really serious about getting into E3 in terms of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So you could, with an exhibits only badge, you really could have done the exact same thing you did last year.
You didn't need a press badge.
Bobby, I'll tell you this.
I'll tell you this.
Even with my exhibits only, I got into press events.
Yeah.
As long as they know you, it doesn't matter what your badge says.
all I had to do was flash them a card that says I do this podcast and they're like we want you exactly so I think it'll be fine if you really really want to go and yes I really really want to go thankfully I got a refund
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
What?
I've got my DDR Freak stuff.
Oh.
Yeah, you might be able to do with that.
Yeah, so, I mean, I didn't get mine the other year, and I think it's because of my name change.
Interesting.
So.
And besides, I want to go to Anaheim.
Yes.
Disneyland.
He wants to go to the place that we always talk about.
All right.
Well, Bobby, I've got to let you go so we can squeeze some more calls in, but we'll see you next week as we do every week.
So have a good one, buddy.
You too.
Later.
Well, we let Bobby go a little long, but that's okay because you know what?
He always has us on his show every week and helps promote us.
And I know as much as he thinks it's us promoting him, it does work both ways.
So he can take a little more time.
All right, 877-GAME-OLR is our phone number or Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
You can give us a call.
We got time for a couple more calls, right?
We're not done yet.
We don't have the fight out of us yet.
Maybe one more call, actually.
I'm looking at the time.
This is starting to go on two hours by the time we finish.
I need to make an announcement.
Yeah, what?
My mom is amazing.
Really?
Yes.
Well, she had you.
Aww.
Hers is the womb that bore me.
That's right.
So we are waiting for the delay to catch up.
Do we have any other last minute stories real quick?
I forgot to ask earlier.
Or maybe I did and I just... MTV Games has shut down.
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
Sucks to be them!
AOL's buying the Huffington Post.
Let's get at least one more call in here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is Spazinator.
Spazinator!
What's on your mind, my friend?
Um, well, two really quick hits.
I want to keep it short and sweet just in case you want to get one less call.
Excuse me.
Just want to congratulate you on 400 shows and hope you have
and more shows to come in the following years.
Other than that, just want to point out to those that have PlayStation Network accounts, there's more free wheels on their usual spots.
Nothing overly exciting, but hey, they're there and they're free.
Hey, I like free stuff.
And as Salacious Pop said earlier, F you to the economy.
Free stuff is always appreciated, right?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's pretty much it.
Thanks for playing the show.
It's a really great show.
Thank you.
You guys help make it up.
It's your show too.
Well, thank you, Spazinator.
Have a good one, buddy.
Sure.
Bye-bye.
You know, I like that he kind of calls in and says what's free on PlayStation because I don't have time to follow all of it.
So, you know, it's where every gamer has a voice and some voices need to know of all the free stuff.
Why not?
Let's do another call.
He kept it so short.
Let's do another call.
1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Give us a call Alright, I'm trying to type in chat so that they know And I spelled guess wrong So I was trying to type with a microphone You need a mic?
Well, the microphone's too big to type with, Rob You think after 400 episodes I could have some mic stands?
Or something Alright, let's get to another call We got the phones lighting up here Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Oh, dropped off there.
Bummer.
Let's try again here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.
Hey, Brad.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Oh, just calling to say congratulations on 400 episodes, guys.
Thank you so much.
I remember when you were starting your show and you're up there to like 250 or something now almost?
I'm pushing that, pushing that.
Just released 243 this week and got a few more coming.
Nice.
By the way, I heard the shout out for Horde House on like 240 I think it was, so thanks for that.
Well, no problem.
You know, Glenn's a big WoW nut, so...
It's natural, we talk about it a little bit.
I have no idea what the hell he's saying half the time, but he talks about it.
Nice.
So, well, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
Any video games in your world?
Well, I can't rag on you about WoW too much because it's been DC Universe for me.
Well, how high are you in DC Universe now?
Are you like level 30 or whatever the cap is yet?
23, 24, something like that.
You're getting there.
You play a hero or a villain?
Hero right now.
Hero right now.
And who's your mentor?
Wonder Woman.
Oh yeah, mine was Wonder Woman too.
Because she's awesome.
What do you think of that whole Wonder Woman pilot that I guess is being sold to NBC?
This is the kind of thing you talk about on your show, right?
What do you think about the Wonder Woman pilot?
Well, I'm interested in seeing it.
it's true you gotta see it before you can really make a judgment I guess that's true you know there's some revivals you kind of like raise your eyebrow at and you're like really kind of like the Knight Rider one was kind of like really but then like Battlestar Galactica like I'm sorry it was way better than the original like way better oh no no in my big fat geek opinion it was better but I understand there's still a lot of love for the original too I love the new one though oh my gosh
How can you not like a chimpanzee in a robot dog costume?
Where do I begin?
You know, I almost bought DC Universe this week.
I had the PS3 copy in my hand, and I was like, I should buy this.
Yes, you should.
Maybe I shouldn't.
Right?
We were at Target.
We went shopping.
Go for it, man.
But I just wanted to call in and say congratulations.
You guys have...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's DragonCon.
You wouldn't have to look too damn far.
All right.
DragonCon has a little bit of everything.
Oh, yeah.
Bobby would like it if we went out to DragonCon.
That's in his backyard.
I know.
We would be.
I know.
We could crash at Bobby's.
We could go to Bobby's.
All right.
Brad.
Which was the name of a Supernatural episode this season.
Oh, you nerd.
All right.
Brad, thanks so much for the call.
Have a good one.
You too, guys.
Later.
All right.
Should we do one more call?
Yes Alright, we'll do one more call We just can't stop Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku What's on your mind, my friend?
First of all, I'd like to say happy 400th to you guys Happy 400th to us Thank you Happy 400th to you too, Zaku You've been here for a lot of it, so thank you Yeah, at least a good 80, you know, like 75% of it But yeah Good enough
Alright, let me see, I'm trying to think, because I've been out of like the whole, you know, I've been out of like the recent gaming news, aside from that new PSP announced.
But I mean, from what I heard, a lot of the devs are just like, you know, they're creaming in their pants over how it's like, you know, like a generation ahead of the current smartphones out there.
Which just, which, you know, the way I see it, they're just paying a lot of lip service to Sony.
I mean that's the whole point is it because right now there have to be nimble against not only Apple but whoever else is releasing any new Android tabs that could just rival what Sony's going to end up releasing.
I mean we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
We really don't know how the new NGP will perform when they release it.
But I can tell you this, I mean dual core phones are going to be here in a little bit.
So you're going to have all these game developers, the ones that are not targeting the PXP, the ones that have targeted the iPhones and high-end Android phones, they're going to have to start capitalizing it.
So that way, you know, they have...
and so on and so forth.
With iPhone 5, I'm sure, kind of like a hybrid thing for AT&T and Verizon on its way in the summer.
So, I mean, it's just crazy times.
Verizon only got the hand-me-downs, per se.
AT&T still has a ton of exclusives now.
Whenever a new iPhone comes out, Verizon will get it months afterwards.
Well, too early to tell.
But so far, that's the indication that I've seen so far that, you know, AT&T will still have it.
It doesn't have its, like, you know, full exclusivity, like, it's the only carrier where you can buy it.
So it'll probably have what, you know, they'll have, like, a compromised, like, a timed exclusive.
But you do realize that, you know, as I said, Google's already, you know, already has, like, Android 3.0 out, which is, like, their tablet version, which is supposed to, like,
Harold in the era of $300 tablets that pretty much rivaled the iPad for a matchup to that.
They just have to bring something that you can't really get on an iPhone or high-end Android phone.
Basically, something that not only surpasses PS2, but just barely touches PS3 graphics.
Something that melts faces with awesomeness.
Exactly.
Well, you need something that's kind of a hybrid in between the PS2 and the 360.
If you get that on a small package like an NGP,
and you're pretty much a step ahead of the competition.
Last question, Zaku.
Do you think they'll succeed?
Sony, I mean, the way I see it is that they never had this much heat from anyone outside of Nintendo.
Because now that Apple's creeping up, you know, Apple and the other manufacturers are creeping up, they have to, like,
You know, they have to make sure they hit another home run.
The PSP sold really well, but there are more iPhones out there than PSPs, and that's a fact.
There are more Android phones out there.
There's a lot more high-end smartphones than people who have PSPs.
Well, we will see.
Buddy, I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks for your call.
Take care, my friend.
We'll see you on episode 700.
Yeah, definitely.
Pax East, DragonCon, Pax Prime, ASEN I do want to go to ASEN We dug out actually all of my old costumes and I found my Tamari fan
WonderCon Season Comic-Con
I have a friend that goes every year.
Really?
Yeah.
Then again, she works in the industry.
Alright.
I'd have to get some help from my friends over there.
AkumaJP, Kitsune, somebody might need some help if I were to come out there for Tokyo Game Show.
Because you guys can clearly tell I can't even read the Japanese release dates right.
I'd have problems navigating around there.
Alright, that's going to do it.
We've got to wrap up episode 400 of this show.
Sadly, it's not a marathon tonight.
We can't go all night long.
But thank you guys, of course, for tuning in tonight.
Got to go around, though.
I'm assuming all the last minute news is done.
If so, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
So, Loki, we'll start with you.
Your final thought tonight.
Galgan's a weird game.
Hope I don't get visited by Chris Hansen.
Salacious Pop, since you have the microphone, thank you so much for being here tonight in this very special episode because you're a special guy.
Any final thoughts tonight for our listeners?
I'm eagerly anticipating our trip to the Noodle House after this.
Are you hungry?
Yeah.
Alright, that's alright.
Arcadian, thank you for being here.
Appreciate your support as always.
You've kind of been there since day one as well, way back in the Arvigil days, so you've watched us grow up right in front of your eyes.
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
I'll go over what my game of 2010 was, and that was Nier.
It has a very good story, very good characters, and very good music, and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Yeah, and one thing about it is that the female character swears in almost every scene she's in.
And I think it's something that would appeal more to older players than younger players.
Younger players probably wouldn't like the story as much.
Some of the characterizations probably wouldn't really ring true to them or wouldn't really kind of mix with their experience.
But older people would probably think would like it a lot more.
Alright, so noted.
That's a hell of a final thought, but I'll have to check that game out.
My final thought is, gosh, A, I could use some Pinkberry, but sadly they're closed.
And B, thank you guys for listening for the past 400 episodes, or whenever you joined, even if this week was your first show.
Thank you so much for listening.
DarkSakura, your final thought?
Baskin-Robbins is open.
We get an afterbirth to do still.
Alright, thank you guys so much for downloading our show.
Thank you for tuning in.
Thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
I mean, as we kind of joked about earlier in the show, we're not the biggest show on the internet.
We don't have millions of dollars backing it up.
We stay here every week though because of you guys and no corporation can put a stop to that.
so thank you guys so much for your support if you like what you hear just tell friends about the show it's word of mouth really helps leave us a nice five star review on iTunes we haven't gotten one of those in like months so we would definitely appreciate some of those or whatever podcasty program you used to listen it would be most appreciated
thank you guys so much and guess what just because tonight was a landmark show episode 400 doesn't mean it's over yet we'll be back to do it all again next week here at Orange Lounge Radio episode 401 goodnight everybody you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
See you next week!
