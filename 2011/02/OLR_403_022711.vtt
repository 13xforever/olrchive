WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.880
Tonight, February 27th, 2011, the 3DS launches in Japan.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.680
We Dare might be too daring for the U.S., and will Guitar Hero get more download content

00:23.680 --> 00:29.680
after all?

00:29.680 --> 00:34.800
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:34.800 --> 00:38.760
Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.760 --> 00:44.320
We tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific,

00:44.320 --> 00:47.200
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.020
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my awesome co-host.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.880
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.880
Booze.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.880
How you doing?

00:55.880 --> 00:56.880
Booze.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.880
What kind of booze?

00:57.880 --> 01:02.320
Apparently she's drank too much of that booze already.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.320
No, no, no, no.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.320
I have...

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
She dumb forgot.

01:05.320 --> 01:06.320
Stop interrupting me.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.320
I have Irish...

01:07.320 --> 01:09.320
Wait, did you guys hear that?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
I'm sorry.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.720
This is worth interrupting because did you hear her say, stop interrupting me.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
She's slurring already.

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
Stop interrupting me.

01:15.720 --> 01:16.720
No.

01:16.720 --> 01:25.560
I have Baileys Irish cream with the last of my Kahlua and ice cubes and whipped cream,

01:25.560 --> 01:27.260
but I've mixed the whipped cream into it.

01:27.260 --> 01:33.400
So it cuts some of the alcohol and increases the calorie count tenfold.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.720
It's like a tablespoon, but it is Supra delicious.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
Sunday night.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
Relax a little.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
Yeah.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.880
Since a belly button is in here.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.680
Well, let me get to that.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.020
Tech master Loki is out tonight.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.720
He actually had an emergency circumstance this week.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
Don't worry guys.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
He's fine.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.480
But what happened, I guess he went in on Tuesday to the doctor and found out he had a hernia

01:58.480 --> 01:59.480
or...

01:59.480 --> 02:01.720
The same kind his child did.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.720
That's like father, like son, right?

02:03.720 --> 02:05.440
Except in reverse, like son, like father.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.660
So you know, and I'm only telling you what it is because I know he's going to give you

02:08.660 --> 02:11.600
all the sort of details about it when he comes back.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
It's a hernia.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.080
I don't know if that'll be next week or two weeks.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
Yeah.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
I mean, it's...

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
Living with a hernia.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.880
So he had to have the surgery for that or I guess availability came up on Friday or

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
something like that.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.840
He didn't know he was going to have the surgery and suddenly it was like, you're having the

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
surgery.

02:26.840 --> 02:27.840
Okay.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.320
So he had the surgery, which, you know...

02:29.320 --> 02:33.280
My favorite thing to do is confuse, and sometimes it's done on purpose, is confuse hernias and

02:33.280 --> 02:36.120
hemorrhoids and ask if they need a donut.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.760
Little different, little different.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.280
So yeah, he's recovering.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.760
He's not able to drive out to the show.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.760
He could be listening.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.680
So hi, Loki, if you're listening.

02:43.680 --> 02:48.520
But he's probably sleeping because I know when I had surgery, granted I had the gall

02:48.520 --> 02:52.660
bladder thing, which is a little different, but I slept for like seven days straight.

02:52.660 --> 02:54.840
So that could be where Loki's at right now.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.840
I don't know.

02:55.840 --> 02:56.940
But regardless, he won't be here tonight.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.940
So it's just Dark Soccer and I holding down the fort.

02:58.940 --> 03:02.800
We didn't have enough time since we just found out about it on Friday and I'm usually gone

03:02.800 --> 03:03.800
on the weekend.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.760
We didn't have time to cook up a guest host.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.240
So it's just here, just the two of us here.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.500
And one of us has been drinking.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.880
So this is sure to be a wonderful show tonight.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.520
Rob had some of my tasty beverage.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.920
It is delicious, isn't it?

03:14.920 --> 03:15.920
Nothing.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.960
But luckily we have you guys in our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com joining us as you

03:20.960 --> 03:23.640
do every week here as we tape live our show.

03:23.640 --> 03:27.000
We couldn't appreciate you guys anymore, especially this week.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.180
You guys are awesome.

03:28.180 --> 03:33.440
And speaking of chat room stories, some folks were asking before the show, can we talk about

03:33.440 --> 03:34.440
the Oscars?

03:34.440 --> 03:35.440
Because that's going on tonight.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.080
On top of everything else, the Oscars are going on tonight.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.880
I want to call them the Betty White's curse.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.360
Well, I'll get to that in a minute.

03:41.360 --> 03:49.280
The Oscars are going on and it's one of the few shows that airs live on the West and the

03:49.280 --> 03:50.280
East Coast.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.360
I don't know of anything else, maybe the Super Bowl, that airs live on both coasts at the

03:54.360 --> 03:55.360
same time.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.200
So I think anybody who's watching, it's probably watching it in one eye and maybe listening

03:59.200 --> 04:01.200
to our show or what have you or waiting for the podcast.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.200
I don't know.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.160
But yeah, I don't know why you'd want to yell out the winners in the chat room because anybody

04:06.160 --> 04:08.760
who cares probably already has on the TV, but whatever.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.960
People want to yell it out.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.840
And I think SSJ went under Matt a joke before the show that if Betty White's not at the

04:13.840 --> 04:15.380
Oscars, who cares?

04:15.380 --> 04:19.580
And I said, look, you can, fine, you can yell out the names of the winners, but you just

04:19.580 --> 04:22.480
have to change everything so that Betty White won everything.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.560
And so now Betty White has just become the new Chuck Norris in our chat room.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.900
But you know what, guys?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.320
I think it's very well deserved.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
You know why?

04:29.320 --> 04:30.320
You know why it's well deserved?

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
Hold on.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
Listen to this.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
The reason I lied.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.700
If I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it, which seems to be exactly what

04:35.700 --> 04:36.820
you're trying to do.

04:36.820 --> 04:39.080
How long have you been feeding this thing?

04:39.080 --> 04:40.240
Six years.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.840
Six years.

04:41.840 --> 04:47.640
Well, Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.400
He threw it some scraps, and well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.840
He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.

04:53.840 --> 04:54.840
He just appeared.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.720
You have no idea how he arrived here.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.120
No, do you?

04:58.120 --> 05:03.520
Well, your husband Bernie, you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.120
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
There you go.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.520
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

05:09.520 --> 05:10.520
That's why Betty White is awesome.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
I love her.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
Yes.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
Amazing.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.840
Anyhow, that was the movie Lake Placid, by the way, if you never saw that.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.280
Really corny ass movie, but Betty White made it, of course.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
Of course.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.380
Anyhow, let's see, yeah, so we're going to get into the show as you guys join us in our

05:27.380 --> 05:28.380
chat room.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.640
We're going to do a little bit of a short show.

05:29.640 --> 05:32.600
We're doing an abbreviated show tonight, meaning we're not going to have a break in the middle

05:32.600 --> 05:35.560
and we're going to blaze right through both halves of our show.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
Don't worry.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
We're still going to take calls at the end.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.200
We're still going to do all your favorite segments.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.400
We're just doing it a little shorter tonight because we don't have Loki, for one, and it's

05:42.400 --> 05:43.800
just the two of us.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.720
With everything we're competing against and so forth, we figured, you know what, let's

05:47.720 --> 05:49.680
have this be a minimum day.

05:49.680 --> 05:50.680
Remember those in school?

05:50.680 --> 05:51.680
You'd have a minimum day.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
We never had such a thing.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
Huh?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
We didn't have minimum days.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.680
Really?

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
We had minimum days here all the time.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
We had teacher work days.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.680
Oh, okay.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.680
It's similar.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.520
But teacher work days were awesome because guess who didn't have to go to school?

06:02.520 --> 06:04.080
That would be all of us.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.080
But the teachers did.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.360
The teachers did.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.940
We're having a minimum day here at OLR so we can go have a business meeting at Pinkberry.

06:09.940 --> 06:10.940
So there you go.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.080
Actually, there is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes, but things I can't tell

06:13.080 --> 06:14.080
you about.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.280
Dude, Spazanator said that if he has alcohol, he'll go psychotic and die.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.280
That's no good.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.280
You probably wouldn't do it.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.480
I had a friend in college who was schizophrenic and took LSD.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
Wow.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
It's Mystique.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Mystique?

06:25.480 --> 06:28.480
Mystique, you want to sit in on the show for a minute?

06:28.480 --> 06:31.720
Come in and introduce yourself as- Oh, God, I love Mystique.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
I'm so happy she's here.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
Hold on.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720
Hello.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
We gotta get her hooked up.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Live radio, folks.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
I am the goddamn Batman.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.720
That she is.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.580
Why are you the goddamn Batman, which by the way, is one of my favorite Twitter accounts

06:41.580 --> 06:45.200
that they have anywhere?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.820
Because I'm awesome.

06:47.820 --> 06:48.820
What more do you need?

06:48.820 --> 06:51.160
I'm awesome.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.160
Then she's got a Batarang in her pants.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.720
Okay, there.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.920
I've got you your own mic now.

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
So there you go.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.920
Sweet.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.800
So what are you up to these days, Mystique?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
What have you been playing?

07:00.800 --> 07:01.800
You playing video games these days?

07:01.800 --> 07:02.800
What are you playing?

07:02.800 --> 07:07.480
Of course she is, because she just got the thing.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
Tell them what you got.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.480
I got what?

07:09.480 --> 07:10.480
The Batman.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.120
Oh, I already did the Batman Arkham Asylum, because that game was awesome.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.480
But the new one's coming out.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.480
I know.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.280
It's not coming out soon enough, though, because I need it now.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.280
Like now.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.280
Because it's goddamn Batman.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.680
Yeah, it's the goddamn Batman and the goddamn Joker.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.800
See, it's not about Batman for her, it's about Joker.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.120
It's all about the Joker and not the Heath Ledger Joker.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.320
Oh, what you got against Heath Ledger?

07:35.320 --> 07:36.400
It's Oscar night.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
I don't care.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.240
Betty White's winning everything, by the way.

07:40.240 --> 07:44.280
We don't care who won anything in the Oscars as long as Betty White did it.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.560
Unless Betty White did it.

07:45.560 --> 07:46.560
Betty White is pretty awesome.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
Yeah, that's right.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.920
Betty White has actually just announced the new villain in the next Batman movie, so there

07:50.920 --> 07:51.920
you go.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.540
She's gonna be Catwoman, actually.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.000
She just took down that bitch Anne Hathaway behind the stage and was like...

07:57.000 --> 07:59.880
I can totally see that shit.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.880
Betty White is hardcore.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.880
That's right.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.800
And of course the next game coming out is Betty White versus Capcom.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.560
I would totally play that game.

08:07.560 --> 08:11.200
She heard that Anne Hathaway got the part of Catwoman, and this is what she said in

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
response.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.200
If you didn't by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded...

08:15.200 --> 08:20.360
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
There you go.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
I concur with that.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.360
All right.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
Anyhow.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.220
I remember certain conversations where someone in this room used to say, I wish I had one

08:28.220 --> 08:29.220
of those.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.220
I do wish I had a dick.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.600
It would be awesome.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
Why?

08:32.600 --> 08:36.480
Because then I could pee wherever I was and...

08:36.480 --> 08:37.800
It doesn't quite work like that.

08:37.800 --> 08:38.920
Hold on.

08:38.920 --> 08:43.160
And when I beat the crap out of somebody, I could whip out my dick and piss all over

08:43.160 --> 08:44.160
him.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.120
Can't you kind of do that now?

08:46.120 --> 08:47.280
I mean, I realize...

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
It's messier.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.680
It's messier because you really got to take down your pants.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
All right.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
Look.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
There's a lot of work.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
Oh, look.

08:54.680 --> 08:59.680
The listener count is plummeting as we hear these details.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.600
I told them about you in wild chat last night, by the way.

09:02.600 --> 09:03.600
Sweet.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.600
I'm famous.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.600
All right.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
I'm living with video game chat.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
Yeah.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.720
So let's talk about how is your gaming week?

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
I played WoW.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.200
And then I played WoW.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.040
And then when I was done playing WoW...

09:15.040 --> 09:16.040
Did you play more WoW?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.040
I played WoW.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.480
What are you doing in WoW?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.880
Well, my mage is...

09:21.880 --> 09:26.220
Because I basically power leveled everything up and didn't bother with my professions.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.680
So now I've gone broke leveling dual crafting.

09:29.680 --> 09:33.640
Now I'm working on mining and sort of archaeology, but not really.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.680
That's because I think that reading some of this stuff is funny.

09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Holy shit.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.720
She's going to be an archaeologist like Indiana Jones.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.720
He's in the game.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.720
Harrison Jones.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.920
Shut the hell up.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.160
And I believe someone does say no time for love, Dr. Jones.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.160
Sweet.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
Yes.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.160
You gotta have a short round.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.160
Yeah.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.160
Oh, he's awesome.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.920
I'll have to go back and show you videos of all that.

09:51.920 --> 09:52.920
But anyway.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.320
You just need to play for Harrison Jones, because that's what it's all about, is the

09:56.320 --> 09:58.640
whole archaeology thing in Oldham.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.640
So cool.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.840
But anyway, and then I decided to work on my puppy.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.200
I just call her my puppy.

10:05.200 --> 10:10.720
I still hate dungeons on my puppy, because people don't know what a freaking tank is

10:10.720 --> 10:13.000
apparently if you're lower than level 20.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.240
But tanks run over people.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.760
And tanks also take a lot of damage without feeling it.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.480
I wish I had a tank.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.760
I want a tank for real life.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.760
Wouldn't it be cool?

10:22.760 --> 10:25.440
It's like if you were in school and you just had someone be your tank.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.440
That would be pretty awesome.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.240
You had your party, and your tank would be like, I don't feel anything.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.800
I'm Teflon.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.480
I'm rubber, you're glue.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.240
And you would always be able to find a parking spot.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.880
And then you had your healer, who would basically go around going, it's OK, don't worry about

10:40.880 --> 10:41.880
it.

10:41.880 --> 10:42.880
You're going to be just fine.

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
They're idiots.

10:43.880 --> 10:44.880
They're bitches.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.880
And then you've got your other three friends who are your DPS.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.640
Bitch, I heard what you just said.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.120
It's on now.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
Bring it.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.520
That would be World of Warcraft for high school.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.920
I just put it on my Facebook.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.480
Loki, if you're listening, this is what happens when you're not here.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.680
Just sort of point that out.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.960
You're missed a lot.

11:04.960 --> 11:09.640
Yeah, but our aim's improving.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.320
I made Misty laugh.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Laughing is fun.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
I had liquor.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.320
Want some?

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
I know.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.320
If it's not obvious.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.640
What are you talking about?

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
She's always like this.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.040
But I'm extra like this.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.040
All right.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.040
Anything else in your gaming week you want to share with us besides WoW?

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
Betty White, the RPG.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
All right.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.840
Mystique, I think I already bugged you about this, but any specific games you've been playing

11:31.840 --> 11:33.920
this week you want to share with the world?

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
Oh, wait.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Final Fantasy III.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
OK.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.260
Dude, I totally played some Dr. Mario.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.260
You played Dr. Mario?

11:40.260 --> 11:41.260
Hells yeah.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.260
Old school 8-bit?

11:42.260 --> 11:43.260
Yeah.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.260
Game Boy, baby.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.260
What?

11:45.260 --> 11:46.260
Game Boy.

11:46.260 --> 11:47.260
Dr. Mario.

11:47.260 --> 11:50.680
What possessed you to get out the pills?

11:50.680 --> 11:53.480
Because sometimes you just need pills.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.680
Different colored pills, especially the red one.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.640
Is there a particular virus that's like, is it the red virus or the yellow virus?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.800
She has the G-virus.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.720
So if she doesn't have her pills, she turns into a zombie and totally sucks brains.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.320
Because brains taste good.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.320
Itchy.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.320
Tasty.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Itchy, tasty.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.720
So, Dr. Mario, wait.

12:15.720 --> 12:20.160
Actually, let me ask you the really compelling question when it comes to Dr. Mario.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.120
Music type A or B?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.480
Music type B. B for bitchin'.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.480
Yes.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.600
Because I like to kick it old school.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
What?

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
What?

12:30.600 --> 12:32.280
You just made a song pop into my head.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.280
What's that?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
A dead milkman song.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
It's a bitchin' Camaro.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
Bitchin' Camaro, bitchin' Camaro.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
I ran over my mother.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
I love that song.

12:38.280 --> 12:46.280
I had to download that the other day so I could play it in the car.

12:46.280 --> 12:52.160
Let's see, going to our chatroom at chat.orangelaungerator.com, Dark Tetsuya says, Rob, I think the women

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
just hijacked the show.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
You know, I think you're right.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
I think...

12:55.160 --> 12:56.160
Yay!

12:56.160 --> 12:57.160
Estrogen!

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
Woo!

12:58.160 --> 13:01.160
Oh my god, help me.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
We've got this.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.680
The powers of the jubbles compel you.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.640
The minute you guys start braiding each other's hair and start talking about boys.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.920
My hair is already braided.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.120
Missy pays someone to do hers, so...

13:13.120 --> 13:14.840
I just flat iron mine.

13:14.840 --> 13:15.840
You know, with an iron.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.480
I like that you've got like purple and then black and purple.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.500
You've got like a red X13 thing going on there.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.760
Because this is always the color I have.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.760
Black and purple.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.760
Because she's secretly, well not so secretly, evil.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
Did I say red X13?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.320
That's a little bit redundant, isn't it?

13:30.320 --> 13:31.320
It's red 13.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.320
Red 13.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.320
Alright.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.320
Rob?

13:34.320 --> 13:37.120
See, and it matches my shoes.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.120
Her shoes are jokery.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.120
Oh, they are jokery.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
What is it about the joker?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
I'm going to take a picture of Missy's shoes.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.800
What is it about the joker you just love so darn much?

13:42.800 --> 13:44.840
Because he likes to kill people, and that's a good thing.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.560
She also likes prints for similar reasons.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
Exactly.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.560
Prints like to kill people too.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
Shoes.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
Alright.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.760
This is our new album artist, Mystique Shoes.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.760
Awesome.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.520
Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week.

13:57.520 --> 14:01.320
I played a little bit of WoW as well, but I did play other stuff too.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.040
I'm actually really addicted to on the iPhone, and I know there's, like when I say that,

14:05.040 --> 14:08.880
there's this whole cluster of people out there that's like, oh god, the iPhone.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.280
I'm really addicted to Cut the Rope, you guys.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.360
Like, it's adorable and cute and...

14:14.360 --> 14:16.960
And the new game, Jump the Shark.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.480
Is there really a game called Jump the Shark?

14:18.480 --> 14:19.480
I don't know.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
There probably is somewhere.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
Alright.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.720
There was an episode of Supernatural called Jump the Shark.

14:23.720 --> 14:24.720
Mystique has left the building.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.480
Alright, well, alright, everybody calm down, it'll be okay.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.300
And then what else have I played this week?

14:32.300 --> 14:39.240
I played Bejeweled Blitz on the Xbox 360, which is, I guess you could say PopCap's way

14:39.240 --> 14:43.160
of cashing in on the Facebook game, which has been doing very well for them.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.680
Although I don't think this was developed by PopCap.

14:45.680 --> 14:49.040
I mean, I think it was like in agreement with them, but I saw another developer's name come

14:49.040 --> 14:50.880
up when I started the game.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.040
And I gotta be honest, guys, I could tell that someone else developed this like right

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
off the bat.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.360
Like, it just didn't have that same polish.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.180
And I don't know how else to say this.

15:00.180 --> 15:02.960
And I know I'm sounding like really harsh, but like when I go in there, especially with

15:02.960 --> 15:07.440
the graphics, the graphics did not have that same polish that I have seen in the other

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
PopCap games.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.880
It needs buffing.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.940
And I guess, yes, the jewels needed to be polished, I don't know.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.640
But yeah, it's okay.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.760
I mean, it is what it is.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.360
It's a minute-long version of Bejeweled.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.100
And you compete against your friends and have the leaderboards.

15:22.100 --> 15:25.980
And you can do regular Bejeweled, or you can do the twisty Bejeweled, the Gyromancer version

15:25.980 --> 15:26.980
of Bejeweled.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.960
You can do either of those in a minute-long versions.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.160
And there's also like a multiplayer version online.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.720
I didn't get to really test that too much.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.680
But you know, it's pretty much what you'd think.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.480
It's multiplayer Bejeweled.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.480
I gotta be honest, though.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.820
I didn't see a whole lot that made me feel like I had to buy this game.

15:41.820 --> 15:47.240
And there already is Bejeweled Twist, or Gyromancer and Gyromancer, and then Bejeweled 2 on the

15:47.240 --> 15:48.240
marketplace.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.560
And Plants vs. Zombies has Bejeweled.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.040
Yeah, and Bejeweled.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.220
And there's even the Jewel Quest, the knockoff game.

15:55.220 --> 15:59.800
And I just, I didn't really feel like there was enough of a game there where it was just

15:59.800 --> 16:02.480
minute-long versions of Bejeweled.

16:02.480 --> 16:05.760
Which is weird, I know, because I do like the version on Facebook, or at least I did

16:05.760 --> 16:06.760
for a long time.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.880
And, you know, you can have the one on the phone.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.600
It just, for me, didn't translate too well to the controller.

16:11.600 --> 16:17.160
I do like some of the things they did where your left stick moves the cursor, and then

16:17.160 --> 16:22.640
the Y, X, A, B buttons flip the gems in that direction.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.680
And in the older Bejeweled games, you used to have to pick two gems, then swap them,

16:26.680 --> 16:28.160
and it was more button presses.

16:28.160 --> 16:32.120
So they kind of made that faster, which is important because the game only goes a minute.

16:32.120 --> 16:36.920
But you can play it for free on Facebook, and it's got that same level of competition.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.360
Granted it doesn't have the twisty gem version, and granted it doesn't have multiplayer.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.940
But I kind of feel like in PopCap's other games, you get enough of that.

16:45.940 --> 16:49.460
So this kind of feels like a little bit of a cash-in to me.

16:49.460 --> 16:53.240
I would really only recommend this game to somebody who doesn't have any of the other

16:53.240 --> 16:58.820
Bejeweled games, who really loves their casual games, who's looking for this fix.

16:58.820 --> 17:02.000
But I honestly think most of you would play this game for a little bit, and then go back

17:02.000 --> 17:04.820
to the one on Facebook, if you really want to play Bejeweled.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.760
Because I think the controller thing would drive you bonkers after a while, when you

17:07.760 --> 17:10.200
can be so much faster with a mouse or with your finger.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.480
It's just one of those games, it just didn't work in translation, and it's kind of a bummer.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.960
And I kind of think that's why PopCap probably didn't do it themselves.

17:17.960 --> 17:18.960
Maybe.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.480
They probably just kind of let somebody else do it, so yikes.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.680
They're going to give us how much money for this game?

17:24.680 --> 17:25.860
Outsource the scrap.

17:25.860 --> 17:29.800
It's $10, if you want to buy that on Xbox Live Marketplace.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.600
There's a lot of great stuff coming out of the Turnpike on Xbox Live Marketplace that

17:32.600 --> 17:34.280
I'm definitely checking out over the next few weeks.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.160
Beyond Good and Evil HD, a lot of people looking forward to that.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.480
Torchlight, oh my god, I'm so excited for Torchlight on Xbox Live.

17:41.480 --> 17:47.840
I am so curious to see, speaking of a game that feels very one-way on the PC, I'm really

17:47.840 --> 17:51.320
curious to see how they translated this to Xbox 360 controller, because apparently they

17:51.320 --> 17:52.720
change quite a bit.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.300
So I'll definitely be checking that out.

17:54.300 --> 17:59.600
I think that's the 15th that that comes out, so I'll be looking at that.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.600
And that does it for my gaming week.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.320
So let's move on and go over some housekeeping real quick.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.960
Not a whole lot.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.080
I just want to mention of course our Twitter, Twitter.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and of

18:10.080 --> 18:13.200
course you can follow OrangeLoungeRadio on Facebook as well.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.960
And if you like OrangeLoungeRadio and you like all this craziness and zaniness that

18:16.960 --> 18:21.560
we bring you every week that's sometimes very random as it was tonight.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.140
I just found out something, Rob.

18:23.140 --> 18:24.140
What's that?

18:24.140 --> 18:26.880
You mentioning PopCap made me want to check for Peggle on Steam.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.880
Peggle Extreme is free.

18:28.880 --> 18:29.880
Free?

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
Really?

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Free.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
Free?

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
I'm installing it right now.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
What's so extreme about Peggle Extreme?

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
No idea, but I love Peggle.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
Oh, there you go.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.880
PSA for the listeners.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.880
Go check that out.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.880
Well, now you made me lose my train of thought.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.080
You interrupted me for some stupid Peggle.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.700
Oh, yeah.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.360
Help spread the word about the show and leave us a nice review on iTunes.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
We always appreciate that.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.520
And a couple more have popped up in the past few days.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.880
We really, really do appreciate you guys taking the time out to leave us a nice review.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.320
And that doesn't have to just be iTunes.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.960
I know some of you guys are like, oh, I'm never going to touch iTunes with a 10-foot

18:58.960 --> 19:02.520
pole or wherever it is that you can read about podcasts if you can leave a nice review for

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
us.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.520
That'd be awesome.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.520
All right.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.040
So, let's move on to some gaming news.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
Let's get into the news tonight.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.720
We're going to start off with the 3DS launch.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.640
The 3DS did launch in Japan.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.280
It did make its release date.

19:15.280 --> 19:20.080
And I guess, you know, it was a very cold day in Japan, but people were still lining

19:20.080 --> 19:21.380
up for it.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.240
There were extras left over.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.820
You didn't have to pre-order it.

19:24.820 --> 19:27.880
They were able to get their hands on it if they didn't pre-order it.

19:27.880 --> 19:31.760
However, the initial shipment of 400,000 units already gone.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.000
That's the early word.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, not surprising.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Not surprising.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
The same thing happens here.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.200
Because it prints money.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.820
I think if you're on it day one, you can get it, but it'll sell out that first shipment

19:41.820 --> 19:42.820
pretty quick.

19:42.820 --> 19:47.400
So, just so you know, they did have people that were camping out for it.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.120
They had eight launch titles over in Japan.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.160
Some of the best-selling ones, at least visually, I mean, they're not going to know until the

19:54.160 --> 19:55.160
numbers come out.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.960
But people that were on location reporting, watching what people were buying, saying that

19:58.960 --> 20:03.520
Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition and the Professor Layton game appeared to be the big

20:03.520 --> 20:07.760
sellers, which will probably be similar over here, at least with Super Street Fighter.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
Did Professor Layton make launch over here?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.760
I'm not sure it did.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
I don't recall.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.820
I think it might have been.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.040
The Layton games are fairly popular here, too.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
Yeah.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.040
Oh, yeah.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.040
They definitely have their audience.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.880
But I think the Super Street Fighter will probably be the big seller out the gate.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.800
And honestly, Nintendogs, I think is going to be a huge one for Nintendo.

20:23.800 --> 20:28.280
Just knowing that the target audience, again, not the folks that listen to this podcast,

20:28.280 --> 20:33.440
but kids, you know, between the ages of like, I don't know, when do kids start using this

20:33.440 --> 20:40.840
the 3DS, maybe like 6, 7 on up through 13 are going to be all over Nintendogs and cats.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.160
And I think even some adults will be, too.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.320
And I got to admit, I'll probably buy it because I'm a sucker.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.320
Big sucker.

20:48.320 --> 20:49.320
Tee hee.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.760
So there you go.

20:50.760 --> 20:51.840
Yeah.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.520
So it's sold out now in Japan.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.040
So if you didn't already import this thing, you might have a hard time.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.860
You're gonna have to wait for the next shipment.

20:57.860 --> 21:01.120
But it does sound like it's a successful launch over there.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.760
Now we want to hear about the next wave of games coming out.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.280
But I guess we'll just have to wait until E3.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.280
Yeah.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.680
Well, I was looking at all the, they've definitely got all the pre-order stuff going on at GameStop

21:11.680 --> 21:15.800
today, which is where I went today to pick up Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.600
And they're pushing it.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.920
So hey.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.040
But how about something that's a little naughty, Rob?

21:22.040 --> 21:23.600
Yay, I love naughty things.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
Naughty.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.160
Wait, should we get Mystique back for this?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.280
Because she's pretty naughty, too.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
A little randy.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.280
Oh, okay.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.280
A little raunchy.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.280
A little sassy?

21:32.280 --> 21:34.320
Oh, more than a bit sassy.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
Alright.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.400
We have a game that's called We Dare.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.440
It's a party game that's put out by Ubisoft.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.640
And well, it's not coming out in America.

21:42.640 --> 21:49.540
In fact, their spokesperson said it absolutely will not see release in the United States.

21:49.540 --> 21:53.160
The trailer has been region locked to Europe.

21:53.160 --> 22:00.920
And well, really, it has you spanking your friends and snogging your controller and getting

22:00.920 --> 22:01.920
naked.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
What?

22:02.920 --> 22:03.920
Release in your underwear.

22:03.920 --> 22:04.920
Okay, wait.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.160
Is this the trailer here?

22:06.160 --> 22:09.600
Can I watch this or is this going to tell me I can only watch this because it's bound

22:09.600 --> 22:10.600
to Europe?

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
Or is this going to work?

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
It may, it may.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.600
It may.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.600
It's been two years.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.520
Well, now there's a stupid ad playing, so no one cares about the ad.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.160
Oh, this is a really slow site.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.480
Let me see if it's on YouTube somewhere.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.320
We're going to go to YouTube.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.320
Okay.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.320
I want to see this.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
I literally have not.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.800
I heard about the game, but I didn't watch this trailer.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.920
Well, I'm going to pull up the- So it's like, what?

22:29.920 --> 22:30.920
It's like Truth or Dare?

22:30.920 --> 22:35.360
Well, I'm pulling up the Amazon UK product description.

22:35.360 --> 22:42.080
Wow, it's $16.99 over there.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.080
And let's see.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
Okay, wait.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.080
Here we go.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.080
Here we go.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.080
I got a trailer.

22:49.080 --> 22:56.240
Okay, right off the bat, that sounds like a Cinemax movie score there in the background.

22:56.240 --> 23:02.160
The cover has a pink chair with a bra on it and a fuzzy handcuffs and some high heels.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.160
Wow.

23:03.160 --> 23:08.160
Hold on, hold on.

23:08.160 --> 23:19.000
Okay, so there's this mini game where there's like an apple.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.480
And the two of them are eating it.

23:20.480 --> 23:28.080
And somebody is like dangling a Wiimote between these two people that are just kind of like,

23:28.080 --> 23:29.080
it's a little bit.

23:29.080 --> 23:43.080
I'm going to leave the thing in the chat room.

23:43.080 --> 23:46.220
Wow.

23:46.220 --> 23:50.360
So this chick had to put a Wiimote in her back pocket, kind of like tucked into the

23:50.360 --> 23:51.360
back of her pants.

23:51.360 --> 23:55.720
And now the boys are spanking her in order to fly through the cloud level here.

23:55.720 --> 24:06.800
Now this other chick, she took her ponytail out.

24:06.800 --> 24:15.200
And of course, the chicks get to spank each other.

24:15.200 --> 24:35.800
Okay, I want someone to get that for me.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.800
Here's the thing.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.040
I'll send you candy.

24:38.040 --> 24:43.680
Okay, so those are like dumb little party games that to be honest, what's the uproar

24:43.680 --> 24:44.680
about this?

24:44.680 --> 24:47.200
I would say that kids would play this because it's a Wii game.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.240
And you know, the target audiences is usually kids because people over here have the big

24:51.240 --> 24:52.240
anal stick.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
Okay, here's the thing.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.560
I'm honestly watching those things that are going on.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.720
Those are all the games we played at parties when I was 12.

24:59.720 --> 25:04.760
Yeah, like remember two minutes in the closet, spin the bottle.

25:04.760 --> 25:08.900
Like all that I mean when you were 12 I was at a party five years ago where you're playing

25:08.900 --> 25:11.880
spin the bottle.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.160
Well you kind of defused the point I was about to make because I was going to say now you're

25:15.160 --> 25:18.000
trying to tell me that a bunch of 20 year olds are going to play these same games that

25:18.000 --> 25:19.320
we played when we were 12.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
Yes.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
Look, we were drunk.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.320
Okay, that's all I'm saying.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.440
I don't need a Wii to help you with that.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.440
You know what I mean?

25:25.440 --> 25:27.680
I don't need a Nintendo Wii to help me with that.

25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
It's a fun idea.

25:28.680 --> 25:33.680
I think that Ubisoft is just being, oh the Americans are going to preach at us.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.320
They're going to sing Jesus on us.

25:37.320 --> 25:43.080
No, it's a little silly that the game can't come out here.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.240
You know, Gripper 01 says it's 16 quid cheap by the way.

25:46.240 --> 25:51.440
Why don't they just put a gigantic red warning label that takes off half the box that says

25:51.440 --> 25:57.720
not for kids and then honestly it will sell more copies if it has that sticker on it.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.760
Because people here don't give a shit.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.760
They don't read the box.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.760
The kids read the box.

26:04.760 --> 26:05.920
Their parents don't read the box.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.040
They expect the person behind the counter to babysit for them.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
And guess what?

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
No.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.040
And then they get all mad.

26:14.040 --> 26:19.960
Oh, but my little kid has this game and they're spanking people in it.

26:19.960 --> 26:25.000
Well, why didn't you supervise the purchase?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.560
Hi?

26:27.560 --> 26:29.640
So I guess it's just too much for us.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.560
Do your damn job.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.800
You could import it I guess if you really wanted.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.280
But I will send a bunch of American candy.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
Will this come out in Canada?

26:38.280 --> 26:39.280
To anyone.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.280
I wonder.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.280
I think that's a fair question to ask.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.280
Maybe it will come out in Canada.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.840
I can get it from Amazon CA.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.840
Uh huh.

26:44.840 --> 26:45.840
Ooh, let's check.

26:45.840 --> 26:46.840
Exactly.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.840
All right.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
Meanwhile, I'm going to move on to something else.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.640
Although if they get me President Cat, first I'll be happy.

26:51.640 --> 26:55.080
I'm going to move on to something else that sounds like a lot of fun, but in a totally,

26:55.080 --> 26:56.180
totally different way.

26:56.180 --> 27:00.760
This isn't really naughty fun so much as it is, well, you know, you know the dark soccer

27:00.760 --> 27:01.760
myself.

27:01.760 --> 27:04.720
I like Disneyland more than anything and this has to do with the theme park.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.960
I do like booze a lot.

27:07.960 --> 27:08.960
Is there a beer land?

27:08.960 --> 27:12.340
Like, is there like a Disneyland that's just booze everywhere?

27:12.340 --> 27:13.340
Probably not.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.400
Anyhow, this probably won't be it either.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
There's a California adventure.

27:16.400 --> 27:23.520
A brand new amusement park in China that is going to feature Warcraft and Starcraft sections

27:23.520 --> 27:24.520
in it.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.520
This is legitimate.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.520
This is not like a trolling thing.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.680
There's pictures of construction that are showing up already.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.240
By the way, not coming out in Canada.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
It's not on their list.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.240
Oh, bummer.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.240
All right.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.920
The park is called Joyland.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.720
It's going to be in the Wuzhen District of China.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.000
There's going to be five district areas.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.240
World of Legend, Mole's World, the Island of Mystery, and then there is Universe of

27:45.240 --> 27:48.460
Starcraft and Terrain of Warcraft.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.900
The park is supposed to be opening in March.

27:50.900 --> 27:54.620
Some pictures have leaked to the internet and you can see the construction going on

27:54.620 --> 27:56.000
there and it looks pretty impressive.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.460
Like they're actually building like a castle that looks like the one in Stormwind and one

27:59.460 --> 28:04.320
of those little outpost thingies that the aliens have in Starcraft.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.480
This actually looks really cool.

28:06.480 --> 28:15.640
It's a huge, huge infringement of intellectual property, but because you have the whole international

28:15.640 --> 28:21.080
thing coming into play, it's really hard to say what Blizzard can actually do about it.

28:21.080 --> 28:26.740
Now, some of the big blogs here in the US have tried to reach out to Blizzard for comment,

28:26.740 --> 28:28.960
but of course I don't think Blizzard's going to say anything publicly.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.920
We wish we thought of this first.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.520
Well, that's kind of what I was getting to is that a lot of people, you know, you've

28:34.520 --> 28:37.080
seen this kind of spread across game blogs this week and so forth.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.400
A lot of people think this is a cool idea.

28:39.400 --> 28:45.360
So why don't we have some type of video game theme park already if there's so much interest

28:45.360 --> 28:46.880
in something like this?

28:46.880 --> 28:48.960
Like for real, why don't we have like a video game theme park?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.280
We've got a Harry Potter park too late.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.960
Why not?

28:52.960 --> 28:59.000
Do you think that maybe the audience is just not, I mean, for a World of Warcraft theme

28:59.000 --> 29:02.240
land in a park, people wouldn't be into that?

29:02.240 --> 29:08.180
I think that they're looking at overall closures of theme parks in the US and thinking that

29:08.180 --> 29:14.600
something like that would be too much of a risk to venture the money on.

29:14.600 --> 29:18.360
Why not try to fix something that's already there?

29:18.360 --> 29:20.580
And I'll give you a great example, honestly.

29:20.580 --> 29:25.520
Here in Northern California, one of the only theme parks we have is a place called Great

29:25.520 --> 29:28.200
America in Santa Clara.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.680
And that place used to be awesome, but it's kind of gone downhill in the past couple of

29:31.680 --> 29:32.680
years.

29:32.680 --> 29:36.600
And then they lost the Paramount licensing so they don't have Top Gun the ride anymore.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.800
It's Flight Deck.

29:38.800 --> 29:42.680
And I think the only like tie-ins they have is they have like Nickelodeon areas and they

29:42.680 --> 29:45.160
have a Survivor ride.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.800
Yes, they turned the TV show Survivor into a ride.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.800
It's actually really cool.

29:49.800 --> 29:53.440
It's one of the better rides in the park, honestly, but it's just basically a little

29:53.440 --> 29:56.600
disc-oriented rollercoaster that really has nothing to do with the damn show.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.160
You don't vote people off the ride or nothing.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.160
That'd be cool.

29:59.160 --> 30:05.160
But my thought is, why not try to team up with a park that's badly in need of some fresh

30:05.160 --> 30:06.420
air?

30:06.420 --> 30:09.160
Or here's another great example, Knott's Berry Farm.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.680
I've never been.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.640
Knott's Berry Farm's always kind of been the laughing little brother sitting in Disneyland's

30:15.640 --> 30:16.640
shadow.

30:16.640 --> 30:21.000
And so maybe something like this could help bolster a park's image and give people a reason

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
to go.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.840
Especially, I mean, Great America being in Santa Clara, being in the heart of Silicon

30:25.840 --> 30:29.480
Valley, is there any better place to build a theme park?

30:29.480 --> 30:30.840
Right.

30:30.840 --> 30:31.840
They should do it.

30:31.840 --> 30:32.840
I think they should do it.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.840
Or they should just buy it.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.280
I mean, Blizzard could probably sneeze and buy it, you know, with their rich money snot,

30:38.280 --> 30:39.280
I guess.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.280
Yeah, I know.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.580
So Bobby is linking me to this.

30:42.580 --> 30:47.160
And I remember he was telling me about this before previously.

30:47.160 --> 30:54.400
There's this website, I guess, of folks that are trying to build a theme park called DemandGameNation.com.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.000
So I'm actually bringing up this website real quick.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.920
So I apologize for any autoplay that's on here.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.460
The first experimental video game theme park and resort.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.240
And they show kind of all the latest news.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.240
Let's see.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
What is this?

31:07.240 --> 31:09.200
Let me click on this.

31:09.200 --> 31:17.640
In the next 12 months, we'll be deciding the best location for the experimental theme park.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.880
Visitors will be players as their dreams and fantasies come to life and adventures yet

31:20.880 --> 31:22.540
to be told.

31:22.540 --> 31:26.840
So in the next 12 months, they'll tell us where they're thinking about building the

31:26.840 --> 31:27.840
park.

31:27.840 --> 31:35.640
Dude, I'm telling you, just take something existing that needs the help, seriously.

31:35.640 --> 31:40.680
But I'm glad at least some people are already on it, but that's a monumental undertaking.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.840
That's going to take a lot of money and investments.

31:42.840 --> 31:48.480
And you're right, Jamie, theme parks haven't been doing so well in the recession.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.120
In fact, theme parks have been closing and so forth.

31:51.120 --> 31:54.720
So I really think, I don't know, the smart thing would be to team up with a theme park

31:54.720 --> 31:56.280
that's already there.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.360
Buy an old one out and do your thing.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.000
Reimagine the rides.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Exactly.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.680
And build it somewhere where people are going to want to visit for other stuff too.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.860
Don't build it, you know, in South Dakota.

32:08.860 --> 32:15.120
No offense to the residents of South Dakota, but, you know, you got what?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
Mount Rushmore?

32:16.120 --> 32:18.440
Hi, I'm in Delaware.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.440
So you know what I mean?

32:19.440 --> 32:21.480
You got to build it somewhere where people are going to want to go.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
Seriously?

32:22.480 --> 32:25.640
Tiger Claw on chat says, you know, we need an orange lounge radio theme park.

32:25.640 --> 32:30.560
You know, I'm just not thinking there's going to be enough of an audience for that.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.720
Maybe what we could get is we could get a booth at the video game theme park.

32:34.720 --> 32:39.640
We would get a little corner of a room, the orange lounge radio booth.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.320
That would probably be the best we could do.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.320
All right.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.080
We'd have, actually we probably wouldn't even have a booth.

32:45.080 --> 32:47.400
We'd probably just, you know, be outside the front door.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
Exactly.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.400
It's cold.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.400
We're so cold.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.040
Let us in.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.040
You know what?

32:53.040 --> 32:55.880
We get to drive the bus that goes from the parking lot to the front.

32:55.880 --> 32:56.880
That's what we'll get to do.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.260
We get to clean up after the tram.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.760
And we'll get to, you know, give the little speech.

33:00.760 --> 33:04.040
Hey guys, it's the orange lounge radio safety speech.

33:04.040 --> 33:07.700
No eating, no drinking, no smoking.

33:07.700 --> 33:15.080
Keep your arms, feet, hands, legs, and ass inside the tram at all times.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.680
That'll be us.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.480
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

33:22.480 --> 33:23.480
Yeah.

33:23.480 --> 33:31.640
Well, how about, um, something a little bit, well, it kind of makes me laugh, because Portal

33:31.640 --> 33:41.840
2, well, the German Playstation blog was told that it completely supports the move.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.920
But it's not fully integrated yet.

33:43.920 --> 33:49.160
Actually, Valve's like, no.

33:49.160 --> 33:52.400
It was mistranslated from the English to the German.

33:52.400 --> 33:58.520
And then, of course, translated from the messed up German back into English.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.680
So nope.

33:59.680 --> 34:08.560
They say that for the PC it will support the Hydra controller, and that it's going to support

34:08.560 --> 34:11.720
the regular console controllers, but no move.

34:11.720 --> 34:16.960
It could be patched in, but when asked about it, they said, who knows.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.240
We don't know that it'll make the game better.

34:19.240 --> 34:24.680
There's games that the Kinect and the Move are great for, but not this one.

34:24.680 --> 34:31.480
So as they said, though, for the Hydra, that they actually invented puzzles specifically

34:31.480 --> 34:34.480
for how the Hydra would work.

34:34.480 --> 34:39.640
So no move, oops, nine.

34:39.640 --> 34:45.640
I thought it would be a little weird if they just suddenly put the Move in, because, you

34:45.640 --> 34:50.760
know, the PS3 version of Portal 2 is already going to have all these extra features that

34:50.760 --> 34:57.640
aren't on the regular, or I'm sorry, not the regular, the Xbox 360 version, the USB-C version.

34:57.640 --> 35:01.560
With the whole Steam integration and everything like that.

35:01.560 --> 35:06.520
So it would be weird if they had the Move in the PS3 version and then nothing for Kinect.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.200
It would just be weird.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.480
Who said Loki and Tingle?

35:11.480 --> 35:12.480
Oh, that's...

35:12.480 --> 35:14.840
They're talking about the stupid theme park.

35:14.840 --> 35:20.720
This OLR theme park they want to have, where the ferret and President Kat would be mascots.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.720
That's fantastic.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.720
I love our chat room.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.720
Frisbee says there'd be a roller coaster.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.720
I love our chat room.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
Oh, boy.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.040
Alright, let's travel the world and check out some release dates, things that are actually

35:29.040 --> 35:34.200
happening near you at a local game store near you.

35:34.200 --> 35:37.440
Coming out this week in the US, since Loki's not here, I'll do the US dates real quick.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.080
Do the Loki voice.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.480
What's the Loki voice?

35:40.480 --> 35:43.900
We got some stuff coming out.

35:43.900 --> 35:44.900
This game's coming out.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.240
It's probably gonna suck.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.240
And some shit on PlayStation 3.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.240
God damn you, Nintendo.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.240
God damn you.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.480
God damn you for releasing this game, Rango.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.480
Who's gonna play that?

35:53.480 --> 35:56.760
Yeah, it's the dude in the Loki voice so that we can pretend we have him here.

35:56.760 --> 35:59.960
March 1st is when Rango comes out on the Wii.

35:59.960 --> 36:00.960
Is that a movie or something?

36:00.960 --> 36:01.960
I think it is.

36:01.960 --> 36:02.960
Johnny Depp does a voice, I guess.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.000
I think there's a lot of people interested in Rift, though.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.680
That is coming out on March 1st.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.160
I believe some people already have it.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.280
If you pre-ordered it, you get the whole early access.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.520
The official release date for the game is March 1st.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.440
This is a new MMO.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.440
Some people are saying it's the WoW Killer, but I hate that term.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.640
It's not the WoW Killer.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.320
The only WoW Killer is WoW.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
Like the Remnant Empire.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.320
Yep.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.780
Disgaea, the Afternoon of Darkness on the PSP comes out this week.

36:26.780 --> 36:30.300
More versions of Rango on other systems, including the Xbox 360, blah blah blah.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.780
A brand new racing wheel, if you're so inclined.

36:32.780 --> 36:37.040
You need one for your PC, you can get a $300 racing wheel.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.100
Should I show that to Dan?

36:39.100 --> 36:42.280
Fight Night Champion comes out on the Xbox 360 as well.

36:42.280 --> 36:45.600
And Mahjong Journey, Quest for Tikal.

36:45.600 --> 36:51.480
For you Mahjong fans on the DS, oh boy, it's party time this week.

36:51.480 --> 36:52.480
Let's see if there's anything else here.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.200
I'm the people who really, really like Mahjong.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.680
Well, it's party time.

36:55.680 --> 37:00.320
Disgaea 3, Absence of Justice on the PS3, oh that's a pretty big one there.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.320
Sounds like life at my house.

37:01.320 --> 37:07.280
Yeah, there's some folks that have fun with Disgaea.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.600
That's coming out.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.960
And Fight Night Champion also comes out on the PS3.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.720
Chuck E. Cheese's Sports Games comes out on the Wii.

37:15.720 --> 37:16.720
Really?

37:16.720 --> 37:18.800
What is the Chuck E. Cheese Sports Games?

37:18.800 --> 37:21.240
Is it dodging bullets?

37:21.240 --> 37:24.440
And what else happens at Chuck E. Cheese these days?

37:24.440 --> 37:27.560
Fights that break out at the tables with the animatronic characters.

37:27.560 --> 37:31.080
Like, I don't know if you read the stories about all the really, really terrible things

37:31.080 --> 37:34.820
that happen at Chuck E. Cheese, but let me just say, it's not a place I would ever take

37:34.820 --> 37:35.820
my child.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.520
No, no.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.680
Chuck E. Cheese was awesome when we were kids.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.680
Yes, it was.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.400
Now it's a dangerous place.

37:42.400 --> 37:50.120
Now it's a frightening place, loaded with bad food and unwashed children.

37:50.120 --> 37:55.760
Puzzle Expedition comes out on the Nintendo DS this week, and let's see if there's anything

37:55.760 --> 37:57.400
else here I want to mention.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.880
Minute to Win It on the Nintendo DS as well.

37:59.880 --> 38:04.520
If you're a fan of that crappy game show, then you can get a crappy game to go with

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
it.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
I've never heard of that one, Rob.

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
What is that?

38:07.520 --> 38:09.920
It's hosted by that guy on the Food Network with the bleached hair who's like 15 years

38:09.920 --> 38:10.920
old.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.640
And it's like, dude, you're too old to bleach your hair.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.640
He's such a bro.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.640
He is.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.640
He's a dude bro.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.960
And he hosts this show where they give away like a million fucking dollars if he can throw

38:18.960 --> 38:21.080
ping pong balls into cups.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.520
Like it's the weirdest.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
That's bizarre.

38:23.520 --> 38:30.400
It's like, you know, the budget is that of going to Target and buying plastic wreaths

38:30.400 --> 38:34.320
that they build games out of and they give away a million dollars.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.320
And I guess that's a whole-

38:35.320 --> 38:38.780
We made this game out of the dollar store.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.980
So here's the deal, guys.

38:41.980 --> 38:49.080
If you want to play the home version of Minute to Win It, you could spend $40 on the DS version

38:49.080 --> 38:54.420
or you could go to the 99 cent clearance center and buy some ping pong balls and some plastic

38:54.420 --> 38:59.680
cups and play the actual games that they play on the show.

38:59.680 --> 39:05.760
Or you could pay 10 times as much and play some fake shit.

39:05.760 --> 39:11.120
Shitty.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.880
I am astounded every day at what goes on in this industry.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.800
People are tarred.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.320
And folks in chat rooms speaking up there, Defective Candy says his name is Guy and he's

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
from the Food Network.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
Yes, that's his name.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.320
Guy.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.320
I think he owns a joint.

39:25.320 --> 39:27.320
Isn't Johnny Garlic's his chain or is that someone else?

39:27.320 --> 39:28.560
I have no idea.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.560
Guy Fairey.

39:29.560 --> 39:30.560
Yeah.

39:30.560 --> 39:31.560
That's it.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.560
I think he owns that Johnny Garlic's.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.560
There's one of those out in Roseville.

39:33.560 --> 39:34.560
Overpriced.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.560
Yeah.

39:35.560 --> 39:42.520
Anyhow, William Murderface in chat says it's beer pong for kids.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.520
Kinda.

39:43.520 --> 39:44.520
Kinda.

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
I'm serious.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
I'm serious.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.840
Dark Sakura, I would love nothing more.

39:48.840 --> 39:52.560
You know how people do like those YouTube reaction shots of people watching Two Girl

39:52.560 --> 39:54.480
One Cup for the first time or whatever?

39:54.480 --> 39:55.480
Yeah.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.360
What I would like to do is I'd like to have a reaction shot of you watching Minute to

39:58.360 --> 40:03.180
Win It for the first time and just you going, what the fuck is this?

40:03.180 --> 40:04.180
People fucking watch this?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.640
This is why I don't watch TV.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.440
This is a million dollars they give away for this?

40:08.440 --> 40:10.400
I have to say something to X-Link real quick.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.400
What's that?

40:11.400 --> 40:13.240
Says that he needs to lose weight and not talk about food.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.320
No, I don't want a skinny chef.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
That's true.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.440
You don't trust a skinny chef.

40:18.440 --> 40:26.360
Julia Childs or those two fat British women who made everything with cream and lard because

40:26.360 --> 40:31.160
you know their food was fucking delicious.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.960
I want the fat British women to cook my food.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.960
All right.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.440
I have to think one of them died.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.440
Can I do Japanese releases?

40:36.440 --> 40:37.440
Yeah, I guess.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
All right.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.660
Coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360, Borderlands and a Hokuto Musou get price

40:42.660 --> 40:45.040
reductions because they go into the platinum collections.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.160
Friday Night Champion is the new release to look for on the Xbox 360 this week.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.640
Moving on to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they get Fight Night Champion there as well.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
Yep.

40:53.640 --> 40:57.840
They also get Samurai Dou 4 comes out there from Spike.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.560
That is a, what kind of game is this here?

41:00.560 --> 41:02.720
I'm trying to look at some of the screenshots.

41:02.720 --> 41:08.920
This looks like kind of like a adventure-y type of Yakuza-y type of game, but set in

41:08.920 --> 41:13.880
more like the ancient Japan and I doubt it's quite as in depth as those Yakuza games because

41:13.880 --> 41:17.800
I don't know if you ever played those games, but man, there's like tons of stuff you can

41:17.800 --> 41:19.240
do in them.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.320
On the Nintendo Wii this week, nothing.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.480
It's the Nintendo Wii.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.240
There's nothing coming out for it.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.200
On the Nintendo 3DS, yes, we have to start reading those dates now.

41:28.200 --> 41:32.760
On the 3DS, Shanghai 3D Cube and Super Monkey Ball 3D come out this week.

41:32.760 --> 41:33.760
More Mahjong!

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
More Mahjong!

41:34.760 --> 41:35.760
That's right.

41:35.760 --> 41:41.120
Oh, by the way, Rob, apparently Betty White won for sound mixing in Inception.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.760
No one curr.

41:42.760 --> 41:50.720
On the Nintendo DS, we have Digimon Story in Super Stross Wars Red and Blue.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.720
Digimon, Dr. Soccer, you were the only person I knew that liked Digimon.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.240
Oh, I liked the anime.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.880
And then you don't like the games?

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
I had a Digimon.

41:58.880 --> 42:03.200
Lastly, on the PSP, this is a huge, huge release, probably the biggest release of the week,

42:03.200 --> 42:08.080
Dissida 012, Duodecim Final Fantasy, that's right, the sequel to Final Fantasy Dissida

42:08.080 --> 42:12.120
makes its way out in Japan this week on the PSP, so I'm sure there will be a lot of folks

42:12.120 --> 42:13.120
into that.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.160
Alright, how about the UK?

42:16.160 --> 42:18.420
Well for the UK, we do have some interesting news.

42:18.420 --> 42:23.080
This is BBC2 bringing you the news on game releases in the United Kingdom.

42:23.080 --> 42:30.760
Okay, actually on the first we have Fable 3, again, Fable 3 was kind of crap.

42:30.760 --> 42:37.840
We have Two Worlds 2, we have Beyond Good and Evil HD, that one's on the second by the

42:37.840 --> 42:38.840
way.

42:38.840 --> 42:43.400
On the fourth we have Fight Night Champion, Hybrid Dimension Neptunia, Pokemon Black,

42:43.400 --> 42:50.480
Pokemon White, Rift, Planes of Who Gives a Crap, I mean, sorry, Talara, and U-Draw.

42:50.480 --> 42:55.120
It wasn't that bad, Rift was interesting, but I don't know, I can't pay for another

42:55.120 --> 42:57.360
MMO right now, I've got too many other expenses to worry about.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.520
I can't pay for them either.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.520
So, that's it?

43:00.520 --> 43:01.520
That's it.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.660
Alright, then let's move on to some rapid fire news, we're gonna go over some news very

43:05.660 --> 43:06.800
quickly here.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.640
By the way, this is your last chance to get the Twitter topics in, we're gonna be doing

43:09.640 --> 43:14.280
Twitter topics in just a moment, so get those in at Twitter.com slash O-L-R, we're gonna

43:14.280 --> 43:16.680
be doing those in just a minute.

43:16.680 --> 43:20.560
But first, I'm gonna start off with some rapid fire news, some quick stuff.

43:20.560 --> 43:25.560
Dragon Age 2, the demo for that hit Xbox Live, and it's getting a lot of good reception out

43:25.560 --> 43:28.280
there, it's also on the PC and so forth.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.440
Dragon Age 2 is gonna be coming out very soon, and they have announced that there's going

43:31.440 --> 43:37.180
to be a theme song in the game by Florence and the Machine, who's a pretty popular band

43:37.180 --> 43:38.440
these days.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.720
They were really indie for a while, and then she did the dog days are over thing at the

43:41.720 --> 43:44.600
MTV awards, and it just blew up, they're huge, they're everywhere.

43:44.600 --> 43:50.200
Anyway, she's really awesome, actually, and a song from the album Lungs, called I'm Not

43:50.200 --> 43:53.440
Calling You a Liar, is being reimagined.

43:53.440 --> 43:58.280
So it's gonna be called I'm Not Calling You a Liar, Dragon Age 2, Variks theme.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.920
Here's the original, if you want a taste of what the song sounds like.

44:00.920 --> 44:19.400
So you kinda get the idea, they'll rework that song a little bit, it's not gonna sound

44:19.400 --> 44:22.640
just like that, but that's gonna be the theme song for Dragon Age 2.

44:22.640 --> 44:27.680
Some websites shut down this week, some community-based websites, as you probably heard about before

44:27.680 --> 44:33.360
on the show before us, Bobby Black Wolf Show, 360 Junkies was a blog about the 360, and

44:33.360 --> 44:36.680
unfortunately they had to close their door this week due to personal issues.

44:36.680 --> 44:41.180
Mygamercard.net was a pretty big website in the community that also had to shut down this

44:41.180 --> 44:44.520
week, so we lost two good ones this week, unfortunately.

44:44.520 --> 44:49.360
The story behind mygamercard.net, though, a little more dramatic.

44:49.360 --> 44:53.920
The founder of the website, Jason Young, left a pretty big goodbye on the site, saying,

44:53.920 --> 45:00.000
quote, the love for community has been lost by Microsoft, saying that a lot of the community

45:00.000 --> 45:06.520
stuff that has been going on has stagnated, and even used the term lack of respect, ouch.

45:06.520 --> 45:11.240
But yeah, it does seem like things have changed a little bit community-wise over at Xbox.

45:11.240 --> 45:17.360
I mean, you know, they closed the Gamerscore blog a little while ago, I know Trixie360

45:17.360 --> 45:21.480
isn't involved anymore, she went to another company, you know, it's just...

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
She's great.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.960
Yeah, she's cool, and it's just different over there now.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.280
So it's, I don't know, it's kind of unfortunate.

45:28.280 --> 45:32.120
I wonder if this will serve as a wake-up call to Microsoft.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.880
Maybe there will be some type of community thing in response.

45:34.880 --> 45:38.160
I think it's going to be very interesting to see if Microsoft responds to this, or if

45:38.160 --> 45:39.160
they just don't care.

45:39.160 --> 45:41.720
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that.

45:41.720 --> 45:46.000
Because a lot of people were using that GamerCard service, you know, on their websites, and

45:46.000 --> 45:48.320
I even had it on my LiveJournal.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.320
We had a little, you know...

45:49.320 --> 45:51.440
Yeah, set it up when it worked.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.760
Just for kicks.

45:52.760 --> 45:53.760
Yeah.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.760
Unfortunately, yeah, they're shut down, so yikes.

45:57.760 --> 46:03.560
Anyhow, one other quick thing I want to mention to you guys, it's something called Every Air.

46:03.560 --> 46:10.040
It's a program that will let you play PlayStation 3 games on an iOS device, like the iPhone,

46:10.040 --> 46:12.720
the iPad, or the iPod, what have you.

46:12.720 --> 46:17.120
Yeah, it's a group of iOS developers that are working on a customizable software that

46:17.120 --> 46:21.060
lets you play high-end PS3 games on your iOS.

46:21.060 --> 46:26.220
So it's something where they've done this with wrangling of hardware and software.

46:26.220 --> 46:30.960
They will actually let you play PS3 games on the iPhone, iPad, and so on.

46:30.960 --> 46:34.800
I think what's going on, they actually like stream it.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.760
They explain how this works.

46:36.760 --> 46:42.680
The trick is to connect a capture device and a USB mouse keyboard device to the PS3.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.500
The capture device sends video data to the PC, and the USB keyboard and mouse sends the

46:47.500 --> 46:48.680
button presses.

46:48.680 --> 46:53.400
On the PC itself, you run a custom build of Every Air, which understands custom gestures

46:53.400 --> 46:59.560
and pipes the input into the PC, which then sends it to the PS3 via the input interpreter.

46:59.560 --> 47:04.160
Gotta be honest, this sounds like a whole lot for what's not going to be very practical,

47:04.160 --> 47:06.160
but they do show some video of this thing running.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.960
There's a whole little YouTube there.

47:07.960 --> 47:12.360
Let's see if we can get past the animation there, get to this thing actually working.

47:12.360 --> 47:18.600
Yeah, there's somebody playing LittleBigPlanet on their phone, starting it up.

47:18.600 --> 47:24.960
So, I don't know though, that seems like a lot just to get that working on your iPod.

47:24.960 --> 47:28.240
It doesn't, I don't know.

47:28.240 --> 47:32.120
But hey, it's one of those things where it's like installing Linux on a toaster.

47:32.120 --> 47:33.120
Why do it?

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
Because we can.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
Exactly.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.040
We do what we must because we can.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.040
Absolutely.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.040
So there you go.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.040
Yeah.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.040
Well, how about some other news, Rob?

47:43.040 --> 47:49.120
First of all, the PlayStation, sorry, the PSP, is going to be having a price drop.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.240
It's going to go down to $130.

47:52.240 --> 47:56.400
So I wonder if that's, you know, preparing the market, maybe clearing out some inventory

47:56.400 --> 48:01.160
for the new thingies coming out, but, you know, they've been slashing them, so now it's

48:01.160 --> 48:02.680
actually somewhat affordable.

48:02.680 --> 48:06.280
Who knows, right?

48:06.280 --> 48:08.840
And another happy, happy, happy news.

48:08.840 --> 48:13.040
The Legend of Zelda celebrates 25 years.

48:13.040 --> 48:20.640
We have had Legend of Zelda for a very long time, older than a lot of our listeners.

48:20.640 --> 48:25.920
And of course, we are going to be seeing Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword coming out, hopefully

48:25.920 --> 48:28.520
before too long.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.520
And pretty cool stuff.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.840
Rob, did you start off with the first one?

48:34.840 --> 48:35.840
Which one?

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
I'm sorry.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.840
The first Legend of Zelda.

48:37.840 --> 48:38.840
Oh, gosh, yes.

48:38.840 --> 48:39.840
Of course.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
That was my very first Zelda game.

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
I remember playing that in the fourth grade.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.840
That was one of the first games I had to buy for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
Fantastic game.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.840
And it was gold.

48:46.840 --> 48:51.560
Except I'm sad that it's 25 years old, because that means I'm old.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.880
No.

48:52.880 --> 48:58.600
And then there is an Xbox Live Arcade game that's a Minecraft clone.

48:58.600 --> 49:07.800
Actually it's done by Projector Games, and it's called, well, I just said, Fortresscraft.

49:07.800 --> 49:12.360
There's a Twitter for it, and they're releasing aspects of the game in different chapters.

49:12.360 --> 49:19.760
Chapter one is Minecraft Creative, chapter two is Crafting, three is Life, four is Machinery,

49:19.760 --> 49:24.860
five is Minions, six is PvP, seven is Fortress Assault Mode.

49:24.860 --> 49:29.560
So it says that the first chapter is going to be coming out for a dollar.

49:29.560 --> 49:34.040
March 4th, 80 bucks.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.040
Beware the Ides of March.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.040
Alright.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.040
That's not the fourth, is it?

49:37.040 --> 49:38.040
Whatever.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.040
Not yet.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.040
So yeah.

49:40.040 --> 49:45.000
Alright, let's go to the Twitter, and read some of the Twitter topics you guys have sent

49:45.000 --> 49:46.880
us tonight.

49:46.880 --> 49:50.480
Which isn't a lot.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.120
The tweets are looking very thin tonight, it must be because everybody's tweeting about

49:53.120 --> 49:54.720
the Oscars, I don't know.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
They're watching Betty White.

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
I guess.

49:56.720 --> 50:01.600
Let's see, going to Morning Wolf on Twitter says, I thought of you guys when I played

50:01.600 --> 50:02.600
pinball yesterday.

50:02.600 --> 50:03.600
Oh, that's sweet.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.600
What's going on in the pinball world?

50:06.600 --> 50:09.160
Pinacogo's coming up I think next month.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.640
What, Pinacogo's that big convention?

50:10.640 --> 50:11.640
Is that the one in Dixon?

50:11.640 --> 50:12.640
I think it's the one in Dixon.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.640
Oh god.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.760
But apparently they actually use the air conditioner now.

50:15.760 --> 50:16.760
Oh, that's good.

50:16.760 --> 50:17.760
That'll be good.

50:17.760 --> 50:20.080
Last year it was still too hot.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.680
Are there any new pinball tables that have come out recently?

50:22.680 --> 50:23.920
Whatever Stern's put out.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.560
Oh yeah, there was the, they had a Dark Knight table, I remember seeing it.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.880
Stern's the only one doing anything.

50:28.880 --> 50:32.640
The last one, the last new table of theirs that I played was Iron Man.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
Oh wow.

50:33.640 --> 50:38.560
And that was last year at Classic Gaming Expo.

50:38.560 --> 50:42.880
Let's see, Flaming Toilet was blanking on our email wanting to know if it was mailbag

50:42.880 --> 50:44.080
at OrangeLaundry.com.

50:44.080 --> 50:47.320
It is actually mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.880
There you go.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.440
Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet that is Grand Theft Auto related.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.880
Well, I've got to say this in honor of Loki not being here tonight.

50:54.880 --> 51:00.680
Apparently Take Two has registered some Grand Theft Auto style domains.

51:00.680 --> 51:09.680
They include CashForDeadDreams.com, SixFigureTemps.com, LifeInvader.com, StopPayingYourMortgage.net,

51:09.680 --> 51:13.000
and HammersteinFaust.com.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.440
People are thinking that this all kind of sounds like the parodies that happen in Grand

51:16.440 --> 51:17.440
Theft Auto.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.600
It is Take Two that actually registered these domains, they're not just like random things

51:20.600 --> 51:21.600
out of the blue.

51:21.600 --> 51:24.800
So yeah, these are probably some of the gags that are coming up in the next Grand Theft

51:24.800 --> 51:30.320
Auto game, which everybody is anticipating will be a huge announcement at E3 this year.

51:30.320 --> 51:31.320
We'll see.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.760
It looks like a few more people have sent you tweets.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.960
I'm looking, I'm looking.

51:35.960 --> 51:44.160
Oh yes, SSJ100Matt is sending us a tweet about the whole, ah yes, Chinatown Fair has closed

51:44.160 --> 51:47.200
its doors and that officially happened on Saturday.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.640
You know, some of my friends on Twitter, not to hijack and talk about a different subject,

51:50.640 --> 51:55.600
but some of my friends on Twitter were at AI, which closed their doors last night, Saturday,

51:55.600 --> 51:57.760
was like the last night of Arcade Infinity.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.960
So there was a bunch of people there.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.400
Isn't that weird how that happened on both coasts at the same time?

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
Yeah.

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
Kind of creepster.

52:03.400 --> 52:06.640
But yeah, Arcade Infinity closed its doors last night and then we have now Chinatown

52:06.640 --> 52:10.240
Fair did actually close.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.400
Sad.

52:11.400 --> 52:15.400
Supposedly though, there is some hope, it does sound like they're going to move to an

52:15.400 --> 52:18.360
unspecified location in Williamsburg.

52:18.360 --> 52:23.440
So perhaps it's not gone forever, it will just be in a new place.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.360
I'd hate to see all those pretty machines go to waste.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.360
Look at that.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.920
They have little sit down super street fighter machines.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.320
Last call was at 1245 AM.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.320
Aww.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.320
Bye guys.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.320
Good luck.

52:34.320 --> 52:37.760
I'm always sad to see more Arcades close.

52:37.760 --> 52:39.160
Alright.

52:39.160 --> 52:40.560
One last tweet for you guys here.

52:40.560 --> 52:42.960
This is from Tigerclaw.

52:42.960 --> 52:46.080
It's a Kinect 3D printing mechanism.

52:46.080 --> 52:54.480
Yeah, it's some type of, it's called Fabricate Yourself and it uses 3D models that the Kinect

52:54.480 --> 52:58.960
captures to make 3D printed figures.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.460
Interesting.

53:00.460 --> 53:04.440
They were showing this off at what was called the Tangible Embedded and Embodied Interaction

53:04.440 --> 53:05.440
Conference.

53:05.440 --> 53:10.200
They took some attendees, had their shapes captured with Kinect and then they got turned

53:10.200 --> 53:13.400
into big giant puzzle pieces.

53:13.400 --> 53:18.340
So all these like people that were at the expo kind of all went into these puzzle pieces

53:18.340 --> 53:20.800
and I can't really explain this on the radio.

53:20.800 --> 53:25.320
But I don't know, they look like little bars of soap with raised imprints of people.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.960
But that's kind of cool that they use Kinect to I guess, you know, do that really cheap,

53:29.960 --> 53:33.280
I don't want to say motion cap, but kind of that same technology where they can outline

53:33.280 --> 53:34.720
a body real quick with that.

53:34.720 --> 53:35.720
So that's pretty cool.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.400
Rob, Rob, breaking news.

53:37.400 --> 53:38.400
What's that?

53:38.400 --> 53:41.320
JC Penney has a new logo and it's shitty.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.400
Who cares?

53:42.400 --> 53:43.760
I care.

53:43.760 --> 53:44.760
Alright.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.760
That's it for the tweets tonight.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.920
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us some more tweets for next time.

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
Meanwhile.

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
Look at that.

53:52.920 --> 53:53.920
It's horrible.

53:53.920 --> 53:54.920
What are they thinking?

53:54.920 --> 53:55.920
Who cares?

53:55.920 --> 53:56.920
Remember it's a video game show.

53:56.920 --> 53:57.920
Remember?

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
I care.

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
I'm a designer.

53:59.920 --> 54:00.920
I care.

54:00.920 --> 54:01.920
Alright.

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
Moving on.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
And apparently Trent Reznor won an Oscar.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Well now that's, that's a little better.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
Alright.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
Yeah.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.560
More Guitar Hero and DJ Hero download content is actually coming.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.660
This is a little bit surprising because people were thinking that when Activision closed

54:12.660 --> 54:14.720
down the franchises, they were done for good.

54:14.720 --> 54:19.600
In fact, the official Twitter feeds at a one time said there's not going to be any more

54:19.600 --> 54:22.120
content, but they have changed course this week.

54:22.120 --> 54:28.320
Both series said on their Twitter feeds that feeds that continued support from the communities

54:28.320 --> 54:29.900
have announced a change.

54:29.900 --> 54:33.380
They will be doing more DLC for both franchises.

54:33.380 --> 54:37.080
Now we don't usually see weekly content in these games.

54:37.080 --> 54:41.040
It's usually more of a monthly thing, but it's still kind of exciting that there'll

54:41.040 --> 54:45.600
be something else, especially because that whole pendulum pack went to a DJ Hero last

54:45.600 --> 54:46.600
time.

54:46.600 --> 54:47.600
That was a pretty awesome pack.

54:47.600 --> 54:51.240
So more information coming soon.

54:51.240 --> 54:53.240
And of course that's all we know.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
Soon.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
Tempting us.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
I know.

54:56.240 --> 55:02.880
Well, you know Telltale, they're a company that we're a pretty big fans of.

55:02.880 --> 55:07.600
Well they wanted to do a Scott Pilgrim game and we're told no.

55:07.600 --> 55:14.160
The creator, Brian Lee O'Malley said, he put it on his Twitter that they approached him,

55:14.160 --> 55:16.080
but he did not want it to be an Avenger game.

55:16.080 --> 55:21.680
He wanted it to be a platformer, which it was pretty, pretty sad though.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.520
I think it could have done both.

55:23.520 --> 55:24.520
Yeah.

55:24.520 --> 55:28.980
I'm kind of surprised, especially, well, maybe not surprised, but the movie didn't do so

55:28.980 --> 55:29.980
hot.

55:29.980 --> 55:35.920
So, I mean, maybe a, well, I don't want to say a better game because the game that came

55:35.920 --> 55:39.920
out was pretty awesome, especially in that whole eight bit throwback kind of way.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.520
And it's, it's pretty great.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.760
But I mean, another game wouldn't have, uh, I think hurt things, but maybe, and it's hard

55:46.760 --> 55:52.360
to tell from this story, but maybe, uh, Telltale wanted to do this instead of what ended up

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
ultimately happening.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.800
I mean, we don't have a timetable as to when this was asked.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.060
I mean, this could have been years ago.

55:58.060 --> 56:00.680
We know that Telltale likes to adapt things from comic books.

56:00.680 --> 56:06.320
Uh, so, you know, we had a bunch of stories last week about the walking dead, uh, having

56:06.320 --> 56:10.840
its comic book being adapted, uh, even though it's happens to be a TV show now.

56:10.840 --> 56:18.180
And then, uh, there was the fable, the, um, the fairytales fables, the adult ones that's

56:18.180 --> 56:19.500
being translated as well.

56:19.500 --> 56:23.800
So it's not like they didn't have their eyes on various comic books.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.240
So Scott Pilgrim of course was a comic book before it was a movie.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.840
So, um, that would have been great, but yeah, it would have been great, but I mean, what

56:29.840 --> 56:32.120
came out was good, was fine.

56:32.120 --> 56:33.120
Yeah.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.120
It was better than fine.

56:34.120 --> 56:35.120
It was great.

56:35.120 --> 56:36.120
Yeah.

56:36.120 --> 56:37.860
So, but it would be nice to see what they would have come up with because that probably

56:37.860 --> 56:39.080
could have been pretty awesome too.

56:39.080 --> 56:40.080
Oh yeah.

56:40.080 --> 56:46.400
So who knows, but, uh, yeah, so that is, uh, not happening.

56:46.400 --> 56:49.340
Also not happening Blockbuster.

56:49.340 --> 56:53.200
This is kind of a blast from your past, but yeah, Blockbuster is going to be selling off

56:53.200 --> 56:58.120
its assets, which are valued at $290 million.

56:58.120 --> 56:59.120
Here's the deal.

56:59.120 --> 57:04.280
Uh, a limited liability company actually bought all the funds of Blockbuster, which is Cobalt

57:04.280 --> 57:11.680
Video Hold Co, and, uh, they have actually stepped in to sell off Blockbuster's assets.

57:11.680 --> 57:18.240
Uh, so they're going to be, uh, uh, fielding offers, I guess it's $290 million is the starting

57:18.240 --> 57:19.240
point there.

57:19.240 --> 57:24.040
And, uh, they did do the bankruptcy filing some time ago, so this isn't really surprising.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.720
We've kind of seen the end coming for Blockbuster for some time.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.920
That was in September of 2010.

57:28.920 --> 57:31.480
So what happens from here, I'm not sure.

57:31.480 --> 57:36.120
I don't know if this means that somebody could step in and buy the whole damn chain and take

57:36.120 --> 57:40.000
over from there, or if this means they're just going to liquidate everything, which

57:40.000 --> 57:43.320
could be if there, especially if there isn't a buyer, uh, they'll probably end up having

57:43.320 --> 57:44.320
to do that.

57:44.320 --> 57:45.320
It's really not surprising.

57:45.320 --> 57:50.120
Um, no, they're probably going to go away.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.920
I think that's what a lot of people is expecting to happen.

57:51.920 --> 57:57.200
I mean, especially in this day, day and age of, uh, you know, the Netflix and the Amazon.

57:57.200 --> 58:03.080
Well, that's the same thing that happened with, uh, Hollywood is they liquidated, um,

58:03.080 --> 58:07.880
to try to, uh, get, to keep from going into bankruptcy, but it looks like Blockbuster's

58:07.880 --> 58:09.040
already in.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.040
Yeah.

58:10.040 --> 58:11.040
They're, they're going to go.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.040
Bye bye.

58:12.040 --> 58:13.040
Yep.

58:13.040 --> 58:17.480
So they're, they went to the mail, you know, too late in the game.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.200
They're they're gone.

58:19.200 --> 58:22.960
It's kind of weird because as I remember as a kid going to rent games at Blockbuster,

58:22.960 --> 58:26.480
so it's just kind of weird to see these things I remember from my childhood now folding and

58:26.480 --> 58:29.320
going away forever.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.440
But I mean, when was the last time I went to a Blockbuster?

58:31.440 --> 58:35.160
I couldn't even tell you a long time ago, a very long time ago.

58:35.160 --> 58:39.080
We're ready to get to the email bag, mailbag at orangeslawnsradio.com.

58:39.080 --> 58:45.560
Let us do such a thing.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.080
We have one email.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
One.

58:48.080 --> 58:53.240
Dear OLR, long time email or first time listener.

58:53.240 --> 58:57.520
I think the fall of the hero franchise is due to one simple reason.

58:57.520 --> 58:59.760
The Will and Grace Syndrome.

58:59.760 --> 59:04.000
Like the groundbreaking NBC sitcom that limped through its final seasons by stunt casting

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
out the wazoo, the equally groundbreaking Guitar Hero took the same route with its own

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
stunt casting.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.600
Ozzy Osbourne, Tom Morello, no doubt, Kurt Cobain, et cetera, limping to its final installment

59:13.600 --> 59:15.840
with Gene Simmons.

59:15.840 --> 59:19.800
While Rock Band has done this to a point, they've managed to limit it to band centric

59:19.800 --> 59:23.800
games like and such as the Beatles and Green Day Rock Band.

59:23.800 --> 59:27.960
Although they did have real bands such as Spinal Tap and Queen and Let Go Rock Band,

59:27.960 --> 59:31.480
these bands were limited to performing their own songs, making their appearances more special

59:31.480 --> 59:34.680
and less awkward.

59:34.680 --> 59:39.920
Seeing Ozzy Osbourne singing La Bamba is akin to having Madonna playing Karen Walker's trashy

59:39.920 --> 59:41.320
roommate.

59:41.320 --> 59:45.700
While it's entertaining for a moment, in the end, it makes you wonder if it really added

59:45.700 --> 59:47.800
anything besides being quick publicity.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.840
It might be fun once or twice, but after a while, you stop caring and start to get annoyed

59:50.840 --> 59:51.840
by it.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.040
Stay black and get well soon, Loki, flaming toilet.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.720
That's it.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.800
I think the emailer is actually really onto something there with the whole it just it

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:07.120
did become a bit of a carnival of sports, carnival of crap.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.920
Rock Band never kind of went there.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.840
You know, I was always able to take Rock Band more seriously.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.560
And I'll tell you what it really boiled down to for me was the support.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.440
I mean, it's funny that we had that story a little bit ago about the whole support with

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.600
the download content and more of it coming out on the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games,

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.320
because I always kind of felt that Rock Band was so much better supported with the download

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320
content.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.480
And that's part of what kind of swayed me over to that series.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.040
No, I agree.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.120
And the whole like Kurt Cobain and Slash stuff, I could care less about that in a game.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120
Yeah.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.080
And I don't know a lot of people that do care about that stuff.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.200
I mean, maybe they're out there.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:49.360
I just don't know them, but I don't think it's that big a deal.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.400
So maybe that cost them too much and ended up putting them out of business.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400
I don't know.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400
I don't know.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.480
All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:15.800
It's the part of the show where we rant because we're mad.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:21.640
My FU first goes to my tooth, which I think I got something caught under it, but OK.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.740
Just to go a little bit into stupid dental history of me.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.720
My canines are still my baby teeth.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.240
So they don't have long roots.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.800
So things get caught under them really easily and it hurts.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800
So yes.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:41.000
Another FU goes to the Oscars for not being all 100 percent about Betty White and Trent

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Reznor.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.520
FU to Trent Reznor for not doing a duet with Betty White.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:55.480
And FU to being too busy.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.880
Done.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.760
My FUs of the week, FU to Loki for not being here tonight, but feel better.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.760
FU to his hernia.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760
That's right.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:09.960
FU to his hernia and FU to the drugs that are preventing him from driving.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.480
Although I would want every pill of the world if I had just had surgery too.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.360
So I feel you.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:24.400
Seriously, though, I would say an FU to FU to expenses and how quickly they add up FU

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
to money.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.960
I mean, money is great and all, but money, you know, can also kind of be well, money

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.560
can also be kind of a pain in the ass.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.760
Hey, Rob, what's that?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.660
I'm going to offer an anti FU to Irene because she's hilarious.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.800
Why is that?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.960
She called you a shirt because she's trolling me on Facebook.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.440
Whatever.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.440
All right.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440
It made me laugh.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440
One more story for you guys.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.080
Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week and your calls coming very soon.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080
Oh yeah.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.840
That was a thank you chat room for reminding me of a good point.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.000
FU to the fact that the Oscars didn't nominate Tron for best original score.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I know, right?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.720
Because seriously, I mean, I get that Trent Reznor won and he's cool and all, but Daft

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.720
Punk is better.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720
Sorry.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720
Said it.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.720
Buttholes.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:08.720
Anyhow.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.960
They're smelly stinky crusty buttholes.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.740
You might've heard that, uh, they, uh, really made it harder to get into E3 this year.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.860
If you are a, uh, independent journalist and so forth, you need X number of hits on your

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.960
website in order to be able to get in.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.240
And so a lot of people are not able to go this year.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.960
Well, guess who's coming to the rescue.

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.800
Guess who's running a contest to send you to E3?

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800
Your mom.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.160
No, but close.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.160
Kmart.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.160
What?

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.300
Yes, that's right.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:41.520
The home of things from the 1990s, uh, is going to be sending folks to E3.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.400
The place with the old lady clothes?

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
Yep.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400
So there you go.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.080
Uh, Kmart is, uh, running a thing on their gaming blog that will send three lucky writers

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.440
to the event, including airfare and hotel.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:59.200
The writers get to cover the event for their own outfits, but this will be reposted on

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.200
Kmart gamer.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.120
Um, I've got to be honest, considering everything that's come into play with what's going on

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.320
in the media and so forth, uh, with E3 and the, the crackdown and all that.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:17.260
This kind of pisses me off actually, is that it's kind of like poo pooing what was really

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.920
insulting to a lot of people.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.480
I think that we're working very hard.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:25.400
It's kind of one of those things where it's like, well, I can get in through a Kmart contest,

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.440
but it's only three people.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.240
Well, but it's only one person or it's only, you know what I mean?

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.160
Like, I bet there's a lot of websites that would want to make that argument right now.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.080
It's only one person or it's only two people.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.840
So why does Kmart get to send three random people to what is supposed to be more of a

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.440
clamped down show?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.760
If I were the people running E3, I would shut this shit down.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.520
Like it's just, I'm sorry, but that's probably how I feel from the E3 people.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.360
And then I kind of see that as, I don't know, it's a little bit of paid them a bunch of

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.360
money.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.000
Well, that's just me.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.800
And then sucked a little bit of, you know, yeah, probably involve that too.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:00.800
I don't know.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.640
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.400
Every week here on the show, dark soccer likes to take a trip down memory lane and find a

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:14.040
game that she thinks, hey, you brats, you ought to be playing this game this week.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.680
It's a classic game of the week.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680
Dark soccer.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.680
What is the classic game of the week?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.840
I sometimes trip over the game and fall on my face.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840
Oh, oh, sorry.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840
Did I say that out loud?

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840
My bad.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.760
Um, today's game is Pokemon snap.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.600
Yay.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.040
It is a first person rail shooter, um, slash simulation game.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:39.760
And it was, uh, done by how laboratory with packs soft NECA and it was published by Nintendo

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.080
for the Nintendo 64.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:49.640
And basically in this game, um, you go around as this, uh, dude with a camera you play well

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:58.040
in a Japan, his name is Toru, um, over here, he's Todd snap, who is a Pokemon photographer

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:04.360
and professor Oak or Okey-doke, I should say, wants him to, uh, take pictures around the

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.840
island so that they can, uh, show Pokemon in their natural habitats.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:15.080
So you go around in a motorized little buggy called the zero one and you take pictures

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.920
of the Pokemans, my Pokemans, let me show you them with my camera.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:28.600
So, uh, you, uh, get different points based for, uh, the size and the pose and keeping

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:33.140
it in frame, you get double points if it's centered, you have extra points for capturing

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:38.320
them in a special pose, for example, a surfing Pikachu, or if you get multiples of the same

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:47.100
Pokemon in the same image and you, uh, basically, uh, hold onto your photos, you can get better

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.640
photos as you go, but you've got different levels, you have the beach, the tunnel, volcano,

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:57.640
river, cave, valley, and the rainbow cloud, um, but some of the items have you play through

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.880
the levels, again, you'll get new things that let you do new stuff in each level so you

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:08.800
can get hidden Pokemon or alternate routes, um, get, uh, different photographs and then

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:14.560
you get pester balls cause it's super effective, you use those to knock out Pokemon or to get

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:20.720
them out of hiding, you get a Poke Flute, which is used to wake up Pokemon, irritate,

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:28.360
or hatch them, and then it can make them dance, and, uh, they can do certain dances, and then

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.800
you get a dash engine which lets you go faster than usual, and then you also get this thing

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.280
called an album mark where you can, uh, mark which ones are your favorite photos.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.280
Pretty fun, huh?

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:44.840
This game is addicting, it's crap, seriously, but it originally was developed as a Nintendo

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:52.800
64 double D game, and it has, uh, 63 of the original generation of Pokemon, and it came

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:58.560
out on March 21st, 1999 in Japan, and June 30th and September 15th in North America and

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:06.120
PAL regions, both in 1999, the virtual console we got it, um, that, uh, well, you couldn't

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:13.240
save your, well, because it's different hardware, we, you actually would be able to, uh, share

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:17.000
the photos with your friends on different ways, and it came out on December 4th, 10th,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.160
and 11th, uh, 2007 in Japan, then North America, then the PAL regions, respectively, and, uh,

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:31.080
it did not start as a Pokemon game, but they thought Pokemon would make itself.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.080
And guess what?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.080
That's true.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.160
I will also tell you that there is another game that is like this, that completely sucks

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.840
and I spent too much money on it, and that is the Cardcaptor Sakura game, however, it

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:48.440
came with a clock, a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a pillowcase, so that was pretty cool.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:54.600
Back to Pokemon Snap, um, it was marketed heavily by Nintendo and Blockbuster, and,

01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.200
um, the Japanese convenience store Lawson also had a deal where you could bring in copies

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.160
of Pokemon Snap and save your pictures to be printed, and, um, we had the same thing

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.640
at the Blockbuster for Pokemon Snap, I wish we did a few of those, and they actually had

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.080
a contest where you could take your best shot and, uh, you win a trip to Australia.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.440
I remember that, because we tried to do that, I wanted to go to Australia.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.920
Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
Yeah.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.880
And then, um, Nintendo had a Pokemon Snap event called Pokemon League Summer Training

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:30.320
Tour, so, uh, it sold, like, a bunch in Japan for its first week, it ranked fifth in the

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.920
United States, it sold over 151,000 copies in the first three weeks of its release, and

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:41.280
it was the most rented game up to October 22, 1999, and it was one of the top ten, uh,

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.840
best selling games as of November of the same year.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:52.800
It was really, really cool, so it sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, so, uh, very,

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:53.800
very cool stuff.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:10:01.720
It was super fun, um, it got a 77 on Metacritic, it, it really, honestly, I think of all of

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:09.160
the, uh, Pokemon games that came out, it was just so fun, really, it was so different and

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:15.800
so unique, that it really, I don't see how it couldn't have, you know, have won.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:22.120
It was, it was a fantastic game, and there are certain people that says that this is

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:31.960
a game that should have never worked, but it just did, so, but, honestly, I, I, like

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:37.520
I said, they've done other types of games like this that just did not do very well,

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:45.920
and like, remember the, uh, Africa taking pictures of animals thing, and, uh, Dead Rising

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.760
even had the, the snap thing, remember?

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.360
Oh yeah, that was one of the best parts of Dead Rising, the original one.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:59.200
So it's not as if the concept isn't well-liked, it's just a matter of execution, and I really

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.880
think this was executed well, and the other thing too, is because of how brilliantly marketed

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880
it was.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.480
Do you remember, Rob, don't you?

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:10.720
Not really, because we didn't really go to Blockbuster ever, I mean, I did go there a

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.680
little bit when I was more in, like, college, but when I was younger, like, we didn't really

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.120
go to Blockbuster, so we didn't, we had more of an independent chain locally, so we didn't

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.600
get any of that, like, printer stuff, and I didn't own it in Nintendo 64 anyway.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.960
They were also doing, because at the same time they also had, um, the Pikachu Gankidechu,

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.640
which in Japan, that's what it was, in the US it was, um, Hey You Pikachu, where you

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:38.120
could talk to Pikachu, and remember C-Man, basically, had that, and, um, Pokemon Stadium,

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:44.280
which I thought was a fantastic concept, but this one of the, you know, 3D entrances of

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.680
Pokemon, I think this one, to this day, is the best.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.560
This is by far a game that I could just sit for hours and vegetate on and just keep playing,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:59.040
even though it's a Nintendo 64 title, I mean, I was, when we got ready for Nintendo 64 the

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.960
first time around, I was pissed off, because how was I going to play Pokemon Snap?

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.640
Well, thankfully there's the Wii Virtual Console on it, but, um, I remember that was a big

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.120
deal because you could send the pictures through the Wii Connect, one of the few changes they

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
made, I guess.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
Wonderful!

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.360
Yeah, because you're not storing them on the cartridge, you're storing them on the Wii,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.840
so, you totally could do it.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.200
Wonderful!

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:31.600
And the voice acting, uh, I like it, because it had such limited voice capacity, so, I

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:36.640
thought, Nintendo's always done this, though, that they've had, you know, a couple lines

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.960
of dialogue to sort of give you the impression of what the character's going to sound like

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.800
without recording full-on dialogue.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.520
I liked Pokemon Puzzle League myself, but I guess we'll have to wait another week for

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520
that.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.520
Perhaps.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.720
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Pokemon Snap, for the Nintendo

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.720
64.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.760
A game that I really like, just so you know.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.800
So, all right, uh, we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.080
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, we're going to take some calls here to close out the show.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.680
Remember guys, in case you missed the beginning of the show tonight, it is a short show tonight,

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.680
uh, Loki was recovering from surgery, we didn't have time to get a guest host, and it's kind

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.920
of a, it's kind of a slow news week anyway, and the Oscars and everything are going on,

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.000
so we're going to just, we're doing a minimum day, we call it here at OrangeLoungeRadio,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.840
like the days we used to have in school.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.920
So we do have the Skype line open, I would ask if there's last minute stories, but Dark

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.240
Soccer usually doesn't go hunting for those, that's a Loki thing, so.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.200
Pink Berry is our last minute story.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.440
The Oscars were won by Pink Berry and Betty White.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.800
So we're going to wait for some calls here, uh, I'll try to see if there's anything real

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.960
quick here that I can pull up.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.840
I should have been doing this before, but I've had to multitask even more than usual

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:54.560
because Loki's not here, so I don't have as much time between stories.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.660
But what we do have, what's that?

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:04.840
We have, um, Shermy, who is laying at your feet loyally, looking offended at you.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.400
Why would Shermy be offended by me?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.040
She's offended by everybody.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.920
She's mad at me because I stepped on her head while I was recording another podcast this

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.440
morning by accident.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.280
Let me get into a couple last minute stories for you guys.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.760
I thought we had covered this last week, but it was in our thread for this week.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.960
I think this is just like some extra stuff even happening.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.320
There is the Expert Remix and fan-created Cramps chapters of Super Meat Boy are coming

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.680
for free, which I think is awesome.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.840
You are not going to have to pay extra money for this or what have you, you can just get

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.040
this for free.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:45.220
By the way, the internets, which was the other bonus levels, where these two other new levels

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.760
are going into, they're all going to be in the internets section, you used to have to

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.280
get either 15 bandages or 40 completed levels now will also open the internets stage, which

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.960
I think is pretty awesome.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.640
So check that out.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.240
All right.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.540
That's pretty cool.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:06.520
Let's look at some other stories here.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.320
Oh, apparently, um, breast milk ice cream, um, is sold out at a London store.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320
Disgusting.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320
Sounds so disgusting.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.080
It's called Baby Gaga Breast Milk Ice Cream.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.280
I just caught that.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280
It's hilarious.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.280
It was on NPR.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.280
Gross.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.400
Hey, that's what babies drink.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.000
But you don't make ice cream out of it for not babies.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.640
You drink breast milk from cows.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.440
It's just different.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.680
DDR Hottest Party 4 is going to be coming out for the Wii if you are still following

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680
this series.

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:44.260
Of course, this is the Wii series of DDR games going to be coming out on the 29th of April.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.440
New features and innovations they're saying.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.440
All right.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440
Well, we'll see.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.920
I guess you're supposed to be using now, uh, the Wii remote, the nunchuck and the dance

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:56.280
mat all together to do hot new dance moves.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.800
There will be 20 licensed tunes, everything from Lady Gaga to Paramore Lord.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.840
I guess they're trying to do more of a full body thing with all those parts, like kind

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.180
of what you do with the connect.

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.160
That's what they're trying to do with the hottest party.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.360
I guess we'll see how that actually plays out.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360
Yeah, I know.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.920
I just want DDR.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.640
Let's see the fate of freestyle games.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.760
The DJ Hero developer still undecided, and a lot of that ties in as well to the announcement

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.920
that there's still download content coming.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.320
So freestyle games has not had the plug pulled on it yet.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.360
They may be able to make other games, maybe even a new DJ Hero game.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.200
I would be more curious to see if anything is happening with that 3D DJ Hero thing that

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.780
they showed at E3.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:48.320
Would you be interested in playing DJ Hero on the 3DS?

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.000
Uh, you know, I could see it happening.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I think it would actually be really cool.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.240
There's another iOS game coming out, an adventure game, called Critter Crunch.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.280
I'm sorry, it's by Critter Crunch.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:09.880
It's called Super Brothers Sword and Sorcery EP, which is a 21st century update to the

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:17.240
works of Miyamoto, Mercer, and Chahi, as it's on the official website.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.880
Sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.760
It's uh, it definitely is pretty.

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.600
It'll be out on March 22nd.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.600
Alright, let's go to the phones.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.600
Who's this?

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600
This is CT.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600
Hey, Dartetsuya, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600
Oh, hang on.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600
Turn down your speakers.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.440
Yes, first rule of radio, you gotta mute what you're listening to, or you'll hear yourself

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.240
and it messes with you.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.240
What's up, buddy?

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.240
Yeah, sorry.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:52.080
I wanted to talk about this new MMO outfit.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080
Is it The Rift?

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.320
It's called, oh no, it's called NESstalgia.

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.320
NESstalgia?

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.720
I seem to, I think I saw something, a late tweet had come in on this after that segment

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720
was done.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.720
But what's NESstalgia?

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:14.640
Well, imagine like Dragon Warrior, but like an MMO, like Warcraft.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.960
How exactly does this play?

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.000
Is it like an old school Nintendo game or what?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.840
Yeah, well yeah, it looks just like the old Dragon Warrior game, only you're playing with

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.760
lots of other people.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.720
And what makes this game fun?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.720
Well it's, it's...

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720
It's old school.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.720
That's why it's awesome.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720
Yeah.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.720
Yeah.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.400
It's like playing, it's like playing an old RPG, but with everybody.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.040
Can you make your own content in this or is it like kind of a linear thing?

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:56.680
Oh no, you can create your own character, choose different colors and all that.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680
Gotcha.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680
Different classes.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.680
All right.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:00.680
I'm watching a video of it.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:07.000
It looks interesting, but honestly I like World of Warcraft.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.880
Do you think this NESstalgia will tear people away from World of Warcraft?

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880
Is it free?

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880
Oh yeah.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880
Oh, that's cool.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.880
Free is good.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880
All right.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.880
What's the website where we can check it out?

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.440
Oh shoot, I have to, I don't have to find it.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.160
I'll have to Google it to find out.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160
Yeah.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.160
All right.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.640
DT, I will check that game out.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.640
I promise.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.200
Anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.680
No, that's it.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.680
All right.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.680
We'll check it out.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.680
Take care, buddy.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.920
It totally looks like it stole Final Fantasy sprites.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920
Oh, there it is.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.480
Gamer girl just said in a chat room there.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.920
It's silkgames.com is where you can get that.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.560
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.560
Why?

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.040
It doesn't look that good?

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.360
I'm already paying for something, so I'll play the thing I'm paying for.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360
This is free.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.400
Yeah, but I won't have time.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.300
Sometimes the diversion is nice.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.720
That's why I have a DS.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.120
I'm actually playing Final Fantasy 3, and usually that's when I don't want to talk to

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.120
people.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:09.960
And honestly, if I wanted something that was sprite based, I'd go back to Ragnarok.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.080
So I can play that for free too, and it looks better.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.200
All right.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.840
Let's try to take some more calls here.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
Hi.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840
Who's this?

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840
Dark Jester.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.840
How you doing?

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840
Hey, good.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.840
How are you, buddy?

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.840
I'm doing okay.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.840
What's on your mind?

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:35.640
Well, I want to let y'all know that I'm the first time live listener, and I've listened

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.360
to a few of your past ones, and I hear y'all saying to tell your friends and everything.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.880
And I wanted to let y'all know that I heard about you guys through another podcast.

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880
Oh, really?

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.840
Just to let y'all know, other people are letting other people know about you.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.840
That's cool.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.320
I hope it was good stuff and not the type of stuff you'd see written on the bathroom

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.920
wall for a good time.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.920
No, no, no, no.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.920
It was good stuff.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920
Oh, good.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920
That's cool.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.040
So where are you calling from, if you don't mind me asking?

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040
I'm sorry?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.040
Where are you calling from?

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.040
Louisiana.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.040
Cool.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.040
Well, I'm an Alabama native.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040
Really?

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040
Yeah.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040
From Mobile.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:25.480
Well, I'm calling from Louisiana, but I'm from Texas, so I've never really been to Mobile

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.480
either.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.480
Well, that's okay.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.480
You're not missing much.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.840
Just Mardi Gras.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.000
So what was the other podcast that we should be sending Valentine's cards to a little late?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.960
It was All Gen Gamers.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960
All Gen Gamers.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:46.640
I have to admit, I have heard of that show, but I don't think I've listened to them lately,

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.920
so I'll have to check it out.

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920
It's fairly new.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.960
They mentioned y'all when they were all hyping about their being on their 30th show, and

01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:01.740
one of the other hosts on the show said that it's a big deal for them, but it was an even

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.520
bigger deal for you guys hitting those 400 episodes.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.520
I wish them luck.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.680
I hope they stick it out.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.920
Doing what we do here, it's not that hard, honestly.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.600
It's just kind of having that drive to come back week after week and just being in it

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.400
for the right reasons.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.040
We know we're not going to be super famous.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.240
That's not the reason to be in this, but just the crowd that we have here in the chat room

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.280
really makes it worth it, and just the positive feedback that we do get.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.880
Believe me, we've got to put up a lot of BS sometimes to get through to that, but you

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.440
do it for the cool people that enjoy the show.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.960
I already approve of them because they had an episode called The Cult of Snuggie with

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960
the dog Snuggie.

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.480
That was a great episode.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.480
Pretty awesome.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.600
Well, shout out to those guys and a big thank you, and 370 to go.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600
You can do it.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600
All right.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:04.520
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Dark Jester?

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
Not that I can think of.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.520
I had a couple of things, but they just kind of flew out of my brain.

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.280
I don't really remember them now.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.480
That tends to happen on live radio.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.480
It happens to me all the time.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.920
But if you think about it, send us an email later on, all right?

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.920
I sure can.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920
Thank you.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:18.920
All right.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:19.920
Welcome to the show, and have a good one.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.920
Thanks for calling.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:21.920
You're welcome.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:22.920
Thanks.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:23.920
Bye-bye.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920
You know, that's funny because I thought I had seen that name before.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.680
I thought that was one of those, like, long-time listener, first-time caller types of things,

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:28.680
but I guess not.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:33.120
I'm actually on their Twitter right now, giving them a thank you.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120
Very cool.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.240
1877 Game OLRs, the number you can call, or our user name on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.760
Now, see, what happened is that we were sitting there, like, completely empty for, like, five

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.680
minutes, and then all of a sudden, the whole thing lights up.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.040
So hopefully I can get to a couple more of those calls at least.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.040
We'll do that.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.040
All right.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:53.040
Let's see.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.040
Oh, there it goes.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.040
Phone's ringing.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.040
Let's go take some more calls.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.040
Hi.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.040
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.040
Who's this?

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.040
Hello?

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040
Hola.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.040
Bienvenidos.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.040
Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.040
Deadline.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040
The person's not really there.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:12.040
You can always call Echo 1-2-3 to check your connection before you call.

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.040
It's always a good thing to do.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.640
Even if you're a long-time caller, Echo 1-2-3 is a good place to start.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.200
Let's go to the phone so we got another call coming in.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.200
Hi.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.200
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.200
Who's this?

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200
Hey, hey.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200
It's Rhonda from animejamsession.com.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.640
Hey, it's like podcast plugging night.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.760
Anybody else want to plug their show?

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.560
It's like independent podcasters of the world unite.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.920
What's up, buddy?

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920
Not too much.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.240
I figured that I'd rest and relax so I can give you my KatsuCon 17 con report.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.240
Yes.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240
KatsuCon 17.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:45.920
I went to KatsuCon 13, I think?

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.920
What year?

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:47.920
I think it might have been 15.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.520
And yes, there is a picture of you floating around on our Facebook fan page of you as

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.520
the Black Mage.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.520
Oh, great.

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520
Joy and Rapture.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.800
All right, yeah, I remember KatsuCon way out there in snowy DC.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.920
How was it?

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.760
It was good, but this time we're no longer in DC.

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:03.760
Oh.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:10.640
Yeah, from my understanding, the omnishore on the Hoity Toity Hotel got tired of the

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.920
con, axed the contract, and told them, get the steppin'.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.800
So we're at a brand new place called the Gaylord National Hotel Spa and Resort in National

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.880
Harbor, Maryland.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.880
Gaylord.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.880
Only you.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880
I know.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.000
Well, how'd the con go?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
What was up?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.440
What kind of fun things were to be seen at KatsuCon 17?

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.800
A lot of cool stuff.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:39.720
It was like, for me, it was just very spread out, very laid back.

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.680
I had a good time.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:44.240
My partner in crime, he did most of the panel work.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.740
Me, I just did a lot of the footwork of pictures and photography and what was trending in long

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.760
lines of cosplay.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.960
And what was trending in cosplay?

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.840
Again, it's Hetalia.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.920
And it seems that the popularity of the Final Fantasy cosplay is still going down since

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.160
the release of 13.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.160
Of course.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:09.600
I played one, I actually wanted to cosplay Japan for Hetalia.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.440
I have yet to see Hetalia, but from what I understand, it's very cracked out.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.000
I've seen some crazy ones, well, a friend of mine's going to Comiket this year, and

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.600
I'm going to have her take a bunch of pictures because I've seen some fantastic Hetalia cosplay

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.600
from Japan.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.520
Has there been any cosplay of pantyhose and stalking?

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.440
Because that's my favorite new one.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:29.440
Yes.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.440
Awesome.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.520
You know this means I could do Supernatural cosplay because it's an anime now?

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.640
Oh, God.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.960
You and that show.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.560
It's like your new, you always get obsessed with one show at a time, and now it's that.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.120
And there's been other ones in the past.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.800
But I've watched Supernatural for a while now.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800
I know.

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.800
Thanks to Becky.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800
It's super strong now.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:48.800
Blame Becky.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800
It's all related stuff.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.960
Before we get into video games, you mentioned pantyhose and stalking.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:57.880
I'm surprised you didn't ask me if I cosplayed from that since you've seen some of the episodes.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.840
Did you cosplay from pantyhose and stalking?

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.840
Yes.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:01.840
I was garter-built.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:02.840
Awesome.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.840
That's awesome.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.840
Nice.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.840
Very nice.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840
Yes.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.000
Very nice.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.920
What video game content was there at Katsucon?

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:16.280
A massive gaming room, and I know I've probably said this once before, and I'll most likely

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:22.320
say it again, Dance Dance Revolution is pretty much officially dead at conventions.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.720
Ah, sad face.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.720
Why is that?

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.160
They don't get the machines.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.520
Unless you're at a con where it's majority of, if it's a gaming convention or specifically

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.240
an anime gaming convention, you'll see it.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:43.800
So far at cons, most popular games you'll see is Pump It Up, Connect Games, and Rock

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800
Band.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.200
Do you see people playing Dance Central in full cosplay now?

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200
I have.

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.920
I've seen a couple of people doing it in full cosplay gear.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920
Oh.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.920
Nice.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.520
I didn't have any pictures because at the time my camera was charging up in the room.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.520
Excuses, excuses.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.620
You have to go to Fauna Mae this year.

01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:05.960
I can't do Fauna Mae this year.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.960
I'm broke.

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.600
I really want to do Fauna Mae.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.160
I'm planning on doing Fauna Mae.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.280
You need to talk to people and see if we can do a thing there.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.760
I have to think of a new costume for this year because none of my costumes fit.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.920
Talk to Rice Princess because she was rattling off in guild chat the other night about wanting

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.760
to do some type of cosplay.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.100
But anyway, well, let me ask one more question then.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.560
What was some good loot you saw in the dealer room?

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.040
T-shirts mostly.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.040
Any good t-shirts?

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.040
What kind?

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:41.000
What were some funny slogans you saw?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Alright.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.080
They have a female shirt with two boos on it.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.760
Wait, so it's a shirt with boobs on it?

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760
Yes.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160
And it says someone lines up, don't touch my boos or leave my boos on.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160
Thank you.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.160
Please stop looking at my boos.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.160
Oh, it's boo.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.640
I thought it was like actual, like I thought it was like one of those shirts where they

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.880
draw the tuxedo on it or something, but like it's just a shirt with boobs drawn on it.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.960
And I was like, why is that?

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.960
That's not funny.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960
That's weird.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960
That's redundant.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:10.960
I get it.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:11.960
Booze.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.480
I like, I like the one that Becky has though, of the d twenties.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.480
It says, yes, they're natural.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:16.480
Oh yeah.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.080
I've seen that before at conventions.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.280
And don't forget the cleric shirt.

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:22.280
Plus one shirt.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.280
Cloth shirt.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.280
No, no, no.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.960
It's a parody of the clerk's logo, but it says clerics.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.960
It says they hate, they may heal you, but they still hate you.

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:33.880
Just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880
Yeah.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880
That's it.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880
All right.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:37.880
One more question.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.880
Thing they most need at KatsuCon 18.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.880
Chicken katsu.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:42.880
Febreze.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:43.880
What's that?

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:44.880
Febreze.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.880
Febreze.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:46.880
All right, buddy.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.040
I'm going to let you go.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040
Have a good one.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.040
For you.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
One more thing.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.040
I'm posting this in the chat.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.640
Um, the masquerade was great, but there was a link to a video of my friends doing a Super

01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.040
Mario Brothers musical too.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.320
What will Brian boy Tano do?

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320
It was really fun.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320
Jesus.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320
Okay.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320
Wait, I'm looking at this here.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:25.320
I can't see an O. There was issues with where they put us for recording videos.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:47.520
You know what the best part about watching these videos, Rama, you know what the best

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.880
part is?

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.880
That being?

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.400
It reminds me that doing an internet podcast about video games for nine years really isn't

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.440
the nerdiest thing I could be doing.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.440
Yeah.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.760
I've seen a wedding at AX.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.320
I've seen wedding proposals at masquerades.

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.640
All right.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.920
I'm really letting you know now, buddy.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:09.920
Have a good one.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:10.920
All right.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.920
Thanks for the call.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.800
All right.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.800
What the hell?

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.800
One more call.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:17.800
Hi, you're on Orange is on its radio.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.800
Who's this?

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800
Hi, guys.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800
What's up?

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.800
Hey, it's DDR dollar bill here.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:22.800
DDR dollar bill.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.800
What's on your mind?

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800
I don't know much.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.080
I saw you posting saying you didn't have anybody calling in, so I figured, damn what happened.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.080
Well, then it all flooded.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.400
It always works that way.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.280
I don't know if it's the delay or what because we have this weird two minute delay between

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.280
when we do things here in studio and then when you guys hear it.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:42.120
It used to be like 15 seconds and then I don't know, all games change some things around

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.760
and I think we bounce.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.480
I think our feed goes out into space and then comes back to earth before it gets to you

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.480
now, but whatever.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.560
Hey, you know what?

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.280
At least we have a place to do our show.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:56.480
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:59.480
And nothing much.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:02.120
Just calling in fast if I say hi.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:06.800
Still waiting on a friend of mine trying to create a gaming laptop for me.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800
Gaming laptop.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.800
What are you looking for in your gaming laptop?

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:13.040
Let's put it this way.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:19.480
This has got to be something that can play at least, the very, very least, something

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:25.760
like Mass Effect 2 or Call of Duty at least 60 frames per second.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760
So you can't do a little netbook.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.520
You're going to have to do something a little more uber than that.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:33.600
Right, but here's something funny today though.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:39.320
I tried a couple over at the Best Pie just for kicks and giggles.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:45.720
I don't know what the hell most of these guys are doing, but I crashed every one of them.

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.440
You crashed every laptop at Best Pie?

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:49.640
You know, some people do that on purpose.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.880
Some people will go into like fries and try to like crash all the computers before they

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.080
get caught by the, you know, burly looking dudes that are trying to sell the computers.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.080
What are you doing?

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:02.360
Not that I would know, but I've just, you know, I've heard.

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:06.040
But I did this on accident, all of them.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.880
Were you hitting Control-Alt-Delete on all of them as you walked by and, you know?

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.880
No.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.640
Actually, it's not as bad of a thing to do on a computer as it used to be.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640
I did something else.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.280
I just, from half of them I was just checking out some of the specs, some of them I was

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:26.120
just trying to run this one website where you can check to see if the computer can run

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120
your game.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:34.200
I forget what it's called right now, but it was a really good one and I'll get it later

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.200
on.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:40.120
I got a couple of those and it just, they started crashing and then I had to reboot

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.120
a couple of them.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.920
I'm like, what the hell is going on here?

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.520
Why can't anybody make a good computer anymore?

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.280
A couple of questions in our chat room here.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.920
Dark Toegak says, 60 frames a second is overkill.

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.280
I get 30's not cutting it for you?

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:55.440
Hell fucking no.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.080
I saw that coming.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.080
Why not?

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.800
No offense, but if I want 30 frames per second, I'll play it on the Xbox and be quite honest.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:08.240
30 frames per second actually, it's not accurate.

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:14.160
It doesn't feel real and no, no, I play a lot better when it's full frames, when it's

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.280
a smooth motion because then it feels more real to me.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:22.240
30 frames is all choppy and I'm missing shots left and right.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.880
I need to be that precise.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:27.980
And Brad from Pod Culture is saying, isn't it rather hard to build a custom laptop?

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.440
That is a good question.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:33.280
It's not quite as easy to build as the desktops.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.280
Oh I know.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.680
You're just trying to find the one that matches your specifications?

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:41.000
Yeah, I know it's hard, but he said he could do it, so I'm just giving him a couple more

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.480
days to get me some specs on it.

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:48.200
He says he can do it, so I didn't say I wasn't going to buy it yet, but I'm very curious

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:53.460
if he can and how, because even I'm like, that's a lot of money to actually get parts

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:58.620
for it, especially since most of them cost half the damn laptop itself.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.800
You might just have to find a really small computer case and try to cram it all in there.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.120
I don't know.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:09.800
It's difficult because the idea is that it's supposed to have where it sits on my lap,

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.400
so I'm playing one game and my girlfriend plays next to me, so sometimes we play Warcraft

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:20.540
together, so we have the TV going on rather than me in one room and her in another room.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:25.920
That's a lot of visual sensory stuff going on at once.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.760
I know, but I've done it before.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760
All right.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.940
Well, anything else on your mind, buddy, before we let you go?

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:38.160
I got to rewire my damn pads so I can play DDR again.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:40.720
There's a new one coming out on the Wii.

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.720
That's the reason.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.320
I need a rewire so I can play on the Wii.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.400
New Lady Gaga and Paramore.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400
And PS3.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:50.400
All right, buddy.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.340
Good luck on your quest for new DDR.

01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:53.340
Have a good one.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.340
Thanks, guys.

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:55.340
Check you later.

01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:56.920
PSDDRdollarBill is not just a clever name.

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.920
All right.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.120
We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line up.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.600
Sorry to those folks who didn't get through tonight.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:04.360
You can always send us an email, mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.520
I love some of this evil stuff you guys are talking about in chat.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.080
Brad from Pod Culture says, I've also done stuff like take a screenshot, set us wallpaper,

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080
then hide all the icons.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.080
That's evil.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:15.080
Oh, yeah.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.080
That's evil.

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:23.560
Well, at my work, we were always told we had to lock our desktops, so the manager of our

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.600
group would actually go in and do, you know, those little rotating word screen savers?

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.600
Oh, yeah.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.080
He'd put those up or like put pictures of like blingy teeth up, you know, and put it

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:42.700
on tile and, or put up like some sort of really bizarre, like this one dude who was like doodly

01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:45.520
doodly, and he put up a picture of like a pink pony.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.520
Hot.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:47.520
Yeah.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.520
Very hot.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.520
All right.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.840
Well, that's going to bring us to an end of another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.600
I know it was a short show tonight, but hey, you know what?

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.280
Sometimes real life gets in the way.

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.720
So we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.280
Dark Soccer, have you sobered up?

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280
Excuse me.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.280
Yes, that's a yes.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280
Oh, it tasted like ice cream.

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.280
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280
Pinkberry!

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:14.440
Uh, my final thought is, I don't know, stuff.

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.440
IDK.

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:16.440
IDK.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.440
LOL.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440
WTF.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.440
BBQ.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.440
You mad?

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.440
You mad?

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:23.640
Well, that's it for another episode here of Orange Lawn Radio.

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.640

We'll see you next week.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:41.600
Hopefully Loki's back, but even if he's not able to come back, we'll have some type of

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.600
guest host.

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.600
Do you have our special tribute ready for him?

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.600
I will.

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.600
I'll have that ready after the show.

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.600
But for now, we're going to say good night.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600
Good night everybody.
