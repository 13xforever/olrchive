00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Tonight, June 7th, 2011, we kick off our live E3 coverage with press conference reactions

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:31,800
and special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miek LaTov in LA on the show floor.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and happy E3 to you all.

4
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
I know there's been a lot of news this week.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,360
Welcome to our special E3 coverage.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,000
We're going to be live tonight and tomorrow night.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's Tuesday and Wednesday, 7 o'clock Pacific.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Little different this week.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
We're on Ustream, checking out a new place to stream the show.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
To those of you that are brand new to Orange Lounge Radio, welcome.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,640
If you found this through Ustream or what have you or some of the other referrals, which

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,440
we'll talk about in a little bit, welcome to our little show.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice and boy, here's a lot of voices about what's

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,160
been talked about from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, to Lezarec, Stadia and Ubisoft, but there's

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,560
just a lot, a lot of talk today and we're going to get right into it, but I need to

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,300
introduce everybody on the panel.

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,640
First off, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes known as Sky, and I'll be joining you with

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,680
my co-host.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,320
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Meaty.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
How are you?

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Meaty.

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Feeling fresh and meaty.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Meaty.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
All right.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
And say hello to the one and only, and I'm so happy he can make it here tonight, Techmaster

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Loki.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Hi.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
We were a little worried that Techmaster Loki wouldn't be here tonight because of family

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,760
commitments, but here he is.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Screw the family.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
No, just kidding.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I hope Nelly's not listening.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
No, no, no.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
All right, good.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,920
Welcome to you, and we're going to ask you about Nintendo in just a little bit.

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Also joining us, we've got other people joining us, we're going to have the one and only Bobby

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Black Wolf from the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,240
He usually does a show right before us on our normal live shows Sunday night.

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
Of course, we're live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and more

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,200
information about all of that is at our website, orangesongsradio.com.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Bobby Black Wolf is in LA at E3.

43
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
He will be joining us momentarily to talk about it.

44
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,880
He has played the Wii U.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,480
We're going to talk all about that in a little while.

46
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,240
I want to introduce somebody else here in studio, though.

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Dan the Man is joining us.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
He's on the show tonight.

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
What a pleasant surprise.

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
How are you, Dan?

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm good.

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Awesome.

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
So, E3.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,400
I wish I was there.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,880
We're going to get into all of the press conferences and so forth.

57
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me just start with this.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,960
Before I plug everything and do the usual plugs, let me... What is one word on your

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:46,120
mind right now that if E3 right now can just boil down to one word, what is that word right

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
now?

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Dan?

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Underwhelming.

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Underwhelming.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Loki?

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Huh.

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
All right.

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Dark Sakura.

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
What?

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm going to say third party.

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
That's two words.

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
No.

72
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Cheater.

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
All right.

74
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Fine.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Third.

76
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
That's my word.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
All right.

78
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,240
I want to also plug our chat room.

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,120
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,520
We will be taking your calls a little later in the show on our toll-free number as well

81
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,120
as Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, but not just yet.

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,700
We're going to get to that later in the show.

83
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,220
If you want to join our chat room, please note we do not have a Ustream chat.

84
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,320
We have an IRC chat room.

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,120
More information is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so please, by all means, pull up a chair,

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,400
sit in the chat room, and join us there.

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
Orange Right in the chat room, we'll start us off tonight, kind of all one word slammed

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,920
together says, third party saving first party asses.

89
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,200
I guess my runner up would be, seriously?

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,160
Oh, that's a good one.

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
Is it going to be all negative tonight?

92
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Really?

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,680
Because I swear to God, all I've been reading on Twitter is just cynicism, skepticism, negativity,

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,760
and I'm like, this is why everybody hates gamers.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,760
There's not an ounce of positivity I'm seeing on Twitter, but I don't feel 100% negative.

96
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Are there things that I think should be done better?

97
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Sure.

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
But is it all negative?

99
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I don't necessarily think so.

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760
But is anything mind-blowing?

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
No.

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Yes, but probably not from any of the big five that we're going to talk about today.

103
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
I'll leave it at that.

104
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
All right.

105
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,400
Anyhow, I also want to unplug us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter,

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,920
twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, he'll be joining us

107
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
in a little bit.

108
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
We're teaming up tonight to do the coverage.

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
He is also on Twitter, twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,040
And the reason why I plug that is that today he was pretty dominated at the Nintendo booth

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
all day.

112
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,440
Well, he wasn't dominated at the Nintendo booth, maybe, but his day was dominated by

113
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,960
the Nintendo booth because he was at the Wii U event today.

114
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,560
But tomorrow he will be taking your orders.

115
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,540
You will be dominating him on Twitter and he is going to be your man on the floor at

116
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,720
twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,800
And if you're like, hey, what freaking Konami games are there that weren't at the press

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,960
conference or whatever, and he'll tweet you back and say, glee karaoke revolution with

119
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Rocky Horror.

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Yay.

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,440
Reggie's bitch today, your bitch tomorrow.

122
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,840
So twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

123
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,840
I also want to say thank you to those of you guys that have retweeted, helped promote these

124
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
special shows.

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,080
I know it's a little weird because we're not in our usual home, but you know, we had to

126
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,920
kind of think fast and this all really came together last minute.

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
So I want to thank everybody involved.

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,720
I want to give a special shout out to video game outsiders who has a show usually live

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,180
tonight at all games.

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,840
They didn't end up doing one tonight because of personal reasons, but they send a tweet

131
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,340
that was like, eh, go listen to OLR and I thought that was very nice of them to do.

132
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,820
And so I wanted to give them a shout out and a thank you.

133
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,380
It's going to be a night of varying opinions.

134
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
It's going to be fun.

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,400
So remember kids play nice and be respectful.

136
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Let's jump into it.

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,080
Microsoft, Microsoft press conference starts us off tonight.

138
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,060
The Microsoft press conference, of course, was delivered Monday afternoon.

139
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,680
I imagine most of you listening don't need, I'm sorry, well, East coast, Monday afternoon,

140
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
fine, Monday morning.

141
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,020
Most of you listening don't need a recap of everything that was talked about, but let

142
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,120
me remind you some of the highlights, halo, halo anniversary edition, halo four, neither

143
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,980
of which interesting enough had connect shown.

144
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,160
It was one of the only games.

145
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,000
In fact, I think of that whole press conference that didn't have connect shown.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,380
Are there any excitement whatsoever about the new halo four or the halo anniversary

147
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
edition?

148
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
Nope.

149
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Did you hear it?

150
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,780
I'm into it.

151
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
I like halo.

152
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,180
I'm stoked for more halo.

153
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,740
I'm, I'm looking forward to a new halo as well.

154
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,460
I mean, obviously the teaser was just that it was, it was literally a title announcement

155
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,540
and nothing else.

156
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,660
The only other little, little pickins to drop or to take from that is it's another trilogy.

157
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,820
And I thought that was interesting that they're committing now to six halo games.

158
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,060
I will say this, it did mess with my head.

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,460
Not seeing the bungee logo before the halo trailers.

160
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,460
Did it?

161
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah.

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,460
I was just like, Oh, it's halo.

163
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh yeah.

164
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,860
There is no bungee making halo anymore.

165
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,580
Oh, that's kind of sad.

166
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
Yeah.

167
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,700
It did seem like that trailer had a very different look to it as well.

168
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,300
It just didn't have that bungee feel.

169
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Yeah.

170
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,300
It didn't.

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
It didn't have that big like, oh, that's okay.

172
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,700
I think, you know?

173
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Yeah.

174
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
That's true.

175
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,980
Bungee kind of ran, ran their course, I guess, but I don't even say they ran their course,

176
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,860
but it's, it's, you know, it's just like, okay, there were the Batman movies from the

177
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,420
eighties and nineties and stuff.

178
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,420
And then there's, you know, the new Batman series and you know, both.

179
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Okay.

180
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,740
Well the beginning of one was good and you know, the other one is also good, but it's

181
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,860
refreshing, I guess, to have like a new style of gameplay.

182
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,020
Yeah.

183
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,020
But it's, it's hard to deny the fact that, you know, it's bungee's, bungee's franchise

184
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
was bungee's.

185
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,860
It's Microsoft's franchise now, but, and it's weird that it won't have their stamp on it

186
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,740
unless the new developers are just sick copycats, which is about the best I could hope for.

187
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,820
Let me jump over to anniversary collection for a minute.

188
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,500
Huge speculation on the internet before that it was going to be very connect heavy.

189
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,020
In fact, I believe there was a domain, halo connect.com or something.

190
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,260
Now granted, there could be more announcements between now and when the game actually comes

191
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,820
out, but unlike most of the other stuff that Microsoft was pushing at E3, wasn't seeing

192
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,980
connect in this halo game.

193
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,820
Do you think they changed their mind?

194
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,260
Do you think this is yet to come?

195
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,860
No, it's because that would have required them to do some extra work because basically

196
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,380
they're just porting the asset.

197
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,080
They're upgrading the assets slightly and they're porting it over to the reach engines.

198
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,460
So it would have required them to rebuild a portion of the engine to get it and oh,

199
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,220
and adjusting the physics so that it's like halo one.

200
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,900
But um, that's what it would have required extra work for them to do that.

201
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Maybe halo four.

202
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,380
Yeah, you can bet your ass halo four will use connect.

203
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,100
Did you find that little footnote that came out after the press conference about that

204
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,460
the multiplayer is all just multiplayer maps for halo reach.

205
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,300
It is not actually a part of the halo anniversary collection or whatever anniversary.

206
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
It is.

207
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
No, I had read this thing online.

208
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Here's how it works.

209
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Okay.

210
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Now that can't be right.

211
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Please, please share me.

212
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Okay.

213
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
It's very similar to ODST.

214
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,380
You have one disc that has the single player campaign on it and of course the co-op for

215
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
that.

216
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,620
Then you have also the multiplayer disc.

217
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,580
Now the whole multiplayer disc is the full halo reach multiplayer portion, I guess.

218
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,500
And the maps do exist on the reach servers, but in it, since it's also in the reach engine,

219
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,940
that's what's going on is these maps are for reach, but you can play against other people

220
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,540
that also have reach, I believe as well.

221
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
Interesting.

222
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,140
Well, I guess that's kind of cool if it kind of bridges that.

223
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,580
Yeah, because ODST is the same thing they did theirs.

224
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,740
It was halo three airplane on.

225
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,900
So it's not, it's not bad.

226
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,100
It's, it's, and considering the fact that it's also going to be a budget price game

227
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,620
too, it's going to be a $40 game when it comes out.

228
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,700
Just because they know they can't make a better multiplayer engine than bungee did.

229
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,420
Let's talk connect for a little bit because obviously connect dominated a lot of Microsoft's

230
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,700
press conference and it's taken a lot of flack on the internet because of that.

231
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,820
I noticed when I was watching Twitter, um, over the press conference, there's a lot of

232
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,800
people hating on Microsoft right now because their conference was very connect heavy and

233
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,900
it didn't seem to address the hardcore gamer, which is funny because that's the battle Nintendo's

234
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,140
been fighting for years.

235
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,140
Bullshit.

236
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,100
Well, I have the best stage and that's important.

238
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,580
Hey, it was important.

239
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,100
I mean, we're going to get into it later on, but they're, they're not the only ones that,

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
you know, okay.

241
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,220
Other than, you know, PlayStation, I guess, uh, they're not the only ones that really

242
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,340
focus on their, their motion gaming stuff.

243
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,180
Um, and yeah, what they showed, I think it's a little bit of everything.

244
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,180
Yeah.

245
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,460
It's some stuff for the hardcore players and he had some stuff that's like, well, this

246
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:59,420
shit's on, you know, could have been on the Wii or, you know, it's very kidsy, I guess.

247
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,300
Let me ask a question of our chat room at chat.orangelauncherator.com again, uh, for

248
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,540
those that are joining us for the first time because of the Ustream connection here, our

249
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,300
normal chat room is at chat.orangelauncherator.com, uh, answer this for me.

250
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
Be honest.

251
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,240
Is there a connect title you want to try?

252
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,340
And I want to talk about some of those connect titles that were announced at the show.

253
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,980
And I want to go to dark soccer for a minute because I know you must've perked up when

254
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,740
you heard about the Disneyland connect game.

255
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,580
Did you hear about the Disneyland connect game?

256
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,940
No, I didn't actually.

257
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
Yes.

258
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,780
There's this whole, I relied on somebody to fill me in.

259
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,060
Obviously Dan didn't fill her in on the Disneyland connect.

260
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,060
You didn't ask.

261
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
All right.

262
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,360
So there's this whole Disneyland connect game going on where they really harped on.

263
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,580
You're going to get to be in Disneyland and they actually showed, you know, like you're

264
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,620
going through down main street and so forth.

265
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,360
But then as you walk up to a ride, like Peter Pan's adventure, they had these little overacting

266
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,860
kids on stage demonstrating it.

267
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
It was just mini games.

268
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,780
And you know what it made me think of, I don't know if you guys remember an old eight bit

269
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,940
game by Capcom years and years ago called adventures in the magic kingdom.

270
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Yes.

271
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
It was an old ass NES game.

272
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,520
It was the same thing.

273
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,820
Do you know what this game is?

274
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,820
What?

275
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,040
It's another connected ventures game.

276
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,460
It's seriously connect Disneyland adventures, connect adventures.

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
It's all it is.

278
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,880
That's why you're flying through stuff and collecting coins or whatever, except it's

279
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
in Disneyland.

280
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
That's all.

281
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Disney hub looked cool.

282
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,660
No mini games looked like fun.

283
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,060
That's exactly where I'm at.

284
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Exactly.

285
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Exactly.

286
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,740
It's fine because it's, it looks fun, but you know, let me put it this way though.

287
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,120
They seriously need to tone down the acting for the people that they have on stage.

288
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,300
It was, it was to the point where it's distracting and I mean, I understand you want to make

289
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,180
it look fun and stuff like that, but Oh my God, just any idea how many Red Bulls those

290
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,580
kids drank, they worked their little hearts off and they're probably dead right now.

291
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,820
They burned out showing you how fun that game was.

292
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,340
I want to know what this horror is.

293
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
All right.

294
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,240
Dark soccer's pointing at Minecraft on the connect, which was a, a little, a little thing

295
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
that was dropped.

296
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,000
And there are some people that are supporting the Minecraft game guru, Minecraft, maybe

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
Kai's Judo Minecraft.

298
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I want to try.

299
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,880
So there is some love for Minecraft.

300
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,540
Now we've talked on orange on trade before.

301
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,980
I don't think anybody here in the room got Minecraft quote unquote.

302
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
Like I tried it.

303
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,300
I get it, but I just don't want to play it.

304
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Yeah.

305
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Yeah.

306
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
I think that's where I'm at.

307
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm like, I get it.

308
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
And I understand why people love it.

309
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
That being said, it's not for me.

310
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,140
I don't have that much free time in my day to play something like that.

311
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,620
But again, what I thought was interesting about the follow-up and what came out after

312
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,420
the press event is that the, obviously the Minecraft was pretty much independently developed.

313
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I think by one guy or just one very small studio, uh, they are not doing this 360 version.

314
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,920
They have basically, I don't know, contracted out or sold the license for somebody else

315
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,100
to develop, which makes sense.

316
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,700
Minecraft's at an all time high right now.

317
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,900
There's iPhone things you're going to see and everything else is going to be everywhere.

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,820
You know, I don't have a problem necessarily with being on 360 and it looked fun and I

319
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,300
probably would like Minecraft.

320
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,180
Like I said, if I existed in a world that had 48 hour days, but I don't.

321
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,240
So I unfortunately don't have time to play something like that.

322
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,940
We have some more feedback in our chat room on the Disney game, Disneyland adventures

323
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,360
for the kinetic tiger claw.

324
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,780
When they showed that Disneyland game, I was reminded of that universal studios game on

325
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
the game cube.

326
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
I remember that game.

327
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
Hmm.

328
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
Actually, I don't.

329
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,980
So that doesn't bode well for this game.

330
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,980
It was bad.

331
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
What was it?

332
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
I don't even remember it.

333
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,900
It was a bunch of universal studios, mini games that was all hosted by woody woodpecker.

334
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,540
There was like a back to the future game.

335
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,300
So I was like, I got to see, this has got back to the future in it.

336
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,220
Was that the best talent they could get was woody woodpecker?

337
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,100
Universal's kind of cartoon mascot was woody woodpecker.

338
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,340
That would be like, okay, we've got a Disneyland game coming out, but unfortunately all the

339
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,420
Disneyland characters, like 98% of them were too expensive to license.

340
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,380
So we got Herbie, the love bug to be in the game.

341
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
We decided to do Knott's Berry Farm.

342
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
It's Disney.

343
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,380
That's it.

344
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,500
We couldn't get Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse.

345
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,580
Connect Knott's Berry Farm adventures.

346
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,420
At least they'd have good chicken.

347
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,460
Savalas in the charm says, uh, connect Disney is for families in Nebraska who are not able

348
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,820
to get to a Disney amusement park.

349
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,540
I see it as more like the thing to just shut the kids up.

350
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,540
No, no.

351
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,660
I'm sure that my store, Nebraska Furniture Mart will sell plenty of those, but, uh, no,

352
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,580
I think what it is is it's another connected, you know, adventurous type game and you know

353
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
what?

354
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,100
It will sell like crazy because it looks fun and it's better than some of the other mini

355
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,220
game crap that's out there for it.

356
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,500
And Disney people will buy it just because apparently it's going to promise that you

357
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,540
can wander around Disneyland on the connect.

358
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,140
Blackness in our chat room says, I really do hope somebody hacks the Disneyland connect

359
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,900
assets and makes a grand theft auto style port.

360
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
Come on now.

361
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,400
Let the kids have something.

362
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,860
Who hasn't made grand theft auto and uh, and GTA yet.

363
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Come on, Matt.

364
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,140
Did you do that or who hasn't made Disney a grand theft auto yet?

365
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,100
Well, I guess the kids do have something.

366
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,580
Did you see the Sesame street game that they spent some time demoing and, and collectively

367
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,960
Twitter was rolling their eyes, but I was like, dude, I wish they had the Sesame street

368
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,740
game when I was six.

369
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
I hate fucking Elmo.

370
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Maybe with less Elmo.

371
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,100
If it had like cookie monster and big bird in it, I'd be like, this game is going to

372
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
be tight.

373
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,740
If Mr. Hooper was still alive, I'm going to play it.

374
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,380
If Linda, the deaf lady was teaching me how to sign, dude, Linda, the deaf lady was hot.

375
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,620
There you go.

376
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,180
Uh, black Wolf is in our chat room right now talking to the chatters.

377
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,460
They're saying I had Sesame street games on my Intellivision word fun and electric company

378
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,460
math fun.

379
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,660
Dude, the electric company game was amazing.

380
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,940
I want to know more about this whole live streaming TV thing they were talking about.

381
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,580
Was I the only one that didn't really get it?

382
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,640
Like it, I don't get it.

383
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,540
It flowed really weird in their presser for me.

384
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,620
They were watching castle.

385
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Yeah.

386
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,620
They're watching castle.

387
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,460
Apparently I caught a little ad in the sidebar and I don't know if it was just a marketing

388
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,340
placeholder or whatever, but it said the connect show.

389
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,740
And that made me think, is Microsoft producing their own content for this too?

390
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,940
Or was that just a placeholder?

391
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,540
I think it's a placeholder, but here's the thing is it's basically going to be content

392
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,300
that you say, for example, like, you know, I have Comcast, so it's going to be Comcast

393
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
programming.

394
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Great.

395
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,580
I can just turn the TV on and watch TV.

396
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,980
You know, I don't need to watch TV through my 360.

397
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,620
My 360 act as a TiVo because if so, I could actually kind of use that.

398
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,660
Well, what it's doing is you guys know what like the review is like those set top boxes

399
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,140
that you just plug into your TV.

400
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,420
And instead of actually having their own content, what they do is they look around the net for

401
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,260
content kind of like windows media center will do, and then let you play it.

402
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,460
It's just going to be a service like that for the Xbox.

403
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,740
And that kind of ties into the other announcements about the partnerships with YouTube finally

404
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
coming to Xbox.

405
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,540
I think a lot of us are going, okay, it's about time.

406
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
We got a decent YouTube player.

407
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
That'd be pretty cool.

408
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
That is going to be pretty cool.

409
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,940
And then this whole Xbox Bing thing where I guess you can go Xbox, Harry Potter, and

410
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,860
it'll show you all the games, all the CDs.

411
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,300
So I mean, will it, will it like search the internet too?

412
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,300
I mean, do we have a legit?

413
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,700
No, it won't search the internet because it doesn't have a fucking web browser in it.

414
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,040
Will connect finally respond to me going Xbox, Bing, gay porn.

415
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,240
It'll probably look up my little pony.

416
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,420
It'll come back with some indie gay.

417
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:32,580
I'll come back with my little Care Bears, the Smurfs, Lady Gaga on HBO.

418
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,980
I hate the new interface.

419
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
It was weird.

420
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,380
It took me a minute to figure out that they were actually demoing a new interface.

421
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,560
Like I, I mean, I'm not stupid.

422
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,440
I saw that it was a new interface, but I thought it was kind of like a spinoff for the TV thing.

423
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,580
Like like the connect thing is, is a little separate thing.

424
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:58,720
I didn't think I was looking at a whole new dashboard and I was kind of like, okay.

425
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,540
It looked like the crossbar a little bit.

426
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,020
No, it's, it's modeled after windows seven phone stuff and then also windows eight is

427
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,220
supposed to be very similar to that.

428
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,260
Good for them to do that kind of, first off, you know, windows eight, you know, that shit

429
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
is optional.

430
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,340
It's like the fucking media center.

431
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,340
You don't have to use media center if you don't want to.

432
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,180
However, on the Xbox 360, it's not fucking optional.

433
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,300
I I'm sorry, hitting the guide button again to get my fucking blades back is not fucking

434
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
optional.

435
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
That is, I want the blades.

436
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,420
I mean, it's, you know what, here's the, here's a thought and I know this is crazy and out

437
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,780
there, but how about we have themes we can download where we can say, Hey, you know what?

438
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
I like the blades.

439
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm going to keep it on the blades.

440
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,220
Hey, I know I want to keep it on this, you know, the new Xbox experience.

441
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,640
All this is now is, Hey, look at this.

442
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
What game am I playing?

443
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,860
Is that a tiny little box in the corner and all these ads are everywhere else.

444
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,040
Uh, technus in our chat room at chat.org.com says, I think it's great.

445
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,760
They added complete voice search.

446
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,580
It's pretty hard and quite pathetic that in the current dashboard it's hard to find shit.

447
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,580
I agree.

448
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
That's kind of my problem.

449
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,020
You know, connect fun labs was on the thing like right after the press conference.

450
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,700
You had to dig to find it.

451
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
No you didn't.

452
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
You should.

453
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
I, it was not on the main bar.

454
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
You had to go to the E3 coverage.

455
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
You didn't look hard enough.

456
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Then you go to connect.

457
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
No, no, no.

458
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
It was on mine.

459
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
It did not come right up.

460
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
All right.

461
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
It was on the community page.

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
The community bar that was right there.

463
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,540
It was like one of the first, you know, few, I should have thought to look in community.

464
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
God damn it.

465
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
It was right there.

466
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
Yeah.

467
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,260
Instead of having to dig, well, when it's like the thing you just announced today, shouldn't

468
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,900
it be like on the main bar?

469
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,260
I mean, I don't know.

470
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,340
It is on one of the main bars, isn't community basically where it starts?

471
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,660
I thought it was, yeah, pretty much whatever.

472
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,660
All right.

473
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,820
Uh, moving on to some other announcements.

474
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,900
Uh, some of the nonconnect things at the top were actually pretty cool.

475
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,220
Uh, there was the modern warfare three demo that they demoed and you know, I'm not into

476
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,700
those games, but I was kind of looking at the footage going, oh, that's really pretty.

477
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,060
That's, that's pretty cool.

478
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,420
If I could actually do that when I play the game, as opposed to just running into walls

479
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,080
constantly and shooting my friends.

480
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,860
You mean there's a modern army game where I can shoot things and shit explodes?

481
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,260
That's revolutionary and brand new.

482
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,380
I have to admit, I thought it was pretty cool when they were doing that whole little getaway

483
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,380
in the raft.

484
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,500
I was like, it's like super army cart.

485
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,820
They had, they had a raft at the end of the last game.

486
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,860
Oh, shows you how much I play those games.

487
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
Modern warfare.

488
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,940
And the truth is I like modern warfare.

489
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,140
All right.

490
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,800
And then, and I love this.

491
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,820
The Tomb Raider demo was hot.

492
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,780
I thought that that was like my favorite thing was neat, but once again, you know, I've already,

493
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,620
I've kind of, you know, set that franchise aside for, well actually since the first Tomb

494
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Raider, I just never got into Tomb Raider.

495
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,340
Well, see the thing about this, but it looks cool.

496
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Yeah.

497
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,900
The thing about this new Tomb Raider is that it didn't look at all like the old ones.

498
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,620
Cause it didn't look like a reboot at all.

499
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,140
I know it looks like uncharted

500
00:21:53,140 --> 00:22:01,980
Maybe that's why they have adventure sense, which is like saying, Hey, you can't figure

501
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,300
out the puzzle.

502
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,620
We'll do it for you.

503
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,420
I'm going to need Tomb Raider for idiots.

504
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Well, I, I, what I loved about it though is that there was scenes very reminiscent of

505
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,400
that movie, the descent, which is like one of the few movies ever to legit scare the

506
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
shit out of me.

507
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,580
So I can kind of see where the survival horror thing is coming from for Tomb Raider.

508
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,700
Cause some of that stuff did look kind of scary.

509
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,140
I Tomb Raider needs something.

510
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:32,140
And if this, if this rejuvenates the franchise, great, but just the same, it's like it's uncharted.

511
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,300
How many times have they tried to reboot, you know, Tomb Raider so many times and it's

512
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,300
failed every time.

513
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,220
So hopefully this time is a little different.

514
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,640
Congratulations, X-Box.

515
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,740
You get uncharted.

516
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
It's Tomb Raider.

517
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,600
Well, I thought, well, but Tomb Raider is not exclusive to the 360 either.

518
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,780
So I thought it was weird that they demoed it at the PS three people could just play

519
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,780
uncharted.

520
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah, that's why they didn't demo it.

521
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,900
They don't want to show uncharted and then, you know, Tomb Raider, Hey, this looks kind

522
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
of similar.

523
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,260
Like, Oh, wait a minute.

524
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Uncharted is awesome.

525
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,060
And Tomb Raider is trying again.

526
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,580
Tiger claw in our chat room says the Tomb Raider demo got kind of creepy with all the

527
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,220
moaning and panting from Laura Croft game guru says Tomb Raider looks too much like

528
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,820
a survival horror game.

529
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,300
Uh, let's see.

530
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,620
Randy you says, dude, stabbing Laura and closing her eyes.

531
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,620
What the fuck?

532
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:24,300
Jenai in our chat room says uncharted is so bro, bro, bro, uncharted is pretty cool.

533
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,220
Did watch that little bit of the demo of the uncharted demo.

534
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
Yeah.

535
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,220
Yeah.

536
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,220
Dan was watching it.

537
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,760
It was let's drown for awhile.

538
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,420
Let's press a repeatedly.

539
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,620
Let's not drown for awhile.

540
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
That's uncharted.

541
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,460
So I was like, yeah, it won't play.

542
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Let's shoot people.

543
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,700
And then quick time events.

544
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Awesome.

545
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,900
Uh, and then of course connect fun labs was shown and I wanted to see the look on Loki's

546
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,220
face when that was being demoed.

547
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
That was awesome.

548
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
Well, here's the thing.

549
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Okay.

550
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
All this stuff got spoiled.

551
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Like right before the press conference.

552
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,700
Oh look, our E3 page got leaked out.

553
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,700
So it, no, all the big, you know, announcements, they were already out there and connect fun

554
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
labs.

555
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,540
That shit leaked a while ago, but, and here's what you connect fun labs is it's, Hey, look,

556
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,380
here's all the tech stuff that we said we could do before and couldn't do.

557
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,840
Now you can, you know, remember the whole, Hey, I can scan my skateboard in there and

558
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,420
you know, play the first thing that they showed.

559
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,860
Did you notice even the lady said, finally, she's like, and now you can scan in your skateboard

560
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,860
finally.

561
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,980
So, you know, she'd been catching shit about that for a year.

562
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,660
Like the first thing they show is someone scanning a skateboard in and then jumping

563
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,780
on a virtual skateboard and playing, and now they're like, Oh, you can do it.

564
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,780
Well.

565
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,620
And the thing about connect to me too, and the whole fun labs that it is not changing

566
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,700
your avatar.

567
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,180
Like it's not like how the 3ds will make a me out of taking a picture of you.

568
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,060
It is just like a temporary thing to do fashion magazine poses.

569
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,300
Like what the fuck is the whole thing where, Oh, you don't have to fumble through menus

570
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,060
anymore to, you know, pick your, your avatar then you're full of shit.

571
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,860
I'm trying to be, I'm not hooking up our connect after all.

572
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,620
You can not make the avatar out of it.

573
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,620
You know what I did, what I wanted to test, I wore my Pikachu shirt to see if it would

574
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,540
take a picture of the Pikachu shirt and like actually show Pikachu, if it would just be

575
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,260
a yellow shirt and it came through as a Pikachu shirt.

576
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,140
I mean, it was a horrible scan of it, but it was definitely Pikachu.

577
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,660
And I was thinking, well, obviously this won't be the main avatar because they can't show

578
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,980
all that copyrighted stuff that people scan in.

579
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,820
Somebody will wear a Dick on their shirt.

580
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,500
I haven't tried it yet, but that's gotta be wrong.

581
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I am.

582
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,860
I am not see if you can figure it out.

583
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Chat.

584
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Is anyone play connect fun labs?

585
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Tell me for all.

586
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,860
I do not believe you.

587
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Let's hook up our connect.

588
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
Save your avatar.

589
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Sure connect.

590
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Someone was supposed to lend me dance masters.

591
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,860
Alright.

592
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,340
Dance central two.

593
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Yeah.

594
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,340
Dance central.

595
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
What'd you think of dance central two?

596
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
It looks like dance central one.

597
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,900
I, I, I have to admit I'm a big fan of dance central, but I didn't see besides obviously

598
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,340
der the two player thing.

599
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,780
I didn't see what was new about it.

600
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Here's what's new about it.

601
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,740
And I know this because I saw the actual feature list so that what they did is they improve

602
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:04,140
the break it down mode where you can actually repeat individual, um, like moves or practice

603
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
individual moves.

604
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
It needed to be.

605
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,420
You can also, um, you know, repeat whole sections of, um, you know, that stuff.

606
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,220
Uh, there's also, I think what else there was in there, you know, the two player at

607
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,660
the same time, they also have the ability where you can get rid of the freestyle stuff.

608
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,940
Say you don't want to do that where you flail about randomly during the song.

609
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,540
You can take that out or you can change the way it looks.

610
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,740
Um, some of that stuff.

611
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,820
And then of course, you know, the, the new music that they're going to have in there.

612
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Yeah.

613
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,780
I don't think they did a whole lot with dance central too.

614
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,460
And honestly, they probably could have just left it alone, but well, it's also one of

615
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,700
those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

616
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,260
How many dance games are on the Wii or not?

617
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
Sorry.

618
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,220
The, uh, the connect connects what there's that dance.

619
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,740
There's dance masters.

620
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,860
Just dance was announced, will be coming.

621
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,380
Uh, and there's that dance paradise.

622
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Is that what it is?

623
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,380
There is there's dance masters, dance central to just dance three right now available right

624
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
now.

625
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,940
Dance paradise, uh, dance masters and dance central.

626
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
So it's three.

627
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,340
I like how they're like, it's the number one selling game on the connect and Michael Jackson,

628
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
the experience.

629
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Okay.

630
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
Maybe there's four.

631
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Well, because it is the number one selling one by a mile and with kind of good reason

632
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,100
because it's the only good one.

633
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Just the answer.

634
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
But here's the thing though.

635
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,340
Just dance though.

636
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,540
I mean, it's good on like the Wii and stuff because of the limitations of that.

637
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,460
But you know, when you kind of bring that in with, you know, dance mat, well not necessarily

638
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,220
dance, but dance central, I don't know if it's going to be able to hold its own.

639
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,900
I mean, people will buy it because they're like, Oh, Hey, just dance.

640
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,100
It's popular.

641
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,980
But um, you know, I think it dance central does a better job though.

642
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,980
I think just dance sells well cause it's got the right name.

643
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,820
Everyone's like dance central.

644
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,160
What's that all about?

645
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Just dance.

646
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Hey, I can just dance.

647
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,740
Have really solid, uh, song lists too.

648
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,940
And I think that's a big part of it.

649
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,620
And more dance masters stumbled is that sure the Konami thing reaches a very niche audience,

650
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,100
which you know, happens to be a lot of the people that's listened to this show historically,

651
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,900
but unfortunately it doesn't really reach anybody beyond that.

652
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,420
You know, people pick up the box for dance masters and go, what's this dance paradise?

653
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,900
Just it was late to the game and it kind of looks clunky.

654
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
I don't know.

655
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,660
I said only ones I'd seen were dance masters and dance central and the only one I've tried

656
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
is dance central.

657
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:27,420
I would love to see a dance game with like half Konami ish songs, half dance central

658
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,820
ish songs in the dance masters interface, because I think there's some cool things that

659
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,980
dance masters brings to the table.

660
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I want more Para Para.

661
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,580
Well then you would be talking about part of my, my pitch for a new DDR game, of course,

662
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
you see.

663
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,500
All right, let me get to some quick, quick thoughts.

664
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,620
We want to get on to Sony.

665
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:50,060
I want to get to Bobby and all that, uh, quick thoughts fable the journey.

666
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Here's my problem with necessarily fable the journey.

667
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Looks good.

668
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,300
I mean, it looks nice cause it's an unreal three now.

669
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,380
Um, here's my problem with the connect game.

670
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,260
So everything's on fucking rails.

671
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,340
Everything is on fucking rails.

672
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,060
Doesn't the halo rail shooter make more sense than a fable rail shooter?

673
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,100
Everything is on fucking rails.

674
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,980
The ghost recon game on rails, the fable game on rails, star wars on rails.

675
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,580
It's that's all they can do is on rail shooters.

676
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:24,380
They can't actually do anything where you have actual control that that's where one

677
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,300
thing that plays Asian has over, you know, the connect is, Hey, you know what?

678
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,860
We have a navigation controller.

679
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,740
We can navigate around the map.

680
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,620
Whereas you guys are stuck on a rail.

681
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,540
You need the Xbox nunchuck.

682
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,940
I you know, I'm coming off of fable three and what I was just talked about on last week.

683
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,740
So LR and I was not feeling that great about fable three.

684
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,100
And so when I saw this preview, I, I was just kind of, eh, if it's $20 maybe, yeah, it looked

685
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
all right.

686
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,300
It would be pretty cool, like Xbox live arcade game and I liked how the perspective is a

687
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
little different.

688
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,180
It actually knew it'd be kind of, it kind of reminded me of, cause it is an on rails

689
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,220
shooter is it would be a pretty cool arcade game.

690
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:09,180
Yeah, actually an actual arcade, an actual arcade game because it's an on rail shooter.

691
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,860
Other quick thoughts since she's brought up on rail shooter, what I think will be as much

692
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,860
as we're all probably looking at it going, eh, I think it's gonna be huge this holiday

693
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,140
connects star wars.

694
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,580
I just hope they fix the lag of shit because the lag looked terrible from what they were

695
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,500
showing the guy playing.

696
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,180
Even the guy doubling it looked like ass playing it.

697
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,180
It was horrible.

698
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,060
Did you see when he tried to lift that ship up and move it and he dropped it?

699
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
That was hilarious.

700
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,100
Oh man, I was, I felt bad for him.

701
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,960
But of course the games are still early on.

702
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
So there you go.

703
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Uh, let's see.

704
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Did I miss anything else?

705
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,260
Do you guys think of big, big stuff?

706
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,660
I mean, there was Tom Clancy game was shown as well.

707
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,560
Uh, Gears of War three, which I actually.

708
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:56,500
The one that looks kind of cool is a rise that the new cry tech, um, game, uh, the yeah,

709
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
the Roman one.

710
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,940
I saw the dude kicking in that and I was like, he's going to like kick his connect right

711
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
off the TV.

712
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,400
I can't play that in my house.

713
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,220
I get to see the achievement now.

714
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,660
This is Sparta.

715
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,980
Every time I do that, you know, but that, that's why a game like that'll sell because

716
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,900
there's going to be a lot of like, that's the thing though.

717
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:22,220
It's an actual, but as long as the, you know, combat's good and not clunky, like, you know,

718
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,380
fighters uncaged or something like that.

719
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,380
I don't know.

720
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,500
It, there was a lot of cool stuff that they show like forza four looks pretty awesome.

721
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,700
Um, and the head tracking stuff and that once again, also kind of laggy, but I don't really

722
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,340
know how you would be able to do that anyways, cause you're kind of, you can't really turn

723
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,740
your head, you know, it just doesn't really work with a stationary, you know, monitor.

724
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,020
It sure didn't work in a Gran Turismo five.

725
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,660
Uh, and oh yeah, forza, which is Dan, I know you're a racing game fan forza.

726
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
Forza looked great.

727
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Now did you see that?

728
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
Great looking racing game.

729
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
Did you see their new steering wheel that they have?

730
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,300
That looks like, but $60 wireless steering wheel.

731
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
What's the point?

732
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,020
Oh, you can wave it around in mid air.

733
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Sweet.

734
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,500
Gears of war three ice tea reuniting.

735
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,980
Why is he always look angry?

736
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:19,060
He's like, you know, it's like every, I don't understand why he was just like scowling.

737
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,340
He looked angry cause he was playing gears of war, which is a testosterone game for men.

738
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,340
War looks angry.

739
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,460
Well, you don't have to like be all, you know, fronting like you're just, you know, I'm going

740
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,420
to murder somebody after I'm done playing this game.

741
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,620
Although I got to say though, the gears of war three limited edition Xbox looks pretty

742
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
nice.

743
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
The black and red one.

744
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Yeah.

745
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
That's good.

746
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,380
I want to quickly just mentioned the EA press conference that happened mass effect three

747
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,620
interesting voice command thing going on there.

748
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,620
Useless.

749
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,060
How quick, you know, I would never use that.

750
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,500
I would never, I mean, is it a great demo thing?

751
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,580
Like to show off your console to your friends?

752
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,340
Like look at this space minority report technology.

753
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,060
It's fun for like five minutes commanding your troops or whatever, you know, to do different

754
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,060
things.

755
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Maybe.

756
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,060
I don't know if that was like that part.

757
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,500
Yeah, I could see that like doing the actual dialogue trees and stuff.

758
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,300
I have a directional pad right in my thumb.

759
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,140
Why do I need to even bother with this bullshit?

760
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,300
All right.

761
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,420
And then of course, a star Wars, the old Republic had its kind of first, uh, what is the opening

762
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,060
trailer shown for the game?

763
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,300
I don't know that people, that trailer was sick.

764
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Yeah.

765
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,020
It looked, I don't know why the star Wars movies can't be like that.

766
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,500
That trailer was sick.

767
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,660
Uh, quickly.

768
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,420
The Ubisoft press conference with Mr. Caffeine.

769
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,500
What was up with that guy?

770
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,940
I didn't watch the whole thing.

771
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,020
I saw caffeine, by the way, when you actually go to a show and see Mr. Caffeine in person,

772
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
he's amazing.

773
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,380
Uh, far cry three was the only game I'd really seen.

774
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,660
And I was like, there was part of the dialogue to me, felt like it was trying to be too edgy.

775
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
I don't know.

776
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,020
All I know is when it showed the dude doing the stealth kills, where he like walked up

777
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,580
behind the guy, pulled the knife out of the guy's pocket and stabbed him with it.

778
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,340
A little part of me, my heart grew three sizes.

779
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,340
The game parts.

780
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:08,380
I mean, I'm not going to play it, but man, I watching that dude kill people like that

781
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,660
was he, he like grabbed the guy's knife, stabbed him with it, whooped it out of him, and then

782
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,220
threw it at another guy and killed him.

783
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,480
I mean, it had to be prescripted because nobody could probably make that look that good, but

784
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,780
it looked like it would be really cool if I knew how to play it.

785
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,900
I like the fact that you don't have malaria.

786
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,220
All right, I'm going to go to the phones.

787
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,460
We're going to give Bobby Black Wolf a call.

788
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,460
He is our man, our correspondent that is at E3 this year.

789
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,580
The other thing too, Bobby's actually like syndicating what we're doing tonight on his

790
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,260
own feed, which I totally forgot to mention at the top of the show because there's just

791
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,860
so much going on tonight.

792
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,060
So of course, a big thanks to him for agreeing to do this with us tonight, and I think Bobby

793
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,060
is now on the line.

794
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,460
You there, Bobby?

795
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
I am here.

796
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,460
What's up, guys?

797
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Not much.

798
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
How's the weather?

799
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Well, a lot actually, but that's all right.

800
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,900
How's the weather in LA?

801
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,960
Not as warm as it is in Atlanta right now.

802
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,300
What an interesting change of pace.

803
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
It's been raining up here.

804
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,300
All right.

805
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Forget the weather.

806
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,240
E3, how did day one treat you?

807
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,660
My feet hurt, but it was a lot of standing around.

808
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,500
It was a lot of standing around.

809
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,700
Yeah, because you waited all day today to play Wii U, didn't you?

810
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Yes.

811
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:26,100
I was about two hours before I got in there, but then I had about an hour and a half to

812
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,140
kind of go through their eight demos.

813
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,060
Two hours actually isn't that bad, all things considered.

814
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,020
Did they have entertainment in the Wii line this year, or Wii U, excuse me, line to keep

815
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
you going?

816
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,020
No, and actually, when I walked up to it, it was about two o'clock, and the show floor

817
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:48,140
closes at six, and I walked up at two, and there was a lady at the end.

818
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,700
There was a sign that said, line closed, and I said, is it already full?

819
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,700
And she's like, well, yeah, we've cut off the line.

820
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,860
You're more than welcome to stay in here, but realize you may not get up to the front,

821
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,300
and you may waste the rest of your day.

822
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
And I said, okay.

823
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
Oh, wow.

824
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,140
And I got up there, and it wound up two hours later, you know, four o'clock, I'm starting

825
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,740
to play with the Wii Wii Wii U.

826
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
That's not that bad.

827
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,540
So I guess they were just trying to scare people away.

828
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,780
That's not that bad, all things considered, because the lines in the past, like the 3DS

829
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,700
line was atrocious last year, and then, of course, the original Wii line.

830
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,780
We all saw those videos on the internet of just the line keeps going and going and going.

831
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
That line was awesome.

832
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
All right.

833
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,060
Anyhow, we'll get to Nintendo in a minute, but let's start by talking about Sony, because

834
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,140
Sony happened yesterday, and you were there at the press conference, right, Bobby?

835
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Correct.

836
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,700
So how was it?

837
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,780
You got like right in the front, practically, didn't you?

838
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,420
Yeah, it was kind of funny, because I got there a little late.

839
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,660
Like I took the shuttle from my hotel, and it started at five, and so I got on the bus,

840
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:55,380
on the bus, at about four or four-o-five, and in LA traffic, it was like 4.55 when we

841
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,580
finally pulled up to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is on USC campus.

842
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,620
So we finally pull up, and I'm like watching everybody, and we can't get off the bus.

843
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,140
It takes us like 15 minutes just to get around the corner into the parking lot.

844
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,380
And we're all like kind of walking in and stuff.

845
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,040
I missed all the food in the beginning and all that stuff, because I was hungry, because

846
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,100
I had eaten since Atlanta that morning.

847
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,820
And I made it all the way, you guys feel there?

848
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
Yeah, we're here.

849
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Okay.

850
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,820
It was just some cut out from my phone.

851
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Anyway, so I was walking, running in, and before I went through the door, there was

852
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,020
a guy saying, hey, there's more seats if you go down this ramp to the VIP area.

853
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,620
So I'm like, okay, I'll go down that ramp.

854
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,220
And so we went down that ramp, and it went underneath, and we were on the floor area,

855
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,780
and people were just directing us.

856
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,540
And they pointed to these seats on folding chairs on the floor right in front of the

857
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
stage.

858
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Nice.

859
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,520
And there were like a lot of Sony employees sitting there, and so I was sitting there

860
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
with them.

861
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,580
And then all the Sony employees got kicked out, and more people came in.

862
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,700
And I realized everybody else that was sitting around me, like Michael Pachter and them,

863
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,980
all had these red VIP lanyards.

864
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
And I didn't have one of those.

865
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,860
So I was kind of like covering up my shirt or something, so it looked like I had a lanyard,

866
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,860
and they never noticed.

867
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,020
You were just in the right place at the right time.

868
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,060
Well, they got to make that section, you were just in the right place at the right time,

869
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
it sounds like.

870
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,420
Yeah, I hate being late.

871
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
Yeah.

872
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,940
And they've got to make that section look full, because that's the part of the auditorium

873
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,880
you can see on TV constantly, is kind of that first little area.

874
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,260
So it's got to be full and animated.

875
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,940
So I'm not surprised they were trying to fill it up.

876
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:48,020
But every time the camera was on me, I was tweaking.

877
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,620
Nice.

878
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,980
Let's talk a little bit about what happened at the Sony press conference.

879
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,820
Obviously, we're going to get to taboo when we come back with the Orange Launch Radio

880
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,040
next Sunday, the regular episodes.

881
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,660
But I lost a point in taboo, because Sony just opened right off the bat with somewhat

882
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,540
of an apology, and one that it seems like most people accepted.

883
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
Loki?

884
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,460
Loki's shaking his head a little bit.

885
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
It was retarded.

886
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Really?

887
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,260
It's like, yeah, we learned a valuable lesson with this PlayStation outage set.

888
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,800
We realized how much you like playing online.

889
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,340
That's all they fucking learned.

890
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
That's all they learned.

891
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,140
It was not like, oh, hey, we're sorry that your credit card information was compromised.

892
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,520
It was, hey, you guys like playing online.

893
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,860
We're going to focus more on online play.

894
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,060
Let me ask the chat room how they feel about it.

895
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,240
Chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, were you satisfied with Sony's apology?

896
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
What do you think?

897
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,780
How did that go over in the crowd there and with you?

898
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:50,540
Well, first off, it was kind of interesting because you notice he never said they got

899
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
hacked.

900
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
They called it an outage.

901
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,620
They didn't say why it was an outage.

902
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,660
But a lot of people round up, and you gotta realize since I'm in the VIP section, I'm

903
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,540
around people who've been in the industry 20 years and all that stuff, and they kind

904
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,420
of were more understanding than the people that were probably up in the normal seats

905
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,900
and people at home.

906
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:18,300
So they were like, okay, he did mention it, and Jack, he does really good on stage.

907
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:23,620
Every year, because he always goes up there and something is bad press for Sony whenever

908
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,460
he walks up at E3.

909
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,940
He and his script writers handle it really well.

910
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,860
That was scripted because I can see the teleprompters from where I was.

911
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,420
And I knew how much of the entire press conference was actually scripted.

912
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,420
Oh, yeah.

913
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
They all were.

914
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,300
And he did a good job, and it stopped people from echoing them because that was one of

915
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,180
the things somebody asked me on Twitter is how many people were gonna interrupt the conference

916
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,820
yelling about the PSN hack, and nobody did because they addressed it right in the beginning

917
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,700
and said, hey, here's the elephant in the room.

918
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Here it is.

919
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
We're sorry.

920
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,020
Going to some comments from our chat room at chat.worried.com, Rama in the chat room

921
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,660
says, that was not an apology, that was more of a thank you for the fans for sticking out.

922
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
That's a good way of putting it.

923
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah.

924
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,700
Technist says, yeah, it was okay.

925
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,980
It was mainly a canned response.

926
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,900
Dartitsuya says, better him than Kazurai.

927
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,860
Techie Q says, where was Kevin Butler?

928
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Uh-huh.

929
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,860
Good question.

930
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,500
Did you spot Kevin Butler there?

931
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,660
No, I did not spot Kevin Butler.

932
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:32,000
He was there last year, but I think they're like, okay, we did that joke, and now we can

933
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
move on.

934
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,140
Kaijuto in the chat room, one of the comments here I want to get, Sony didn't need to apologize.

935
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,740
Free games and getting it back up was enough.

936
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,740
Not their fault.

937
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,060
Some dicks hacked them.

938
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,560
I just had to say, though, that it really did sound quite a bit more sincere than the

939
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,740
other canned stuff we had before.

940
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,880
Yeah, it was one of those things where it was like, it could have been a lot worse.

941
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,260
But seeing as like most of the Twittersphere at the end of the day seems to be dogging

942
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,780
on Microsoft and Nintendo, again, I'm making broad generalizations.

943
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,580
But most of the Twitter that I'm looking at is dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, but

944
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:12,380
is kind of praising Sony, I would say, distraction successful.

945
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,380
I think that Sony-

946
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,260
Yes, that was a distraction event.

947
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Right.

948
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,660
Well, but it's exactly what their PR needed.

949
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,660
Speaking of audience reaction, Bobby, since you were there, how was it when you, in the

950
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,500
theater, when it was announced that the PlayStation Vita is going to be exclusive 3G on AT&T?

951
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,180
Because I could tell you, we heard it pretty clear, how bad was it where you were?

952
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,740
Was it really a lot of groans?

953
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:45,700
It wasn't loud, but I mean, I heard like all the laughter of, yeah, we figured it and all

954
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
the groans.

955
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,300
And we could even see Kaz was kind of like not expecting that.

956
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,060
I think if he had said the word Verizon instead, it would have been a much different reaction.

957
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,580
But no, it was very, that was the one negative part of their press conference was that.

958
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Yeah.

959
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,860
Nobody didn't present it very well, because honestly enough, I was in the chat.

960
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,820
I was watching online and so I was watching the people chatting in the sidebar and those

961
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,880
people are absolute blithering idiots, but they were just like, does that mean I can

962
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,460
only get it through AT&T?

963
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,340
And it's like, oh my God, please just die.

964
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,860
Well, and it just struck me as interesting because I feel like he started to say something

965
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:28,980
else like that deal had just been sealed within the past 48 hours.

966
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,420
He wasn't quite prepared to say that.

967
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,740
That's how it came across to me.

968
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,980
That's what E3 is all about.

969
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,740
I have AT&T on my iPhone.

970
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,780
I'm one of those people that's like, whatever.

971
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,860
I'm hoping there's a deal.

972
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:43,060
As we have iPhone plans, that doesn't mean that we get on for free.

973
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Yeah.

974
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,660
I'm not buying a 3G, PS, Vita, Velveeta, whatever.

975
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,660
Screw that.

976
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,820
Just, you know, tether to your iPhone or tether to, you know, whatever.

977
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,300
Well, let's talk about the Vita.

978
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,220
Bobby, I'll let you start it off since you were there.

979
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,420
What was kind of the reaction to the Vita that you saw?

980
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,340
What did you observe?

981
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,020
The people that were around me, they're like, okay, why are they saying that this is the

982
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,780
first time we've ever had augmented reality on a handheld because of the cameras?

983
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,420
And you know, why are they saying that this is the first time you've been able to do such

984
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,580
and such when they're like listing features in the 3DS?

985
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,060
But a lot of people are saying, you know, okay, I can see why they're doing it.

986
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,360
They think it's priced too high.

987
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,380
It's also the first time they've done it on a PlayStation Portable.

988
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:43,060
They have the camera for their stupid new iPad game and also for, what was it, the Invisimals

989
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,380
and stuff like that.

990
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,220
Well, interesting because a lot of the folks I was seeing online were really happy with

991
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,460
that price point saying, oh, Nintendo, Sony's coming after your 3DS.

992
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,780
Let me ask the chatters in our chat room.

993
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,720
Are you convinced you need a PlayStation Vita?

994
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,180
Why or why not?

995
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,100
How was your reaction to the price announcement?

996
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
So chat.orangelandre.com.

997
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:12,980
And here's one of the things that somebody said was that if it had HDMI output, sold.

998
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,340
Interesting.

999
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,340
What about that whole...

1000
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Now...

1001
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,580
Go ahead.

1002
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,280
I did not get the PlayStation Vita.

1003
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,680
They had it there, but it was a long ass line.

1004
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,900
And I decided that taking part in their distraction boos was more important.

1005
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,260
So I haven't been able to play the Vita yet, but they did have it there.

1006
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,940
But nobody I knew stood in the line because, like I said, there was distraction boos.

1007
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:36,940
Right.

1008
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,940
Right.

1009
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,540
You were kind of talking about the whole HDMI out and all that.

1010
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
One of the games that...

1011
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,700
And I'm sure this was the one that caught most people's attention was The Ruin, the

1012
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:52,620
dungeon crawler where they were playing it on the PSP and then did the transferring.

1013
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,220
So it's not just Konami doing this.

1014
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,260
Well, I guess it was a little different, but the transferring concept, I guess you could

1015
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,740
say, where they stopped on the PSP and then went right over to the PS3 and kind of picked

1016
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:02,740
it up.

1017
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,740
Right.

1018
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,740
Do they need...

1019
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,260
Yeah, and the question that I have about that is, do you have to be a PlayStation Plus member

1020
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,060
for the cloud savings?

1021
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,180
I would think so, yes.

1022
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,900
But obviously those are the details they want to leave out.

1023
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,540
Let me get to some of the immediate chat comments about the Vita.

1024
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,900
Tiger Claw says, I got to admit, the PS Vita for $249.99 is a pretty good price given all

1025
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,980
the tech that's in it.

1026
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,260
Savalas in our chat room says, does my new Vita have a firewall to protect me from hacks?

1027
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,260
Janai says, I will buy one, but it will feel like an updated PSP.

1028
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,580
Frisbee U says, nope, price is okay, but doesn't have any good games.

1029
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:44,340
Zappi says, I need a Vita, Uncharted, Wipeout, Little Deviants, and LittleBigPlanet look

1030
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,900
great.

1031
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,900
So lots of...

1032
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,820
Now, Tiger Claw says something here, and I want to kind of point this out.

1033
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,200
He says the PS Vita produced PS3 quality graphics.

1034
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,540
That is incorrect.

1035
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:04,700
It is comparable to the PS3 because the Vita has a smaller resolution, but it could not

1036
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,420
do 1080p PS3 quality graphics.

1037
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,900
It's because of the resolution of the screen is not 1080p.

1038
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,620
It's able, and it's also the screen is smaller, it's able to get away with making something

1039
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,340
that is comparable to the PS3, but it is not exact to the PS3.

1040
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,780
Hence why maybe the HDMI output may not be such a good idea.

1041
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,140
It may kind of ruin the quality.

1042
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,660
Right.

1043
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,300
And then you're going to get something that looks a little more PS2-ish when you actually

1044
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,300
hook it up to your TV.

1045
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,300
Right.

1046
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,780
Let's talk about some of the other stuff that happened at Sony's press conference.

1047
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:45,340
What about, well, there was obviously some new core Sony games shown, Uncharted 3, Resistance

1048
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,580
3.

1049
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,820
Any reactions to that?

1050
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,240
I thought the Uncharted 3 looked kind of cool because there was a very Helen Mirren slash

1051
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,820
Dame Judi Dench-esque villain in it.

1052
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,820
She was awesome.

1053
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,820
Yeah.

1054
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:00,820
It went over well.

1055
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,340
Everybody liked that, and a lot of people around me are like, why are they...

1056
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,740
Because the people that were around me in the VIP section, they were older than me.

1057
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,020
And they're like, God, do we really need more 3D?

1058
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,020
Do we really need more...

1059
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,100
Why are they pushing the 3D stuff on me?

1060
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,500
So that was kind of mixed in my area.

1061
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,820
I think it got more pop up in the seat.

1062
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:32,660
But what's interesting is that they had Ken Levine come out to talk about him doing the

1063
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:39,820
Vita, and they did not show Ratchet & Clank, which they had back there, and they didn't

1064
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,180
show Twisted Metal, which they had playable on that floor at the end.

1065
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,700
And so they left some of those out.

1066
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:51,420
The only game I played after that was Little Big Planet 2 with the Move support.

1067
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,700
Oh, what'd you think?

1068
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
They did...

1069
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,780
It was kind of what we expected.

1070
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,580
It's not Sackboy's prehistoric move.

1071
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:00,360
They did something a little different.

1072
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:06,140
And I got to play some of the story level from the one in their minigames.

1073
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:10,980
And the main tool that they give you is, I think it's like the brain-inator or something,

1074
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,660
but it's where you actually move things.

1075
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,420
So you're still playing Little Big Planet exactly the way that you're used to, with

1076
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:22,000
the buttons and the sticks and everything, and you're just moving things around and bouncing

1077
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,220
yourself off with some of these.

1078
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,960
And they did a really good job with it, and then they've got a minigame that they had

1079
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,340
in the play, where it's one of those, it's kind of like cut the rope a little bit, where

1080
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,660
there's a ball at the top and you're trying to get it to the end, but you have to place

1081
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,660
things.

1082
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,720
And then when you release the ball, it kind of goes through this Rube Goldberg machine

1083
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
that you've created.

1084
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Interesting.

1085
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
And that was kind of neat.

1086
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,980
So this is something that's going to be like free patch, free upgrade for Little Big Planet

1087
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,580
2, right?

1088
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,580
I believe so.

1089
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,300
It's not something I'm going to have to buy separately.

1090
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,460
And they better, because on the box of Little Big Planet 2, it says, better with PlayStation

1091
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Move.

1092
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,380
It's got the Move logo, but it's not part of the game right now.

1093
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,900
So I think that'd be kind of stupid if they put that on the box and then said, oh, but

1094
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,300
you got to pay extra to get that part that's in the blue sticker on the front of the box.

1095
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
It's just better if you own it.

1096
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
It just makes you feel good.

1097
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,180
Let me go to this comment in our chat room about the Move.

1098
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,420
Technis says, was it me or was the Move almost nonexistent in the entire press conference

1099
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,900
except for maybe four mentions and a game demo?

1100
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,100
And yeah, that medieval game they were showing that used the Move, medieval moves, Deadman's

1101
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,980
Quest, I got to admit, well, the facilitator they had doing it was probably their weakest

1102
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,300
one of the whole press conference.

1103
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,300
And I was-

1104
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,300
Good job, Jeremy.

1105
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,300
I was a little underwhelmed.

1106
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Good job, Jeremy.

1107
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,300
I was a little underwhelmed.

1108
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,580
Wasn't that the same guy that like showed up the stupid medieval tech demo last time

1109
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,100
when they were first showing off the Move stuff?

1110
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,900
The medieval tech demo last time was the sports champions thing, I think.

1111
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,900
Yeah.

1112
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,900
I think it's changed quite a bit.

1113
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,900
I don't think...

1114
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,060
Some of the ideas are probably still there, but I don't think any of the assets or anything

1115
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,060
is still the same.

1116
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,980
When they first showed it off, he was the guy demoing it.

1117
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
Hmm.

1118
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,980
Oh, same demo-er?

1119
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Maybe.

1120
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:13,500
One of the other big moments of the Sony press conference was a special unannounced guest.

1121
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1122
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,220
What?

1123
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
What?

1124
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,220
There was another move being shown.

1125
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,220
What's that?

1126
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,100
Kobe Bryant came out and sucked at it.

1127
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,780
I was just about to say that.

1128
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,600
Yeah, the other big guest that was at Sony's press conference was the Kobe Bryant moment.

1129
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,620
And I tweeted you and I'm like, quick, throw your shoe.

1130
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,620
What kind of...

1131
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,900
Yeah, but I liked my shoe too much.

1132
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,860
What kind of reaction did Kobe get from the crowd?

1133
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,260
Because it sounded very mixed.

1134
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,260
It was...

1135
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:45,140
I mean, he got some pops and, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, when he kind of made jokes

1136
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,620
about himself or something, that got some reaction.

1137
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,660
But it was, you know, we had partially a lot of answers for him.

1138
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,660
Right, right.

1139
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,860
It was a pretty resounding endorsement by him as well.

1140
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:01,180
I mean, I'm sure he gets paid handsomely to say it, but still, you know, you couldn't

1141
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,340
help but feel the little punch in the gut to EA after what happened to them last year.

1142
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:13,460
So one of the big, big buzz things that happened at the Sony press conference was those 3D

1143
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,460
monitors.

1144
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,340
And, you know, one thing Sony has definitely learned from the past is how to get a price

1145
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,340
right.

1146
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,860
Because, you know, when the PlayStation 3 was first announced, there was a lot of heckling.

1147
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,500
But now a lot of folks say the Vita is priced right.

1148
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:35,260
And now a 3D television with resistance 3, 3D glasses, HDMI cable, $499.

1149
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,060
3D monitor.

1150
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:43,340
3D monitor, oh, so it won't actually get TV signal.

1151
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,860
I guess it probably doesn't have an accessibility.

1152
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,940
And it's probably, it's probably going to be sized like your computer monitor.

1153
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,460
Like I don't know if they said what size it was.

1154
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,460
24 inch.

1155
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,180
24, so you're right on the money.

1156
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Yeah, 24 inch.

1157
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,340
So that that's not really TV.

1158
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,340
That's a monitor.

1159
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,940
Also, I wanted to mention something because I know I'm going to go back, I'm watching

1160
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
chat too.

1161
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,940
That's fine.

1162
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,660
Randy, you that E3 is the only place you can see Kobe play in June.

1163
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,940
Actually most times at E3, the LA Lakers are in the NBA finals and we have to fight them

1164
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,220
because the Staples Center is right next to E3.

1165
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,220
That's true.

1166
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,160
I'm actually glad he's not playing in June because that's hell.

1167
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:23,220
Me too because that means traffic on Thursday won't be as bad as it was the year before.

1168
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,660
But yeah, so well, I thought it was interesting the way he marketed it when they were, when

1169
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,800
he was mentioning the new monitor.

1170
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,460
It's perfect for a dorm room.

1171
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,060
I thought that right there was like a huge, like we know exactly who needs this and who

1172
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,500
our audience is for this.

1173
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,060
And I think that was right on the money.

1174
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:45,700
I think that's going to cause this thing to get on a lot of college wish lists this year.

1175
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,700
So we'll see.

1176
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,700
Except for me.

1177
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,700
Except for you.

1178
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,700
Not interested?

1179
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh yeah, because you don't, you don't do 3D.

1180
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,960
I can't see the 3D and actually it screwed me up.

1181
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,160
Like I was, because I was so close and at an angle and I put those glasses on because

1182
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,040
they were showing a lot of us, a lot of trailers in 3D.

1183
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:09,320
It was actually messing me up because I usually like, if I'm like looking straight at it,

1184
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
it's fine.

1185
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,420
Like it's just a darker 2D except for maybe some things that the edges, but being at that

1186
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,080
angle, it, it sucks.

1187
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,300
Now one thing that they said they were going to do with the 3D technology, this is the

1188
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,140
stuff with the technology that I really am looking forward to and I would actually be

1189
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:33,100
confused, is because they do the stutter technology, they have, you know, they actually implemented,

1190
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,920
and I don't know if they're showing it here or not, where, you know, instead of having

1191
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,320
each eye shutter differently, they have each pair of glasses shutter differently, you can

1192
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:47,020
actually have two different screens, or people seeing two different images on the screen.

1193
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
That is awesome.

1194
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,480
Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too and very Wave of the Future, very much so.

1195
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,100
So I want to get to Nintendo here in a minute, but a couple of things I've got to, got to

1196
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,580
mention out of the Sony press conference, we won't have time to hit everything, but

1197
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:05,340
Dar Sakura, I know you had been looking at Star Trek the game and some of the announces

1198
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,340
that were made around that.

1199
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,100
Did you hear about the PlayStation move that's going to look like a phaser?

1200
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,280
Why am I so not surprised either?

1201
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,580
I, I, I'm not going to lie, it sounds kind of awesome actually.

1202
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,820
I don't own a move yet and now I want to hold out and get one.

1203
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,620
I would only have a move if it looked like a phaser.

1204
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:25,060
I mean it really depends, like they didn't show a lot of the playable game and I don't

1205
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,340
know if it's out there on the, well probably not, it's still a ways out and they don't

1206
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,340
want to see the movie.

1207
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,340
It's pre-alpha right now.

1208
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,340
No, no, no.

1209
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,780
I'm trying to get an appointment to see the game.

1210
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,940
Oh, ho, ho, I hope you do.

1211
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,940
I really hope you do.

1212
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,940
I hope so too.

1213
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
Yeah.

1214
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,940
I want to count the lens flares.

1215
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,780
But with anything that new, I'm going to keep my judgment reserved.

1216
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
Right.

1217
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,100
I don't think you can count that high.

1218
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,780
But I mean they are investing a lot in this because it wasn't just this official game,

1219
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:53,980
but I guess a PSN precursor, I guess what comes to mind, Dead Rising 2K0-esque thing

1220
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:59,140
for the Star Wars game, or excuse me, Star Trek game is supposed to be there as well.

1221
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,180
More information next year, a little closer to the movie's launch I'm sure.

1222
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,940
Loki, I got to let you have a moment because they did mention at the PlayStation 3 conference

1223
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,060
exclusives coming to Saints Row the 3rd and I know you've got to have an opinion on that

1224
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,060
game.

1225
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,140
I don't really care about the exclusives that they have coming to that.

1226
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,700
I'm still getting on 360.

1227
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,700
Really?

1228
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:16,740
But what about the game itself?

1229
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,180
The game is fucking amazing.

1230
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:24,940
I saw some gameplay footage they had during an interview prior to one of the conferences

1231
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:33,220
and they have a guy just doing wrestling moves on random pedestrians and then they even showed

1232
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,900
the giant purple dildo weapon and stuff like that.

1233
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:41,300
They're talking about the vehicle that you can suck people up into it and launch them

1234
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,300
back out.

1235
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:46,140
It's going to be awesome.

1236
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,380
Basically they said that their goal was to make the most over the top game possible and

1237
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,660
everything that they asked to do in there, where they thought they would truly get turned

1238
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,940
down, they're like, nah, go ahead and do that.

1239
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:59,260
So I can't wait.

1240
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,060
I have to admit, I approve of that approach.

1241
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,060
You know what?

1242
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,060
Go big.

1243
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,580
But here's the thing too, I watched this morning the trailer, they have a new trailer out there

1244
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:15,020
for Postal 3 and I got to tell you, it looks like shit.

1245
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,900
Because they're like, oh, look how edgy we are.

1246
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,180
No, I'm sorry, Saints Row 3 blows that shit away.

1247
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,500
Who gives a fuck that you have a guy dressed up like a nut sack?

1248
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Who cares?

1249
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,700
There's a weapon that's a giant purple penis that you can hit people with in Saints Row

1250
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,700
3.

1251
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,500
If you want to do edgy, you're going to have to make a game based on the Human Centipede

1252
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,100
part 2.

1253
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:41,340
I don't know how much room we have for masturbating with barbed wire in a...

1254
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:46,340
Hey, did you see on the PS Vita, and Dan, I know you are a Fighting Game fan stream.

1255
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,340
Well, hang on.

1256
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Hang on.

1257
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,340
Yeah, yeah.

1258
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,340
I want to interject on the Saints Row thing real quick.

1259
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,340
Go for it.

1260
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:57,460
Because I haven't seen it yet, but they have done the most genius marketing here at E3.

1261
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,460
What's that?

1262
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:04,340
They bought or rented out for the week that parking lot across the street from Staples

1263
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,100
Center and have offered free parking to all E3 attendees that get in there.

1264
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,280
They have bikini models at the entrance trying to direct people in.

1265
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,540
They've got tents in there, and they've got it all decked out in Saints Row.

1266
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,540
Awesome.

1267
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,860
I know where we're going Thursday.

1268
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,860
No doubt.

1269
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,860
All right.

1270
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:29,020
Dan, I know you're a Fighting Game fan.

1271
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,020
Jamie's giving her husband a stare down.

1272
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,020
What?

1273
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,020
Jamie, come on.

1274
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,020
You know you want to see...

1275
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,020
You know, this is radio, so no one can see that.

1276
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,020
Jamie, even you have to admit boobies.

1277
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,920
I just didn't want him to get to the boobies first.

1278
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
There we go.

1279
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,460
There'll be plenty of boobies to go around at E3.

1280
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Even I'll get some boobies.

1281
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:48,460
All right.

1282
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,460
Word.

1283
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,460
And you'll like them.

1284
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,700
Let me ask this question real quick, because you're a Fighting Game fan.

1285
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,620
On the Vita, Street Fighter crossed Tekken, some of the first kind of footage of that

1286
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620
game in action.

1287
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,620
You're a fan?

1288
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,620
You a fan, Dark Zyra?

1289
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,620
He want.

1290
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,620
She loves Tekken.

1291
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,620
Yeah?

1292
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Are you kind of...

1293
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,620
Nah.

1294
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,620
You feeling a little...

1295
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,380
Like a 2D fighter?

1296
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,380
Well it's that whole...

1297
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,380
Made out of a 3D fighter?

1298
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
Yeah.

1299
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,380
Well...

1300
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,380
It'll be cool.

1301
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,380
That got very little reaction.

1302
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,380
Well, it was...

1303
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,380
The thing was, it was weird to me, because as much as I like that idea of Street Fighter

1304
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:25,140
crossed Tekken, then they announced, okay, so it's Street Fighter world and Tekken world

1305
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:30,600
collides, and then we're going to throw in Cole from Infamous, and it's like, what does

1306
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,440
he have to do with anything?

1307
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,460
Because Namco likes throwing in random characters.

1308
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,020
Like, if we're going to put our Tekken franchise on the line here, we've got to have random

1309
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,580
people who have nothing to do with the universe in it.

1310
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,380
We can't have Darth Vader, so here's Cole.

1311
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,860
Actually, since Namco's involved, why didn't they just put Kratos in there?

1312
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,860
I know, right?

1313
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,140
Everybody would have gave a shit if it was Kratos.

1314
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,220
Besides, wouldn't it be funny just to see Kratos just hacking up Ryu?

1315
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:56,220
Well, there's also that moment where, well, Kratos has now kind of already been done this

1316
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:59,980
year in Mortal Kombat, so it would be a little much to do another fighter back to back like

1317
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,980
that.

1318
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,980
Oh yeah, he's in Mortal Kombat, he's not in Soul Calibur.

1319
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,980
Yeah.

1320
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,860
They needed, though, instead of Cole, they needed the iPad, have the iPad fucking shit

1321
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:09,860
up in there.

1322
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,860
No, they needed Sackboy.

1323
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,860
Sackboy?

1324
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:12,860
No, no, no, no.

1325
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,860
Sackboy would have been amazing.

1326
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
Now you guys are getting stupid.

1327
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:18,740
No, no, no, it's not stupid, because keep in mind, Tekken 3, we had Gon.

1328
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,740
That's right, you do have Panda.

1329
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,740
Sackboy.

1330
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,900
No, well Panda and Kuma were always part of the story, but, I mean, freaking Gon.

1331
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,460
There's a bear fighting here, but, oh, Sackboy, that's ridiculous.

1332
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,460
That's silly.

1333
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,620
Oh, but you're playing a chibi dinosaur.

1334
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,620
You can have shit.

1335
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:35,620
You can punch him.

1336
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:39,540
You can, oh, actually, I can make it all the way through Tekken Street mode with Gon.

1337
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:44,780
All right, we gotta get to the next press conference this morning, Nintendo.

1338
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,580
Let's talk about Nintendo for a little bit.

1339
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:50,780
I'm gonna leave the room so that I can actually hear Loki without going deaf.

1340
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,780
What's that, Bobby?

1341
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,540
You don't want me to talk about James' addiction?

1342
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,300
Do you want to, oh, yes!

1343
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,060
I totally forgot to ask Bobby about what happened behind the scenes at the Sony press conference

1344
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,340
before we get to Nintendo, because, yo, when we're watching at home, it cuts out at the

1345
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:08,420
end, but you were there for, what, like two and a half more hours, right?

1346
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:11,100
Yeah, it ended at 10.

1347
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Wow.

1348
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,100
So what was happening, James?

1349
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,300
Basically, at the end of the press conference, the entire stage went away, and that's where

1350
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:22,340
all their demo kiosks were, and they brought food, lots of food, like grilled cheese sandwiches

1351
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:29,580
and pasta salad and cookies and cupcakes and other, like, it was great.

1352
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:34,220
And then beer and alcohol flowing open bar, and then at nine o'clock, James' Addiction

1353
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,220
comes on.

1354
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,220
Oh, James Addiction.

1355
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,580
I'm like, okay, I saw them in Activision last year, so I'm good.

1356
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:43,100
But they came out and did an hour set.

1357
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,780
And for no particular reason than, hey, we got James Addiction, because we're Sony.

1358
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,940
They better have been caught stealing.

1359
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,380
They had Mixmaster Mike there, too.

1360
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,380
I love him, too.

1361
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,380
Yeah.

1362
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,380
Wow.

1363
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:02,420
But him, they had all their trailers of their games, but it was messing with the color and

1364
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,220
everything, and that was kind of the visuals around.

1365
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:11,260
But they also had all these, like, scantily clad women on top of the stage's areas that

1366
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:17,260
were still doing, like, doing slow dances and stuff, and it was the techno music.

1367
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,780
And it was kind of weird, because we're sitting there playing video games while there's, like,

1368
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:27,180
a hot chick above us, like, kind of doing a pole game.

1369
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,660
So I guess they knew their audience.

1370
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,660
All right.

1371
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,260
So, and how many Sony beers did you have again?

1372
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,680
What?

1373
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,820
How many Sony beers did you have again?

1374
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,460
Honestly, because they had crappy beers, only one.

1375
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,980
Tonight is the night that I'm going to have way too many beers.

1376
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,980
All right, all right.

1377
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:43,980
Well, then we gotta, we gotta get-

1378
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,980
They had crappy beer?

1379
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,980
I'm so sorry.

1380
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,660
We gotta get through Nintendo's press conference so that Bobby can get to the beer drinking.

1381
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:51,660
But you know what?

1382
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,100
Bobby, with all due respect, I gotta let Loki kick this one off.

1383
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,460
So Loki, why don't you give us a little report on Nintendo's press conference?

1384
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:08,900
So Nintendo came out and basically showed off some of their 3DS stuff, and no one cared.

1385
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:09,900
No.

1386
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:14,740
No, they talked, first they started off actually by talking about the Zelda 25th anniversary

1387
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:15,740
edition.

1388
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,740
Which was awesome.

1389
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,540
Which, you know, they had, like, an orchestra.

1390
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:24,220
They had an orchestra, and they had Miyamoto out there, and my Zelda fanboy soul was like,

1391
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,220
yes!

1392
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,580
It was beautiful.

1393
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,500
And then they were talking about how they're kind of celebrating it on all the different

1394
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,500
platforms.

1395
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:37,540
For the 3DS, of course you had, you know, the Game Boy Color Zelda game that's available

1396
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,540
for download on there.

1397
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,460
It's gonna be the first one in the Game Boy Color Virtual Console lineup.

1398
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,660
I bought it.

1399
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,180
Sucker!

1400
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:53,260
And then for the Nintendo Wii, obviously, you know, Skyward Sword is gonna be available

1401
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,040
later this year.

1402
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,340
For the DSiWare, which I'm assuming also means the 3DS as well, they're gonna have Zelda

1403
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,460
the Four Swords Adventure as a free download, which is kinda cool.

1404
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,660
Too bad that's not playable by itself, though.

1405
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:18,900
And then of course they're also gonna do some sort of pre-order bonus for the 3DS with Ocarina.

1406
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:24,940
That you're gonna be able to get a music CD with the soundtrack from the game for if you

1407
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:32,080
register the game quite early on the Nintendo, you know, club thing.

1408
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:38,020
And then of course they're gonna do some sort of orchestra, you know, live shows and stuff

1409
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,860
like that with the Zelda music.

1410
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,820
It's gonna be all over the world.

1411
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:47,140
And then they're gonna have a CD for that that's gonna be available with the Skyward

1412
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,020
Sword game.

1413
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,620
And then 3DS stuff, they showed off, you know, the new Mario game, which looks kinda cool.

1414
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:58,160
It's kind of like a cross between Mario Galaxy and like Mario 64, which is not bad.

1415
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,380
And then Star Fox, they showed a little bit of that.

1416
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,780
I mean, it's just souped up Star Fox 64.

1417
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,780
What else did they show?

1418
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:13,300
Luigi's Mansion 2, which is, you know, supposed to be, you know, brand new for that and stuff.

1419
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,300
And I called that there was gonna be an augmented reality game where you hunt ghosts with the

1420
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,300
camera.

1421
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,420
I still think there is, but they just haven't announced that yet because it makes sense.

1422
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,860
With like the Face Raiders stuff.

1423
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:29,020
I just wanna know why Luigi's Mansion, because the first one was crap.

1424
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:30,020
It has its fans.

1425
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:34,180
Actually the best part of it was when you went into the attic and then the lightning

1426
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,780
would flash and then his shadow would be hanging by a noose.

1427
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,260
So and then, okay, so they do the Kid Icarus and all these 3DS games.

1428
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,060
The Kid Icarus and then Mario Kart, what the fuck's up with Mario Kart, okay?

1429
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:50,960
Mario Kart, now with, you know, monster trucks and, you know, hang gliders.

1430
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,960
And that's innovative.

1431
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,940
And they were like, you've never, you've never raced this game before.

1432
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:00,380
And like all the first few tracks that they were showing were all tracks from other games.

1433
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:07,060
I'm like, actually, yes, I have raced every single one of those.

1434
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:11,820
And then they decide, hey, you know what, let's talk about this new console that we've

1435
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:12,860
got.

1436
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,260
And of course what they do, they don't show the console, because, you know, that would

1437
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,260
be too easy.

1438
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,980
So they show the controller and the controller is basically everything that was rumored to

1439
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,980
be.

1440
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:25,100
It's, you know, it looks like it's made out of the plastic that's from the nunchuck or

1441
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,100
something like that.

1442
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,300
It's got the tiny stuff and it's got the, you know, 6.2 inch touch screen.

1443
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,540
And then they go to say, hey, what are we calling this thing?

1444
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,220
Uh, well, you know how everybody hated the name Wii, but then they eventually got used

1445
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:40,620
to it and stuff.

1446
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,620
We got another one for you.

1447
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:43,620
Wii U.

1448
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,620
What?

1449
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:49,460
I, like, seriously, they said Wii U is the name of that.

1450
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:50,940
I was like, what?

1451
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,380
My brain hurts for how stupid this is.

1452
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,140
But, you know, people will get used to it.

1453
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,220
They could still change their mind.

1454
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:03,940
You know, Dan and I were saying before the show, like, what if they had just called it

1455
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:05,000
the Nintendo U?

1456
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,620
I think that would have been, like, U as in Ultra IDK, like, I think Nintendo U would

1457
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,620
have been fine.

1458
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,620
No, well, here's the problem.

1459
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,460
They have to do Wii because people are fucking stupid and they're not gonna understand.

1460
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:19,840
I can use my Wii stuff with, see, then they know that they can use their Wii stuff with

1461
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,840
it.

1462
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Great.

1463
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:27,780
The problem is, is already everyone's kind of half assuming, I thought it was a new system,

1464
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,780
not just a new controller.

1465
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,780
And it is a new system.

1466
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,780
It is a new system.

1467
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,780
Dura does HD.

1468
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,780
People don't know that.

1469
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,820
They're just like, oh, I just use it with my existing Wii.

1470
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:45,340
I know Bobby is dying to jump in here in a minute here, but let me let Loki wrap up here.

1471
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,100
What other impressions did Wii U leave you with?

1472
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:55,500
It's a neat piece of hardware, but it just seems so gimmicky to me.

1473
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,500
I'm sorry.

1474
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,300
It's just, how expensive is it?

1475
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,500
Some of the graphics, like their little tech demo pre-rendered thing looked kind of cool

1476
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,860
and what it does.

1477
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,620
But the whole conference, they didn't fucking announce anything.

1478
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,620
Oh, okay.

1479
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:12,920
They hinted that Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and 3DS.

1480
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
They hinted at that.

1481
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,940
And then they said, oh, but that's gonna be a while now.

1482
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,460
Yeah, just like they hinted at Pikmin coming out.

1483
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,900
And how long has that been?

1484
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,340
Oh, wait, it's still not out yet.

1485
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:27,580
So Smash Brothers, oh, let's get them all excited and promise this game that's not gonna

1486
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,020
come out for two years.

1487
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:37,140
And then Wii U, and I'm sorry, it's just, like the tech demos they showed off, it's

1488
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:42,460
like, oh, hey, look, I can play Wii Sports Golf and I can put this controller on the

1489
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,580
ground and make it so I can see a ball there and stuff.

1490
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,460
All right, Bobby's been waiting patiently.

1491
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:52,220
Bobby, what do you think about them showing just a controller and not really showing the

1492
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,140
specs of the console off?

1493
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:58,460
Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.

1494
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,460
Sorry.

1495
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,460
Gun pal under the piss.

1496
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,460
Is there a fire truck driving by?

1497
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:10,020
So, well, first I want to jump in because we started with the 3DS stuff.

1498
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,020
Sure, go ahead.

1499
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,500
And I do want to mention that I have, like, 100 street pass me now.

1500
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,500
It's, like, awesome.

1501
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,260
I've almost got, like, all the puzzle pieces of all puzzles.

1502
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:30,620
But I played Mario Kart 3DS because they had a couple of games out in intense and stuff.

1503
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,260
And I actually did play it and I enjoyed it.

1504
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,260
It is Mario Kart.

1505
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:38,980
I mean, all the same tricks on how to, you know, boost around corners and stuff is still

1506
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:40,520
there and stuff.

1507
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,580
But to me, it was Mario Kart meets Diddy Kong Racing.

1508
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,860
How so?

1509
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:50,780
With all the different ways that you could, you know, like, either you would be a plane

1510
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:55,140
or you'd go underwater, which they didn't really do underwater in Diddy Kong Racing.

1511
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:01,140
But, like, with the planes and stuff and monster trucks and having the different types of vehicles

1512
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,140
and stuff.

1513
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,660
So that's kind of what it reminded me of.

1514
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:10,500
But it was still Mario Kart and, you know, it's, for fans of Mario Kart, it's a lot of

1515
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
it.

1516
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
Yeah.

1517
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
See, that's the problem right there.

1518
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,500
Okay?

1519
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,980
Here's basically what Nintendo's innovation is.

1520
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,180
All right.

1521
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,940
What can we add to this to make it better?

1522
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,180
Oh, let's add some more vehicle types.

1523
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,640
Do people really give a shit about more vehicle types?

1524
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,760
What they want you to do is they want you to come up with some new tracks and stop fucking

1525
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,880
repeating tracks from every goddamn game that you've already released.

1526
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,620
It would be nice to hear just a tinge about the online capability because 3DS already

1527
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,300
has better online than the Wii.

1528
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,940
So it'd be, I would like to hear more about that, but Bobby?

1529
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:46,940
Well, I mean, the tracks that they had in the demo that I played, you know, because

1530
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:51,980
the ones, like, that went underwater, you know, and there is, you know, different physics

1531
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,980
underwater.

1532
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,580
And, you know, gliding through the air and having to determine where you're going to

1533
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:58,620
glide and when you're going to go up and down.

1534
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:01,700
So I mean, the demo had new tracks.

1535
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,700
I don't recognize any of the tracks that were in the demo.

1536
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:09,820
Now, the trailer probably showed tracks that you might have seen, you know, segments of

1537
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:14,620
tracks that you've seen before, but, you know, like, yeah, there's a track that looks like

1538
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,660
the Donkey Kong tracks from the N64, but it's not the same layout.

1539
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,060
It just has the same scenery.

1540
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:29,300
So don't write it off based on the three second stiffness in the trailer because it does change

1541
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,300
it enough.

1542
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:35,580
Yes, it's still Mario Kart, and yes, it's still, you know, not new but fun, maybe.

1543
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,580
I don't know.

1544
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,580
It's just like how they thought-

1545
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,580
You know, a lot of people are like, what's wrong with more of what I like?

1546
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,340
It's just like how they thought it was necessary to put motorcycles in the Wii version.

1547
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,340
Who gives a shit?

1548
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,340
It's a kart racing game.

1549
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,340
You don't need fucking motorcycles.

1550
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:49,620
Oh, now let's put monster trucks in there.

1551
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,620
Who cares?

1552
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,780
Well, then it would be more like a side truck if they did that.

1553
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,780
Look at-

1554
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,780
No, no.

1555
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,780
See, here's what they do if it's a side truck.

1556
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:59,220
Oh, let's put jet engines in there and put, you know, let's put boats.

1557
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,220
All right.

1558
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,220
Look-

1559
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,220
Excite boats.

1560
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:03,220
Since we're talking 3DS, let me throw out-

1561
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:04,220
That's going to happen.

1562
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,700
We've just put that out in the atmosphere.

1563
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,700
Nintendo right now has just started to work on excite boats.

1564
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,020
Let me throw out this question for the chat room.

1565
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:17,380
For all you folks in chat who do not currently own a 3DS, are you interested in 3DS now?

1566
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,180
They showed more titles.

1567
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,800
I thought it was interesting, and that's the question I've got for our chat, chat.orangetouch.com.

1568
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,660
Are you interested in a 3DS now?

1569
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,500
Because I thought it was interesting because leading into that, Reggie, and Reggie just

1570
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,460
showed why he was Reggie.

1571
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:33,980
And he said something, and Bobby, maybe you can help fill me in here.

1572
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:38,740
He said something like, well, you want to see the same old stuff again, but you want

1573
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,740
to see innovation.

1574
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,740
And he goes kind of like, conflict, fine.

1575
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,740
We can handle that.

1576
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:45,740
That's our industry.

1577
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:46,740
Here you go.

1578
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,220
We're fucking Nintendo.

1579
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,220
Suck it down.

1580
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,220
Yes.

1581
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Let's see innovation.

1582
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,260
Hey, you will like it.

1583
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,620
Let's talk innovation, Nintendo.

1584
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,620
Let's start off.

1585
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,620
Innovation is deeper and wider.

1586
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,620
That's what she said.

1587
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:02,620
What?

1588
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,620
What?

1589
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,620
No.

1590
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:07,700
Let's talk innovation here, Nintendo.

1591
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,660
Animal Crossing.

1592
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,340
Now you can sit on park benches and go swimming.

1593
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,620
It's the same fucking game still.

1594
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:15,620
Same damn game.

1595
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:16,620
Same everything.

1596
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:17,620
There's the same patterns.

1597
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:18,860
I even saw the screenshots.

1598
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:24,060
The same fucking patterns that have been in that game since it first came out on the goddamn

1599
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,180
GameCube or in this stupid game.

1600
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,460
Actually, it came out on Nintendo 64.

1601
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:32,420
I understand that, but over here- For God's sake, it's fucking Animal Crossing.

1602
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,580
Who cares?

1603
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,900
I care because you know what?

1604
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,660
They get away with this shit with every goddamn franchise that they have because their fans

1605
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,660
love it.

1606
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,660
You know what?

1607
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,660
Your fucking Smash Brothers come out.

1608
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,460
I bet you that it's going to be all the fucking same characters again.

1609
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:47,980
Fuck, they're just going to pork that shit from the Wii is what's going to end up happening.

1610
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,820
But that's what makes it a franchise.

1611
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:50,820
Dark Sakura.

1612
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,820
I want it.

1613
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,580
I want the Smash Brothers too.

1614
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,580
Animal Crossing.

1615
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:00,580
I was actually going to start playing my GBA one again.

1616
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,140
Then I have to ask as a follow-up, why?

1617
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:09,620
Because I watched the anime last night and it was super cute and I was like, I remember

1618
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:10,660
this in the game.

1619
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,300
I remember that in the game.

1620
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,460
I miss playing it.

1621
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:14,460
You can ask Dan.

1622
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:15,460
He was here the whole time.

1623
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,460
As soon as they took out Unlock-A-Whole-Nest games, fuck that franchise.

1624
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:24,300
Bobby, do you think it's odd that they left Animal Crossing and Paper Mario out of the

1625
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,300
conference totally?

1626
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,860
Well, except for, I guess, logos at the end?

1627
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:35,380
I think that they felt they had enough that they were showing that they didn't teach you.

1628
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:40,100
What I was actually surprised at is that there were no live demos of games.

1629
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:45,460
They didn't bring those two out to show people.

1630
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,020
Is that maybe because the whole 3D, 2D thing?

1631
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,820
No, no, I'm talking about the Wii U.

1632
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,820
Oh, excuse me.

1633
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,820
I moved on already.

1634
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:53,820
Oh, sorry, sorry.

1635
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,820
But they didn't bring it out.

1636
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,100
They showed videos, but I'm like, is it even here?

1637
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,820
Because I'm seeing all these conceptual videos and stuff.

1638
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:05,700
I didn't even think it was even at E3, because usually they would have brought it out or

1639
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,700
something.

1640
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,220
Tethered to lovely-looking ladies, right?

1641
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,220
Yeah.

1642
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,180
Let me get to some of the feedback from our chat room on the 3DS, and then we'll move

1643
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,180
into Wii U.

1644
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,980
For the non-3DS owners, are you interested in a 3DS now?

1645
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:20,180
Gio Videa says, no, can't use the 3D on the 3DS anyway.

1646
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,900
Burr says, still not interested.

1647
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,140
Dungeon Buster, not really.

1648
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,620
Blender, not interested in the 3DS at all.

1649
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:28,620
So there's some of the negatives.

1650
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,620
But then we get some other positives.

1651
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,020
Dark Tetsuya, oh, definitely.

1652
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,220
New Mario Kart looks neat.

1653
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,220
Yay, Tanooki suit.

1654
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:38,620
I think he might be, or was Tanooki suit in Mario Kart, or is he just blurring the other

1655
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,620
Mario game?

1656
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,620
He's talking about the...

1657
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,620
He's blurring them.

1658
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,620
All right.

1659
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,180
Defective Candy says, no, I'm not impressed with the 3DS.

1660
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:47,540
Lacklustre title still, and the system was not even done when it came out.

1661
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,620
I'll stick to my DSi until they discontinue making games for it.

1662
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:53,420
Frisbee U, no, we don't want to see the same stuff again.

1663
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:58,260
Technus, I want Star Fox 64 3DS, but the picture thing was so fucking stupid.

1664
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,260
So no.

1665
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,500
Interesting, because there's not a lot of yeses.

1666
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,820
And here's the thing about Star Fox, that he was talking about fucking innovation, how

1667
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:11,380
you can tilt it to, you know, you can optionally, I guess, tilt it to control, you know, your

1668
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:12,380
ship.

1669
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,740
Yeah, except it fucks up the 3D when you do that, dumbass.

1670
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,300
Oh, no kidding.

1671
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,860
Let's put tilt controls on a 3D game that requires you to keep the system at an actual

1672
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,020
view so that you can see the 3D.

1673
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:29,140
I guess that's for people who don't give a shit about 3D, but then again, why the fuck

1674
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:31,540
are you buying, you know, a 3DS sim?

1675
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:35,300
Or better yet, why the fuck are you buying a game that came out on the Nintendo 64?

1676
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,660
Oh, because that's innovation for Nintendo.

1677
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,580
We can port old shit and make it slightly better.

1678
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:41,780
The hobby wants to jump in.

1679
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:48,540
Well, I mean, I am a 3DS because it's a higher resolution top screen.

1680
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:53,900
For me as well, like, I bought a 3DS because I skipped the DSi and I skipped the DSi XL

1681
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:57,340
and I, you know, the last one I had owned was a DS Lite, so I thought, eh, it's time

1682
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,340
for upgrade.

1683
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,340
Why not?

1684
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,340
That's why I did it.

1685
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:04,700
But anyway, let's move on to Wii U because I know Bobby wants to move on.

1686
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:07,580
Let me throw a question out to chat that we'll get to in a minute.

1687
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:12,360
And then I want to talk, Bobby, your time with the hands-on Wii U.

1688
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:16,980
On a scale of 1 to 10, chatters, 10 being very and 1 being not at all, I'm sounding

1689
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:21,000
like a club Nintendo survey, but I'm just kind of curious here, 1 being not at all,

1690
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,420
how interested are you in Wii U?

1691
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,860
Scale of 1 to 10, 1 not at all, 10 very.

1692
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:33,980
Bobby, you got your hands on it after four hours of waiting, right?

1693
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,980
What do you think?

1694
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:40,320
First off, what I want to say is I want to give a history lesson.

1695
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,920
Back in 2005 at Nintendo's press conference, they decided that they were going to show

1696
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,620
this brand new revolutionary control scheme.

1697
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:57,740
And they showed the remote and they did, you know, that was when, you know, Miyamoto came

1698
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,460
out, flashing Zelda swords and all that stuff.

1699
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,820
And they showed it.

1700
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:06,300
And when you played the games, you realized they were running on Gamecubes.

1701
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:10,300
And that's where the whole joke of two Gamecubes tucked together came from.

1702
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:15,340
In 2006, they actually showed the console that the controller was for.

1703
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:22,220
Fast forward to 2011, they are showing the controller for their next console, but they're

1704
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,340
not telling you that much about the console itself.

1705
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:27,900
They're focusing on the input mechanism.

1706
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,020
Next year, we're actually going to see more of the console.

1707
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:38,620
Now, the demos that they're showing here are running on new hardware, but it's not like

1708
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:42,160
they even like to show a box there, but I was actually told that's not running anything.

1709
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,180
It's like running, there's a PC back there, running a, you know, a souped-up Wii dev kit.

1710
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,900
And that's what they're running things off of.

1711
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,380
So they're not ready to talk about the console yet.

1712
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:57,180
They're trying to get people to concentrate on the controller and the conceptual demos.

1713
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:02,700
There is not a single retail game being shown, except, well, okay, there's one retail game

1714
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:06,500
and it's a third-party game that's being shown here at E3 for the Wii U.

1715
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,940
So I kind of wanted to straighten that out.

1716
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:12,340
Which one is that, the Lego game?

1717
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,340
Huh?

1718
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,340
Which, what's the third-party game?

1719
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:15,340
The Lego game?

1720
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,340
Uh, no.

1721
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,660
They're showing Ghost Recon online.

1722
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,660
Oh.

1723
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:19,660
Wow, okay.

1724
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:23,060
You know what, though, Bobby, you're wrong because those are going to be an actual game

1725
01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:26,020
because that's what Wii Sports and Wii Play ended up being.

1726
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:29,700
It's all those tech demos and they've had, hey, you know what, we're going to be innovative.

1727
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,260
We're going to slap that shit together, kind of duct tape it a little bit, and throw it

1728
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:37,500
out with a controller because people are suckers and they want free controllers.

1729
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,940
But Bobby, that should make Bobby happy because that Chase Me is basically Pac-Man Versus.

1730
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,940
Pac-Man Versus is awesome.

1731
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:44,940
Right.

1732
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,300
And what I'm saying is, like, people are, you know, when people look at these stuff

1733
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,900
they're going to be like, wow, they're going to make me pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.

1734
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,020
No, they're not going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.

1735
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:58,740
They're going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me, Battle Me, and all that other stuff.

1736
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,220
But I mean, they were very adamant with me when I talked to people that actually worked

1737
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:05,060
at Nintendo and weren't just hired for the Wii.

1738
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:08,340
As you can tell, by the way, because the people that worked at Nintendo have QR codes of their

1739
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,300
knees on their badge that you can scan.

1740
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,420
But they actually were very adamant saying these are conceptual demos.

1741
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,460
These are not final products.

1742
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:25,420
These are to get your mind working and trying to tell you this is the type of stuff you

1743
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,420
can do.

1744
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:33,820
Yes, we may see, you know, the shield pose game and Chase Me and Battle Me in some kind

1745
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:37,620
of compilation, but not as stand-alone games.

1746
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:41,820
The only stand-alone games, like, they had the Mario game running there and then, you

1747
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,180
know, goes online running.

1748
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,260
But the rest were tech demos.

1749
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,740
Just so you guys know, the feedback on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very, 1 being not at

1750
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:53,540
all, how interested are you in the Wii U?

1751
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:56,460
I see lots of, it's just all over the board.

1752
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,920
There's some 9s, but there's also some 1s.

1753
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,520
There's a 0 from Joe Videa.

1754
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,900
A lot of 5s and 4s, and then like a 6.

1755
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,380
So there's a universal meh.

1756
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,380
It's all over.

1757
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,580
And that's because, it's because it's all conceptual right now.

1758
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,180
People aren't seeing final products right now.

1759
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:17,340
And you know, even the hardware isn't finalized.

1760
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:21,540
And they didn't really emphasize enough that, you know, this is a new console.

1761
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,460
You could actually walk away from there, and even I thought, this is just a new controller

1762
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,240
for my Wii.

1763
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:33,620
And you know, right now you're playing some of the games with Wii Remote, it's got a Wii

1764
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:41,420
sensor bar underneath each TV, even though there's a sensor bar in the Wii Wii controller.

1765
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:45,740
But essentially, I eat this out of them.

1766
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:52,180
The console is called the Wii U, and they haven't named the controller yet.

1767
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:54,220
I want to name it Bob.

1768
01:21:54,220 --> 01:22:02,380
I just wonder this, are we ready for the era of the game controller to cost $100 plus?

1769
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:07,620
I don't think it will, because that touch screen is not, it's a cheap, it's the DS touch

1770
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:08,620
screen.

1771
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:09,620
I called it on Sunday's show in Summerguard.

1772
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,020
But it's a 6 and a half.

1773
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,020
It's larger.

1774
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:15,460
Well, I don't think, I still think, it's a lot larger.

1775
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,460
I don't know.

1776
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,460
7980.

1777
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,420
Yeah, but it's larger, but it's not multi-touch.

1778
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,420
So that's one big thing.

1779
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,420
Bobby went, go ahead.

1780
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:27,660
Yeah, go ahead, finish your thought, sorry.

1781
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:31,020
So it didn't seem to be like, I couldn't do any multi-touch stuff.

1782
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,980
Maybe their current demos don't have multi-touch, but yeah, I mean, it's just a larger version

1783
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,940
of the DSi screen.

1784
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:43,140
Bobby, were there any demos that were using more than one of those controllers on the

1785
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,140
same system?

1786
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,520
Because that was something I noticed at the conference, none of the games were using more

1787
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,000
than one of those controllers.

1788
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,980
Everything was supplemented with additional Wiimotes.

1789
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:55,060
I didn't get a good look at Battle.me.

1790
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,980
That was the only one that might have.

1791
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:01,940
But everything else, it was either, you know, it was a one-player experience, or, you know,

1792
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:07,340
it was one person using that, and then four Wiimotes.

1793
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:11,520
I think I watched a video of Battle.me on Nintendo's website, and I want to say the

1794
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,820
person flying the spaceship was using the controller, and everybody else was on a Wiimote,

1795
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:19,780
so no, if the videos are to be the definitive answer.

1796
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,180
I thought that was interesting.

1797
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:26,540
Like, maybe the price of the controller really isn't going to be such an issue, because they

1798
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,860
aren't really going to have you, or want you to have more than one.

1799
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,060
Maybe the games aren't really going to need more than one.

1800
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,060
That's baloney.

1801
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:35,860
That sounds to me like just the whole thing with the GBA connector.

1802
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:36,860
Oh yeah.

1803
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:37,860
Oh yeah.

1804
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,860
It's the same theory.

1805
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:41,460
Why don't they just make a connector for the DS?

1806
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:44,060
Here's the thing.

1807
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:48,980
The controller is not creating any graphics, and I think that might be why.

1808
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:49,980
They're actually...

1809
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:56,420
The graphics on the controller is being created by the Wii Wii Wii Wii, and it's being sent

1810
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:02,780
wirelessly with very little lag to the controller.

1811
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:08,540
That makes sense, and that's some technology you can see right now in the PS3 and the PSP.

1812
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,940
You can log into your PS3 on your PSP.

1813
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:15,860
It's a very little advertised feature, but you can fire up your PSP and log into your

1814
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,740
PS3 and see the image on your PSP, and it does work.

1815
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:25,100
And remember back when Kasarai was first showing Ridge Racer, the original concept was that

1816
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,220
that PSP was supposed to be your rear view mirror.

1817
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:32,500
We never saw that really fully realized, but the idea was out there a while ago.

1818
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,420
If no one minds actually if I go back to an old point, because she just made the point

1819
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:38,420
to me.

1820
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,420
Sure.

1821
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:46,180
But Sierra has said that as a person who bought around eight different versions of Final Fantasy

1822
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,900
VII, I don't care if it's the same game.

1823
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,700
Talk about back to the Animal Crossing thing.

1824
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,540
The fans will buy it if they like it, so that's why it says the same thing.

1825
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:58,300
Then the fans can't complain when they say, oh, well, it's just the same game, they didn't

1826
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,300
do anything.

1827
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:01,300
Four, not seven.

1828
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:08,580
Bobby, you're in a unique position that none of us, and probably most of our chatters and

1829
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:12,040
even listeners are in tonight, where you're the only one that's actually held one of these

1830
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,140
Wii U's.

1831
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:18,180
So coming out of there, how are you, because I know you said at the end of the press conference

1832
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:21,980
you were feeling a little meh, but coming out of the demo, are you thinking you're going

1833
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:28,160
to buy a Wii U, or are you kind of like, I need to see more next year?

1834
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:33,340
I want to hand Nintendo my wallet, and they say here, take it.

1835
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:37,340
And what was it about it that just made you go, I'm sold?

1836
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:43,980
Well, I can actually contextualize a lot more, and I can see where they're going with it

1837
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:49,220
and a lot of the neat stuff that they're doing, and the neat gameplay that they're doing with

1838
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,900
that, and what they can do.

1839
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:55,860
I can kind of see where they're going with it, which a lot of people usually can't.

1840
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,740
When they first announced the DS, everybody was like, why would I want a touch screen

1841
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,620
on my game?

1842
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:06,260
And now iPhone games are really popular.

1843
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,580
And I could see where that was going, and nobody else could figure out why would I want

1844
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,740
a touch screen gaming system.

1845
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:16,660
I actually saw, when I first saw the DS, here's why you'd want a touch screen gaming system.

1846
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:19,700
I could actually see it, and it's true.

1847
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,100
And a lot of people are like, oh, this is a gimmick and all that stuff.

1848
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:26,700
And a lot of Nintendo's innovations have been copied by everybody else, and they were called

1849
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:31,220
gimmicks at first, like Rumble was a gimmick.

1850
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:37,300
And now we have touch screens on everything, motion controls are on everything.

1851
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:41,700
I think that Nintendo is going to innovate in this space, and you're going to see in

1852
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,700
a couple years other companies copied them, and it's not the first time they've done this

1853
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:50,060
because they've already done the GameCube, Game Boy Advance thing.

1854
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,500
So they've already got a track record of some of the stuff they already know.

1855
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,780
Very, very interesting response.

1856
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,700
I know this is all speculation at this point, no one knows, but any idea when this thing

1857
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,820
might hit shelves?

1858
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:06,660
Does it seem like, no, we're going to have another E3 where we see the Smash Brothers

1859
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:11,100
and we see the games, and we're going to talk Holiday 2012, or is this going to be a 3DS

1860
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,500
style launch where you think maybe it's coming March?

1861
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,580
Holiday 2012.

1862
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,580
It'll be Holiday 2012.

1863
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:23,020
Just from being in retail, Nintendo always saves the machines for Christmas.

1864
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,020
But not the 3DS?

1865
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,740
No, no, not the portables.

1866
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:31,500
No, this is coming from one of those guys that has the QR code on his badge.

1867
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,500
Oh, okay.

1868
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,500
So that's the official word, then.

1869
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:38,420
Bobby, what did you think about the analog 6 being above the actual D-pad and the face

1870
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,420
buttons?

1871
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,460
That's a little backwards compared to the controllers now.

1872
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,460
3DS is that way.

1873
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,460
It felt natural.

1874
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:44,460
All right.

1875
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,460
All right.

1876
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:51,540
Because of where the triggers are, there's the triggers and then the LB and the RB, but

1877
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:56,020
because of where they are, that is the exact position your thumb would really want to be

1878
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,420
if you wanted to use the dual analog sticks.

1879
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:03,120
Bobby, if I'm not mistaken, you were kind of in this wee line yourself and doing this

1880
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,460
whole thing, kind of going in there by yourself.

1881
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:09,500
Now, I know when I'm in a big environment like that by myself, because I did E3 myself

1882
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,340
one year, or at least one of the days, and one of the things that I couldn't help but

1883
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:16,460
do was listen to other people around me and do a little bit of people watching.

1884
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,100
Yes, I was being a little nosy.

1885
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,980
Were you doing any of that maybe in the Nintendo booth and kind of picking up some of the buzz

1886
01:28:21,980 --> 01:28:25,860
from people around you?

1887
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:30,500
Not really, because everybody around me spoke different languages.

1888
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Touche.

1889
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,500
All right.

1890
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,380
But, I mean, people were generally, they had been in that line for so long, they weren't

1891
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:45,020
really enthusiastic except for in the shield pose game where you kind of have to be, but

1892
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:48,100
you know, some people, it seemed like they got a decent response.

1893
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:52,060
I think the hate that's on the internet is not on the show floor.

1894
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,060
Okay.

1895
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,780
A lot of questions from chat.

1896
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,780
We have a couple, chat.ownerswannatraday.com.

1897
01:28:56,780 --> 01:29:00,660
Frisbee U says, Bobby, does the controller feel too big?

1898
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,300
And Jenai asks, how heavy is the controller?

1899
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:10,040
The controller is actually lighter, or it's about the same as my iPad.

1900
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,780
If I don't have a cover on it, it feels about the same weight as my iPad does.

1901
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:15,780
Okay.

1902
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,780
And how did it feel?

1903
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:22,420
And as for, it felt natural, like, I mean, you think it's big, but then you hold it and,

1904
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:27,460
you know, I mean, I had normal-sized hands, and it felt fine, because you're not reaching

1905
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,940
all the way down to the bottom.

1906
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,900
Like, all the buttons are easily accessible.

1907
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:36,500
You know, it's, you know, yeah, it's also, I mean, it's also a prototype controller as

1908
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,500
well.

1909
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:41,380
It could change at the end, and it was also, like, tied down, like, four different ways.

1910
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:42,380
You couldn't take it.

1911
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,260
But that probably added the weight as well.

1912
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,900
But no, it felt natural.

1913
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,620
It felt, it was lighter than I expected.

1914
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:55,660
D.R. Froyev, I don't even think you would know the answer to this, but maybe some buzz.

1915
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,140
What is the battery life like on that Wii U controller?

1916
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:02,780
We didn't hear anything about, like, is it batteries, is it charge, how does it work?

1917
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,780
Nothing on that.

1918
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,300
Well, it was wired when I played it.

1919
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:11,060
Ah, so maybe it's feeding, well, no, because they showed in the other concept videos, it's

1920
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,060
going to be wireless.

1921
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:17,420
We talked about beaming the image wirelessly, but it's too early now, it's early on.

1922
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,460
The proto pictures I've seen online look like they have a charge port on them.

1923
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:22,980
I want to know what this parrot has to do with anything.

1924
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:23,980
Bobby?

1925
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,980
It's just in a demo.

1926
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,980
What?

1927
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,980
I'm sorry, you were going to say something, we were cutting you off.

1928
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:36,220
No, it was just, it's wired here, it's a prototype, I mean, things change, you know, I mean, the

1929
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:40,780
3DS didn't really change all that much, but I remember, like, the original DS was different

1930
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:45,100
when it came out, so this is the prototype thing, it could change its layout, I don't

1931
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,700
even think they know what the tech specs are going to be in the final product.

1932
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:53,700
Alright, let's move on from Nintendo a little bit, Bobby, because I know, but what?

1933
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,900
I gotta say one thing.

1934
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,660
Alright, yes please, Logie.

1935
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,660
I gotta say, cycling sounds awesome!

1936
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:00,660
What?

1937
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:04,700
Didn't you ever see, didn't you see that part where they're doing the FaceTime thing?

1938
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,700
Let's go cycling!

1939
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,700
Cycling sounds awesome!

1940
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:10,060
Actually, I do have one question about the controller itself.

1941
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:14,020
How is it ergonomically?

1942
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:20,140
Like I said, when I held it, my fingers went to all the right places, and it, like, on

1943
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,460
the back, which you don't get to see all that much, there is actual grooves for you to hold

1944
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:34,740
with your three fingers that aren't playing with the triggers, and it felt, it felt good,

1945
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:39,940
I mean, it was like, I picked it up, and my hands were in the right place, it didn't hurt,

1946
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:46,180
or anything, they've got it ergonomically sound for at least my size hands.

1947
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:49,220
That's what I was wondering about, because it was actually, people were talking about

1948
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:53,500
the original Xbox controller, about it being massive and huge and too big for everybody,

1949
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,540
and I was like, well I wonder if this thing, and then I looked at it, and from the front,

1950
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:00,660
it doesn't look like it's very ergonomically comfortable.

1951
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:04,900
But again, on the back, it's got grooves on the back that, well, for you to hold onto

1952
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,700
and for your fingers to naturally curve around.

1953
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,940
Well, see, I was thinking the same logic, though, with the Saturn dual analog controller

1954
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,260
on the front, it doesn't look like it would be very comfortable, but it's one of the most

1955
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,660
comfortable controllers there are.

1956
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Yeah.

1957
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:17,540
So, yeah, I was wondering if it was along the same lines.

1958
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:18,540
Yeah.

1959
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:23,420
Okay, so for real now, moving on from Nintendo, because Bobby wants to go to some parties,

1960
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:29,020
so we gotta let him go soon, but Bobby, any other observations from the show floor today?

1961
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:32,940
Was your whole day Wii U, or did you get to see some other stuff?

1962
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:37,660
I had an appointment with EA Sports, so I got to play the pre-alpha build of the new

1963
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:44,500
SSX, and I can see that people who like SSX are really gonna like this.

1964
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:50,180
They've talked about how they've got this snow avalanche system that is dynamic, like

1965
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:56,880
it's not split second or anything that has these predetermined catastrophic events.

1966
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:04,380
They actually say that they take the stability of the area, how stable it is, to see if that

1967
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:09,580
actually affects more snow or stops the snow, and that's one of the modes where you're trying

1968
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:13,980
to survive, not die, you're trying to get down this mountain without getting crushed

1969
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,980
by snow.

1970
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:17,660
It's very uplifting.

1971
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:26,060
But they did basically Google Earth, it was kind of funny, they licensed with NASA topography

1972
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:31,220
data of the entire world, and they said it's nice to have friends in high places, that

1973
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:38,260
was their pun, and they had all the major mountain ranges, and you can pick those mountains

1974
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:43,060
to go down, and it's the actual mountains from the actual NASA topography data, and

1975
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:45,180
those are the mountains that you go down.

1976
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:49,820
And they've done some things with it, like one of the mountains that's on the China border,

1977
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:52,900
they decided they were gonna put pieces of the Great Wall of China in there that you

1978
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,780
could grind off of and stuff, though it's not completely realistic.

1979
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:00,380
But it's still, it's a lot more than they've done in the past.

1980
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:06,140
But it worked well, I mean, it's not a final build by any means, there was some lag in

1981
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:07,780
it, but I mean, that's because it's a pre-alpha build.

1982
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:08,780
Interesting.

1983
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:13,260
So basically, I saw that, they showed me some stuff about HEPA, which I'm not a huge Docker

1984
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:18,620
fan, but it was kind of neat, some of the stuff they did, so I saw that, and then I

1985
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:24,580
walked through Microsoft's booth to see what was kind of in there, and I'm going to go

1986
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:30,780
play that Disneyland Connect game, because I know where I'm going Friday.

1987
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,700
And Friday is a research trip.

1988
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:38,420
Friday is a research trip.

1989
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:42,860
But apparently in the demo, like I guess in the briefing, because I didn't see the briefing

1990
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:49,940
I was in the air, but apparently I guess it cuts off at the end of the Peter Pan ride?

1991
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:50,940
In the presser?

1992
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:54,740
I think so, yeah, I just thought it was a time thing, yeah.

1993
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:55,740
Yeah.

1994
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:58,980
Well, it cuts off, apparently you do actually fight Captain Hook.

1995
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:01,340
Now they showed that a little bit.

1996
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:02,340
Interesting.

1997
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,020
Maybe it was in a video or something, alright.

1998
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:06,020
What else?

1999
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,060
There was that, and then I walked by and I immediately thought of ROG, because there

2000
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:17,980
were these four chicks wearing black dresses up on a stage, doing the time warp.

2001
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:18,980
From the Rocky Horror Picture Show?

2002
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,420
And I just had to get pictures.

2003
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:23,820
And so this means they're doing a Rocky Horror Picture Show video game?

2004
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:24,820
Yay!

2005
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:25,820
Yes!

2006
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,820
Yes, it is called Glee Karaoke Revolution 2.

2007
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:29,820
Ugh.

2008
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:30,820
No.

2009
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:36,100
You've mentioned the four-letter G word.

2010
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:37,100
Therefore I must go in-

2011
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,100
I even took video for you.

2012
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,100
Oh, wait, here we go, here we go.

2013
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:47,860
You mentioned the four-letter G word, now I must go throw up.

2014
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:52,620
Well, yes, and I did get the picture, thank you Bobby.

2015
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:57,700
Did you get some hands on time with anything else?

2016
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,700
Not really.

2017
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:03,220
I mean, I did, I stopped by, I have a friend who works at Double Fine, and I walked by

2018
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:09,220
and played Trenched, which is their Xbox Live arcade game, which is a third-person mech

2019
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:15,900
tower defense game, where you're fighting waves and waves of enemies, and you can drop

2020
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,580
turrets and different things like a tower defense game, but then you're also in this

2021
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,780
mech shooting at them, and running around and stuff.

2022
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:27,780
It was two-player offline because I was playing with the person standing next to me on his

2023
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,780
console.

2024
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:36,660
Unfortunately, this demo, they dropped you at a mission that's like in the last third

2025
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:41,020
of the game, so you've already gone through the tutorial by this point and all that stuff,

2026
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:46,100
and it was a little confusing key because I haven't really done much with the game,

2027
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,380
but I can see people liking it.

2028
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:54,200
It's not over the top like you'd expect from Kim Schafer, though.

2029
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,360
So what's on deck for you tomorrow?

2030
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:57,360
What are your plans?

2031
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,580
I know we mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'm sure you want to talk about your Twitter

2032
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:01,580
project.

2033
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:06,640
Right, I have two appointments tomorrow, and other than that, I'm letting people direct

2034
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,980
me.

2035
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:13,060
My two appointments, just so people kind of know, at one o'clock, I'm going to visit a

2036
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:16,620
Georgia company, because being in Georgia, I actually have contacts there.

2037
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:22,420
I'm going to go to CCP Games, where they just announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3

2038
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:27,420
exclusive, and they're actually going to show the connectivity between Dust 514 on the PlayStation

2039
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:30,900
3 and Eve Online, the Excel spreadsheet simulator on the PC.

2040
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:37,980
I'm very curious about that, because we miss that with so much coming out of Sony.

2041
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:42,540
But yeah, I'm very interested in this whole, how does this game impact the MMO of Eve Online?

2042
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,860
Very interested.

2043
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:48,020
Yeah, and I am too, because I have played Eve a little bit, so I actually understand

2044
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:50,580
the universe and stuff, so I'm going to go in there and see them.

2045
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:54,340
And then at four o'clock, I do have a Bethesda appointment, where I'm going to get to see

2046
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:57,540
the demo of Skyrim that everybody else has seen already.

2047
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,300
Yeah, I guess it was on TV.

2048
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:02,820
I think we saw a portion of what will be a longer demo for you.

2049
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:07,100
I heard it's a 30-minute demo behind the doors, so very curious about that.

2050
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:11,120
So good, those are two games we can definitely talk more about tomorrow.

2051
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,900
And so if folks want to follow you on Twitter?

2052
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,020
Bobby Blackwolf.

2053
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:20,520
And tomorrow also, I'm going to be trying to hit Atlas, so if you have any specific

2054
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,540
questions about Catherine or any of other Atlas games, I'm probably going to hit them

2055
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:27,080
after the CCP appointment, because they're next door.

2056
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,700
And our Chibi Wolf picture?

2057
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,900
I'm going to go try to find Natsume and get your Chibi Wolf picture and everything.

2058
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:34,900
Yay!

2059
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,900
Need to go play Scenes Row 3.

2060
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:38,900
I need my cowl.

2061
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:42,940
Let me, actually, the one thing, not to load you up with assignments, Bobby, but there

2062
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:47,040
is a couple, maybe you already know the answers to a couple of these, but there's two things

2063
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,460
that are kind of missing right now, where I'm like, what happened to...

2064
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:56,060
One of them is Grand Theft Auto V. Everybody was convinced Grand Theft Auto V was debuting

2065
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:58,360
at E3, and we have heard nothing.

2066
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,360
It's gone.

2067
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,020
It's not there, right?

2068
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:03,520
I have not seen it.

2069
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,700
And then the other big question mark is, what the hell's Activision doing?

2070
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,940
Yeah, they've got a booth.

2071
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,440
I'll go stop by them, but I think they're doing this little game that's called Modern

2072
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,440
Warfare 3.

2073
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,440
Oh, yeah.

2074
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,440
All right.

2075
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,440
They're fine.

2076
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,440
Don't know if you've heard of it.

2077
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,840
Well, but still, when Activision is a huge company like EA and EA, I could name easily

2078
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:27,080
like 10 games EA we know they're doing.

2079
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,800
Activision's got maybe a couple, you know.

2080
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:30,800
I'd like to know.

2081
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:31,800
No, they have more than that.

2082
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,200
Yeah, but where's the bungee game?

2083
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,240
Where's, you know, I just thought there'd be more coming out from Activision.

2084
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,440
Maybe because of lack of press conference.

2085
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,680
I don't know.

2086
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:40,680
Any music games?

2087
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:41,680
Yeah, they've scaled back.

2088
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,680
Yeah.

2089
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,680
Mm.

2090
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,680
Very interesting.

2091
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:50,640
Yeah, it's Modern Warfare 3 for them, X-Men Destiny, Spider-Man, uh, where are they?

2092
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,640
Spyro.

2093
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,920
Well, the Activision, if I'm not mistaken, was awesome.

2094
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:57,920
Spyro, cha-ching, Skylanders is what that's called.

2095
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:04,120
It's basically, hey, guess what, we're gonna charge you $70 for the starter kit, and then

2096
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:08,880
if you want your individual, you know, collect them all figurines that you can use for playable

2097
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,000
characters in the game, those are each gonna cost you $8.

2098
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,800
If I'm not mistaken, wasn't Activision also at one time the company that said, we're just

2099
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,280
not doing E3 anymore?

2100
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,280
Yeah, exactly.

2101
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,280
Yeah.

2102
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:26,400
And their big title now is so big that they're just like, we don't need E3, really.

2103
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,480
You know, if they're gonna do a show, we'll make an appearance, but we don't want to spend

2104
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:30,480
the money or the time.

2105
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,160
Well, then I hope Battlefield 3, you know, blows the shit out of them, because that game

2106
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,440
looks nice.

2107
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,400
Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.

2108
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,400
Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.

2109
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,320
Yeah, I just watched, like, a mission, there was like a tank mission or whatever that they're

2110
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,720
showing with Battlefield 3.

2111
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,880
It's just amazing.

2112
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,040
I mean, Call of Duty, it's pretty action-packed.

2113
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,000
Ultra-realistic-looking wargame!

2114
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Wow!

2115
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Another one!

2116
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,040
But it looks way better, though.

2117
01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:01,600
They all look great, but I mean, it's just like, awesome!

2118
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:03,000
We gotta let Bobby go find some...

2119
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I have...

2120
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,480
No, no, hang on, I gotta respond to something in here in chat.

2121
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:12,000
Kaijuto says, the reason why there isn't a GTA 5 is because Agent is coming up with the

2122
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
GTA 5.

2123
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,680
Now, I can't remember who exactly I heard this from, but it was from somebody I trust.

2124
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:24,600
Apparently, they heard somebody ask, I think it was Jack Trenton, is Agent still a PS3

2125
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,600
exclusive?

2126
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,880
And his response was, you'll have to ask Rockstar about that.

2127
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:32,560
Hmm, interesting.

2128
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:37,640
Bobby, we gotta let you go find some good beer in LA.

2129
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:42,360
But before we do, I can't imagine anyone that listens to Orange Lounge Radio doesn't already

2130
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:46,140
know about your show, but just in case there's like the one person that doesn't, tell us

2131
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:48,760
a little bit about your show.

2132
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,760
I'm the opening band.

2133
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,760
Stop.

2134
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,760
And I am on at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, right before Orange Lounge Radio.

2135
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:01,000
It's me talking for about 30 minutes, and then I take calls and everybody tells me I'm

2136
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,200
wrong for the next 20 minutes, and then I goof off with Rob and Dark Talker for 10 minutes,

2137
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,200
and that's my show.

2138
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,200
That is my entertainment.

2139
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:13,200
And it's at All Games Radio, it's where it's live, or bobbyblackwolf.com is the website

2140
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:18,480
where I've almost, you know, I'm not as old as they all are, but I'm coming upon the ears

2141
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,480
next month.

2142
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:20,920
That's still very impressive.

2143
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,920
Very impressive.

2144
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:22,920
You're still a big boy.

2145
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,200
You can sit at the big kids' table.

2146
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,200
All right, well, Bobby, we'll be talking to you again tomorrow and have a lot of fun at

2147
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:33,360
E3 tomorrow and just play as many games as you can, all right?

2148
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,360
I will.

2149
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,080
I mean, Thursday also is wide open.

2150
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,480
I don't have any appointments on that day, so, you know, if I don't get through it tomorrow,

2151
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,680
I want to get through it Thursday, and I want to say, because some people don't believe

2152
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:48,480
me when I say this, is they started asking me, go ask Microsoft if they're going to charge

2153
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,480
for Skype.

2154
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,680
I'm like, no, I can't, because I don't have that kind of access.

2155
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:52,680
Right, right.

2156
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:53,680
Exactly.

2157
01:42:53,680 --> 01:43:00,240
Try to keep your questions to games that maybe aren't triple-A titles or from triple-A developers.

2158
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,840
I want to find, you know, like this here, Scribblenauts.

2159
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,720
Scribblenauts I had never heard of until I saw it in the back corner of WB's booth a

2160
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,760
couple years ago, and it blew me away.

2161
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,080
Katamari Damacy I really hadn't heard of until Namco showed it off a couple of years ago

2162
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:20,960
at E3, or many years ago at E3 now, so I'm looking for those games, and if you hear something

2163
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,960
that maybe you want to hear more about that GameSpot and iGn at the big sites aren't going

2164
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,880
to cover, those are the games I want to find.

2165
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,800
I'm not going to be able to tap Peter Molyneux about Fable the 30.

2166
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,560
I'm not going to be able to ask Sony about, you know, if they're going to be doing this

2167
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,120
or that with the Vita, because they're not going to talk to me.

2168
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:42,960
What the smaller does, they will answer my question, and those are the people I want

2169
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:43,960
to talk to.

2170
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:47,480
Alright internet, you have your homework assignment, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf, and I just

2171
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:51,440
want to clarify, even though Bobby will still be at the show Thursday, we will not be having

2172
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,120
an E3 special Thursday.

2173
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:58,280
Anything Bobby does on Thursday, he will be doing on his own show this upcoming Sunday

2174
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:02,560
when he broadcasts live, and we will not be here live on Sunday.

2175
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,160
It's all weird, this programming thing.

2176
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:08,240
I'm just going to have to like draw a grid, but follow our websites and stay tuned for

2177
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:10,000
all the information in our twitters.

2178
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,360
That's how you can stay on top of the world.

2179
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:16,720
And on my show Sunday night, I will actually talk about the actual demos of the Wii Wii

2180
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:21,240
Wii Wii that I played, and how each of them felt and played and all that stuff.

2181
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,800
Alright, sounds good.

2182
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,760
Alright, well Bobby, we're going to let you go so we can get to some other calls, and

2183
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,800
I got to call Shane too, who's also there waiting to talk to us.

2184
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,560
So take care, buddy.

2185
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,120
Yeah, no, hey, I get to go watch nerds riding a mechanical bull now, it's going to be great.

2186
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,360
Awesome, have fun.

2187
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,360
Thank you.

2188
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:41,360
Bye.

2189
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,480
The one and only Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.

2190
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:46,820
Thanks so much to him for joining us for over an hour on that call.

2191
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,920
One hour, nine minutes, he's been joining us here.

2192
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:49,920
That's a long phone call.

2193
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,920
That's a long phone call.

2194
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,920
That's a lot of minutes.

2195
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:52,920
Poor Bobby.

2196
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:57,880
Alright, before we get to Shane and Miklotov, bringing him on the show, talking, he was

2197
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:03,040
also at Nintendo's press event, so we're going to hear about Wii U all over again, yay Logie.

2198
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,640
Have you guys been experiencing E3 from home?

2199
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:06,640
What have you guys been doing?

2200
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:11,880
You know, we're not there this year, which is kind of different, especially me being

2201
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,880
there last year.

2202
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,760
I'm kind of sad I'm not there this year, but it's been interesting kind of doing E3 from

2203
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:17,760
home.

2204
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,440
I like that some of the stuff I can go right on and download right away, like ConnectFunLabs,

2205
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:26,120
I was all over that for like 10 minutes, and Logie, you were a big fan of my Sailor Moon

2206
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,120
videos, right?

2207
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,120
That's pretty funny.

2208
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:35,680
Well, I've been going on Twitter and seeing random, this is bullshit, Wii U what?

2209
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,120
So my Twitter's been a source of hilarity.

2210
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,760
Dan, what about you?

2211
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:47,000
I've been streaming all the press conferences, and I've been going to the game sites, and

2212
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,560
just experiencing it as much as you can from the comfort of your computer chair.

2213
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:54,040
That's right.

2214
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,920
And where the food is reasonable.

2215
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,920
We should be there.

2216
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:57,920
I know.

2217
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,920
We failed.

2218
01:45:58,920 --> 01:45:59,920
Next year.

2219
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:00,920
Next year.

2220
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,040
Alright, let me ask this question too, Logie, I know you've had some hands on with this,

2221
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:07,680
some of the stuff that's been released during E3, we've had a few, not just ConnectLabs

2222
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:12,040
was, it's out today, but there was also ExciteBike3D came out.

2223
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,400
Did you get a chance to grab the ExciteBike3D on 3DS?

2224
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:22,720
I did, I checked it out, I'm glad that it wasn't just them kind of offsetting each individual

2225
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:29,480
sprite layer, but, I mean, it still wasn't that great, it was like watching ExciteBike

2226
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:34,320
on a really tiny screen, because when you do it in 3D, it's just, it's really tiny.

2227
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,760
Do you have that here with you?

2228
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,760
I don't.

2229
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:37,760
Dammit.

2230
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,760
Do you have it, Rob?

2231
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:40,640
Yes, I do, actually.

2232
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:41,640
Give to Daddy.

2233
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:45,880
We'll see what you think of this, let me, I have Zelda Link's Awakening up right now,

2234
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:51,240
which by the way, I love that you can actually frame it inside a little Game Boy, and it

2235
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:55,960
does this 3D effect, where it's just like the image is indented just a little bit, like

2236
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:58,880
you're playing on an actual Game Boy, because remember how the screen was behind the glass

2237
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,880
a little bit?

2238
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,880
Yeah.

2239
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:01,880
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

2240
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,280
If anything's gonna sell me a 3DS, it's crap like that, but they need to drop the price

2241
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:05,280
like 50 bucks.

2242
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,280
Let's get one right now.

2243
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:07,520
It's just too expensive.

2244
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,400
They probably will before too long, so here you go, I'm gonna give that to Dan, he can

2245
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,060
check that out right now.

2246
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:19,160
I do like how when you zoom, use the 3D slider on it, how it zooms it back into like the

2247
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:26,520
original game, which is kind of neat, but I mean, beyond that gimmick, I just can't

2248
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,400
get too excited about it, you know what I mean?

2249
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:34,520
It's just, I don't know, it's as exciting as Excitebike is, I guess.

2250
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:42,080
Alright, well we are going to give Miek Latov a call and ask some more questions about Nintendo.

2251
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,080
We're gonna hear another perspective, and I don't know if, I don't think he got hands

2252
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:53,680
on with Wii U today, but he was there at the Nintendo presser, and Dan's like, this is

2253
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,200
widescreen, what's going on?

2254
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,440
Alright, we're gonna give Miek Latov a call, I just punched in the digits, one ringy dingy,

2255
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:06,960
two ringy dings, live radio, special presentation here on Ustream, we'll be back next Sunday.

2256
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,920
Hi, Miek Latov, how you doing?

2257
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:09,920
Good.

2258
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:16,040
Hey, it's Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, of course, with DarkSakura, Loki, and Dan all here, and

2259
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:19,240
we've been talking, of course, about E3, you're there in Los Angeles.

2260
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:24,240
We've already kind of covered the press conferences, let me give you, let me get some quick reaction

2261
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,240
from you.

2262
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,600
You didn't go to them, but you know, you're a gamer too, obviously.

2263
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,200
Microsoft and Sony, what did you think of their press conferences?

2264
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,880
Microsoft bored me to tears.

2265
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:36,880
Why is that?

2266
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:42,400
Because they didn't have anything interesting, they were all, here's the Kinect that we've

2267
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:47,760
been pushing for a year, and we're trying to keep it relevant, but here's some titles

2268
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:48,760
for it.

2269
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:56,600
And by the way, here's Gears of War with probably a drunk or high iced tea, who would be funny.

2270
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:00,120
That's why he was angry, he wasn't drunk yet, and it was 11 AM.

2271
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:03,400
There you go.

2272
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:08,480
And really, they had me with Van Central, and that was it, nothing else was interesting

2273
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,480
to me.

2274
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,480
And then Sony?

2275
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,760
Sony, I actually really liked.

2276
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,040
I liked their monitor.

2277
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:22,480
I didn't see it yet in action, but I liked the idea of two people looking at it and seeing

2278
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,440
different things, and it's cheap.

2279
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:34,880
I liked the idea of the Vita, I liked Uncharted 3, talking about Pico and Shadow of the Cloth,

2280
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,600
this just often makes me happy.

2281
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,160
So overall, they did really well in my eyes.

2282
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:44,640
Now let's move to Nintendo, because you were there, you were at the press conference today, correct?

2283
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,640
Yeah.

2284
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,120
And how was it for you?

2285
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:50,560
Now we've already kind of recapped, obviously, what was shown, but how was it for you kind

2286
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,280
of being there?

2287
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,920
I really liked it.

2288
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,320
I'd like to go again.

2289
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:02,960
It was also, while I liked it, I thought it was cool, like the orchestra, and that was

2290
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,920
neat, and a golden remote was cool.

2291
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:11,440
I was also kind of dull, and it went by really fast.

2292
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,800
So it was almost like a blink and you missed it.

2293
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:13,800
How were your seats?

2294
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,800
Were you way up in the nosebleeds?

2295
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,800
Oh, they were really good.

2296
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:19,800
No, no, I was seven rows from the front.

2297
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:20,800
Nice.

2298
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,800
Good for you.

2299
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,800
So you could probably see that little Wii U mote, or whatever they're going to call

2300
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:30,320
it, in their hands when they were showing that off, huh?

2301
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,040
I don't remember them showing it off in person.

2302
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,040
Oh yeah, that's right.

2303
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,040
Bobby even said that.

2304
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,040
They didn't bring it out.

2305
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,200
It was only on the videos.

2306
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,200
That's right.

2307
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,200
Well, whatever.

2308
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,200
Well, what did you think?

2309
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,200
What was your impressions of Wii U?

2310
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:44,200
I know you haven't done hands-on, or did you do hands-on today, or no?

2311
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:50,520
No, I went there first thing this morning, and of course all the visitors were in line

2312
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:51,520
first.

2313
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,160
That's what they do.

2314
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:59,960
And it looked like it was a three-and-a-half-hour wait from where I was at, so I said, do it,

2315
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,240
and I'm just going to do it tomorrow.

2316
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:04,200
I believe Bobby waited four hours, but it moved a little.

2317
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,560
He got in line after they said it was closed, and they told him flat out he might not see

2318
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:10,600
it, but he did get to see it finally by four.

2319
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,960
But I think he was in that line for four hours today.

2320
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:18,040
Yeah, that's why I just wanted to go and look at other things today, because I knew that

2321
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,840
tomorrow and the next day would be mostly Vita and Wii U.

2322
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,440
Well, I want to get to those other things.

2323
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,240
Oh, is there big lines for Vita, too?

2324
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:26,240
Is that all behind the scenes?

2325
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,240
Oh, yeah.

2326
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,240
Oh, wow.

2327
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,240
Okay.

2328
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,240
Okay, interesting.

2329
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,920
It's kind of like how Sony did the move last year.

2330
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:37,080
Quickly though about Nintendo, you did get some hands-on with some of the 3DS stuff,

2331
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,080
right?

2332
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,080
Oh, yeah.

2333
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:43,840
So what they talked about today for the 3DS, I got to play.

2334
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:44,840
Oh, wow.

2335
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:46,800
So that was pretty cool.

2336
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,960
I like that they had their titles at the press conference, and I'm like, oh, yeah, and everything

2337
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:54,040
we're talking about, they'll play it now.

2338
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,400
Wait, so Kid Icarus was playable, too?

2339
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,400
Yeah.

2340
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,080
Oh, my God, I love Kid Icarus.

2341
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,080
Wow.

2342
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,760
Tell us a little bit about how that demo played.

2343
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:02,760
Okay.

2344
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,400
So there were two, well, three demos.

2345
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:08,080
I think two of the three so far.

2346
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:15,480
The first demo is a aerial mission and a ground mission combined into one.

2347
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:21,000
So with the aerial mission, it's pretty much, if you played Sin and Finish Me, you've got

2348
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:28,760
your little target that you control with the stylus, and then the spherical pad is how

2349
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:35,880
you strafe and move up and down, and your firing is all based out of the left button

2350
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:39,400
at the top bell button.

2351
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:46,800
And before you actually do the mission, you actually had, I think, around nine options

2352
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,200
for what you wanted because of your weapon.

2353
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,200
Hmm.

2354
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:51,200
So that was pretty neat.

2355
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:55,860
I went with Pan Blast because I thought that was cool.

2356
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:03,600
So when you're playing, if you target an enemy with a target, I don't know how to pronounce

2357
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:09,760
it, it'll lock onto them, kind of.

2358
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:15,000
If you hold down the L button, it'll shoot a rapid succession of shots.

2359
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,700
If you just target them, though, and just single press it, you will deliver like a fully

2360
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:24,480
charged blast that can actually take out several enemies in that area.

2361
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,480
Hmm.

2362
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:31,400
So, was that, I'm sorry, did you say the other one was the multiplayer demo?

2363
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:33,920
Oh, there were two other ones.

2364
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,920
There was a multiplayer demo, I did not get to do that.

2365
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,520
I don't know why, I don't think I wanted to hang around at that point.

2366
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:48,240
But the other one they had was AR cards, which actually, if you did the demonstration with

2367
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:49,240
them, you got a pack.

2368
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:55,080
So I have a pack of Kid Icarus AR cards, once the game comes out, they'll be able to use.

2369
01:53:55,080 --> 01:54:02,400
But all it really is, is just putting characters on, you know, through the AR, on the card,

2370
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:04,000
and then they can battle each other.

2371
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,240
It was that thing that some were joking like, hey, didn't we see this already when it was

2372
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,720
called the Eye of Judgment?

2373
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:13,880
Yes, that's all it is, but that's pretty much all their AR cards are.

2374
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:20,040
Interesting that Nintendo just slaps Kid Icarus on it, and now people are going crazy about

2375
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,040
it.

2376
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,040
Isn't that funny how that works, Loki?

2377
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:23,040
Yeah.

2378
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,320
Is there a bet still on if a million copies of that game sell?

2379
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,320
No, there is no bet.

2380
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:28,320
It's done.

2381
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,320
Just get over it.

2382
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:31,320
Alright, alright.

2383
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,320
What else did you play on DS?

2384
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:34,320
3DS.

2385
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,040
I played Luigi's Mansion 2.

2386
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:42,960
It played like Luigi's Mansion, there was some big shocker there.

2387
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:48,480
The one thing that I did not like is that, I know it's early in development, but the

2388
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:53,440
frame rate chugs, even when you weren't doing much of anything.

2389
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:57,160
Okay well hopefully they get that ironed out, I mean yeah, that's an early development thing

2390
01:54:57,160 --> 01:55:01,240
I'm sure, but they'll have to fix that.

2391
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:04,520
Mario was cool.

2392
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:10,760
It played like Mario Galaxy on the stages that didn't have the 3D worlds where you're

2393
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:17,960
running around the entire planet upside down and stuff like that.

2394
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:22,160
Nothing much really different there, you've got your raccoon suit back, but it looks like

2395
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:26,640
the Tanooki suit, but it has the raccoon suit powers, so it's kind of weird.

2396
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:27,640
Interesting.

2397
01:55:27,640 --> 01:55:29,640
Let's see, Mario Kart.

2398
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,640
Mario Kart was fantastic.

2399
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:36,680
60 frames a second from what I was told.

2400
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,680
Even in 3D?

2401
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,640
It works hard.

2402
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,760
Even in 3D?

2403
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:41,760
Even in 3D it does 60 frames a second?

2404
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:42,760
Yeah.

2405
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,760
Wow.

2406
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,760
Oh yeah, yeah.

2407
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:45,760
Who would play it in 2D?

2408
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,480
Losers would play it in 2D.

2409
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:51,600
Well I'm thinking of Dead or Alive Dimensions where they were saying, oh it'll do 60 frames

2410
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:55,920
in 2D in 3D in 3D, like it was kind of split, so I was wondering if they were going to do

2411
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:56,920
it.

2412
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:57,920
Yeah, same with Street Fighter.

2413
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:58,920
Huh, okay.

2414
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:05,120
Yeah, but no, this was 60 frames greedy, it worked hard, which was amazing because Mario

2415
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:14,040
Kart has not been hard in years, the paint lighting mechanic, when you had the jumps,

2416
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:20,480
that was interesting because you either had to slow down in the air to collect coins,

2417
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:25,560
or you knocked the ground as fast as you could to continue racing, so it was a weird trade-off.

2418
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:26,560
Interesting.

2419
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:34,600
The sub propeller, when you're underwater, whatever, that was stupid, it did nothing

2420
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:35,600
for me.

2421
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:36,600
And Star Fox?

2422
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:43,080
Star Fox, I don't know if I had a single player, I played multiplayer though, and it felt a

2423
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:49,080
lot like the multiplayer that was from the DS game, which I kind of liked, just really

2424
01:56:49,080 --> 01:56:50,080
nice looking.

2425
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:56,320
What was cool though is that out of our four people battle, I totally killed everybody

2426
01:56:56,320 --> 01:57:02,400
in one, and the little, not really a Nintendo rep that was hired for this event, she was

2427
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:06,320
complaining because I killed her first.

2428
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,000
Were you aiming for her because you can see her little picture or whatever?

2429
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Yes.

2430
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Is it just a static picture?

2431
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,600
There's a girl, clearly you have to make her feel inferior.

2432
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,600
It's a changing picture?

2433
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:20,120
Does it get reactions like when you get blown up, like I'm thinking of that Burnout game?

2434
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:21,120
Oh, how funny.

2435
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:28,340
No, yeah, well, it's not a changing picture, it's a stream of you, so you can see what

2436
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:32,400
they're looking at, like if they're going to look up in the upper corner or something

2437
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:38,420
or if they make a weird face randomly, it's seriously refreshing but fairly slow.

2438
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:41,600
No picking your nose and playing Star Fox then?

2439
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:45,520
You could, but it'd be hard because of the way you have to hold the system, you know,

2440
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,520
the system.

2441
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:50,360
All right, so that's cool, so it sounds like you got your hands on at least a lot of the

2442
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,360
3DS titles today.

2443
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:55,080
What was your favorite out of the bunch?

2444
01:57:55,080 --> 01:58:02,640
Probably a tie between Mario Kart and Kid Icarus, because I forgot to say Kid Icarus,

2445
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,820
beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

2446
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:11,520
The water in that game, as Nintendo's known to do, just was amazing, it blew me away.

2447
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:16,360
One more 3DS question, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Nintendo unloaded onto the eShop

2448
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:20,420
today trailers for Animal Crossing and Paper Mario as well.

2449
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:23,240
Were those games anywhere to be seen?

2450
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:28,240
Not that I saw, because I really wanted to play at least Animal Crossing.

2451
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:34,000
I did download the trailer though when I got back to the hotel room for Animal Crossing,

2452
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,800
and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it or not, but it's got some really interesting

2453
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:38,800
features.

2454
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:39,800
Oh, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

2455
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:40,800
What's that?

2456
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:41,800
It looks what?

2457
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,080
I said it's got some really cool new features.

2458
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,080
I'm not sure if you guys...

2459
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,360
Yeah, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

2460
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,360
Sitting on benches and swimming?

2461
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:52,360
Awesome.

2462
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:53,360
Yeah.

2463
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:56,160
That's crazy.

2464
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:57,960
Was your mind blown by swimming?

2465
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,960
I was like, oh my god, I can sit down!

2466
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,360
Wait, Mikolatov, did Animal Crossing have colored balloons?

2467
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:07,960
No, no, it wasn't that cool.

2468
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:08,960
All right.

2469
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,400
Okay, then what else did you do at the show today?

2470
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:15,480
So, you didn't stand in line for the Vita all day like Bobby had to.

2471
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,720
What did you get your hands on today?

2472
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:25,160
Well, I also wanted to be thrown that I played Zelda as well on the 3DS, and it was fan-freaking-tastic.

2473
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:30,360
That was a close call for my tie for best 3DS game I played.

2474
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:31,360
What does that...

2475
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:38,080
I mean, is it just the 3D to what many consider a classic video game that did it for you?

2476
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:41,200
Or did it feel new?

2477
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,280
What was it that made it so great?

2478
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,760
Or could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?

2479
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:47,680
Sorry, what did you say?

2480
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:50,080
Could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?

2481
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:53,000
What made it so great?

2482
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:58,100
I'm not sure I could tell I was playing a 13-year-old game.

2483
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:04,600
I will say that the graphics are definitely much nicer.

2484
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,600
The frame rate is crazy nice.

2485
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,600
The 3D effects, I didn't really care for.

2486
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,920
It didn't really do anything for me.

2487
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:20,920
I did like people switching to the slingshot or the hookshot would allow you to move the

2488
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:24,700
system around instead of using the directional pad to find your target.

2489
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:25,700
That was neat.

2490
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:26,700
All right.

2491
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,400
Well, what else did you get to play at the show today?

2492
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:30,400
Let's see.

2493
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:36,360
I personally walked around, which is kind of a waste of a day.

2494
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:41,280
I played the new Silent Hill game, both in 3D and in 2D.

2495
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:42,280
Interesting.

2496
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:44,280
What'd you think?

2497
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:47,200
Crap is what I think.

2498
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:53,240
It was terrible in 3D and it was terrible in 2D, so this is definitely a pass for me.

2499
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:55,200
I'm not even interested.

2500
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,200
Why was it terrible?

2501
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:57,200
What did it play like?

2502
02:00:57,200 --> 02:00:59,400
Was it more like the Wii Silent Hill, which I don't see anymore?

2503
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,720
Was it more like Alan Wake?

2504
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:01,720
Was it Alan Wake?

2505
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:02,720
What was it?

2506
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:08,380
I wish it was like Alan Wake or even Shattered Memories.

2507
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:20,960
It was like a generic survival horror that ran really choppy and was boring and not scary.

2508
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:25,960
At least in every other demo that I've played at E3 for a Silent Hill game, something has

2509
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:28,320
been kind of freaky about it.

2510
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,320
Not this one.

2511
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,520
It was just boring.

2512
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,320
It's not Silent Hill if it's not freaky.

2513
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,720
Exactly.

2514
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:38,680
And it was just dull.

2515
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:42,400
Like oh, there was an ending that jumped out and I think was supposed to scare me, but

2516
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:46,880
this more annoyed me because they aren't scary.

2517
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:49,920
Speaking of scary, did you see the Tomb Raider stuff?

2518
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:51,800
I don't know if it's playable on the show floor or whatever.

2519
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:55,400
I found that that trailer seemed to be pretty, I mean, I don't know, we've had some differing

2520
02:01:55,400 --> 02:02:01,120
opinions in here, but I compared it to The Descent, which I found to be a scary-ass movie.

2521
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:04,880
The only thing I ever saw for Tomb Raider wasn't on the floor, it was during the Microsoft

2522
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,240
Next conference.

2523
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:12,800
So I was over in Corey Enix's booth for a bit today and I didn't see it anywhere, but

2524
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,120
I was also playing the entire demo for Final Fantasy XIII-2.

2525
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:19,560
Ooh, what'd you think of that?

2526
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:25,360
I actually really like XIII despite what other people think, so I like this one a lot.

2527
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:34,640
They added a few interesting features like a, what's that called, the real-time segments

2528
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:41,640
like God of War and Heavy Rain tabs, which was, you know, it's a little out of place,

2529
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,140
but it was still neat.

2530
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:49,840
They definitely tried to give players a little more freedom and faith with some options that

2531
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:55,880
were like, you gotta take to attack this guy or go try to weaken him first by using this

2532
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:56,880
device.

2533
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,520
I hear if you went to attack him, you died, and you'd have to reset the whole bit of the

2534
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:02,520
demo over again.

2535
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:05,920
So I thought that was neat.

2536
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:06,920
But no dress sphear.

2537
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:07,920
No dress sphears.

2538
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,920
Do they have a release for that?

2539
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:14,160
I definitely don't know who the main character is that I was playing as.

2540
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:17,680
Do they have a, I think it's supposed to be Lightning Sister, do they have a release for

2541
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:18,680
XIII-2 yet?

2542
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,240
Loki, have we heard one?

2543
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:21,240
No.

2544
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,240
No?

2545
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,240
No.

2546
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,240
No.

2547
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:25,240
Wow.

2548
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:26,240
Interesting.

2549
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:27,240
Interesting comment in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com.

2550
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:28,240
Jenai says, Silent Hills Konami Sonic now.

2551
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:33,800
And Randi Yu says, wouldn't go that far, Sonic is laughably exhausted.

2552
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:38,080
Frisbee Yu jumps in, speaking of Sonic, was Sega at E3?

2553
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,200
Of course Sega was at E3.

2554
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:47,160
I went over there quite a bit, looking at my darndest for PSA-2, but it wasn't there.

2555
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:48,160
Oh, I was just gonna ask.

2556
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,160
It might be somewhere.

2557
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:54,880
Surely you had to see if there was a Phantasy Star or online too, oh bummer they didn't

2558
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:55,880
bring that.

2559
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:00,800
Yeah, but there was a lot of Sonic stuff for their new Sonic game, and it actually didn't

2560
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,800
look that bad.

2561
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,800
I didn't get to play it though yet.

2562
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:04,800
Hmm.

2563
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:07,720
Alright, you'll have to let us know when you do finally get your hands on it.

2564
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,720
What else?

2565
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:14,040
There was this really neat Kinect game by Konami.

2566
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:18,520
It was called Lead Me's, I believe.

2567
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:23,840
It's both Kinect, and I believe it's a download title they said, but it plays a little bit

2568
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:24,840
like Lemmings.

2569
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:31,440
So you stand in front of the Kinect sensor and you become this like wire frame character

2570
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:32,560
pretty much.

2571
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:36,320
And you have these little adorable things that fall down and you have to get them to

2572
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:41,080
safety by using your limbs as bridges, stuff like that.

2573
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,080
Interesting.

2574
02:04:42,080 --> 02:04:49,040
Okay, so like you use your body to build the path to get these guys safe, basically?

2575
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,040
Yes.

2576
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:51,040
Interesting.

2577
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:56,000
Any other, I know you're a big fan of music games too, any music games that you saw besides

2578
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,320
Dance Central 2?

2579
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:05,600
No, I saw DDR, but it's laughable nowadays, so it's not even worth talking about.

2580
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:11,120
Aww, but I kinda wanted to know how laughable it was.

2581
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:15,400
It had four licenses, I believe, and the rest were not in the originals.

2582
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:23,400
And what I watched looked like the character models looked like DDR PC quality, but not

2583
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,400
as awesome.

2584
02:05:24,400 --> 02:05:28,400
Because there was no Mr. Spanky or anything like that, they were just like really poorly

2585
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,960
done character models.

2586
02:05:29,960 --> 02:05:31,960
Nobody loves Mr. Spanky.

2587
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:34,080
What was that?

2588
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,080
Forget it.

2589
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:36,080
Oh, okay.

2590
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:42,000
I did not hear you, because I'm hearing me talk every time I talk, so...

2591
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
D'Artesia says, no Dance Masters 2?

2592
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,720
No Dance Masters 2.

2593
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:53,640
I do know the only thing that's behind closed doors at Konami, because I still have my hookup,

2594
02:05:53,640 --> 02:05:58,360
is Pro Evolution Soccer, so everything else that's on the floor is all they're showing.

2595
02:05:58,360 --> 02:05:59,360
Interesting.

2596
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,080
And it's pretty sad also.

2597
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:08,160
Like, this E3 has been kind of let down in terms of what's being shown, despite having

2598
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,840
two new consoles.

2599
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:15,440
What about Dance Central 2, didn't you say you had some hands-on time with that?

2600
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:22,480
Yeah, I played Dance Central 2, it was fantastic, but it was just Dance Central with new characters

2601
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,880
and new moves.

2602
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:25,480
Is Harmonic showing anything else at their booth?

2603
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:28,200
Aren't they supposed to be unveiling a new game?

2604
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:30,240
Oh, I didn't see that at a Harmonic booth.

2605
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,400
I hadn't seen a Harmonic booth at all.

2606
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:33,400
That was at Microsoft.

2607
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,400
Interesting.

2608
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:37,640
So it must be kind of a behind closed doors thing, or in a conference room.

2609
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:38,640
Interesting.

2610
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

2611
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,640
All right.

2612
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:45,600
Well, anything else that you had some hands-on time with you want to share with us tonight?

2613
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:47,600
I'm wrecking my brain.

2614
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:57,360
No, I want to play Nintendo a whole lot, but I saw a lot of neat games that were briefly

2615
02:06:57,360 --> 02:07:01,320
mentioned at the end of the press, or just via a title.

2616
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:08,040
So I saw Risen Heaven, I saw the new Kirby game, of course I saw Legend of Zelda Skyward

2617
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:12,200
Sword, which looks amazing now, I'm really excited for it.

2618
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:15,560
What's your plan for tomorrow?

2619
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:21,360
I'm hoping a coin later to decide if I'm standing in line for Vita or Wii U.

2620
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:27,280
Personally, I'm leaning more towards Vita, because I don't really think I care much about

2621
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:28,880
the Wii U at this point.

2622
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:29,880
Ouch.

2623
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,440
All right, yeah, we need someone to go play the Vita, and I don't know if Bobby will get

2624
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:34,240
around to it tomorrow, so I think you should do that.

2625
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:35,240
Do the Vita?

2626
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,240
Yep.

2627
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:37,240
Okay.

2628
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,240
I'll try that one.

2629
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,240
All right.

2630
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,720
Well, anything else you want to share before we let you go so we can get to some other

2631
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:46,080
callers from our chat room at 1877 Dean Waller?

2632
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,080
The first thing...

2633
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:49,600
Okay, this will be cool to some of those people out there.

2634
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:52,320
Let's start with the lamer one for a second.

2635
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,320
Okay.

2636
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:58,120
I was going down Hollywood Boulevard yesterday, because that's where my place I'm staying

2637
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:06,360
at is, and if people follow reality TV at all, or gay porn, I fully ran into Dustin

2638
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:09,120
Tito from either Real World or Flat Pad.

2639
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,240
That was pretty funny.

2640
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:14,040
The one with the sordid past, apparently, yes.

2641
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,040
Yes.

2642
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:18,360
I wanted to just go up to him and be like, hey, I've seen you naked.

2643
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,360
That might have been awkward.

2644
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,360
I don't know.

2645
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:22,360
Yeah, just slightly.

2646
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:27,440
But the actual cool thing that people may care about is right when I walked out of the

2647
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:33,560
Nokia theater here today after Nintendo was done, I ran Snapchat instead of Kiriyamaoka.

2648
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:34,560
That was really cool.

2649
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,560
Oh, nice.

2650
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:37,200
Did you get a picture or anything, or say hello, or just...

2651
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:41,720
Yeah, I got a picture, I said hello, we shook hands.

2652
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:46,960
I tweeted him actually after the fact, and he tweeted back, and by him tweeting back

2653
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:52,120
at me, somehow G4 is now following my Twitter, which is a waste of their time.

2654
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:57,480
It might be one of those spam Twitters, so look out, because I see a lot of those.

2655
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:58,840
No, it's a real one.

2656
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:00,840
I looked into it.

2657
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:01,840
Weird.

2658
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:02,840
Well, whatever.

2659
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:03,840
All right.

2660
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,800
Well, Mikkelshof, enjoy the rest of the show.

2661
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:09,440
Get some hands on with Vita tomorrow and whatever else, and we'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

2662
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:10,440
Okay.

2663
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:11,440
Sounds good.

2664
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:12,440
All right.

2665
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,440
And try to stalk more celebrities for us.

2666
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,440
Yes.

2667
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,440
All right.

2668
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,440
I will do that.

2669
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,440
Take care, buddy.

2670
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:18,440
All right.

2671
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,440
Bye.

2672
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:22,040
We're running a little long tonight, but we will open it up for a few quick, quick calls

2673
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:24,160
if anyone wants to call and just talk impressions.

2674
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:25,160
What do you think?

2675
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:26,160
Where are you at?

2676
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:31,600
Are we completely off base with what we're saying about Wii U or Kinect or the Vita?

2677
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:36,820
Give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2678
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:37,820
That's all one word.

2679
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:42,320
If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you use ECHO123 first

2680
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:43,320
before you give us a call.

2681
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:44,320
Again, what were your impressions?

2682
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:48,240
I'm sure many of you, you know, I didn't want to just recap the news tonight with you guys

2683
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:50,720
because I'm sure most of you were watching it.

2684
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:55,160
Although I'm liking hearing about these hidden things like that Konami game that sounds like

2685
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,160
Lemmings.

2686
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:59,480
I want to hear about more of those types of games.

2687
02:09:59,480 --> 02:10:01,040
So we'll see.

2688
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,040
All right.

2689
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:05,620
Again, 1877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2690
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:07,520
Quick programming note, we are live tonight.

2691
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,700
We are live tomorrow night.

2692
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:14,480
We are off Sunday because Bobby Blackwolf and some of us here at OLR are going to go

2693
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:17,040
celebrate E3 broadcast by going to Disneyland.

2694
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:18,040
I'm sorry.

2695
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:19,680
We're doing research for Disney Connect.

2696
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,920
We got to make sure that Disney Connect game is accurate.

2697
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:22,920
Absolutely.

2698
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:25,640
And we will leave no stone unturned.

2699
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:28,300
And there have to be hidden cats in the game for it to be accurate.

2700
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:32,200
But we will be back next Sunday on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2701
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:34,760
That will be June the 19th.

2702
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,600
Bobby Blackwolf will be here June the 12th, not here, but at allgames.com where he's usually

2703
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,640
at June the 12th and of course on his podcast feed.

2704
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:46,400
That's where you're going to hear his Thursday impressions since we will not be live Thursday

2705
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,400
night.

2706
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:48,960
So I hope everybody got the programming worked out there.

2707
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:54,200
Again 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2708
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:59,680
I have to point out, Sega did not announce a system.

2709
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:03,080
So that's a no minus point.

2710
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,080
You didn't get buzzed on that.

2711
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:05,080
Exactly.

2712
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:09,640
I think I'm the only one that has a buzz so far because Sony did indeed apologize for

2713
02:11:09,640 --> 02:11:11,600
what had happened.

2714
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:12,600
And they showed Fable.

2715
02:11:12,600 --> 02:11:15,360
I think they weren't going to show Fable either.

2716
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:16,360
I don't remember.

2717
02:11:16,360 --> 02:11:17,360
All right.

2718
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,360
Well, apology.

2719
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:20,760
It's kind of a gray area.

2720
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:22,480
He said they weren't even going to mention it.

2721
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:23,480
Not true.

2722
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,480
Maybe.

2723
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:25,480
Which they let off with by saying mentioning.

2724
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:26,480
All right.

2725
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,480
Let me get to the phones.

2726
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:28,480
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2727
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:29,480
Who's this?

2728
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,480
Hey, it's Sturlock.

2729
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,480
Hey, Sturlock.

2730
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:32,480
How you doing, buddy?

2731
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:33,480
Pretty good.

2732
02:11:33,480 --> 02:11:34,480
How's E3 going for you?

2733
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:35,480
What are your thoughts?

2734
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:39,080
It looks pretty awesome.

2735
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:41,640
I really want a Vita.

2736
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:42,960
Why?

2737
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,080
Street Fighter vs Tekken.

2738
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:48,480
But can't you get that on the PS3 or the 360?

2739
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:49,480
Yeah, but come on, man.

2740
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:50,480
It's a portable version.

2741
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,480
That's just awesome.

2742
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:55,760
What did you think about this whole announcement that Cole's in it as well?

2743
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,800
I was like, what?

2744
02:11:57,800 --> 02:11:58,800
Okay.

2745
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,800
Whatever.

2746
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:00,800
It's kind of random, right?

2747
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,760
But, I mean, you got, I mean, it's pretty common for an Abaco, though.

2748
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:09,960
I mean, you've got Tekken characters and, like, urban rain, so.

2749
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:12,120
I guess that's true.

2750
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:19,480
They do that kind of stuff all the time, but Nintendo, I don't know, I still can't get

2751
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,080
my head around this name.

2752
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:22,960
Yeah, I know.

2753
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:26,640
The name's a little weird, but remember, I mean, and I don't like the name either, to

2754
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:27,640
be honest.

2755
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:30,080
I think they should have just called it the Nintendo U, and we could have just all said,

2756
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:33,920
oh, the U stands for Ultra or something like that, you know?

2757
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,660
Or if they wanted to go back to, like, the old school, they could have called it the

2758
02:12:38,660 --> 02:12:41,420
U-Force, like that old peripheral.

2759
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,920
That's a super Wii.

2760
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:44,920
I like the Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii.

2761
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:50,120
Yeah, I've been doing that all day, too, I was just like, oh my god.

2762
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:54,240
So, damn it, where was I going with this?

2763
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:56,880
Everybody's got an opinion on the Wii U.

2764
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:03,080
What do you think of the console itself besides just the name?

2765
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:06,880
Which I do think everyone will get used to eventually, by the way.

2766
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,380
Ooh, do we have a network outage?

2767
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:09,380
I think we did.

2768
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:10,380
I think we had a drop.

2769
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:11,380
Shit.

2770
02:13:11,380 --> 02:13:15,000
Did we have a drop stream?

2771
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,520
I don't know if we're even still broadcasting at this point.

2772
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:18,520
I think we are.

2773
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:23,880
But we had an internet, okay, we had an internet downtime.

2774
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:27,000
I think we're, oh wow, we just reconnected right away with Strelok.

2775
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Okay, yeah, we had a weird drop thing happen there, so that's weird.

2776
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
But we're back.

2777
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Silly internets.

2778
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Yeah, silly internets.

2779
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Yes.

2780
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
All right, well, whatever.

2781
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,720
So, what's on your mind with the Wii U?

2782
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:45,000
Well, I'd like to see more from it than just the spectrum of stuff.

2783
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:51,120
The controller is kind of interesting, even though I honestly really can't use too much

2784
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,120
of it.

2785
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:56,480
But it's an interesting concept.

2786
02:13:56,480 --> 02:14:03,840
But really what has me excited is something from the Microsoft, it's not the only thing

2787
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:08,320
that I really cared about from the Microsoft press conference, but something that kind

2788
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:21,280
of touched on briefly was the whole Bing thing with Kinect, where you could tell it what

2789
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,280
to play.

2790
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:27,160
If you want to search for a game and then play it by voice, you can do that.

2791
02:14:27,160 --> 02:14:28,520
And that's really exciting.

2792
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:31,680
Xbox, Bing, pornography.

2793
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,680
Yes.

2794
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,680
Awesome.

2795
02:14:33,680 --> 02:14:34,680
Indeed.

2796
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:43,160
A lot of people are kind of on what Microsoft showed.

2797
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,320
What did you think of the press conference overall?

2798
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:49,520
Overall, the Microsoft conference, yeah, exactly, was just kind of like, really, more shooters.

2799
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:50,520
Don't care.

2800
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:52,080
Too many first-person shooters, huh?

2801
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:53,080
Too many shooters.

2802
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,080
It's oversaturated.

2803
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:55,080
All right.

2804
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,200
We're going to let you guys go get some other calls before we do.

2805
02:14:57,200 --> 02:15:00,880
Any other final thoughts for us?

2806
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,880
I'm just one more.

2807
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:08,720
I want Konami to announce the Snatcher game, but that didn't happen.

2808
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:10,200
Sadly, it's probably not going to.

2809
02:15:10,200 --> 02:15:11,200
Don't hold your breath.

2810
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:12,200
I was going to say.

2811
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:13,200
All right.

2812
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,200
All right, buddy.

2813
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,200
We're going to let you go get some more calls, but have a good one, okay?

2814
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,200
All right.

2815
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:17,200
Thanks.

2816
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:18,200
All right.

2817
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:19,200
Thank you.

2818
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:20,200
Thanks for putting up with the internet outage, too.

2819
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:21,200
That was kind of weird.

2820
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:22,200
It's just another day here at OLR.

2821
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:23,200
Yeah, I've been having...

2822
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,200
Hey, what's up, guys?

2823
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:25,200
This is Kaijuto.

2824
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:26,200
Hey, Kaijuto.

2825
02:15:26,200 --> 02:15:27,200
What's on your mind, buddy?

2826
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:33,320
Yeah, that the Wii U, the controller, scares the fucking hell out of me.

2827
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:35,760
Why does it scare you?

2828
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:38,480
I mean, it looks like it's going to break.

2829
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:43,760
I mean, all the stuff they want you to do with it doesn't seem very safe for the controller,

2830
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:48,080
like putting it down on the floor, sticking it on that gun and swinging it around.

2831
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:49,080
I don't know.

2832
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:51,120
It just looks like a lot of kids are going to break that thing.

2833
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:54,160
You know, I think you're kind of onto something here, because I can't tell you, and this is

2834
02:15:54,160 --> 02:15:57,760
kind of embarrassing, but I can't tell you how many headsets I've broken on my computer,

2835
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,160
because I'll sit it down on my chair when I get up to go to the bathroom, and then I

2836
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:03,120
come back, crunch, my fat ass sits on it and crunches it.

2837
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:04,400
So you have to be really careful.

2838
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:05,800
Like, you're going to need...

2839
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:10,980
Everybody needs a coffee table to put that controller on, and that's away from the dogs

2840
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:12,640
and the cats that tend to do this.

2841
02:16:12,640 --> 02:16:14,920
Yeah, it's like the big glass on it.

2842
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,400
It's like, you know, it just...

2843
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:20,560
To me, it feels like it's going to just break within a couple of weeks.

2844
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,560
Let's be real.

2845
02:16:21,560 --> 02:16:22,660
It's not really glass.

2846
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:25,040
It's that cheap, plasticky thing that the DS has used.

2847
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,040
It's the same touchscreen from a DS, just bigger.

2848
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,040
Oh, yeah, I did not.

2849
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:29,040
Those get broken.

2850
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:30,040
It looks like glass to me.

2851
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,040
Yeah, they will get...

2852
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,040
It'll still get broken, but yeah.

2853
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:34,040
So...

2854
02:16:34,040 --> 02:16:39,400
Well, let's say that controller is invincible.

2855
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,400
What is your thoughts about Wii U otherwise?

2856
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:46,560
As far as, like, being innovative, I think they're going somewhere with it.

2857
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:50,880
I'm going to agree with Bobby Blackwell if I saw a lot of potential with what they were

2858
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:51,880
showing that you could do with it.

2859
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:57,160
I mean, it's still not something that I want to run out and get right away until I see

2860
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:03,080
something that I really like, but you know, I do appreciate them for trying to bring some

2861
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:08,000
innovation to the game where even though they're recycling the same old games, you know, just

2862
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:18,080
putting Mario on everything, but other than that, they are innovative with their shit.

2863
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:20,440
At what point would Nintendo be charging too much?

2864
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:22,480
I get a lot of feedback, by the way, just to let you know.

2865
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,720
I'm like hearing myself talking about it.

2866
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,720
Yeah, and we have an Echo thing going on, but just...

2867
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:29,520
Well, do you have the Ustream running, because you've got to pause it.

2868
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:36,640
The other thing is, at what price do you think the Wii U becomes too expensive right now?

2869
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:37,640
$399.

2870
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:38,640
$399.

2871
02:17:38,640 --> 02:17:42,360
So, if it's $398, you might be there.

2872
02:17:42,360 --> 02:17:43,360
No, no.

2873
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:46,040
No, I get it at $298.

2874
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:47,040
Alright.

2875
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:48,040
$299, $298.

2876
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:51,880
Alright, well, Kajuda, we're going to let you go to see if we can get another call,

2877
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:53,160
but thanks so much for the call.

2878
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,160
Take care, buddy.

2879
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,160
Alright.

2880
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:56,160
Good night.

2881
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,160
Good night.

2882
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:58,160
Later.

2883
02:17:58,160 --> 02:17:59,160
877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2884
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:05,200
Give us a call, and as we start to wrap up here while we wait for one more call, where

2885
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:06,200
are you guys at?

2886
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:10,680
You know, a lot of people feel the need to rank Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, but let

2887
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:13,200
me kind of leave it here with this.

2888
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,360
Out of what we've talked about tonight, what are you most excited about?

2889
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:20,880
What are you most interested in hearing more about?

2890
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:21,880
Dark Sakura?

2891
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:22,880
Animal Crossing.

2892
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:23,880
No, really.

2893
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:32,880
To be honest, I'm still actually kind of meh about a bunch of it, really.

2894
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:39,400
There were things I had hoped to see that didn't pop out, and really, it was a lot

2895
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:43,040
more of what I expected, although I do really like that new controller.

2896
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:47,760
I'm more excited about that controller for the Wii U, even though the name is, you know,

2897
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:48,760
stupid.

2898
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,760
Alright, we'll get to the other feedback in studio here in a minute, but we do have

2899
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:53,280
another call coming in, so let's get to that.

2900
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:54,280
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2901
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:55,280
Who's this?

2902
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,280
Hey, this is Blender from Napo.

2903
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:58,280
What's going on?

2904
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:59,280
Blender!

2905
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:00,280
What's on your mind?

2906
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:01,280
Nothing.

2907
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:04,480
I just, I, one thing I don't know if you guys mentioned, I was like five minutes late

2908
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:11,400
getting into the show, and nobody mentioned, I was really interested in the BioShock Infinite

2909
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:14,440
with the move support.

2910
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:17,920
You're right, we did kind of skip over that, and that is kind of a big deal, yeah.

2911
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,960
I didn't even, I gotta be honest, I was really terrible, and I didn't even play that

2912
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:26,160
far into the first BioShock game, but I was all over this look of the new game, it's

2913
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:27,160
awesome.

2914
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:30,040
With the whole like, air rails and stuff, that game looks sweet.

2915
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:35,800
I'll finally get to wipe the cobwebs off of my move.

2916
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:38,600
What did you think about Ken Levine's little kind of comment?

2917
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:44,040
He had this, it was almost awkward to me a little bit, his little interlude about how

2918
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:47,320
he's finally got won over by the move.

2919
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:48,320
He sold out.

2920
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:49,320
Yeah.

2921
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:51,600
Sony said, hey guys, guys, money.

2922
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:55,600
And they're like, oh, we like money, and they're like, alright, put move support in

2923
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:56,600
your game.

2924
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:00,000
And they're like, oh, okay, and say something good about the move for us.

2925
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,320
Alright, I can do that, because I like money.

2926
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:06,000
It was like Gabe Newell last year with the whole Valve thing, but.

2927
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Exactly.

2928
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,640
Well, what else caught your eye, Blinder?

2929
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:16,480
Well, I just, Uncharted 3, of course, I'm just a huge Uncharted fan, the multiplayer

2930
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,480
looks fantastic.

2931
02:20:17,480 --> 02:20:24,680
But, other than that, well, see, I only own one system, I only own the Sony, so.

2932
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,920
So there's not a lot for you on the other ones.

2933
02:20:26,920 --> 02:20:31,860
Did maybe, I have to ask it, did Microsoft or Nintendo maybe make you think twice about

2934
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:33,760
picking up another one?

2935
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:38,000
Not Nintendo, but Microsoft, I mean, I'm still kind of on the edge.

2936
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:45,400
I mean, I'm not a fanboy, if I had the money, I would pick up another system, you know.

2937
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:54,280
But it's just, mainly what I've been listening to is just for the Microsoft thing, would

2938
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:59,680
be like, if they did it, they need to make a Kinect, like an L.A. Noire Kinect game.

2939
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:01,560
That would tell me.

2940
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:04,000
Where I can just slap the bitch if I think they're lying.

2941
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

2942
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Pop!

2943
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
All right.

2944
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,400
Have your partner do, hey, go over there and go investigate this for me, I'm gonna go have

2945
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,400
a beer.

2946
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:12,400
All right.

2947
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:14,320
Blinder, any other last thoughts for us before we let you go?

2948
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,320
No, that's it.

2949
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:16,320
All right.

2950
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:17,320
Take care.

2951
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:18,320
We'll see you later.

2952
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:19,320
All right, you too.

2953
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,320
All right, bye.

2954
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,320
All right.

2955
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:22,320
We are gonna go ahead and close the Skype line, guys.

2956
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:23,320
I'm very sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

2957
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:26,520
Don't forget, we're gonna be back tomorrow, and we'll have a little more time to take

2958
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:27,520
more calls tomorrow.

2959
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:29,600
So if you didn't get through tonight, don't be mad.

2960
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,240
You can also email us mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

2961
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:35,900
We will go to the mailbag tomorrow, because we won't have press conferences.

2962
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:38,000
We're gonna hear about other games tomorrow.

2963
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
We still haven't talked Skyrim.

2964
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,720
We gotta talk a little bit about Skyrim.

2965
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,360
Some of the other games, we'll probably dive into Bioshock a little more.

2966
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:46,400
Whatever it is that Bobby and Shane can get their hands on, we're gonna talk a little

2967
02:21:46,400 --> 02:21:50,120
more about tomorrow, and your calls will really help fill in and email us tomorrow.

2968
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,640
And Chibi Wolf.

2969
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:52,640
And Chibi Wolf.

2970
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:53,640
Let's hope.

2971
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:56,380
For now, I wanna go around and get everybody's kind of last thought here.

2972
02:21:56,380 --> 02:22:00,360
And again, guys, sorry to cut it off, but we were only intending on going till nine,

2973
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:01,640
and it's almost 9.30.

2974
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:05,560
So I wanna try and wrap up, and everybody's being a real trooper for staying with us.

2975
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:09,280
But Dan, what are you walking away from this most excited about?

2976
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,840
The Wii U.

2977
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:11,840
The Wii U.

2978
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:12,840
Wii Wii Wii.

2979
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:14,880
Why is that?

2980
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:17,260
It could be really awesome.

2981
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:18,560
Or it could fucking suck.

2982
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,560
No, I'm just kidding.

2983
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:20,560
Well, and that's exactly it.

2984
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:24,800
If Nintendo comes through with the price, and they come through with the games, and

2985
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:29,320
you know, some people do some great development for it, I mean, it could be really, really

2986
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:30,960
smooth.

2987
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:32,720
And it could do a lot of cool stuff.

2988
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:35,080
Or it could be an absolute waste of technology.

2989
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:38,220
And Nintendo's scary, because Nintendo does that.

2990
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:40,840
Sometimes Nintendo hits something, and they just knock it out of the park.

2991
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:45,400
And then sometimes Nintendo's just like, yeah, look at our great thing!

2992
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:47,240
We have no fucking idea what to do with it.

2993
02:22:47,240 --> 02:22:50,600
I mean, the Vita is really cool.

2994
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:54,260
And I mean, I kinda knew it was gonna be a really cool thing.

2995
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:59,080
And when Sony came through with pricing, that wasn't, you know, ridiculous, because I swore.

2996
02:22:59,080 --> 02:23:04,000
I swore they were gonna say, $599 US dollars, and everybody was gonna laugh them out of

2997
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
the arena.

2998
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,600
When they said $250, and everyone was like, alright.

2999
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:14,200
You know, I was like, okay, maybe Sony's learned a thing, but it's just a better PSP.

3000
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:17,840
Where the Vita could be something completely new.

3001
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:20,560
They didn't just say, okay, here's a new Wii controller.

3002
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:25,720
They said, here's a new, different thing that no one's done before.

3003
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,280
And that could be pretty slick.

3004
02:23:28,280 --> 02:23:29,280
I'm with you there.

3005
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:32,660
I wanna go to chat real quick, because one of the other games that's being brought up

3006
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:35,040
in chat right now that we didn't get into depth about today.

3007
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,360
Randy Yu says, Batman, Batman, Batman.

3008
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:41,240
And Blender says, did you see the Catwoman trailer, Randy Yu, which, you know, was shown

3009
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:42,240
at one of the press conferences.

3010
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:47,240
Now I gotta say, there were two things out of the whole three press conferences that

3011
02:23:47,240 --> 02:23:51,440
made me audially, audible say, wow.

3012
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:54,220
I said wow twice during the press conferences.

3013
02:23:54,220 --> 02:23:57,080
One of them was the $499 3D monitor.

3014
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:58,080
I said wow.

3015
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:01,840
The other one was when they announced that Batman Arkham City was gonna be on the Wii

3016
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:02,840
U.

3017
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:03,840
Batman on Nintendo.

3018
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,400
That's just, I don't know why.

3019
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,560
It's just crazy to me.

3020
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:10,780
Well, and if they don't have to make huge graphic compromises, it means that the Wii

3021
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:14,400
U has at least the horsepower of the current generation of consoles.

3022
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,400
Correct.

3023
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:16,400
So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

3024
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,040
Uh, Loki, I know you still need to answer.

3025
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:19,800
I will, uh, let me go first here.

3026
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:24,600
Uh, I'm gonna say the thing I am most excited to see more about, I'm gonna be honest.

3027
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:26,560
I'm gonna go kind of off the beaten path here a little bit.

3028
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:29,120
Although the Wii U, yes, of course I'm gonna see more of that.

3029
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:33,880
I really just feel like, I just, everything is fucking speculation till next year.

3030
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:35,760
You know, it's, it's so, so early.

3031
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,600
Now we know that most of the rumors were true and we've seen where they're going with it.

3032
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:46,400
But for me, the more immediate question, I actually want to see these hardcore games

3033
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,080
with the Kinect functionality.

3034
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,320
I want to see how the public responds to it.

3035
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:59,580
I want to see, I, when I play Kinect, I do really like it and I, I really want so much

3036
02:24:59,580 --> 02:25:03,920
more out of the Kinect and I'm just, I'm really curious how some of these shooters are going

3037
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:04,920
to play.

3038
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:09,880
I mean, I kind of even want to play the Ghost Recon game just to check it out.

3039
02:25:09,880 --> 02:25:12,080
That is never a game I'd be interested in otherwise.

3040
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:13,080
It's so weird.

3041
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,120
I'll save you the trouble.

3042
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:18,040
The response is going to be, eh.

3043
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:20,360
But maybe like two people are going to like buy it.

3044
02:25:20,360 --> 02:25:24,960
It's just like, that's what Twitter will say, but what will the dollars say?

3045
02:25:24,960 --> 02:25:26,800
That's what, that's what the dollars are going to say.

3046
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:27,800
You think?

3047
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:28,800
I, I, I disagree.

3048
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:32,680
In my life, I've dealt with a lot of mainstream gamers.

3049
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:38,000
I've worked at game stores for 10 years and I've seen those guys come into the store and

3050
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:46,320
the Twitter crowd, as much as I hate to say it, is kind of the voice of the quote unquote

3051
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:47,760
hardcore gamer.

3052
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:53,360
The guy who cares enough to be sitting on the computer watching that press conference

3053
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:56,960
and not because he's going to come on here tonight and talk about it.

3054
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:00,040
You know, there's just not going to be a lot of interest.

3055
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:01,040
Fair enough.

3056
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:02,040
You know, it'd be sweet.

3057
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:03,480
It'd be sweet if they could pull it off.

3058
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:06,240
I'm the first guy to admit I have an unopened connect.

3059
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:12,840
It's Jamie's and uh, if they did something sufficiently awesome, that would make me rip

3060
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:13,840
into that thing.

3061
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:14,840
I mean, I would love it.

3062
02:26:14,840 --> 02:26:19,840
I'm probably going to open it now just to try connect labs, but it's just like, wow,

3063
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:24,360
I would love to see the shooter that, you know, you could stand in front of your TV

3064
02:26:24,360 --> 02:26:27,720
and play and not have it be a real shooter or hell, even just the light gun game.

3065
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:29,280
Cause I totally missed light gun games.

3066
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,040
Well, the Wii U is going to have a lot of this.

3067
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:32,040
Yeah.

3068
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:34,920
Like, you know, I was complaining about the on rail stuff and that's all I connect do.

3069
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:35,920
You know what though?

3070
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,560
Like ghost squad on the Wii is fucking awesome.

3071
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:42,960
Squad is an awesome game and the Wii Zapper is a good ghost squad control.

3072
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:44,520
I wanted the ghost squad rifle.

3073
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,520
Okay.

3074
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:46,520
That's a little too far.

3075
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:52,880
Cause it's got the little trigger and it's got the pull thing, but I wanted the ghost

3076
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:56,260
squad rifle to be the Xbox 360 rifle and it just never happened.

3077
02:26:56,260 --> 02:27:00,160
I like that new connect looking rifle, or not connect, the move rifle, by the way, it

3078
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,160
was cool.

3079
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,320
I got to say though, Dan, I'm not disagreeing with your perspective necessarily about like

3080
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:07,480
who the hardcore gamers are and all that, but I got to say, I really think that with

3081
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:14,640
no Wii U this year, Microsoft kind of has that Nintendo soccer mom casual market cornered

3082
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:16,040
this year.

3083
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:19,880
And it's, it's just going to be interesting to see what connect games rise to the top.

3084
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:25,600
Will it just be dance central to number one seller this year or will that connect functionality

3085
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:27,320
float a hardcore game up to the top?

3086
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:31,480
Well, they need to come up with, you know, their Wii sports resort or with their Wii

3087
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:32,520
fit.

3088
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:35,360
That one game that just every connect owner has to have.

3089
02:27:35,360 --> 02:27:36,360
Dance central.

3090
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:37,360
I think it's dance central.

3091
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:38,600
But it's not dance central.

3092
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:43,400
All the dance fans love dance central, but the common folks aren't just like, oh man,

3093
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:44,400
dance central.

3094
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:47,080
Because I was in a room full of common people the other day and nobody really liked dance

3095
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,080
central.

3096
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:49,080
Really?

3097
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,920
I would say dance central, not just like music fans like us who've been following a few years,

3098
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:55,120
but like rock band fans, which is a much wider audience.

3099
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,120
All right.

3100
02:27:56,120 --> 02:27:57,120
Air guitar freaks.

3101
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:58,120
We've got to get towards wrapping up.

3102
02:27:58,120 --> 02:27:59,120
Yes.

3103
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:00,120
I've got to let Loki have his say.

3104
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:02,120
Loki, what left you wanting more?

3105
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:04,880
Saints Row 3.

3106
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:06,400
Air Saints Row the Third.

3107
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,400
It's awesome.

3108
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:11,640
And god damn it, I wish they'd just announce a new Grand Theft Auto and be done with it.

3109
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:12,640
No kidding.

3110
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,280
And Half Life 2 Episode 3.

3111
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:15,280
Fuck you, Valve.

3112
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,280
Fuck you right in the ear.

3113
02:28:16,280 --> 02:28:17,280
We know it's coming.

3114
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,280
I mean, come on.

3115
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:20,380
Just, just, just come out and say it.

3116
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:23,520
You know, that's, that's really it.

3117
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:24,520
All right.

3118
02:28:24,520 --> 02:28:25,520
Fuck Valve.

3119
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:29,840
And the fact that, you know, so what Nintendo's console can play Batman Arkham Asylum.

3120
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,840
You know what?

3121
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:33,600
The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 can also play that.

3122
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:34,600
Why do I care?

3123
02:28:34,600 --> 02:28:35,920
A year earlier.

3124
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:41,640
I, yeah, and I'm not gonna go buy, you know, a console just because they can play a game

3125
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:44,280
of a console that I can already have.

3126
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:49,600
I want to see what titles Nintendo's gonna have that are exclusive to this that are actually

3127
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:54,040
gonna be worth my time instead of saying, hey, lookit, we got this really cool thing.

3128
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:55,680
Because here's the problem.

3129
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,840
They're hoping that the publishers are, you know, gonna be creative enough to use this

3130
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,640
technology that they built.

3131
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:07,320
Last time I checked, it never was a problem that, oh, these games aren't creative enough.

3132
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:14,160
It's oh, we just don't give a crap about fleshing up this game to the point of, you know, attracting

3133
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:18,480
other people other than casual gamers because, eh, casual gamers still just buy whatever

3134
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:23,560
as long as it's $19.99.

3135
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:24,560
Alright.

3136
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:28,920
Well, um, anything you guys are hoping, well, Loki, you're not gonna be here tomorrow.

3137
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:30,920
No, I'm not gonna be here.

3138
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:34,400
And Dan will be here and Dark Soccer and myself.

3139
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:37,880
But since you kind of have, this is your last chance to say whatever you want on the show

3140
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:41,660
here about E3 till next Sunday, anything else you kind of want to get out about your thoughts

3141
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:42,660
on the show?

3142
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:48,280
Um, I mean, other than just like some of the stuff that's already been, there's nothing

3143
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:52,320
really that's like brand new, nothing out of those conferences that was really just

3144
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:53,800
caught me off guard.

3145
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:59,800
You know, um, I don't know, it was just no real surprises, nothing like, oh my God, that's

3146
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:00,800
so amazing.

3147
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,800
And you could see it.

3148
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:03,040
The crowds weren't into it.

3149
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:08,020
There were like one or two pops when something that they were supposed to pop at came.

3150
02:30:08,020 --> 02:30:13,400
There were a lot of pauses where the companies expected applause and nobody was into it.

3151
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:16,240
It was a very apathetic attitude.

3152
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:21,480
Even the big stuff that people were supposed to be into just didn't win people over.

3153
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:26,840
All right, we'll be back tomorrow to do some more E3 coverage.

3154
02:30:26,840 --> 02:30:32,420
Dark Soccer, myself, Dan, and you guys in our chat room and of course in LA, a big thanks

3155
02:30:32,420 --> 02:30:36,840
of course to Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, Miklotov are both in LA and they will be back with

3156
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:38,960
more game opinions tomorrow.

3157
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:42,240
But for tonight, we say goodnight.

3158
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,360
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

3159
02:30:43,360 --> 02:30:48,080
We'll see you back here tomorrow at our little temporary space here on Ustream, seven o'clock

3160
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:50,360
Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

3161
02:30:50,360 --> 02:30:54,880
No video yet, but hopefully you stream in the future and not tomorrow either, but you

3162
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:55,880
stream in the future.

3163
02:30:55,880 --> 02:31:00,040
We might have some more video features, kind of like we used to back in the day on OLR.

3164
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:02,720
So besides that, I'm so completely unglamorous right now.

3165
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,600
I can't be on video or it will explode.

3166
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:07,120
So that's going to do it for our E3 coverage tonight.

3167
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:09,680
We'll be back tomorrow, seven o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

3168
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:10,680
We'll see you here.
