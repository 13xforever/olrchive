00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:24,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, June 7th, 2011, we kick off our live E3 coverage with press conference reactions and special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov in LA on the show floor.

2
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:32,302
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

3
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,900
[SPEAKER_10]: To those of you that are brand new to Orange Lounge Radio, welcome.

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,164
[SPEAKER_10]: If you found us through Ustream or what have you or some of the other referrals, which we'll talk about in a little bit, welcome to our little show.

5
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:15,795
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice and boy, here's a lot of voices about what has been talked about from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, to a lesser extent EA and Ubisoft, but there's just a lot, a lot of talk today and we're going to get right into it, but I need to introduce everybody on the panel.

6
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:20,400
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes known as Sky, and I'll be joining you with my co-host.

7
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:23,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaty.

9
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:24,344
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

10
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:24,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaty.

11
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Feeling fresh and meaty?

12
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:26,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaty.

13
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:27,087
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

14
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:31,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And say hello to the one and only, and I'm so happy he can make it here tonight, Techmaster Loki.

15
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

16
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:37,639
[SPEAKER_10]: We were a little worried that Techmaster Loki wouldn't be here tonight because of family commitments, but here he is.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw the family.

18
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:40,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

19
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:41,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope Nelly's not listening.

20
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:42,262
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

21
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:42,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, good.

22
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:47,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome to you, and we're going to ask you about Nintendo in just a little bit.

23
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Also joining us, we've got other people joining us.

24
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:52,566
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have the one and only Bobby Blackwolf from The Bobby Blackwolf Show.

25
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:57,208
[SPEAKER_10]: He usually does a show right before us on our normal live shows Sunday night.

26
00:01:57,228 --> 00:02:01,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we're live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And more information about all of that is at our website, orangelonestradio.com.

28
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf is in L.A.

29
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:07,853
[SPEAKER_10]: at E3.

30
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:10,534
[SPEAKER_10]: He will be joining us momentarily to talk about it.

31
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:14,475
[SPEAKER_10]: He has played the Wii U. We're going to talk all about that in a little while.

32
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:16,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to introduce somebody else here in studio though.

33
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan the Man is joining us.

34
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

35
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,436
[SPEAKER_10]: What a pleasant surprise.

36
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:20,996
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you Dan?

37
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:21,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

38
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

39
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:25,637
[SPEAKER_10]: So, E3.

40
00:02:26,638 --> 00:02:27,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was there.

41
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,933
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get into all the press conferences and so forth.

42
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:35,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just start with this before I plug everything and do the usual plugs.

43
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:46,440
[SPEAKER_10]: What is one word on your mind right now that just if E3 right now can just boil down to one word, what is that word right now?

44
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:47,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan?

45
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:49,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Underwhelming.

46
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:51,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Underwhelming.

47
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:51,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

48
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:51,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

49
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,756
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

50
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,403
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to get to that later in the show.

51
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,944
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to join our chat room, please note we do not have a Ustream chat.

52
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,265
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a IRC chat room.

53
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,745
[SPEAKER_10]: More information is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

54
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:33,246
[SPEAKER_10]: So please, by all means, pull up a chair, sit in the chat room, and join us there.

55
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,807
[SPEAKER_10]: And Orange Wright in the chat room will start us off tonight.

56
00:03:37,227 --> 00:03:41,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of all one word slammed together says, third party saving first party asses.

57
00:03:43,028 --> 00:03:45,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my runner up would be, seriously?

58
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:46,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously?

59
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:47,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a good one.

60
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to be all negative tonight?

61
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:49,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

62
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:58,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I swear to God, all I've been reading on Twitter is just cynicism, skepticism, negativity, and I'm like, this is why everybody hates gamers.

63
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:03,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there's not an ounce of positivity I'm seeing on Twitter.

64
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,734
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't feel 100% negative.

65
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:08,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there things that I think should be done better?

66
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:08,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

67
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,315
[SPEAKER_10]: But is it all negative?

68
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't necessarily think so.

69
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But is anything mind-blowing?

70
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,221
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

71
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:20,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, but probably not from any of the big five that we're going to talk about today.

72
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:22,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it at that.

73
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:23,587
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

74
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:26,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to plug us on Facebook.

75
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

76
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:29,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.

77
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:31,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

78
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:33,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf, of course, he'll be joining us in a little bit.

79
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:35,195
[SPEAKER_10]: We're teaming up tonight to do the coverage.

80
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,456
[SPEAKER_10]: He is also on Twitter.

81
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash Bobby Blackwolf.

82
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:40,119
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why I plug that is that

83
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Today he was pretty dominated at the Nintendo booth all day.

84
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, he wasn't dominated at the Nintendo booth, maybe.

85
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:51,266
[SPEAKER_10]: But his day was dominated by the Nintendo booth because he was at the Wii U event today.

86
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:54,268
[SPEAKER_10]: But tomorrow, he will be taking your orders.

87
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,269
[SPEAKER_10]: You will be dominating him on Twitter.

88
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And he is going to be your man on the floor at twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf.

89
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:01,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're like, hey...

90
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:06,905
[SPEAKER_10]: What freaking Konami games are there that weren't at the press conference or whatever?

91
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:10,814
[SPEAKER_10]: And he'll tweet you back and say, Glee Karaoke Revolution with Rocky Horror.

92
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:11,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

93
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Reggie's bitch today, your bitch tomorrow.

94
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,801
[SPEAKER_10]: So twitter.com slash Bobby Blackwolf.

95
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:21,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to say thank you to those of you guys that have retweeted, helped promote these special shows.

96
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:27,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's a little weird because we're not in our usual home, but we had to kind of think fast and this all really came together last minute.

97
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to thank everybody involved.

98
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:34,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to give a special shout out to Video Game Outsiders who has a show usually live tonight at All Games.

99
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,452
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't end up doing one tonight because of personal reasons, but they sent a tweet that was like, go listen to OLR.

100
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:44,419
[SPEAKER_10]: and I thought that was very nice of them to do and so I wanted to give them a shout out and a thank you.

101
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a night of varying opinions.

102
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:51,473
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be fun so remember kids, play nice and be respectful.

103
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,336
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

104
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:19,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo, Halo Anniversary Edition, Halo 4, neither of which, interesting enough, had Kinect shown.

105
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,281
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of the only games, in fact, I think, at that whole press conference that didn't have Kinect shown.

106
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:29,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any excitement whatsoever about the new Halo 4 or the Halo Anniversary Edition?

107
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:30,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

108
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:31,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear the...

109
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm into it, I like Halo, I'm stoked for more Halo

110
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:53,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this.

111
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:58,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It did mess with my head not seeing the Bungie logo before the Halo trailers.

112
00:06:58,424 --> 00:06:58,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it?

113
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was just like, oh, it's Halo.

114
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, there is no Bungie making Halo anymore.

115
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's kind of sad.

116
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:05,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

117
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,371
[SPEAKER_10]: It did seem like that trailer had a very different look to it as well, huh?

118
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it just didn't have that Bungie feel.

119
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it didn't.

120
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't have that big orchestra.

121
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:15,655
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay, I think, you know?

122
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

123
00:07:16,615 --> 00:07:19,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Bungie had kind of ran their course, I guess, but...

124
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:30,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to even say they ran their course, but it's just like, okay, there were the Batman movies from the 80s and 90s and stuff, and then there's the new Batman series.

125
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:40,326
[SPEAKER_09]: The beginning of one was good, and the other one is also good, but it's refreshing, I guess, to have a new style of gameplay.

126
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:46,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's hard to deny the fact that it's Bungie's franchise.

127
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was Bungie's franchise.

128
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Microsoft's franchise now.

129
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:52,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's weird that it won't have their stamp on it.

130
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:57,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless the new developers are just sick copycats, which is about the best I could hope for.

131
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:00,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me jump over to Anniversary Collection for a minute.

132
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Huge speculation on the internet before that it was going to be very Kinect heavy.

133
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,567
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I believe there was a domain, halokinect.com or something.

134
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:17,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, granted, there could be more announcements between now and when the game actually comes out, but unlike most of the other stuff that Microsoft was pushing at E3, wasn't seeing Kinect in this Halo game.

135
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:19,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think they changed their mind?

136
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is yet to come?

137
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:31,945
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's because that would have required them to do some extra work because basically they're just upgrading the assets slightly and they're porting it over to the Reach engine.

138
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:38,409
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would have required them to rebuild a portion of the engine and adjusting the physics so that it's like Halo 1.

139
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,212
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would have required extra work for them to do that.

140
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Halo 4.

141
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can bet your ass Halo 4 will use Kinect.

142
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:56,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you find that little footnote that came out after the press conference about that the multiplayer is all just multiplayer maps for Halo Reach?

143
00:08:56,835 --> 00:09:01,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It is not actually a part of the Halo Anniversary Collection or whatever, Anniversary Edition?

144
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:02,739
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

145
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I had read this thing online about... No, no, no, here's how it works.

146
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:05,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that can't be right.

147
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:06,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, please share me.

148
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:09,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, it's very similar to ODST.

149
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:16,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you have one disc that has the single player campaign on it and, of course, the co-op for that disc.

150
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you have also the multiplayer disc.

151
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the whole multiplayer disc is the full Halo Reach multiplayer portion, I guess.

152
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:34,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And the maps do exist on the Reach servers, but since it's also on the Reach engine, that's what's going on.

153
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:40,078
[SPEAKER_09]: These maps are for Reach, but you can play against other people that also have Reach, I believe, as well.

154
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:41,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

155
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess that's kind of cool if it kind of bridges that.

156
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because ODST did the same thing they did.

157
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Halo 3 they were playing on.

158
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not bad.

159
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:57,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And considering the fact that it's also going to be a budget-priced game, too, it's going to be a $40 game when it comes out.

160
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:01,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because they know they can't make a better multiplayer engine than Bungie did.

161
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:10,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk Kinect for a little bit because obviously Kinect dominated a lot of Microsoft's press conference and it's taken a lot of flack on the internet because of that.

162
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:25,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed when I was watching Twitter over the press conference there's a lot of people hating on Microsoft right now because their conference was very Kinect heavy and it didn't seem to address the hardcore gamer which is funny because that's the battle Nintendo's been fighting for years.

163
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullshit, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,770
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the best stage.

165
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's important.

166
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it was important.

167
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:40,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're going to get into it later on, but they're not the only ones that, you know, okay, other than, you know, PlayStation, I guess.

168
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,801
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not the only ones that really focus on their motion gaming stuff.

169
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,146
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, what they showed, I think it's a little bit of everything.

170
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:58,735
[SPEAKER_09]: You had some stuff for the hardcore players and you had some stuff that's like, well, this shit's on, you know, could have been on the Wii or, you know, it's very kidsy, I guess.

171
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:02,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask a question of our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com again.

172
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,684
[SPEAKER_10]: For those that are joining us for the first time because of the Ustream connection here, our normal chat room is at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

173
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:10,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Answer this for me.

174
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:10,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Be honest.

175
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a Kinect title you want to try?

176
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:16,190
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to talk about some of those Kinect titles that were announced at the show.

177
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,532
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to go to DarkSakura for a minute because I know you must have perked up when you heard about the Disneyland Kinect game.

178
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear about the Disneyland Kinect game?

179
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:25,734
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't actually.

180
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:29,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there's this whole... I relied on somebody to fill me in.

181
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, Dan didn't fill her in on the Disneyland Kinect.

182
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:32,798
[SPEAKER_10]: You didn't ask.

183
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:38,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, there's this whole Disneyland Kinect game going on where they really harped on...

184
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,402
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to get to be in Disneyland.

185
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:46,285
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually showed, you know, like you're going through down Main Street and so forth.

186
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:52,788
[SPEAKER_10]: But then as you walk up to a ride like Peter Pan's Adventure, they had these little overacting kids on stage demonstrating it.

187
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:53,608
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just mini games.

188
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what it made me think of?

189
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:00,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys remember an old 8-bit game by Capcom years and years ago called Adventures in the Magic Kingdom.

190
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:00,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

191
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:02,213
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an old-ass NES game.

192
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:03,353
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the same thing.

193
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what this game is?

194
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:04,894
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

195
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another Connect Adventures game.

196
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:10,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, Connect Disneyland Adventures.

197
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:11,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Connect Adventures.

198
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:12,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all it is.

199
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:16,014
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you're flying through stuff and collecting coins or whatever.

200
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:17,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Except it's in Disneyland.

201
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,055
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

202
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,336
[SPEAKER_06]: The Disney Hub looked cool.

203
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,457
[SPEAKER_09]: The minigames looked like butt.

204
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly where I'm at.

205
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:23,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly where I'm at.

206
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:24,438
[SPEAKER_09]: No, exactly.

207
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:29,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine because it looks fun, but... Let me put it this way, though.

208
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: They seriously need to tone down the acting for the people that they have on stage.

209
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:34,322
[SPEAKER_09]: It was...

210
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:36,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It was to the point where it was distracting.

211
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:41,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I understand you wanted to make it look fun and stuff like that, but oh my god.

212
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:43,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any idea how many Red Bulls those kids drank?

213
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:47,087
[SPEAKER_06]: They worked their little hearts off, and they're probably dead right now.

214
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:50,389
[SPEAKER_06]: They burned out showing you how fun that game was.

215
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:52,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know what this horror is

216
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:16,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think anybody here in the room got Minecraft, quote unquote.

217
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it, but I just don't want to play it.

218
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that's where I'm at.

219
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:23,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it, and I understand why people love it.

220
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That being said, it's not for me.

221
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:28,608
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just I don't have that much free time in my day to play something like that.

222
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:29,588
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

223
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,034
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

224
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:15,974
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some more feedback in our chatroom on the Disney game, Disneyland Adventures for the Kinetic Tiger Claw.

225
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:20,439
[SPEAKER_10]: When they showed that Disneyland game, I was reminded of that Universal Studios game on the GameCube.

226
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that game?

227
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:22,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

228
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:24,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I don't, so that doesn't bode well for this game.

229
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:25,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was bad.

230
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,045
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

231
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember it.

232
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Universal Studios Mini Games Back to the Future

233
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:42,984
[SPEAKER_06]: was Woody Woodpecker.

234
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:53,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be like, okay, we've got a Disneyland game coming out, but unfortunately all the Disneyland characters, like 98% of them were too expensive to license, so we got Herbie the Lovebug to be in the game.

235
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:54,549
[SPEAKER_10]: So we decided to do Knott's Berry Farm.

236
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be expensive because it's Disney.

237
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be it.

238
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:57,690
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

239
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,371
[SPEAKER_10]: We couldn't get Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse.

240
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Connect Knott's Berry Farm Adventures.

241
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,637
[SPEAKER_10]: At least they'd have good chicken.

242
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:15,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Savalas in the chair says, Connect Disney is for families in Nebraska who are not able to get to a Disney amusement park.

243
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I see it as more like the thing to just shut the kids up.

244
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:19,122
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

245
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:23,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that my store, Nebraska Furniture Mart, will sell plenty of those.

246
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do hope somebody hacks the Disneyland Connect assets and makes a Grand Theft Auto style port.

247
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on now, let the kids have something.

248
00:15:53,373 --> 00:15:56,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Who hasn't made Grand Theft Auto and GTA yet?

249
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate fucking Elmo.

250
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe with less Elmo.

251
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:20,637
[SPEAKER_06]: If it had like Cookie Monster and Big Bird in it, I'd be like, this game's going to be tight.

252
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to buy a copy and I'm going to play it.

253
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,103
[SPEAKER_10]: If Linda the Deaf Lady was teaching me how to sign.

254
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, Linda the Deaf Lady was hot.

255
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:31,666
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

256
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:38,635
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf is in our chat room right now talking to the chatters there saying, I had Sesame Street games on my Intellivision.

257
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:41,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Word fun and Electric Company math fun.

258
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, the Electric Company game was amazing.

259
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:48,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know more about this whole live streaming TV thing they were talking about.

260
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:50,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Was I the only one that didn't really get it?

261
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:51,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

262
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,343
[SPEAKER_10]: It flowed really weird in their presser for me.

263
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:55,544
[SPEAKER_06]: They were watching Castle.

264
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:57,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're watching Castle apparently.

265
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I caught a little ad in the sidebar.

266
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:03,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was just a marketing placeholder or whatever, but it said The Connect Show.

267
00:17:04,352 --> 00:17:07,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And that made me think, is Microsoft producing their own content for this too?

268
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:08,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Or was that just a placeholder?

269
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:10,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a placeholder, but here's the thing.

270
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:17,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically going to be content that, say, for example, I have Comcast, so it's going to be Comcast programming.

271
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:19,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

272
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I can just turn the TV on and watch TV.

273
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't need to watch TV through my 360.

274
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:27,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Will my 360 act as a TiVo?

275
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if so, I could actually kind of use that.

276
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what it's doing is, you guys know what the review is, right?

277
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:34,135
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Harry Potter, and it'll show you all the games, all the CDs.

279
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, will it like search the internet too?

280
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, do we have a legit... No, it won't search the internet because it doesn't have a fucking web browser in it.

281
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:17,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Will Kinect finally respond to me going, Xbox, Bing, gay porn.

282
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:20,169
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll probably look up gay porn.

283
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:21,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it'll be My Little Pony.

284
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll come back with some indie gay... Yeah, it'll come back with My Little Pony.

285
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:24,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Care Bears.

286
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:26,473
[SPEAKER_06]: The Smurfs.

287
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Lady Gaga on HBO.

288
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

289
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:36,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate the new interface.

290
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:37,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It was weird.

291
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:41,287
[SPEAKER_10]: It took me a minute to figure out that they were actually demoing a new interface.

292
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not stupid.

293
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:50,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that it was a new interface, but I thought it was kind of like a spinoff for the TV thing, like the Kinect thing is.

294
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,472
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little separate thing.

295
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think I was looking at a whole new dashboard.

296
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,475
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was kind of like, okay.

297
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:01,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked like the crossbar a little bit, didn't it?

298
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:07,397
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's modeled after Windows 7 phone stuff and then also Windows 8 is supposed to be very similar to that.

299
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for them to do that kind of stuff.

300
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:13,038
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, Windows 8, that shit is optional.

301
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:14,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the fucking media center.

302
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,259
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to use media center if you don't want to.

303
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:21,063
[SPEAKER_09]: However, on the Xbox 360, it's not fucking optional.

304
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:21,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

305
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:26,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Hitting the guide button again to get my fucking blades back is not fucking optional.

306
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the blades.

307
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:31,176
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

308
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:31,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a thought.

309
00:19:31,736 --> 00:19:33,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is crazy and out there, but...

310
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

311
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:57,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Techness in our chatroom at chat.orange.studio.com says, I think it's great they added complete voice search.

312
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:01,488
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty hard and quite pathetic that in the current dashboard it's hard to find shit.

313
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:02,109
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

314
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,969
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of my problem.

315
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:07,970
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Connect Fun Labs was on the thing like right after the press conference.

316
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,450
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to dig to find it.

317
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,091
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you didn't.

318
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,531
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not on the main bar.

319
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,971
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to go to the E3 coverage.

320
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:14,872
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't look hard enough.

321
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:15,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you go to Connect.

322
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:17,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

323
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was.

324
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:41,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty much.

325
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:42,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

326
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:43,457
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

327
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on to some other announcements.

328
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the non-connect things at the top were actually pretty cool.

329
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,061
[SPEAKER_10]: There was the Modern Warfare 3 demo that they demoed.

330
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:56,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I'm not into those games, but I was kind of looking at the footage going, oh, that's really pretty.

331
00:20:56,563 --> 00:21:02,886
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool if I could actually do that when I play the game as opposed to just running into walls constantly and shooting my friends.

332
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:06,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean there's a Modern Army game where I can shoot things and shit explodes?

333
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,519
[SPEAKER_10]: That's revolutionary and brand new!

334
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, I thought it was pretty cool when they were doing that whole little getaway in the raft.

335
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, it's like Super Army Cart.

336
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,630
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a raft at the end of the last game.

337
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shows you how much I play those games.

338
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:22,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Modern Warfare.

339
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And the truth is, I like Modern Warfare.

340
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

341
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and I love this, the Tomb Raider demo was hot.

342
00:21:31,012 --> 00:21:32,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that was like my favorite thing I saw.

343
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:43,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomb Raider was neat, but once again, you know, I've already, I've kind of set that franchise aside for, well actually since the first Tomb Raider, I just never got into Tomb Raider.

344
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But it looks cool.

345
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:51,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the thing about this new Tomb Raider is that it didn't look at all like the old ones, because it didn't look like a reboot at all.

346
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:53,223
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it looks like Uncharted.

347
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, maybe that's why Microsoft wanted to show it in their conference And then they have Adventure Sense, which is like saying, hey, you can't figure out the puzzle?

348
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:21,236
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do it for you I'm gonna need that It's Tomb Raider for idiots Well, what I loved about it though is that there were scenes very reminiscent of that movie The Descent Which is like one of the few movies ever to legit scare the shit out of me So I can kind of see where the survival horror thing is coming from for Tomb Raider Because some of that stuff did look kind of scary

349
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider needs something, and if this rejuvenates the franchise, great.

350
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:31,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But just the same, it's like, it's Uncharted.

351
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:34,662
[SPEAKER_09]: How many times have they tried to reboot Tomb Raider?

352
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:38,845
[SPEAKER_09]: So many times, and it's failed every time, so hopefully this time it's a little different.

353
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations Xbox, you get Uncharted, it's Tomb Raider.

354
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:47,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but Tomb Raider is not exclusive to the 360 either, so I thought it was weird that they demoed it as Microsoft Prime.

355
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but PS3 people can just play Uncharted.

356
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:49,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

357
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's why they didn't demo it.

358
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,076
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to show Uncharted and then, you know, Tomb Raider.

359
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this looks kind of similar.

360
00:22:56,137 --> 00:22:56,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, wait a minute.

361
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Uncharted is awesome and Tomb Raider is trying again.

362
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,424
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, the Tomb Raider demo got kind of creepy with all the moaning and panting from Lara Croft.

363
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:06,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

364
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:10,328
[SPEAKER_10]: GameGuru says, Tomb Raider looks too much like a survival horror game.

365
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:12,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

366
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Randy U says, dude stabbing Lara and closing her eyes?

367
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:16,073
[SPEAKER_10]: What the fuck?

368
00:23:16,713 --> 00:23:20,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Janai in our chatroom says, Uncharted is so bro, bro, bro.

369
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:22,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncharted is pretty cool.

370
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,655
[SPEAKER_08]: I did watch that little bit of the demo.

371
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:26,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Of the Uncharted demo?

372
00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:27,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

373
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:27,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

374
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,396
[SPEAKER_08]: When Dan was watching it, it was, let's drown for a while.

375
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's press A repeatedly.

376
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:34,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not drown for a while.

377
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:35,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Uncharted.

378
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,397
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, yeah, I won't play it.

379
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's shoot people.

380
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:39,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And then QuickTime events.

381
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

382
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:46,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, Connect Fun Labs was shown, and I wanted to see the look on Loki's face when that was being demoed.

383
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:46,868
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

384
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:47,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing, okay?

385
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:49,328
[SPEAKER_09]: All this stuff got spoiled.

386
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:54,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, right before the press conference, oh, look, our E3 page got leaked out.

387
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, all the big, you know, announcements, they were already out there.

388
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,812
[SPEAKER_09]: And Connect Fun Labs, that shit leaked a while ago, but...

389
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:31,454
[SPEAKER_06]: and here's what you know Connect Fun Labs is it's hey look here's all the tech stuff that we said we could do before and couldn't do now you can you know remember the whole hey I can scan my skateboard in there and you know play the first thing that they show did you notice even the lady said finally she's like and now you can scan in your skateboard finally so you know she's been catching shit about that for a year like the first thing they show someone scanning a skateboard in and then jumping on a virtual skateboard and playing and now they're like oh you can do it

390
00:24:32,202 --> 00:24:37,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and the thing about Connect Me too and the whole Fun Labs is that it is not changing your avatar.

391
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:41,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like how the 3DS will make a me out of taking a picture of you.

392
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:45,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It is just like a temporary thing to do fashion magazine poses.

393
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:52,794
[SPEAKER_09]: But then what the fuck is the whole thing where, oh, you don't have to fumble through menus anymore to pick your avatar.

394
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:54,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you're full of shit.

395
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:54,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to be rude.

396
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:55,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fucking lie.

397
00:24:55,196 --> 00:24:55,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, screw it.

398
00:24:55,556 --> 00:24:57,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not hooking up our Connect after all.

399
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:23,925
[SPEAKER_10]: you cannot make the avatar out of it you know what I did what I wanted to test I wore my Pikachu shirt to see if it would take a picture of the Pikachu shirt and like actually show Pikachu if it would just be a yellow shirt and it came through as a Pikachu shirt I mean it was a horrible scan of it but it was definitely Pikachu and I was thinking well obviously this won't be the main avatar because they can't show all that copyrighted stuff that people scan in somebody will wear a dick on their shirt I haven't tried it yet but that's gotta be wrong

400
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not... See if you can figure it out.

401
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat, is anyone playing Kinect Fun Labs?

402
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:28,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me if you are.

403
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:29,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not believe you.

404
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:30,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hook up our Kinect.

405
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:31,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Save your avatar.

406
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:32,989
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your Kinect.

407
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone was supposed to lend me Dance Masters.

408
00:25:37,432 --> 00:25:37,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

409
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:38,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Central 2.

410
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:40,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Dance Central.

411
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:41,674
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of Dance Central 2?

412
00:25:42,194 --> 00:25:43,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Dance Central 1.

413
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:52,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, I'm a big fan of Dance Central, but I didn't see, besides, obviously, Durr, the two-player thing, I didn't see what was new about it.

414
00:25:52,693 --> 00:25:55,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what's new about it, and I only know this because I saw the actual feature list.

415
00:25:56,176 --> 00:26:04,842
[SPEAKER_09]: What they did is they improved the break-it-down mode where you can actually repeat individual moves or practice individual moves.

416
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,023
[SPEAKER_09]: It needed to be retooled.

417
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:11,988
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also repeat whole sections of that stuff.

418
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:14,130
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also...

419
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think what else there was in there.

420
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:22,176
[SPEAKER_09]: The two-player at the same time, they also have the ability where you can get rid of the freestyle stuff.

421
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:30,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Say you don't want to do that where you flail about randomly during the song, you can take that out or you can change the way it looks.

422
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:32,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of that stuff.

423
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:35,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, the new music that they're going to have in there.

424
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:41,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think they did a whole lot with Dance Central 2, and honestly, they probably could have just left it alone.

425
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's also one of those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

426
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:46,134
[SPEAKER_06]: How many dance games are on the Wii?

427
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, I'm sorry, the Kinect.

428
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:57,158
[SPEAKER_10]: The Kinect, there's Dance Masters, Just Dance was announced, will be coming, and there's that Dance Paradise, is that what it is?

429
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Dance Masters, Dance Central 2, Just Dance 3, Dance Paradise.

430
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Available right now.

431
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Paradise, Dance Masters, and Dance Central.

432
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:08,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's three?

433
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:12,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how they're like, it's the number one selling dance game on the Kinect.

434
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And Michael Jackson, The Experience.

435
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:15,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess maybe that's four.

436
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:19,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because it is the number one selling one by a mile and with kind of good reason.

437
00:27:19,226 --> 00:27:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because it's the only good one.

438
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, though.

439
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:29,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Dance, though, I mean, it's good on the Wii and stuff because of the limitations of that, but when you...

440
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:34,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of bring that in with Dance Central.

441
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:36,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's going to be able to hold its own.

442
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:39,382
[SPEAKER_09]: People will buy it because they're like, oh hey, Just Dance, it's popular.

443
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:44,709
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think Dance Central does a better job though.

444
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Just Dance sells well because it's got the right name.

445
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:50,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Dance Central, Just Dance Dance Paradise

446
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, except only ones I'd seen were Dance Masters and Dance Central.

447
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,532
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one I've tried is Dance Central.

448
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:32,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see a dance game with like half Konami-ish songs, half Dance Central-ish songs in the Dance Masters interface because I think there's some cool things that Dance Masters brings to the table.

449
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:32,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I want more Parapara.

450
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then you would be talking about part of my pitch for a new DDR game, of course.

451
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:38,879
[SPEAKER_10]: You see...

452
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:41,401
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let me get to some quick, quick thoughts.

453
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,602
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to get on to Sony.

454
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get to Bobby and all that.

455
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:46,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick thoughts.

456
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:47,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Fable the Journey.

457
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:53,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my problem with necessarily... Fable the Journey looks good.

458
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:56,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it looks nice because it's in Unreal 3 now.

459
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my problem with the Kinect games, though.

460
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:00,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's on fucking rails.

461
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is on fucking rails.

462
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:06,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't a Halo rail shooter make more sense than a Fable rail shooter?

463
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything is on fucking rails!

464
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:10,966
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ghost Recon game, on rails.

465
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,868
[SPEAKER_09]: The Fable game, on rails.

466
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:14,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Wars, on rails.

467
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all they can do is on rail shooters.

468
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:18,654
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't actually do...

469
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:22,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything where you have actual control.

470
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:28,959
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where one thing that PlayStation has over, you know, the Kinect is, hey, you know what?

471
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,500
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a navigation controller.

472
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We can navigate around the map whereas you guys are stuck on a rail.

473
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,563
[SPEAKER_06]: You need the Xbox nunchuck.

474
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:45,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm coming off of Fable 3, which I talked about on last week's OLR, and I was not feeling that great about Fable 3.

475
00:29:45,803 --> 00:29:50,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I saw this preview, I was just kind of, eh, if it's $20 maybe.

476
00:29:50,704 --> 00:29:51,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looked alright.

477
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:55,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be a pretty cool Xbox Live Arcade game, and I liked how the perspective's a little different.

478
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:59,626
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually kind of reminded me of, because it is an on-rails shooter.

479
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:00,369
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

480
00:30:19,338 --> 00:30:19,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

481
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:42,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt bad for him but of course the games are still early on so there you go did I miss anything else?

482
00:30:44,012 --> 00:31:03,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom Clancy game was shown as well Gears of War 3 actually the one that looks kind of cool is Rise the new Crytek game the Roman one I saw the dude kicking in that and I was like he's gonna kick his Kinect right off the TV I can't play that in my house

483
00:31:03,507 --> 00:31:04,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see the achievement now.

484
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:06,631
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Sparta!

485
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:09,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time I do that.

486
00:31:11,775 --> 00:31:15,076
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's why a game like that will sell because there's going to be a lot of 17-year-old guys.

487
00:31:15,096 --> 00:31:15,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks good, though.

488
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:16,756
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's the thing, though.

489
00:31:16,836 --> 00:31:24,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an actual... But as long as the combat's good and not clunky like Fighters Uncaged or something like that, I don't know.

490
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,659
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of cool stuff that they showed.

491
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Forza 4 looks pretty awesome.

492
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And the head tracking stuff in that, once again, also kind of laggy.

493
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't really know how you would be able to do that anyways because you can't really turn your...

494
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:40,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, you're a racing game fan, Forza?

495
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Forza looks great.

496
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great looking racing game.

497
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see their new steering wheel that they have?

498
00:31:57,522 --> 00:32:00,444
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks like butt.

499
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:01,785
[SPEAKER_09]: $60 wireless steering wheel.

500
00:32:02,145 --> 00:32:02,885
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point?

501
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:05,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you can wave it around in midair.

502
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:06,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

503
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:10,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War 3, Ice-T reuniting.

504
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does he always look angry?

505
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,273
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, I'm hardcore.

506
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:13,693
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Ice-T.

507
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:19,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like every, I don't understand why he, he's just like scowling the entire time.

508
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:21,399
[SPEAKER_06]: He looked angry because he was playing Gears of War.

509
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

510
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a testosterone game for men.

511
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody in Gears of War looks angry.

512
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:32,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you don't have to like be all, you know, fronting like you're just, you know, I'm gonna murder somebody after I'm done playing this game.

513
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:38,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I gotta say though, the Gears of War 3 limited edition Xbox looks pretty nice.

514
00:32:38,152 --> 00:32:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: The black and red one?

515
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

516
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:39,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks good.

517
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,274
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, quickly, I got to get to Bobby.

518
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to quickly just mention the EA press conference that happened.

519
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:49,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass Effect 3, interesting voice command thing going on there.

520
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:49,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Useless.

521
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:50,738
[SPEAKER_10]: How quick?

522
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never use that.

523
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:52,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never.

524
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it a great demo thing to show off your console to your friends?

525
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, look at this space minority report technology.

526
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:01,344
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun for like five minutes.

527
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:04,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Commanding your troops or whatever to do different things.

528
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:04,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

529
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:05,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that was like...

530
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:07,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Part, yeah, I could see that.

531
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:13,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, doing the actual dialogue trees and stuff, I have a directional pad right in my thumb.

532
00:33:13,312 --> 00:33:15,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I need to even bother with this bullshit?

533
00:33:17,743 --> 00:33:20,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Wars The Old Republic What was up with that guy?

534
00:33:20,184 --> 00:33:23,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Caffeine by the way, when you actually go to a show and see Mr. Caffeine in person, he's amazing.

535
00:33:43,497 --> 00:34:05,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Far Cry 3 was the only game I'd really seen and I was like there was part of the dialogue to me felt like it was trying to be too edgy I was like this game is fucking edgy when it showed the dude doing the stealth kills where he like walked up behind the guy pulled the knife out of the guy's pocket and stabbed him with it a little part of me my heart grew three sizes the game parts were cool I mean I'm not gonna play it but man

536
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:07,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the fact that you don't have malaria

537
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:26,362
[SPEAKER_10]: I am here, what's up guys?

538
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:27,543
[SPEAKER_10]: How's the weather in L.A.? ?

539
00:34:56,703 --> 00:35:00,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, not as warm as it is in Atlanta right now.

540
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,248
[SPEAKER_10]: What an interesting change of pace.

541
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:03,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been raining up here.

542
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:04,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, forget the weather.

543
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:05,650
[SPEAKER_10]: E3.

544
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,612
[SPEAKER_10]: How did day one treat you?

545
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:10,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my feet hurt.

546
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:11,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

547
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a lot of standing around.

548
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:15,538
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a lot of standing around.

549
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:18,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because you waited all day today to play Wii U, didn't you?

550
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:22,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was about two hours before I got in there.

551
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:25,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I had about an hour and a half.

552
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:27,744
[SPEAKER_05]: to kind of go through their eight demos.

553
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:31,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Two hours actually isn't that bad, all things considered.

554
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:36,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they have entertainment in the Wii line this year, or Wii U, excuse me, line to keep you going?

555
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:42,956
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and actually, when I walked up to it, it was about two o'clock, and the show floor closes at six.

556
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:49,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And I walked up at two, and there was a lady at the end, there was the sign that said, line closed.

557
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, is it already full?

558
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:53,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, well...

559
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:55,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've cut off the line.

560
00:35:56,561 --> 00:36:02,573
[SPEAKER_05]: You're more than welcome to stay in here, but realize you may not get up to the front, and you may waste the rest of your day here.

561
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:03,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, okay.

562
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:04,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh wow.

563
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:11,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got up there and it wound up two hours later, you know, four o'clock, I'm starting to play with the Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii U. That's not that bad.

564
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they were just trying to scare people away.

565
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:23,421
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not that bad, all things considered, because the lines in the past, like the 3DS line was atrocious last year, and then of course the original Wii line, we all saw those videos on the internet of just the line keeps going and going and going.

566
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:24,682
[SPEAKER_10]: That line was awesome.

567
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:33,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow, we'll get to Nintendo in a minute, but let's start by talking about Sony, because Sony happened yesterday, and you were there at the press conference, right Bobby?

568
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:35,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

569
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: So, how was it?

570
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:40,155
[SPEAKER_10]: You got, like, right in the front, practically, didn't you?

571
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:44,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was kind of funny because I got there a little late.

572
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:50,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I took the shuttle from my hotel at, like, and it started at 5, and so I got on the bus at about 4, 4.05.

573
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:52,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And in L.A.

574
00:36:52,779 --> 00:37:00,582
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic, it was, like, 4.55 when we finally pulled up to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is on USC campus.

575
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:01,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

576
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,542
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally pull up and I'm like watching everybody and we can't get off the bus.

577
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:09,804
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes us like 15 minutes just to get around the corner into the parking lot.

578
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're all like kind of walking in and stuff.

579
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:18,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed all the food in the beginning and all that stuff because I was hungry because I hadn't eaten since Atlanta that morning.

580
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:24,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And I made it all the way... You guys still there?

581
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:25,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're here.

582
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:27,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

583
00:37:27,674 --> 00:37:29,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Something cut off on my phone.

584
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:29,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

585
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:39,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was walking in, running in, and before I went through the door, there was a guy saying, hey, there's more seats if you go down this ramp to the VIP area.

586
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, okay, I'll go down that ramp.

587
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:54,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we went down that ramp, and it went underneath, and we were on the floor area, and people were just directing us, and they pointed to these seats, like folding chairs on the floor, and

588
00:37:54,842 --> 00:38:23,142
[SPEAKER_05]: right in front of the stage and there were like a lot of Sony employees sitting there and so I was sitting there with them and then all the Sony employees got kicked out and more people came in and I realized everybody else that was sitting around me like Michael Pachter and them all had these red VIP lanyards and I didn't have one of those so I was kind of like covering up my shirt or something so it looked like I had a lanyard and they never noticed you were just in the right place at the right time

589
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:26,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time the camera was on me, I was tweaking.

590
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

591
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:51,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk a little bit about what happened at the Sony press conference.

592
00:38:52,116 --> 00:39:08,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, we're going to get to Taboo when we come back with the Orange Launch Radio next Sunday, the regular episodes, but I lost a point in Taboo because Sony just opened right off the bat with somewhat of an apology, and one that it seems like most people accepted.

593
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:10,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki?

594
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:11,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's shaking his head a little bit.

595
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It was retarded.

596
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:12,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

597
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:17,332
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, we learned a valuable lesson with this PlayStation Outage set.

598
00:39:18,253 --> 00:39:20,535
[SPEAKER_09]: We realized how much you like playing online.

599
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:21,956
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all they fucking learned.

600
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,598
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all they learned.

601
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:28,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not like, oh, hey, we're sorry that your credit card information was compromised.

602
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:28,483
[SPEAKER_09]: It was...

603
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you guys like playing online.

604
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to focus more on online play.

605
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask the chat room how they feel about it.

606
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:38,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat room at chat.orange.com.

607
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you satisfied with Sony's apology?

608
00:39:40,202 --> 00:39:40,722
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

609
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, how did that go over in the crowd there and with you?

610
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:50,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first off, it was kind of interesting because you notice he never said they got hacked.

611
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:51,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

612
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:52,169
[SPEAKER_05]: They called it an outage.

613
00:39:52,469 --> 00:39:52,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

614
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,331
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't say why it was an outage.

615
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:54,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

616
00:39:55,464 --> 00:40:07,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of people around us, and you gotta realize since I'm in the VIP section, I'm around people who've been in the industry 20 years and all that stuff, and they kind of were more understanding than the people that were probably up in the normal seats and people at home.

617
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:17,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were like, okay, he did mention it, and Jack, he always, he does really good on stage.

618
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:24,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every year, you know, because he always goes up there and something is like bad press for Sony whenever he walks up at E3.

619
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,624
[SPEAKER_05]: and he and his script writers handle it really well.

620
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:34,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That was scripted because I can see the teleprompters from where I was.

621
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:38,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew how much of the entire press conference was actually scripted.

622
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:51,674
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a good job and it stopped people from heckling him because that was one of the things somebody asked me on Twitter is how many people were going to interrupt the conference yelling about the PSN hack and nobody did.

623
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:56,582
[SPEAKER_05]: because they addressed it right in the beginning and said, hey, here's the elephant in the room.

624
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:57,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

625
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:58,203
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sorry.

626
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to some comments from our chat room at chat.orange.com.

627
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma in the chat room says, that was not an apology.

628
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:07,366
[SPEAKER_10]: That was more of a thank you for the fans for sticking out.

629
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:08,406
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good way of putting it.

630
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:09,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

631
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:10,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Technus says, yeah, it was okay.

632
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:12,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It was mainly a canned response.

633
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:15,148
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, better him than Kazurai.

634
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Techie Q says, where was Kevin Butler?

635
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

636
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:20,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Good question.

637
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you spot Kevin Butler there?

638
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:25,610
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I did not spot Kevin Butler.

639
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:32,495
[SPEAKER_05]: He was there last year, but I think they're like, okay, we did that joke, and now we can move on.

640
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:37,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had to say, though, that it really did sound quite a bit more sincere than the other canned stuff we had before.

641
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:53,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was one of those things where it could have been a lot worse.

642
00:41:54,793 --> 00:42:11,703
[SPEAKER_10]: But seeing as most of the Twittersphere at the end of the day seems to be dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, again, I'm making broad generalizations, but most of the Twitter that I'm looking at is dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, but is kind of praising Sony, I would say, distraction successful.

643
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Sony... That was a distraction event.

644
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:15,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

645
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,867
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's exactly what their PR needed.

646
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:32,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of audience reaction, Bobby, since you were there, how was it when you, in the theater, when it was announced that the PlayStation Vita is going to be exclusive 3G on AT&T?

647
00:42:32,921 --> 00:42:35,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I can tell you, we heard it pretty clear.

648
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:36,882
[SPEAKER_10]: How bad was it where you were?

649
00:42:37,102 --> 00:42:38,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it really a lot of groans?

650
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:46,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't loud, but I mean, I heard like all the laughter of, yeah, we figured it, and all the groans.

651
00:42:47,193 --> 00:43:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: and we could even see Kaz was kind of like not expecting that I think if he had said the word Verizon instead it would have been a much different reaction but no it was very that was the one negative part of their press conference was that yeah I thought he didn't present it very well because honestly enough I was in the chat I was watching online and so I was watching the people chatting in the sidebar and those people are absolute blithering idiots but they were just like does that mean I can only get it through AT&T

652
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, oh my god.

653
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, just die.

654
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:23,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it just struck me as interesting because I feel like he started to say something else.

655
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:27,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that deal had just been sealed within the past 48 hours.

656
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,533
[SPEAKER_10]: He wasn't quite prepared to say that.

657
00:43:31,473 --> 00:43:32,714
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it came across to me.

658
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:33,875
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what E3 is all about.

659
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I have AT&T on my iPhone.

660
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:37,637
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm one of those people that's like, whatever.

661
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:38,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping there's a deal.

662
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:42,900
[SPEAKER_06]: As we have iPhone plans, that doesn't mean that we get on for free.

663
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:48,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying a 3G PS Vita, Velveeta, whatever.

664
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:48,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that.

665
00:43:48,743 --> 00:43:54,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Just tether to your iPhone or tether to whatever.

666
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:56,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's talk about the Vita.

667
00:43:57,475 --> 00:44:00,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, I'll let you start it off since you were there.

668
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,318
[SPEAKER_10]: What was kind of the reaction to the Vita that you saw?

669
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,078
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you observe?

670
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:13,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that were around me, they're like, okay, why are they saying that this is the first time we've ever had augmented reality on a handheld because of the cameras?

671
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:19,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are they saying that this is the first time you've been able to do such and such when they're listing features of the 3DS?

672
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:23,349
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of people are saying, okay,

673
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see why they're doing it.

674
00:44:27,023 --> 00:44:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's priced too high.

675
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:35,106
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also not the first time they've done it on a PlayStation Portable.

676
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:43,949
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the camera for their stupid iPad game and also for the Invisimals and stuff like that.

677
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:49,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, interesting because a lot of the folks I was seeing online were really happy with that price point saying, oh,

678
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:54,155
[SPEAKER_10]: and here's one of the things that somebody said was that if it had HDMI output sold interesting what about that whole go ahead

679
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:19,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not get to play the Vita.

680
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:26,713
[SPEAKER_05]: They had it there, but it was a long-ass line, and I decided that taking part in their distraction booze was more important.

681
00:45:27,593 --> 00:45:30,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't been able to play the Vita yet, but they did have it there.

682
00:45:31,188 --> 00:45:35,152
[SPEAKER_05]: but nobody I knew had stood in the line because, like I said, there was distraction booze.

683
00:45:35,492 --> 00:45:37,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

684
00:45:38,494 --> 00:45:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: You were kind of talking about the whole HDMI out and all that.

685
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:51,705
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the games, and I'm sure this was the one that caught most people's attention, was The Ruin, the dungeon crawler, where they were playing it on the PSP and then did the trans-farring...

686
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:52,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

687
00:45:52,746 --> 00:45:57,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and the question that I have about that is, do you have to be a PlayStation Plus member for the cloud savings?

688
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:15,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think so, yes, but obviously those are the details they want to leave out.

689
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:17,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to some of the immediate chat comments about the Vita.

690
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:23,792
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says, I gotta admit, the PS Vita for $249.99 is a pretty good price given all the tech that's in it.

691
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:28,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Savalas in our chatroom says, does my new Vita have a firewall to protect me from hacks?

692
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:32,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Janai says, I will buy one, but it will feel like an updated PSP.

693
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,264
[SPEAKER_10]: FrisbeeU says, nope, price is okay, but doesn't have any good games.

694
00:46:38,724 --> 00:46:40,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Zappy says, I need a Vita.

695
00:46:41,307 --> 00:46:45,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Uncharted, Wipeout, Little Deviants, and LittleBigPlanet look great.

696
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, TigerClaw said something here, and I want to kind of point this out.

697
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:54,657
[SPEAKER_05]: He said the PS Vita produced PS3 quality graphics.

698
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: That is incorrect.

699
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:02,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It is comparable to the PS3 because the Vita has a smaller resolution.

700
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could not do 1080p PS3 quality graphics.

701
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because of the resolution of the screen is not 1080p.

702
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:21,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It's able, and it's also the screen is smaller, it's able to get away with making something that is comparable to the PS3, but it is not exact to the PS3.

703
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:24,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Hence why maybe the HDMI output may not be such a good idea.

704
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:26,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It may kind of ruin the quality.

705
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:27,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

706
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:27,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

707
00:47:27,871 --> 00:47:28,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

708
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,699
[SPEAKER_10]: It went over well.

709
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:01,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody liked that.

710
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people around me are like, why are they... Because the people that were around me in the VIP section, they're older than me.

711
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, God, do we really need more 3D?

712
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:15,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they pushing the 3D stuff on me?

713
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of mixed in my area.

714
00:48:19,626 --> 00:48:22,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it got more pop up in the seats.

715
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:52,394
[SPEAKER_05]: but what's interesting is that they had Ken Levine come out to talk about him doing the Vita and they did not show Ratchet and Clank which they had back there and they didn't show Twisted Metal which they had playable on that floor at the end and so they left some of those out the only game I played after that was LittleBigPlanet 2 with the move support oh what did you think?

716
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,620
[SPEAKER_05]: They did kind of what we expected.

717
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Sackboy's prehistoric move.

718
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: They did something a little different.

719
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:04,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to play some of the story levels in one of their minigames.

720
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main tool that they give you is I think it's like the Braininator or something.

721
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:12,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's where you actually move things.

722
00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:17,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're still playing a little bit exactly the way that you're used to with the buttons and the sticks and everything.

723
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just moving things around and bouncing yourself off with some of these

724
00:49:24,056 --> 00:49:51,446
[SPEAKER_05]: and they did a really good job with it and then they've got a mini game that they had me play where it's one of those like it's kind of like cut the rope a little bit where there's a ball at the top and you're trying to get it to the end but you have to place things and then when you release the ball it kind of goes through this Rube Goldberg machine that you've created and that was kind of neat so this is something that's going to be like free patch free upgrade for LittleBigPlanet 2 right?

725
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:53,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe so.

726
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,301
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not something I'm going to have to buy separately.

727
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:59,663
[SPEAKER_05]: They better, because on the box of LittleBigPlanet 2 it says better with PlayStation Move.

728
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:04,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the Move logo, but it's not part of the game right now.

729
00:50:04,366 --> 00:50:12,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that'd be kind of stupid if they put that on the box and said, oh, but you've got to pay extra to get that part that's in the blue sticker on the front of the box.

730
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:13,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just better if you own it.

731
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:15,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It just makes you feel good.

732
00:50:16,038 --> 00:50:16,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Jeremy.

733
00:50:16,418 --> 00:50:16,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Jeremy.

734
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:49,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that the same guy that showed out the stupid medieval tech demo last time when they were first showing off the move stuff?

735
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: The medieval tech demo last time was the sports champions thing, I think.

736
00:50:56,365 --> 00:50:57,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

737
00:50:57,406 --> 00:50:58,907
[SPEAKER_10]: There was another move being shown.

738
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:18,441
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

739
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Kobe Bryant came out and sucked at it.

740
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:22,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just about to say that.

741
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:26,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the other big guest that was at Sony's press conference was the Kobe Bryant moment.

742
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:28,844
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tweeted you and I'm like, quick, throw your shoe.

743
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I like my shoe too much.

744
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:35,146
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of reaction did Kobe get from the crowd?

745
00:51:35,766 --> 00:51:37,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sounded very mixed.

746
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:40,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, I mean, he got some pops.

747
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:47,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, when he kind of made jokes about himself or something, that got some reactions, but

748
00:51:51,923 --> 00:51:56,946
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a pretty resounding endorsement by him as well.

749
00:51:56,986 --> 00:52:04,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm sure he gets paid handsomely to say it, but still, you know, you couldn't help but feel the little punch in the gut to EA after what happened to them last year.

750
00:52:05,352 --> 00:52:05,452
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

751
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:07,553
[SPEAKER_10]: HGMI Cable, $499

752
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,160
[SPEAKER_10]: 3D Monitor.

753
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,661
[SPEAKER_10]: 3D Monitor.

754
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so it won't actually get TV signal.

755
00:52:43,402 --> 00:52:45,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it probably doesn't have an antenna built in.

756
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and it's probably going to be sized like your computer monitor.

757
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:51,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know if they said what size it would be.

758
00:52:51,845 --> 00:52:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: 24-inch.

759
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:53,725
[SPEAKER_10]: 24, so you're right on the money.

760
00:52:54,185 --> 00:52:55,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 24-inch.

761
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:57,146
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's not really TV.

762
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:58,126
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a monitor.

763
00:52:58,386 --> 00:53:01,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I want to just mention something because I know I'm going to go back.

764
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm watching chat, too.

765
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

766
00:53:03,048 --> 00:53:03,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Randy, you...

767
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:04,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

768
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:21,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too, because that means traffic on Thursday won't be as bad as it was the year before.

769
00:53:21,337 --> 00:53:29,344
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was interesting the way he marketed it when he was mentioning the new monitor.

770
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:31,426
[SPEAKER_10]: It's perfect for a dorm room.

771
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:37,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that right there was a huge, like, we know exactly who needs this and who our audience is for this.

772
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:38,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that was right on the money.

773
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:43,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's going to cause this thing to get on a lot of college wish lists this year.

774
00:53:46,764 --> 00:53:49,165
[SPEAKER_10]: except for me except for you, not interested?

775
00:53:49,545 --> 00:54:12,755
[SPEAKER_05]: oh yeah, because you don't do 3D I can't see the 3D and actually, it screwed me up because I was so close and at an angle and I put those glasses on because they were showing a lot of us a lot of trailers in 3D it was actually messing me up because I usually if I'm looking straight at it it's fine, it's just a darker 2D except for maybe some things at the edges

776
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,921
[SPEAKER_05]: but being at that angle, it sucked.

777
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:40,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Now one thing that they said they were going to do with the 3D technology, this is the stuff with the technology that I really am looking forward to and I would actually be confused, is because they do the shutter technology, they have, you know, they've actually implemented, and I don't know if they're showing it here or not, where, you know, instead of having each eye shutter differently, they have each pair of glasses shuttered differently,

778
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:46,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually have two different screens or people seeing two different images on screen.

779
00:54:46,757 --> 00:54:47,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.

780
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too and very wave of the future.

781
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Very much so.

782
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:57,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get to Nintendo here in a minute, but a couple of things I've got to mention out of the Sony press conference.

783
00:54:57,641 --> 00:55:06,004
[SPEAKER_10]: We won't have time to hit everything, but DarkSakura, I know you had been looking at Star Trek The Game and some of the announcements that were made around that.

784
00:55:06,044 --> 00:55:09,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear about the PlayStation Move that's going to look like a phaser?

785
00:55:09,145 --> 00:55:09,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

786
00:55:10,197 --> 00:55:14,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get an appointment to see the game I hope so too I want to count the lens flares

787
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,958
[SPEAKER_08]: But with anything that new, I'm going to keep my judgment reserved.

788
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:43,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can count that high.

789
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,025
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, they are investing a lot into this because it wasn't just this official game, but I guess a PSN precursor.

790
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:55,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess what comes to mind, Dead Rising 2K0-esque thing for the Star Wars game.

791
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:57,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, excuse me, Star Trek game is supposed to be there as well.

792
00:55:59,032 --> 00:56:01,654
[SPEAKER_10]: More information next year, a little closer to the movie's launch, I'm sure.

793
00:56:02,094 --> 00:56:10,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I gotta let you have a moment because they did mention at the PlayStation 3 conference exclusives coming to Saints Row the 3rd and I know you've gotta have an opinion on that game

794
00:56:10,362 --> 00:56:13,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really care about the exclusives that they have coming to that.

795
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:14,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still getting it on 360.

796
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:15,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

797
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:16,483
[SPEAKER_10]: But what about the game itself?

798
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:18,304
[SPEAKER_09]: The game looks fucking amazing.

799
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:25,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some gameplay footage they had during an interview prior to one of the conferences.

800
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:31,566
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the guy just doing rustling moves on random pedestrians.

801
00:56:32,286 --> 00:56:36,167
[SPEAKER_09]: They even showed the giant purple dildo weapon and stuff like that.

802
00:56:36,767 --> 00:56:37,247
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
00:56:58,653 --> 00:56:59,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.

804
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, I approve of that approach.

805
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know what?

806
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:03,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Go big.

807
00:57:03,576 --> 00:57:04,977
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, too.

808
00:57:05,097 --> 00:57:07,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I watched this morning the trailer.

809
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,084
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a new trailer out there for Postal 3, and I gotta tell you, it looks like shit.

810
00:57:14,704 --> 00:57:16,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're like, oh, look how edgy we are.

811
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:17,646
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm sorry.

812
00:57:17,706 --> 00:57:19,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Saints Row 3 blows that shit away.

813
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:24,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, who gives a fuck that you have, you know, a guy dressed up like a nutsack?

814
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:24,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

815
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:25,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

816
00:57:25,771 --> 00:57:30,073
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a weapon that's a giant purple penis that you can hit people with in Saints Row 3.

817
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:34,074
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to do edgy, you're going to have to make a game based on the Human Centipede Part 2.

818
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:40,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much room we have for masturbating with barbed wire.

819
00:57:40,956 --> 00:57:46,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, did you see on the PS Vita, and Dan, I know you are a fighting game fan.

820
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:46,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on.

821
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to interject on the Saints Row thing real quick.

822
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen it yet.

823
00:57:52,824 --> 00:57:56,388
[SPEAKER_05]: They have done the most genius marketing here at E3.

824
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:57,769
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

825
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:08,358
[SPEAKER_05]: They bought or rented out for the week that parking lot across the street from Staples Center and offered free parking to all E3 attendees that get in there.

826
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:12,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have bikini models at the entrance trying to direct people in.

827
00:58:13,322 --> 00:58:14,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got tents in there.

828
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:16,865
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got it all decked out in Saints Row.

829
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:19,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

830
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I know where we're going Thursday.

831
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:22,391
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt.

832
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:24,812
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

833
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:27,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, I know you're a fighting game fan.

834
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:30,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie's giving her husband a stare down.

835
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:31,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, come on.

836
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:32,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you want to see.

837
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,856
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is radio, so no one can see that.

838
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:37,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, even you have to admit, boobies.

839
00:58:39,673 --> 00:58:40,273
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

840
00:59:05,706 --> 00:59:06,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 2D fighter?

841
00:59:06,808 --> 00:59:08,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Made out of a 3D fighter?

842
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,152
[SPEAKER_06]: That got very little reaction.

843
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:29,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the thing was it was weird to me because as much as I like that idea of Street Fighter X Tekken, then they announce, okay, so it's Street Fighter World and Tekken World collides, and then we're going to throw in Cole from Infamous.

844
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:32,328
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, what does he have to do with anything?

845
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Namco likes throwing in random characters.

846
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:40,831
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, if we're going to put our Tekken franchise on the line here, we've got to have random people who have nothing to do with the universe in it.

847
00:59:41,591 --> 00:59:44,132
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't have Darth Vader, so here's Cole.

848
00:59:45,396 --> 00:59:46,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

849
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

850
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:36,603
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have shit.

851
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I can make it all the way through Tekken Street Mode with Gon.

852
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:43,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we gotta get to the next press conference this morning.

853
01:00:43,826 --> 01:00:44,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo.

854
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about Nintendo for a little bit.

855
01:00:46,588 --> 01:00:50,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna leave the room so that I can actually hear Loki without going deaf.

856
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,190
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that, Bobby?

857
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:53,967
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want me to talk about Jane's Addiction?

858
01:00:54,627 --> 01:00:55,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah!

859
01:00:56,468 --> 01:01:02,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally forgot to ask Bobby about what happened behind the scenes at the Sony press conference before we get to Nintendo.

860
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,372
[SPEAKER_10]: When we're watching at home, it cuts out at the end, but you were there for what?

861
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Like two and a half more hours, right?

862
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it ended at ten.

863
01:01:10,674 --> 01:01:10,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

864
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:12,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So what was happening?

865
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:18,657
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the press conference, the entire stage went away and that's where all their demo kiosks were.

866
01:01:19,238 --> 01:01:29,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And they brought food, lots of food, like grilled cheese sandwiches and pasta salad and cookies and cupcakes and other, like, it was great.

867
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:32,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And then beer and alcohol flowing open bar.

868
01:01:32,865 --> 01:01:34,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at 9 o'clock, James Addiction comes on.

869
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:39,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, I'm like, okay, I saw them in Activision last year, so I'm good.

870
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:41,470
[SPEAKER_05]: But they came out and did an hour set.

871
01:01:43,027 --> 01:01:46,748
[SPEAKER_10]: and for no particular reason then, hey, we got Jane's Addiction because we're so many.

872
01:01:46,768 --> 01:01:48,028
[SPEAKER_08]: They better did Bin Cut Ceiling.

873
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they had Mix Master Mike there too.

874
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I love him too.

875
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:53,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

876
01:01:54,190 --> 01:02:04,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be like him, like they were like just, they had all their trailers of their games but like it was messing with the color and everything and that was kind of the visuals around.

877
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:11,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also like had all these like scantily clad women like on top of the stages, areas that were like

878
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:23,512
[SPEAKER_05]: still doing like doing slow dances and stuff and it was to the techno music and it was kind of weird because we're sitting there playing video games while there's like a hot chick above us like kind of doing a pole game.

879
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:28,594
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess they knew their audience.

880
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:29,214
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

881
01:02:29,594 --> 01:02:31,294
[SPEAKER_10]: So and how many Sony beers did you have again?

882
01:02:33,315 --> 01:02:33,495
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

883
01:02:33,635 --> 01:02:35,116
[SPEAKER_10]: How many Sony beers did you have again?

884
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly because they had crappy beers only one.

885
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:41,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is the night that I'm going to have way too many beers.

886
01:02:42,363 --> 01:02:44,545
[SPEAKER_10]: They had crappy beer?

887
01:02:44,585 --> 01:02:45,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry.

888
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:49,670
[SPEAKER_10]: We gotta get through Nintendo's press conference so that Bobby can get to the beer drinking.

889
01:02:50,591 --> 01:02:51,211
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

890
01:02:51,371 --> 01:02:54,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, with all due respect, I gotta let Loki kick this one off.

891
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:59,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Loki, why don't you give us a little report on Nintendo's press conference?

892
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:08,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nintendo came out and basically showed off some of their 3DS stuff and no one cared.

893
01:03:10,229 --> 01:03:15,194
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they started off actually by talking about the Zelda 25th Anniversary Edition.

894
01:03:15,594 --> 01:03:16,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was awesome.

895
01:03:17,023 --> 01:03:41,856
[SPEAKER_09]: which you know they had like an orchestra they had an orchestra they had Miyamoto out there and my Zelda fanboy Saul was like yes it was beautiful and then they were talking about how they're kind of celebrating on all the different platforms for the 3DS of course you had you know the Game Boy Color Zelda game that's available for download on there it's gonna be the first one the Game Boy Color Virtual Console I bought it

896
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:44,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Sucker!

897
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:54,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for the Nintendo Wii, obviously, Skyward Sword is going to be available later this year.

898
01:03:54,917 --> 01:04:04,281
[SPEAKER_09]: For the DSiWare, which I'm assuming also means the 3DS as well, they're going to have Zelda The Four Swords Adventure as a free download, which is kind of cool.

899
01:04:05,601 --> 01:04:07,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad it's not playable by itself, though.

900
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:09,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

901
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:30,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, they're also going to do some sort of pre-order bonus for the 3DS with Ocarina that you're going to be able to get a music CD with the soundtrack from the game for if you register the game quite early on the Nintendo Club thing.

902
01:04:32,017 --> 01:04:34,639
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, they're going to do some sort of orchestra...

903
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:39,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Live shows and stuff like that with the Zelda music.

904
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:41,502
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be all over the world.

905
01:04:43,402 --> 01:04:47,703
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have a CD for that that's going to be available with the Skyward Sword game.

906
01:04:48,963 --> 01:04:52,544
[SPEAKER_09]: And then 3DS stuff, they showed off the new Mario game, which looks kind of cool.

907
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:57,485
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like a cross between Mario Galaxy and Mario 64, which is not bad.

908
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:01,346
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Star Fox, they showed a little bit of that.

909
01:05:01,786 --> 01:05:03,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just souped up Star Fox 64.

910
01:05:03,306 --> 01:05:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

911
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Luigi's Mansion 2

912
01:05:29,032 --> 01:05:29,392
[SPEAKER_08]: It was cute.

913
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:30,313
[SPEAKER_08]: It has its fans.

914
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:37,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the best part of it was when you went into the attic, and then the lightning would flash, and then his shadow would be hanging by a noose.

915
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:42,041
[SPEAKER_10]: So, and then, okay, so they do the Kid Icarus and all these 3DS games.

916
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:44,803
[SPEAKER_09]: The Kid Icarus, and then Mario Kart, what the fuck's up with Mario Kart, okay?

917
01:05:45,123 --> 01:05:51,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Kart, now with, you know, monster trucks and, you know, hang gliders, and that's innovative.

918
01:05:52,987 --> 01:05:55,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're like, you've never raced this game before.

919
01:05:55,932 --> 01:06:00,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the first few tracks that they were showing were all tracks from other games.

920
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, actually, yes, I have raced every single one of those.

921
01:06:06,977 --> 01:06:09,939
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

922
01:06:31,176 --> 01:06:58,950
[SPEAKER_09]: and then they go to say hey what are we calling this thing uh well you know how everybody hated the name Wii but then they eventually got used to it and stuff we got another one for you Wii U what I like seriously they said Wii U is the name of that I was like my brain hurts for how stupid this is but you know people will get used to it they can still change their mind

923
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:04,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan and I were saying before the show, what if they just called it the Nintendo U?

924
01:07:05,129 --> 01:07:08,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would have been like U as in Ultra IDK.

925
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:10,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Nintendo U would have been fine.

926
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:11,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the problem.

927
01:07:11,354 --> 01:07:15,337
[SPEAKER_09]: They have to do Wii because people are fucking stupid and they're not going to understand.

928
01:07:15,777 --> 01:07:17,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I can use my Wii stuff.

929
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:20,141
[SPEAKER_09]: See, then they know that they can use their Wii stuff with it.

930
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:21,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

931
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:29,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The big problem is already everyone's kind of half assuming, I thought it was a new system, not just a new controller.

932
01:07:30,888 --> 01:07:31,669
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a new system.

933
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:32,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a new system.

934
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,971
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't know that.

935
01:07:34,011 --> 01:07:37,835
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like, oh, I just use it with my existing Wii.

936
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:43,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Bobby is dying to jump in here in a minute here, but let me let Loki wrap up here.

937
01:07:45,262 --> 01:07:47,124
[SPEAKER_10]: What other impressions did Wii U leave you with?

938
01:07:48,218 --> 01:07:54,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's a neat piece of hardware, but it's just, it just seems so gimmicky to me.

939
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, how expensive is it?

940
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:03,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of the graphics, like their little tech demo pre-rendered thing look kind of cool, you know, what it does.

941
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:06,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But the whole conference, they didn't fucking announce anything.

942
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:09,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, they hinted that Smash Bros.

943
01:08:09,104 --> 01:08:12,785
[SPEAKER_09]: is coming to, you know, the Wii U and 3DS.

944
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:16,726
[SPEAKER_09]: They hinted at that, and then they said, oh, but that's going to be, you know, a while down.

945
01:08:16,946 --> 01:08:19,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just like they hinted at Pikmin coming out.

946
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:20,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And how long has that been?

947
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:22,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, it's still not out yet.

948
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:24,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, Smash Bros.

949
01:08:24,672 --> 01:08:28,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's get them all excited and promise this game that's not going to come out for two years.

950
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:36,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Wii U. And I'm sorry, it's just like the tech demos they showed off.

951
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:45,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh hey, look, I can play Wii Sports Golf and I can put this controller on the ground and make it so I can see a ball there and stuff.

952
01:08:45,836 --> 01:08:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Bobby's been waiting patiently.

953
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:53,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, what do you think about them showing just a controller and not really showing the specs of the console off?

954
01:08:55,284 --> 01:08:57,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo.

955
01:08:58,366 --> 01:08:58,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

956
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Gunpow entered the pit.

957
01:09:01,469 --> 01:09:02,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a fire truck driving by?

958
01:09:05,712 --> 01:09:09,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, first I want to jump in because we started with the 3DS stuff.

959
01:09:09,915 --> 01:09:10,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, go ahead.

960
01:09:11,801 --> 01:09:16,122
[SPEAKER_05]: and I do want to mention that I have like 100 Street Pass me's now.

961
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:17,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like awesome.

962
01:09:17,182 --> 01:09:20,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I've almost got like all the puzzle pieces of all puzzles.

963
01:09:22,063 --> 01:09:30,044
[SPEAKER_05]: But I played Mario Kart 3DS because they had a couple of games out in tents and stuff.

964
01:09:30,384 --> 01:09:33,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually did play it and I enjoyed it.

965
01:09:33,225 --> 01:09:34,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Mario Kart.

966
01:09:34,225 --> 01:09:39,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean all did the same tricks on how to boost around corners and stuff is still there.

967
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff, but to me it was Mario Kart meets Diddy Kong Racing.

968
01:09:44,539 --> 01:09:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: How so?

969
01:09:46,781 --> 01:10:01,690
[SPEAKER_05]: With all the different ways that you could, you know, like either you would be a plane or you'd go underwater which they didn't really do underwater in Diddy Kong Racing, but like with the planes and stuff and monster trucks and having the different types of vehicles and stuff.

970
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:07,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of what it reminded me of, but it was still Mario Kart and, you know, it's

971
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:10,623
[SPEAKER_05]: For fans of Mario Kart, they'll love it.

972
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Do people really give a shit about more vehicle types?

973
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:31,677
[SPEAKER_09]: What they want you to do is they want you to come up with some new tracks and stop fucking repeating tracks from every goddamn game that you've already released.

974
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:38,002
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be nice to hear just a tinge about the online capability because 3DS already has better online than the Wii.

975
01:10:38,282 --> 01:10:40,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to hear more about that.

976
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:40,804
[SPEAKER_10]: But Bobby?

977
01:10:42,825 --> 01:10:52,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the tracks that they had in the demo that I played, you know, because the ones like that went underwater, you know, and there is, you know, different physics underwater.

978
01:10:53,388 --> 01:10:58,210
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, gliding through the air and having to determine where you're going to glide and when you're going to go up and down.

979
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, the demo had new tracks.

980
01:11:01,892 --> 01:11:04,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recognize any of the tracks that were in the demo.

981
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:11,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the trailer probably showed tracks that you might have seen, you know, segments of tracks that you've seen before.

982
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:16,659
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, like, yeah, there's a track that looks like the Donkey Kong tracks from the N64.

983
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:18,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not the same layout.

984
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:19,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has the same scenery.

985
01:11:21,997 --> 01:11:26,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't write it off based on the three second snippets in the trailers.

986
01:11:27,299 --> 01:11:30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it does, it changes enough.

987
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, yes, it's still Mario Kart, and yes, it's still, you know, not new but fun, maybe.

988
01:11:35,682 --> 01:11:36,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

989
01:11:36,343 --> 01:11:39,944
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, a lot of people are like, what's wrong with more of what I liked?

990
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:43,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like how they thought it was necessary to put motorcycles in the Wii version.

991
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gives a shit?

992
01:11:45,186 --> 01:11:46,107
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a kart racing game.

993
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,347
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need fucking motorcycles.

994
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:49,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now let's put monster trucks in there.

995
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:50,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Excite Boats

996
01:12:08,675 --> 01:12:10,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me throw out this question for the chat room.

997
01:12:10,596 --> 01:12:16,837
[SPEAKER_10]: For all you folks in chat who do not currently own a 3DS, are you interested in 3DS now?

998
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:18,498
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed more titles.

999
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:22,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was interesting, and that's the question I've got for our chat, chat.orange.radio.com.

1000
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:24,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you interested in a 3DS now?

1001
01:12:24,499 --> 01:12:29,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I thought it was interesting because leading into that, Reggie just showed why he was Reggie.

1002
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:33,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said something, and Bobby, maybe you can help fill me in here.

1003
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:34,662
[SPEAKER_10]: He said something like,

1004
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:39,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you want to see the same old stuff again, but you want to see innovation.

1005
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:43,126
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes kind of like, conflict?

1006
01:12:43,346 --> 01:12:44,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine, we can handle that.

1007
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our industry.

1008
01:12:45,547 --> 01:12:46,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you go.

1009
01:12:46,568 --> 01:12:47,868
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fucking Nintendo.

1010
01:12:49,149 --> 01:12:49,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Suck it down.

1011
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, let's see innovation.

1012
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:53,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And you will like it.

1013
01:12:54,132 --> 01:12:55,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk innovation, Nintendo.

1014
01:12:56,553 --> 01:12:57,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start off.

1015
01:12:57,393 --> 01:13:00,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Innovation is deeper and wider.

1016
01:13:00,455 --> 01:13:01,375
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what she said.

1017
01:13:02,436 --> 01:13:03,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah, wah.

1018
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:04,177
[SPEAKER_09]: No, um...

1019
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:07,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk innovation here, Nintendo.

1020
01:13:07,685 --> 01:13:08,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing.

1021
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can sit on park benches and go swimming.

1022
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:13,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same fucking game still!

1023
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:15,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Same damn game.

1024
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:16,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Same everything.

1025
01:13:16,432 --> 01:13:17,533
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the same patterns.

1026
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:18,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I even saw the screenshots.

1027
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:26,260
[SPEAKER_09]: The same fucking patterns that have been in that game since it first came out on the goddamn GameCube are in this stupid game.

1028
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it came out on Nintendo 64.

1029
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:27,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1030
01:13:28,562 --> 01:13:32,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but over here... For God's sakes, it's fucking Animal Crossing.

1031
01:13:32,363 --> 01:13:33,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

1032
01:13:33,724 --> 01:13:34,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I care, because you know what?

1033
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:39,026
[SPEAKER_09]: They get away with this shit with every goddamn franchise that they have, because their fans love it.

1034
01:13:39,266 --> 01:13:39,746
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1035
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:41,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking Smash Bros.

1036
01:13:41,047 --> 01:13:41,587
[SPEAKER_09]: is coming out.

1037
01:13:41,787 --> 01:13:44,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you it's going to be all the fucking same characters again.

1038
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:47,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, they're just going to port that shit from the Wii, is what's going to end up happening.

1039
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's what makes it a franchise.

1040
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:50,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura.

1041
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:51,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I want it.

1042
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the Smash Brothers 2.

1043
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:55,732
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I meant Animal Crossing.

1044
01:13:56,112 --> 01:14:00,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I was officially going to start playing my GBA one again.

1045
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:03,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I have to ask you, as a follow-up, why?

1046
01:14:03,954 --> 01:14:05,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I watched the anime last night.

1047
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:06,695
[SPEAKER_08]: The other night.

1048
01:14:07,195 --> 01:14:10,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was super cute, and I was like, I remember this in the game.

1049
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:12,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that in the game.

1050
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:13,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss playing it.

1051
01:14:13,457 --> 01:14:14,257
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask Dan.

1052
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: He was here the whole time.

1053
01:14:15,798 --> 01:14:19,219
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as they took out Unlockable Nest games, fuck that franchise.

1054
01:14:19,499 --> 01:14:20,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, do you...

1055
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:25,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it's odd that they left Animal Crossing and Paper Mario out of the conference totally?

1056
01:14:25,256 --> 01:14:26,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, except for, I guess, logos at the end?

1057
01:14:29,957 --> 01:14:35,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they felt they had enough that they were showing that, you know, they didn't keep you.

1058
01:14:35,298 --> 01:14:39,178
[SPEAKER_05]: What I was actually surprised at is that there were no live demos of games.

1059
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:43,779
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't bring those two out to show people.

1060
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:47,960
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that, is that maybe because of the whole 3D, 2D thing?

1061
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,582
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm talking about the Wii U. Oh, excuse me.

1062
01:14:51,622 --> 01:14:52,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved on already.

1063
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:53,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, sorry.

1064
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:54,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But they didn't bring it out.

1065
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:55,925
[SPEAKER_05]: They showed videos.

1066
01:14:56,545 --> 01:14:58,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, is it even here?

1067
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:00,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm seeing all these conceptual videos and stuff.

1068
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:02,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even think it was even at E3.

1069
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Because usually they would have brought it out or something.

1070
01:15:06,012 --> 01:15:08,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Tethered to lovely looking ladies, right?

1071
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:11,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get to some of the feedback from our chatroom on the 3DS.

1072
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,402
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we'll move into Wii U. For the non-3DS owners, are you interested in a 3DS now?

1073
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:19,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Geovidea says, no, can't use the 3D on the 3DS anyway.

1074
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:21,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Burr says, still not interested.

1075
01:15:21,886 --> 01:15:23,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Dungeon Buster, not really.

1076
01:15:24,168 --> 01:15:26,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Blender, not interested in the 3DS at all.

1077
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some of the negatives, but then we get some other positives.

1078
01:15:30,732 --> 01:15:31,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Dartesia, oh, definitely.

1079
01:15:32,053 --> 01:15:33,094
[SPEAKER_10]: New Mario Kart looks neat.

1080
01:15:33,214 --> 01:15:35,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, Tanooki suit.

1081
01:15:35,996 --> 01:15:39,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Was Tanooki suit in Mario Kart, or is he just blurring the other Mario games?

1082
01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:39,598
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1083
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Defective Candy says, Interesting, because there's not a lot of yeses.

1084
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:12,070
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the thing about Star Fox, that he was talking about fucking innovation, how you can tilt it to, you can optionally, I guess, tilt it to control your ship.

1085
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:15,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, except it fucks up the 3D when you do that, dumbass.

1086
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:16,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no kidding.

1087
01:16:17,252 --> 01:16:23,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's put tilt controls on a 3D game that requires you to keep the system at an actual view so that you can see the 3D.

1088
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:28,136
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's for people that don't give a shit about 3D.

1089
01:16:28,156 --> 01:16:31,017
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, why the fuck are you buying a 3DS sim?

1090
01:16:31,518 --> 01:16:35,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Or better yet, why the fuck are you buying a game that came out on the Nintendo 64?

1091
01:16:35,419 --> 01:16:37,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, because that's an innovation for Nintendo.

1092
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,901
[SPEAKER_09]: We can port old shit and make it slightly better.

1093
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby wants to jump in.

1094
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I have a 3DS because it's a higher resolution top screen.

1095
01:16:48,492 --> 01:17:06,999
[SPEAKER_10]: for me as well I bought a 3DS because I skipped the DSi and I skipped the DSi XL and the last one I had owned was a DS Lite so I thought it's time for upgrade why not that's why I did it but anyway let's move on to Wii U because I know Bobby wants to move on let me throw a question out to chat that we'll get to in a minute

1096
01:17:07,459 --> 01:17:34,647
[SPEAKER_10]: and then I want to talk Bobby your time with the hands-on Wii U on a scale of 1 to 10 chatters 10 being very and 1 being not at all I'm sounding like a club Nintendo survey but I'm just kind of curious here 1 being not at all how interested are you in Wii U scale of 1 to 10 1 not at all 10 very Bobby you got your hands on it after 4 hours of waiting right what do you think

1097
01:17:36,533 --> 01:17:39,274
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, what I want to say is I want to give a history lesson.

1098
01:17:40,174 --> 01:17:48,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in 2005, at Nintendo's press conference, they decided that they were going to show this brand new revolutionary control scheme.

1099
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:59,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And they showed the remote, and they did, you know, that was when, you know, Miyamoto came out, slashing Zelda doors and all that stuff.

1100
01:18:00,339 --> 01:18:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And they showed it, and when you played the games, you realized they were running on GameCubes.

1101
01:18:06,187 --> 01:18:09,769
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's where the whole joke of two GameCubes duct taped together came from.

1102
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:14,873
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2006, they actually showed the console that the controller was for.

1103
01:18:15,713 --> 01:18:24,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Fast forward to 2011, they are showing the controller for their next console, but they're not telling you that much about the console itself.

1104
01:18:24,219 --> 01:18:26,981
[SPEAKER_05]: They're focusing on the input mechanism.

1105
01:18:27,641 --> 01:18:30,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, we're actually going to see more of the console.

1106
01:18:31,023 --> 01:18:34,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the demos that they're showing here are running on new hardware,

1107
01:18:35,802 --> 01:18:42,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But, it's not, they even show a box there, but I was actually told that's not running anything.

1108
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:43,706
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like running a, there's a PC back there.

1109
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Running a, you know, a souped up wheat weed dev kit.

1110
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:48,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what they're running things off of.

1111
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:51,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they're not ready to talk about the console yet.

1112
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:56,993
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to get people to concentrate on the controller and the conceptual demos.

1113
01:18:57,053 --> 01:18:59,254
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not a single retail game

1114
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:08,687
[SPEAKER_05]: being shown, except, well, okay, there's one retail game, and it's a third-party game that's being shown here at E3 for the Wii U, so I kind of wanted to straighten that out.

1115
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:09,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Which one is that, the Lego game?

1116
01:19:11,588 --> 01:19:11,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1117
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:14,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, which, what's the third-party game, the Lego game?

1118
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, no, they're showing Ghost Recon Online.

1119
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:18,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow, okay.

1120
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,561
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though, Bobby?

1121
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:25,843
[SPEAKER_09]: You're wrong because those are going to be an actual game because that's what Wii Sports and Wii Play ended up being.

1122
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:28,525
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all those tech demos and they've had, hey, you know what?

1123
01:19:28,545 --> 01:19:29,365
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be innovative.

1124
01:19:29,605 --> 01:19:37,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to slap that shit together, kind of duct tape it a little bit and throw it out with a controller because people are suckers and they want free controllers.

1125
01:19:37,389 --> 01:19:43,653
[SPEAKER_10]: But Bobby, that should make Bobby happy because that Chase Me is basically Pac-Man vs. Pac-Man vs. is awesome.

1126
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:46,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I'm saying is like,

1127
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: People are, you know, when people look at these stuff, they're going to be like, wow, they're going to make me pay $50 for Chase Me.

1128
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:53,039
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not going to make you pay $50 for Chase Me.

1129
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:58,601
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to make you pay $50 for Chase Me, Battle Me, and all that other stuff.

1130
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:03,963
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, they were very adamant with me when I talked to people that actually worked at Nintendo and weren't just hired for the week.

1131
01:20:04,943 --> 01:20:10,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Which you could tell, by the way, because the people that worked at Nintendo have QR codes of their knees on their badge that you could scan.

1132
01:20:12,126 --> 01:20:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But they actually were very adamant saying, these are conceptual demos.

1133
01:20:17,237 --> 01:20:19,197
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not final products.

1134
01:20:19,298 --> 01:20:25,879
[SPEAKER_05]: These are to get your mind working and trying to tell you this is the type of stuff you can do.

1135
01:20:26,339 --> 01:20:37,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we may see the Shield Pose game and Chase Me and Battle Me in some kind of compilation, but not as standalone games.

1136
01:20:37,581 --> 01:20:43,323
[SPEAKER_05]: The only standalone games, like they had the Mario game running there and then Ghost Recon Online running.

1137
01:20:44,063 --> 01:20:45,503
[SPEAKER_05]: But the rest were tech demos.

1138
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:52,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you guys know, the feedback on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very, 1 being not at all, how interested are you in the Wii U?

1139
01:20:53,857 --> 01:20:56,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I see lots of, it's just all over the board.

1140
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:58,479
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some nines, but there's also some ones.

1141
01:20:58,779 --> 01:21:00,120
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a zero from Jovidea.

1142
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,940
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of fives and fours.

1143
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:03,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And then like a six.

1144
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:05,901
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a universal meh.

1145
01:21:06,722 --> 01:21:07,242
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all over.

1146
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because it's all conceptual right now.

1147
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:13,384
[SPEAKER_05]: People aren't seeing final products right now.

1148
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:16,241
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, even the hardware isn't finalized.

1149
01:21:16,301 --> 01:21:21,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and they didn't really emphasize enough that, you know, this is a new console.

1150
01:21:21,484 --> 01:21:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually walk away there and, I mean, even I thought this is just a new controller for my Wii.

1151
01:21:27,108 --> 01:21:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, right now they've, you know, right now you're playing some of the games with Wii Remote.

1152
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:39,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a Wii sensor bar underneath each TV, even though there's a sensor bar in the Wii Wii Wii controller.

1153
01:21:41,258 --> 01:21:41,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But, it's

1154
01:21:42,552 --> 01:21:44,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, I beat this out of them.

1155
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:49,876
[SPEAKER_05]: The console is called the Wii U, and they haven't named the controller yet.

1156
01:21:52,257 --> 01:21:53,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to name it Bob.

1157
01:21:56,419 --> 01:21:56,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Dan?

1158
01:21:57,099 --> 01:21:57,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wonder this.

1159
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we ready for the era of the game controller to cost $100 plus?

1160
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:07,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it will because that touchscreen is not, it's the DS touchscreen.

1161
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:09,645
[SPEAKER_10]: I called it on Sunday's show in some regards.

1162
01:22:09,665 --> 01:22:10,785
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a six and a half.

1163
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:11,485
[SPEAKER_10]: It's larger.

1164
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot larger.

1165
01:22:15,546 --> 01:22:15,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1166
01:22:15,886 --> 01:22:16,886
[SPEAKER_10]: 79 maybe.

1167
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:19,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's larger, but it's not multi-touch.

1168
01:22:20,387 --> 01:22:21,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one big thing.

1169
01:22:21,707 --> 01:22:22,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1170
01:22:23,768 --> 01:22:23,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1171
01:22:24,568 --> 01:22:24,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

1172
01:22:24,968 --> 01:22:25,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Finish your thought.

1173
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:25,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1174
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:30,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't seem to be like I couldn't do any multi-touch stuff.

1175
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:37,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe their current demos don't have multi-touch, but yeah, it's just a larger version of the DSi screen.

1176
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:43,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, were there any demos that were using more than one of those controllers on the same system?

1177
01:22:43,707 --> 01:22:45,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that was something I noticed at the conference.

1178
01:22:45,388 --> 01:22:47,430
[SPEAKER_10]: None of the games were using more than one of those controllers.

1179
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:49,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything was supplemented with additional Wiimotes.

1180
01:22:52,523 --> 01:22:54,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get a good look at Battle.me.

1181
01:22:55,025 --> 01:23:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the only one that might have, but everything else it was either, you know, it was a one-player experience or, you know, it was one person using that and then four Wii remotes.

1182
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:06,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1183
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:15,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I watched a video of Battle.me on Nintendo's website and I want to say the person flying the spaceship was using the controller and everybody else was on a Wiimote.

1184
01:23:15,816 --> 01:23:19,620
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, if the videos are to be the definitive answer.

1185
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:20,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that was interesting.

1186
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:29,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Like maybe the price of the controller really isn't going to be such an issue because they aren't really going to have you or want you to have more than one.

1187
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:31,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the games aren't really going to need more than one.

1188
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:32,732
[SPEAKER_10]: That's baloney.

1189
01:23:32,752 --> 01:23:36,494
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds to me like just the whole thing with the GBA connector.

1190
01:23:36,974 --> 01:23:37,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1191
01:23:37,695 --> 01:23:38,575
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same theory.

1192
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:40,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they just make a connector for the DS?

1193
01:23:41,296 --> 01:23:42,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1194
01:23:44,058 --> 01:23:48,479
[SPEAKER_05]: The controller is not creating any graphics, and I think that might be why.

1195
01:23:48,880 --> 01:24:00,805
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually, the graphics on the controller is being created by the Wii U, and it's being sent wirelessly with very little lag to the controller.

1196
01:24:02,717 --> 01:24:03,317
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

1197
01:24:03,578 --> 01:24:07,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's some technology you can see right now in the PS3 and the PSP.

1198
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:10,661
[SPEAKER_10]: You can log into your PS3 on your PSP.

1199
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:19,046
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very little advertised feature, but you can fire up your PSP and log into your PS3 and see the image on your PSP, and it does work.

1200
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:26,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, remember back when Kasarai was first showing Ridge Racer, the original concept was that that PSP was supposed to be your rearview mirror.

1201
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:31,773
[SPEAKER_10]: We never saw that really fully realized, but the idea was out there a while ago.

1202
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:35,107
[SPEAKER_08]: If no one minds, actually, if I go back to an old point.

1203
01:24:35,387 --> 01:24:35,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1204
01:24:35,807 --> 01:24:37,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Because she just made the point to me.

1205
01:24:38,048 --> 01:24:38,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1206
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:47,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Ciara has said that as a person who bought around eight different versions of Final Fantasy VII, I don't care if it's the same game.

1207
01:24:48,514 --> 01:24:49,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about back to the Animal Crossing thing.

1208
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:52,136
[SPEAKER_08]: The fans will buy it if they like it.

1209
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:54,437
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why it stays the same.

1210
01:24:54,477 --> 01:24:57,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the fans can't complain when they say, oh, well, it's just the same game.

1211
01:24:57,919 --> 01:24:58,759
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't do anything.

1212
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Four, not seven.

1213
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:00,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1214
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:12,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, you're in a unique position that none of us and probably most of our chatters and even listeners are in tonight where you're the only one that's actually held one of these Wii U's.

1215
01:25:13,085 --> 01:25:16,426
[SPEAKER_10]: So coming out of there, how are you?

1216
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:25,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know you said at the end of the press conference you were feeling a little mint, but coming out of the demo, are you thinking you're going to buy a Wii U or are you kind of like, I need to see more next year?

1217
01:25:28,549 --> 01:25:30,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hand Nintendo my wallet.

1218
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,416
[SPEAKER_05]: and just say, here, take it.

1219
01:25:33,316 --> 01:25:36,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And what was it about it that just made you go, I'm sold?

1220
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:51,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can see kind of more, you know, I can actually contextualize a lot more and I can see where they're going with it and a lot of the neat stuff that they're doing and the neat gameplay that they're doing with that and what they can do.

1221
01:25:51,928 --> 01:25:55,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I can kind of see where they're going with it, which a lot of people usually can't.

1222
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, when they first announced the DS, everybody's like, why would I want a touchscreen on my games?

1223
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:03,941
[SPEAKER_05]: and now, you know, what's, you know, iPhone games are really popular.

1224
01:26:05,282 --> 01:26:11,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and I could see where that was going and nobody else could figure out why would I want a touchscreen gaming system.

1225
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:16,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw when I first saw the DS, here's why you'd want a touchscreen gaming system.

1226
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:19,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I could actually see it and it's true, you know.

1227
01:26:19,612 --> 01:26:22,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people are like, oh, this is a gimmick and all that stuff.

1228
01:26:22,914 --> 01:26:27,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of Nintendo's innovations have been copied by everybody else and they were called gimmicks at first.

1229
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:30,059
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Rumble was a gimmick.

1230
01:26:30,959 --> 01:26:36,045
[SPEAKER_05]: and now we have touch screens on everything, motion controls are on everything.

1231
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:49,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that Nintendo is going to innovate in this space and you're going to see in a couple years other companies copying them and it's not the first time they've done this because they've already done the GameCube, Game Boy Advance thing.

1232
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've already got a track record of some of the stuff they already know.

1233
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:54,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Holiday 2012 It'll be Holiday 2012

1234
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Just from being in retail, Nintendo always saves the machines for Christmas.

1235
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:23,967
[SPEAKER_06]: But not the 3DS?

1236
01:27:24,247 --> 01:27:25,768
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, not the portables.

1237
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: The consoles.

1238
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:30,250
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something from one of those guys that has the QR code on his badge.

1239
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:31,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1240
01:27:32,471 --> 01:27:33,532
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the official word then.

1241
01:27:33,552 --> 01:27:38,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, what did you think about the Analog 6 being above the actual D-pad and the face buttons?

1242
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:41,456
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a little backwards compared to the controllers now.

1243
01:27:41,516 --> 01:27:42,237
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS is that way.

1244
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:43,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It felt natural.

1245
01:27:44,438 --> 01:27:44,658
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1246
01:27:46,296 --> 01:27:57,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of where the triggers are, there's the triggers and then the LB and the RB, but because of where they are, that is the exact position your thumb would really want to be if you wanted to use the dual analog sticks.

1247
01:27:58,925 --> 01:28:05,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, if I'm not mistaken, you were kind of in this wee line yourself and doing this whole thing, kind of going in there by yourself.

1248
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:16,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I know, when I'm in a big environment like that by myself, because I did E3 myself one year, or at least one of the days, and one of the things that I couldn't help but do was listen to other people around me and do a little bit of people watching.

1249
01:28:16,576 --> 01:28:17,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I was being a little nosy.

1250
01:28:18,077 --> 01:28:22,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you doing any of that, maybe in the Nintendo booth and kind of picking up some of the buzz from people around you?

1251
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:28,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, because everybody around me spoke different languages.

1252
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:30,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Touche.

1253
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:31,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Touche.

1254
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:54,333
[SPEAKER_10]: The controller is actually lighter.

1255
01:28:54,353 --> 01:28:55,254
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the same as my iPad.

1256
01:28:55,334 --> 01:28:57,695
[SPEAKER_10]: If I don't have a cover on it, it feels about the same weight as my iPad does.

1257
01:28:57,735 --> 01:28:58,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And how did it feel?

1258
01:28:58,495 --> 01:28:58,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And as for...

1259
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:25,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt natural, like, I mean, you'd think it's big, but then you hold it, and, you know, I mean, I have normal-sized hands, and it felt fine.

1260
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:30,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're not reaching all the way down to the bottom, like, all the buttons are easily accessible.

1261
01:29:31,843 --> 01:29:42,106
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, you know, yeah, it's also, I mean, it's also a prototype controller as well, it could change at the end, and it was also, like, tied down, like, four different ways, so you couldn't take it.

1262
01:29:42,526 --> 01:29:45,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So that probably added to the weight as well.

1263
01:29:46,134 --> 01:29:47,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it felt natural.

1264
01:29:47,935 --> 01:29:48,875
[SPEAKER_05]: It was lighter than I expected.

1265
01:29:48,955 --> 01:29:51,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was wired when I played it.

1266
01:30:06,763 --> 01:30:28,876
[SPEAKER_10]: ah so maybe it's feeding well no because they they showed in the other concept videos it's going to be wireless and they talked about beaming the image wirelessly but it's too early it's early on the proto pictures I've seen online look like they have a charge port on them I want to know what this parrot has to do with anything Bobby what I'm sorry but you were gonna say something we were cutting you off

1267
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,231
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's wired here.

1268
01:30:32,271 --> 01:30:33,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a prototype.

1269
01:30:33,692 --> 01:30:35,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Things change.

1270
01:30:36,173 --> 01:30:41,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3DS didn't really change all that much, but I remember the original DS was different when it came out.

1271
01:30:41,876 --> 01:30:43,017
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a prototype thing.

1272
01:30:43,097 --> 01:30:44,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It could change its layout.

1273
01:30:44,918 --> 01:30:48,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think they know what the tech specs are going to be in the final product.

1274
01:30:49,332 --> 01:30:50,332
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it ergonomically?

1275
01:30:50,392 --> 01:30:51,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, when I held it

1276
01:31:16,689 --> 01:31:19,370
[SPEAKER_05]: My fingers went to all the right places.

1277
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:28,912
[SPEAKER_05]: On the back, which you don't get to feel that much, there is actual grooves for you to hold with your three fingers that aren't playing with the triggers.

1278
01:31:30,812 --> 01:31:34,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt good.

1279
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:38,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked it up and my hands were in the right place.

1280
01:31:38,554 --> 01:31:39,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't hurt.

1281
01:31:39,975 --> 01:31:41,817
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1282
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:06,864
[SPEAKER_05]: On the back, it's got curves on the back for you to hold on to and for your fingers to naturally curve around.

1283
01:32:06,884 --> 01:32:10,326
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I was thinking the same logic, though, with the Saturn dual analog controller on the front.

1284
01:32:10,366 --> 01:32:13,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like it would be very comfortable, but it's one of the most comfortable controllers there are.

1285
01:32:13,768 --> 01:32:13,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1286
01:32:14,368 --> 01:32:16,750
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I was wondering if it was along the same lines.

1287
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I had an appointment with EA Sports, so I got to play the pre-alpha build of the new SSX.

1288
01:32:22,122 --> 01:32:25,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can see that people who like SSX are really going to like this.

1289
01:32:44,413 --> 01:32:50,014
[SPEAKER_05]: They've talked about how they've got this snow avalanche system that is dynamic.

1290
01:32:50,254 --> 01:32:56,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like split-second or anything that has these predetermined catastrophic events.

1291
01:32:56,816 --> 01:33:10,179
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually say that they take the stability of the area, how stable it is, to see if that actually affects more snow or stops the snow, and that's one of the modes where you're trying to survive.

1292
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:11,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Not die.

1293
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,474
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to get down this mountain without getting crushed by snow.

1294
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:16,435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very uplifting.

1295
01:33:17,456 --> 01:33:22,119
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, they did basically Google Earth.

1296
01:33:22,559 --> 01:33:23,099
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of funny.

1297
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:27,402
[SPEAKER_05]: They licensed with NASA topography data of the entire world.

1298
01:33:28,262 --> 01:33:30,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said it's nice to have friends in high places.

1299
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:31,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That was their pun.

1300
01:33:32,645 --> 01:33:37,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had all the major mountain ranges, and you can pick those mountains.

1301
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:41,794
[SPEAKER_05]: to go down, and it's the actual mountains from the actual NASA topography data.

1302
01:33:42,614 --> 01:33:44,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the mountains that you go down.

1303
01:33:45,056 --> 01:33:56,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've done some things with it, like one of the mountains that's on the China border, they decided they were going to put pieces of the Great Wall of China in there that you could grind off of and stuff, so it's not completely realistic.

1304
01:33:56,604 --> 01:33:59,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still, it's a lot more than they've done in the past.

1305
01:34:00,227 --> 01:34:01,708
[SPEAKER_05]: But it worked well.

1306
01:34:01,828 --> 01:34:05,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not a final build by any means.

1307
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:07,812
[SPEAKER_05]: There was some lag in it, but I mean, that's because it's a pre-alpha build.

1308
01:34:08,374 --> 01:34:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: so basically I saw that and they showed me some stuff about FIFA which I'm not a huge soccer fan but it was kind of neat some of the stuff they did so I saw that and then I walked through Microsoft's booth to see what was kind of in there and I'm going to go play that Disneyland Connect game because I know where I'm going Friday and Friday is a research trip Friday is a research trip

1309
01:34:37,383 --> 01:34:37,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1310
01:34:37,743 --> 01:34:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1311
01:34:38,383 --> 01:34:46,887
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently in the demo, like I guess in the briefing, because I didn't see the briefing, I was in the air, but apparently I guess it cuts off at the end of the Peter Pan ride.

1312
01:34:46,907 --> 01:34:47,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

1313
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: In the presser?

1314
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:52,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so, yeah.

1315
01:34:52,249 --> 01:34:53,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought it was a time thing, yeah.

1316
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:55,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1317
01:34:55,550 --> 01:34:56,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it cuts off.

1318
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:58,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently you do actually fight Captain Hook.

1319
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they showed that a little bit.

1320
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:02,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh, interesting.

1321
01:35:02,461 --> 01:35:03,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it was in a video or something.

1322
01:35:03,602 --> 01:35:03,862
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1323
01:35:04,962 --> 01:35:05,322
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

1324
01:35:05,702 --> 01:35:09,424
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that, and then I walked by and I immediately thought of Rob.

1325
01:35:09,764 --> 01:35:10,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh dear.

1326
01:35:10,624 --> 01:35:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there were these four chicks wearing black dresses up on a stage doing the time warp.

1327
01:35:17,907 --> 01:35:18,868
[SPEAKER_10]: From the Rocky Horror Picture Show?

1328
01:35:18,888 --> 01:35:20,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just had to get pictures.

1329
01:35:20,368 --> 01:35:23,249
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this means they're doing a Rocky Horror Picture Show video game?

1330
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1331
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:25,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

1332
01:35:25,768 --> 01:35:54,194
[SPEAKER_08]: yes, it is called Glee Karaoke Revolution 2 no you've mentioned the four letter G word therefore I must go I even took video for you oh wait, here we go you mentioned the four letter G word now I must go throw up yes, and I did get the picture thank you Bobby did you get some hands on time with anything else?

1333
01:35:57,589 --> 01:36:10,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, I mean, I did, I stopped by, I have a friend who works at Double Fine, and I walked by and played Trenched, which is their Xbox Live arcade game, which is a third-person mech tower defense game.

1334
01:36:10,872 --> 01:36:11,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, interesting.

1335
01:36:11,852 --> 01:36:20,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you're fighting waves and waves of enemies, and you can drop turrets and different things like a tower defense game, but then you're also in this mech shooting at them.

1336
01:36:21,303 --> 01:36:22,384
[SPEAKER_05]: and running around and stuff.

1337
01:36:23,204 --> 01:36:28,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It was two player online because I was playing with the person standing next to me on his console.

1338
01:36:31,248 --> 01:36:37,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, this demo, they dropped you at a mission that's like in the last third of the game.

1339
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:40,532
[SPEAKER_05]: You've already gone through the tutorial by this point and all that stuff.

1340
01:36:40,992 --> 01:36:45,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a little confusing because I haven't really done much with the game.

1341
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:48,856
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can see people liking it.

1342
01:36:49,356 --> 01:36:49,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

1343
01:36:49,964 --> 01:36:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Not over the top like you'd expect from Kim Schafer, though.

1344
01:36:54,186 --> 01:36:55,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's on deck for you tomorrow?

1345
01:36:56,148 --> 01:36:57,108
[SPEAKER_10]: What are your plans?

1346
01:36:57,448 --> 01:37:00,970
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know we mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'm sure you want to talk about your Twitter project.

1347
01:37:02,751 --> 01:37:02,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1348
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:04,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two appointments tomorrow.

1349
01:37:05,093 --> 01:37:06,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than that, I'm letting people direct me.

1350
01:37:09,015 --> 01:37:16,339
[SPEAKER_05]: My two appointments, just so people kind of know, at 1 o'clock I'm going to visit a Georgia company because being in Georgia, I actually have contacts there.

1351
01:37:16,903 --> 01:37:22,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to CCP Games where they just announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3 exclusive.

1352
01:37:22,948 --> 01:37:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're actually going to show the connectivity between Dust 514 on the PlayStation 3 and EVE Online, the Excel spreadsheet simulator on the PC.

1353
01:37:32,975 --> 01:37:37,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very curious about that because we missed that with so much coming out of Sony.

1354
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:42,443
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'm very interested in this whole how does this game impact the MMO of EVE Online.

1355
01:37:42,483 --> 01:37:42,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interested.

1356
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:48,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I am too because I have played EVE a little bit so I actually understand the universe and stuff.

1357
01:37:48,979 --> 01:37:50,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go in there and see them.

1358
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:57,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at 4 o'clock I do have a Bethesda appointment where I'm going to get to see the demo of Skyrim that everybody else has seen already.

1359
01:37:58,005 --> 01:37:59,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess it was on TV.

1360
01:37:59,466 --> 01:38:02,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we saw a portion of what will be a longer demo for you.

1361
01:38:02,868 --> 01:38:04,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard it's a 30-minute demo behind the doors.

1362
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,991
[SPEAKER_10]: So very curious about that.

1363
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:07,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So good.

1364
01:38:07,551 --> 01:38:10,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are two games we can definitely talk more about tomorrow.

1365
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if folks want to follow you on Twitter...

1366
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:26,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf and tomorrow also I'm going to be trying to hit Atlas so if you have any specific questions about Catherine or any of other Atlas' games I'm probably going to hit them after the CCP because they're next door.

1367
01:38:27,044 --> 01:38:28,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And our Chibi Wolf picture?

1368
01:38:30,334 --> 01:38:59,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go try to find Natsume and get your Chibi Wolf picture Need to go play Saints Row 3 I need my cow Actually, the one thing not to load you up with assignments, Bobby maybe you already know the answers to a couple of these but there's two things that are kind of missing right now where I'm like, what happened to... One of them is Grand Theft Auto V Everybody was convinced Grand Theft Auto V was debuting at E3 and we have heard nothing It's gone, it's not there, right?

1369
01:39:01,569 --> 01:39:02,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not seen it.

1370
01:39:03,476 --> 01:39:07,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other big question mark is what the hell is Activision doing?

1371
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they've got a booth.

1372
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:11,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go stop by them.

1373
01:39:12,002 --> 01:39:15,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they're doing this little game that's called Modern Warfare 3.

1374
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:16,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, all right.

1375
01:39:16,786 --> 01:39:17,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know if you've heard of it.

1376
01:39:18,327 --> 01:39:26,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but still, when Activision's a huge company like EA, and EA, I could name easily like 10 games EA, we know they're doing.

1377
01:39:26,714 --> 01:39:28,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Activision's got maybe a couple.

1378
01:39:29,436 --> 01:39:31,177
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they have more than that.

1379
01:39:31,197 --> 01:39:33,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but where's the Bungie game?

1380
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:36,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I just thought there'd be more coming out from Activision.

1381
01:39:36,141 --> 01:39:37,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe because of the lack of press conference.

1382
01:39:37,543 --> 01:39:37,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1383
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:40,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Any music games?

1384
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:41,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they've scaled back.

1385
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:43,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

1386
01:39:43,931 --> 01:39:50,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's Modern Warfare 3 for them, X-Men Destiny, Spider-Man, whatever the... Spyro.

1387
01:39:52,438 --> 01:39:57,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the Activision, if I'm not mistaken, was also... Spyro, Cha-Ching, Skylanders is what that's called.

1388
01:39:57,702 --> 01:39:59,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, hey, guess what?

1389
01:40:00,284 --> 01:40:10,792
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to charge you $70 for the starter kit, and then if you want your individual, you know, collect-them-all figurines that you can use for playable characters in the game, those are each going to cost you $8.

1390
01:40:11,993 --> 01:40:18,195
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm not mistaking, wasn't Activision also at one time the company that said, we're just not doing E3 anymore?

1391
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:20,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1392
01:40:20,716 --> 01:40:26,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Their big title now is so big that they're just like, we don't need E3 really.

1393
01:40:26,817 --> 01:40:30,278
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to do a show, we'll make an appearance, but we don't want to spend the money or the time.

1394
01:40:30,298 --> 01:40:36,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I hope Battlefield 3 blows the shit out of them because that game looks nice.

1395
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:58,239
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody wants to see Activision put in their place everybody wants to see Activision I just watched like a mission there was like a tank mission or whatever that they're showing with Battlefield 3 it's just amazing I mean Call of Duty it's pretty action packed it's an ultra realistic looking war game wow another one it looks way better though they all look great but I mean it's just like

1396
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome!

1397
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:04,764
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta let Bobby go find some... No, no, hang on.

1398
01:41:05,044 --> 01:41:07,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta respond to something in here in chat.

1399
01:41:07,026 --> 01:41:12,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaijudo says the reason why there isn't a GTA 5 is because Agent is coming out for GTA 5.

1400
01:41:12,871 --> 01:41:18,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I can't remember who exactly I heard this from, but it was from somebody I trust.

1401
01:41:18,836 --> 01:41:25,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they heard somebody ask, I think it was Jack Trenton, is Agent still a PS3 exclusive?

1402
01:41:25,101 --> 01:41:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: And his response was, you'll have to ask Rockstar about that.

1403
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:30,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1404
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:32,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1405
01:41:34,085 --> 01:41:36,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby, we got to let you go find some good beer in LA.

1406
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:43,277
[SPEAKER_10]: But before we do, I can't imagine anyone that listens to Orange Lounge Radio doesn't already know about your show.

1407
01:41:43,337 --> 01:41:47,163
[SPEAKER_10]: But just in case there's like the one person that doesn't, tell us a little bit about your show.

1408
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the opening band.

1409
01:41:51,292 --> 01:41:51,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

1410
01:41:52,072 --> 01:41:54,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am on at 8 p.m.

1411
01:41:54,193 --> 01:41:54,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern, 5 p.m.

1412
01:41:54,874 --> 01:41:56,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Pacific, right before Orange Launch Radio.

1413
01:41:56,734 --> 01:42:02,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me talking for about 30 minutes, and then I take calls, and everybody tells me I'm wrong for the next 20 minutes.

1414
01:42:03,097 --> 01:42:07,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I goof off with Rob and DarkSakura for 10 minutes, and that's my show.

1415
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:08,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That is high entertainment.

1416
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:16,143
[SPEAKER_05]: All Games Radio is where it's live, or bobbyblackwolf.com is the website where I've almost, you know, I'm not as old as they all are,

1417
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:19,023
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm coming upon six years next month.

1418
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:20,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That's still very impressive.

1419
01:42:20,764 --> 01:42:21,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Very impressive.

1420
01:42:21,505 --> 01:42:22,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still a big boy.

1421
01:42:23,807 --> 01:42:25,068
[SPEAKER_10]: You can sit at the big kids table.

1422
01:42:25,528 --> 01:42:25,768
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1423
01:42:25,968 --> 01:42:31,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Bobby, we'll be talking to you again tomorrow and have a lot of fun at E3 tomorrow and just play as many games as you can, all right?

1424
01:42:33,474 --> 01:42:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

1425
01:42:33,874 --> 01:42:36,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And Thursday also is wide open.

1426
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:37,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any appointments on that day.

1427
01:42:38,438 --> 01:42:41,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if I don't get through it tomorrow, I want to get through it Thursday.

1428
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:42,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say...

1429
01:42:42,959 --> 01:42:48,944
[SPEAKER_05]: because some people don't believe me when I say this and they started asking me, go ask Microsoft if they're going to charge for Skype.

1430
01:42:48,984 --> 01:42:51,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I can't because I don't have that kind of access.

1431
01:42:51,987 --> 01:42:53,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right, exactly.

1432
01:42:53,047 --> 01:42:59,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to keep your questions to games that maybe aren't AAA titles or from AAA developers.

1433
01:43:00,373 --> 01:43:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to find, you know, like this year's Scribblenauts.

1434
01:43:03,756 --> 01:43:09,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Scribblenauts I had never heard of until I saw it in the back corner of WB's booth a couple years ago and it blew me away.

1435
01:43:10,103 --> 01:43:16,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Damacy I really hadn't heard of until Namco showed it off a couple years ago at E3, or many years ago at E3 now.

1436
01:43:17,809 --> 01:43:28,477
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking for those games, and if you hear something that maybe you want to hear more about that GameSpot and IGN at the big sites aren't going to cover, those are the games I want to find.

1437
01:43:28,998 --> 01:43:31,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be able to ask Peter Molyneux about Fable the 30.

1438
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:38,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to be able to ask Sony about if they're going to be doing this or that with the Vita, because they're not going to talk to me.

1439
01:43:39,065 --> 01:43:39,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But the smaller desks,

1440
01:43:40,424 --> 01:43:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: They will answer my question.

1441
01:43:41,955 --> 01:43:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the people I want to talk to.

1442
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:45,474
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Internet, you have your homework assignment.

1443
01:43:45,494 --> 01:43:47,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Twitter.com slash BobbyBlackWolf.

1444
01:43:47,195 --> 01:43:52,699
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to clarify, even though Bobby will still be at the show Thursday, we will not be having an E3 special Thursday.

1445
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:59,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything Bobby does on Thursday, he will be doing on his own show this upcoming Sunday when he broadcasts live.

1446
01:43:59,985 --> 01:44:02,467
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will not be here live on Sunday.

1447
01:44:02,808 --> 01:44:04,189
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all weird, this programming thing.

1448
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:05,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to have to draw a grid.

1449
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:09,613
[SPEAKER_10]: But follow our websites and stay tuned for all the information in our Twitters.

1450
01:44:09,894 --> 01:44:11,395
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you can stay on top of the world.

1451
01:44:12,313 --> 01:44:20,836
[SPEAKER_05]: and on my show Sunday night I will actually talk about the actual demos of the Wii Wii Wii Wii Wii Wii that I played and how each of them felt and played and all that stuff.

1452
01:44:21,196 --> 01:44:22,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, sounds good.

1453
01:44:23,637 --> 01:44:30,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well Bobby we're going to let you go so we can get to some other calls and I've got to call Shane too who's also there waiting to talk to us.

1454
01:44:30,779 --> 01:44:31,659
[SPEAKER_10]: So take care buddy.

1455
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I get to go watch Nerds riding a mechanical bull now.

1456
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be great.

1457
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:37,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome, have fun.

1458
01:44:39,218 --> 01:44:41,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Thank you

1459
01:45:02,944 --> 01:45:03,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty fun.

1460
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:33,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been going on Twitter and seeing random, this is bullshit!

1461
01:45:34,063 --> 01:45:34,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii U what?

1462
01:45:35,605 --> 01:45:38,108
[SPEAKER_08]: So my Twitter's been a source of hilarity.

1463
01:45:38,889 --> 01:45:39,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, what about you?

1464
01:45:39,831 --> 01:45:41,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been streaming all the press conferences.

1465
01:45:41,553 --> 01:45:41,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

1466
01:45:42,334 --> 01:45:42,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1467
01:45:43,015 --> 01:45:45,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been going to the game sites and...

1468
01:45:47,052 --> 01:46:14,764
[SPEAKER_10]: just experiencing it as much as you can from the comfort of your computer chair that's right and where the food is reasonable we should be there I know we failed next year next year alright let me ask this question too Loki I know you've had some hands on with this some of the stuff that's been released during E3 we've had a few not just Connect Labs was it's out today but there was also Excitebike 3D came out did you get a chance to grab the Excitebike 3D on 3DS

1469
01:46:15,484 --> 01:46:16,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, and I checked it out.

1470
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:23,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that it wasn't just them kind of offsetting each individual sprite layer.

1471
01:46:24,011 --> 01:46:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, it still wasn't that great.

1472
01:46:27,474 --> 01:46:34,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like watching Excitebike on a really tiny screen, because when you do it in 3D, it's just really tiny.

1473
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:35,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have that here with you?

1474
01:46:36,162 --> 01:46:36,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

1475
01:46:37,123 --> 01:46:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it.

1476
01:46:37,663 --> 01:46:39,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have it, Rob?

1477
01:46:39,384 --> 01:46:40,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do, actually.

1478
01:46:40,565 --> 01:46:41,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Give to daddy.

1479
01:46:42,532 --> 01:46:42,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go!

1480
01:47:06,255 --> 01:47:07,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too expensive.

1481
01:47:07,516 --> 01:47:09,778
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably will before too long, so here you go.

1482
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:10,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give that to Dan.

1483
01:47:10,778 --> 01:47:12,880
[SPEAKER_10]: He can check that out right now.

1484
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:21,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like how when you use the 3D slider on it, how it zooms it back into the original game, which is kind of neat.

1485
01:47:21,987 --> 01:47:28,171
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, beyond that gimmick, I just can't get too excited about it, you know what I mean?

1486
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:30,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... I don't know.

1487
01:47:30,793 --> 01:47:33,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's as exciting as Excitebike is, I guess.

1488
01:47:34,876 --> 01:47:41,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we are going to give Miklatov a call and ask some more questions about Nintendo.

1489
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,240
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hear another perspective.

1490
01:47:43,981 --> 01:47:47,542
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if, I don't think he got hands on with Wii U today.

1491
01:47:48,083 --> 01:47:51,864
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was, he was there at the Nintendo presser.

1492
01:47:52,665 --> 01:47:54,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dan's like, this is widescreen, what's going on?

1493
01:47:54,986 --> 01:47:57,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to give Miklatov a call.

1494
01:47:57,347 --> 01:48:00,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I just punched in the digits, one ringy dingy, two ringy dingys.

1495
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:01,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

1496
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:02,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

1497
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:02,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

1498
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft bored me to tears.

1499
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

1500
01:48:36,662 --> 01:48:39,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they didn't have anything interesting.

1501
01:48:39,284 --> 01:48:48,148
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all, here's the Kinect that we've been pushing for a year and we're trying to keep it relevant.

1502
01:48:48,608 --> 01:48:56,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, here's Gears of War with probably a drunk or high iced tea.

1503
01:48:56,432 --> 01:48:57,552
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why he was angry.

1504
01:48:57,632 --> 01:48:59,553
[SPEAKER_10]: He wasn't drunk yet and it was 11am.

1505
01:49:00,694 --> 01:49:01,174
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1506
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:06,224
[SPEAKER_05]: and really they had me with Band Central and that was it.

1507
01:49:06,505 --> 01:49:08,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else was interesting to me.

1508
01:49:09,386 --> 01:49:10,007
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Sony?

1509
01:49:11,648 --> 01:49:12,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony?

1510
01:49:12,788 --> 01:49:13,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually really liked.

1511
01:49:14,849 --> 01:49:16,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked their monitor.

1512
01:49:17,091 --> 01:49:24,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it yet in action but I liked the idea of two people looking at it and seeing different things and it's cheap.

1513
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the idea of the Vita.

1514
01:49:29,578 --> 01:49:30,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Uncharted 3.

1515
01:49:32,383 --> 01:49:34,884
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about Pico and Shadow of the Cloth.

1516
01:49:35,284 --> 01:49:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: This also makes me happy.

1517
01:49:36,584 --> 01:49:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So overall, they did really well in my eyes.

1518
01:49:40,126 --> 01:49:40,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1519
01:49:40,646 --> 01:49:41,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked it.

1520
01:49:41,046 --> 01:49:41,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to go again.

1521
01:49:41,566 --> 01:49:41,826
[SPEAKER_10]: It was also...

1522
01:49:58,519 --> 01:50:09,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, while I liked it, and I thought it was cool, like, they had the orchestra, and that was neat, and, oh, a golden remote was cool, I was also kind of dull, and it went by really fast.

1523
01:50:11,451 --> 01:50:12,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they're really good.

1524
01:50:12,412 --> 01:50:14,773
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I was seven rows from the front.

1525
01:50:14,793 --> 01:50:14,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1526
01:50:14,934 --> 01:50:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember them showing it off in person.

1527
01:50:17,575 --> 01:50:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bring it off in person.

1528
01:50:19,036 --> 01:50:19,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1529
01:50:19,177 --> 01:50:19,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1530
01:50:40,836 --> 01:50:43,859
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you haven't done hands-on, or did you do hands-on today, or no?

1531
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:59,075
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I went there first thing this morning, and of course all the visitors were in line first, that's what they do, and it looked like it was like a three and a half hour wait from where I was at, so I was like, screw it.

1532
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm just going to do it tomorrow.

1533
01:51:00,692 --> 01:51:05,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's why I decided to go and look at other things today because I knew that tomorrow and the next day would be mostly Vida and you.

1534
01:51:22,071 --> 01:51:25,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, everything that they talked about today for the 3DS, I got to play.

1535
01:51:25,273 --> 01:51:26,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was pretty cool.

1536
01:51:27,053 --> 01:51:27,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that they had

1537
01:51:48,806 --> 01:51:53,748
[SPEAKER_05]: They're titled at the press conference and they're like, oh yeah, and everything we're talking about, don't say it now.

1538
01:51:54,308 --> 01:51:55,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, so Kid Icarus was playable too?

1539
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, oh my god, I love Kid Icarus.

1540
01:51:59,130 --> 01:52:01,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, tell us a little bit about how that demo played.

1541
01:52:02,512 --> 01:52:05,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so there were two, well, three demos.

1542
01:52:05,613 --> 01:52:07,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I did two of the three so far.

1543
01:52:08,074 --> 01:52:13,757
[SPEAKER_05]: The first demo is an aerial mission and a ground mission combined into one.

1544
01:52:15,417 --> 01:52:17,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the aerial mission...

1545
01:52:17,965 --> 01:52:30,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much, if you played Sin Infinishment, you've got your little target that you control with the stylus, and then the circle pad is how you straight and move up and down.

1546
01:52:31,015 --> 01:52:37,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And your firing is all based out of the left button at the top, the L button.

1547
01:52:39,342 --> 01:52:44,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you actually do the mission, you actually had like, I think around nine...

1548
01:52:46,295 --> 01:52:48,336
[SPEAKER_05]: options for what you want to use as your weapon.

1549
01:52:48,856 --> 01:52:51,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty neat.

1550
01:52:51,218 --> 01:52:54,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I went with Pan Blast because I thought that was cool.

1551
01:52:55,820 --> 01:53:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're playing, if you target an enemy with the target, I don't know how to pronounce it, it'll lock onto them, kind of.

1552
01:53:09,787 --> 01:53:14,189
[SPEAKER_05]: If you hold down the L button, it'll shoot a rapid succession of shots.

1553
01:53:15,026 --> 01:53:23,908
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just target them though and just single press it, you will deliver like a fully charged blast that can actually take out several enemies in that area.

1554
01:53:28,628 --> 01:53:31,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, did you say the other one was the multiplayer demo?

1555
01:53:32,949 --> 01:53:33,809
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two other ones.

1556
01:53:34,329 --> 01:53:35,509
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a multiplayer demo.

1557
01:53:35,549 --> 01:53:36,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not get to do that.

1558
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:38,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1559
01:53:39,470 --> 01:53:41,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I wanted to hang around at that point.

1560
01:53:42,431 --> 01:53:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other one they had was AR cards.

1561
01:53:45,395 --> 01:54:10,870
[SPEAKER_05]: which actually if you did the demonstration with them you got a pack so I have a pack of Kid Icarus AR cards once the game comes out they'll be able to use but all it really is is just putting characters on through the AR on the card and then they can battle each other it was that thing that some were joking like hey didn't we see this already when it was called the Eye of Judgment yes that's all it is

1562
01:54:12,177 --> 01:54:13,418
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much all there is.

1563
01:54:13,578 --> 01:54:20,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting that Nintendo just slaps Kid Icarus on it and now people are going crazy about it.

1564
01:54:20,381 --> 01:54:21,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that funny how that works, Loki?

1565
01:54:22,102 --> 01:54:25,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, was the bet still on if a million copies of that game sell?

1566
01:54:25,924 --> 01:54:26,784
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there is no bet.

1567
01:54:28,105 --> 01:54:29,525
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done.

1568
01:54:29,565 --> 01:54:30,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over it.

1569
01:54:30,386 --> 01:54:30,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, alright.

1570
01:54:31,786 --> 01:54:32,767
[SPEAKER_10]: What else did you play on DS?

1571
01:54:33,767 --> 01:54:33,967
[SPEAKER_10]: 3DS.

1572
01:54:34,067 --> 01:54:35,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Luigi's Mansion 2.

1573
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:36,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1574
01:54:38,004 --> 01:55:02,484
[SPEAKER_05]: it played like Luigi's Mansion it was some big shocker there the one thing that I did not like is that I know it's early in development but the frame rate chugged even when you weren't doing much of anything okay well hopefully they get that ironed out I mean yeah that's an early development thing I'm sure but they'll have to fix that Mario Mario was cool um

1575
01:55:04,525 --> 01:55:15,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It played like Mario Galaxy on the stages that didn't have the 3D worlds where you're running around the entire planet upside down and stuff like that.

1576
01:55:17,808 --> 01:55:19,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much really different there.

1577
01:55:19,568 --> 01:55:26,090
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got your raccoon suit back, but it looks like the Tanooki suit, but it has the raccoon suit powers, so it's kind of weird.

1578
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:26,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1579
01:55:28,450 --> 01:55:29,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, Mario Kart.

1580
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:31,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Kart was fantastic.

1581
01:55:33,324 --> 01:55:35,166
[SPEAKER_05]: 60 frames a second from what I was told.

1582
01:55:36,587 --> 01:55:37,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in 3D?

1583
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:40,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in 3D?

1584
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:41,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Even in 3D it does 60 frames?

1585
01:55:42,071 --> 01:55:42,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1586
01:55:43,212 --> 01:55:45,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would play it in 2D?

1587
01:55:45,714 --> 01:55:47,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Losers would play it in 2D.

1588
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:53,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm thinking of Dead or Alive Dimensions where they were saying, oh, it'll do 60 frames in 2D and 30 in 3D.

1589
01:55:53,621 --> 01:55:57,484
[SPEAKER_10]: It was kind of split, so I was wondering if they were kind of doing... Yeah, same with Street Fighter.

1590
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:58,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh, okay.

1591
01:55:59,385 --> 01:56:00,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but no, this was 60 frames 3D

1592
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:06,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hard, which was amazing, because Mario Kart has not been hard in years.

1593
01:56:08,515 --> 01:56:23,880
[SPEAKER_05]: The paint gliding mechanic, when you had the jumps, that was interesting because you either had to slow down in the air to collect coins, or you knocked to the ground as fast as you could to continue racing.

1594
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:25,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a weird trade-off.

1595
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:28,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1596
01:56:29,241 --> 01:56:30,662
[SPEAKER_05]: The propeller, when you're underwater,

1597
01:56:31,932 --> 01:56:32,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1598
01:56:32,492 --> 01:56:33,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That was stupid.

1599
01:56:33,873 --> 01:56:34,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It did nothing for me.

1600
01:56:35,294 --> 01:56:35,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And Star Fox?

1601
01:56:37,255 --> 01:56:37,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Fox?

1602
01:56:37,895 --> 01:56:40,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it had a single player.

1603
01:56:40,717 --> 01:56:47,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I played multiplayer, though, and it felt a lot like the multiplayer that was from the DS game, which I kind of like.

1604
01:56:48,661 --> 01:56:49,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really nice-looking.

1605
01:56:51,503 --> 01:56:56,865
[SPEAKER_05]: What was cool, though, is that out of our four-people battle, I totally killed everybody in one.

1606
01:56:57,045 --> 01:56:57,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And the little...

1607
01:56:58,447 --> 01:56:59,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how funny.

1608
01:56:59,107 --> 01:56:59,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1609
01:57:27,156 --> 01:57:34,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what they're looking at, like if they're going to look up in the upper corner or something, or if they make a weird face randomly.

1610
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:38,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It's continuously refreshing, but fairly slow.

1611
01:57:38,300 --> 01:57:40,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So no picking your nose and playing Star Fox then?

1612
01:57:41,582 --> 01:57:46,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, but it'd be hard because of the way you have to hold the system.

1613
01:57:47,044 --> 01:57:48,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so that's cool.

1614
01:57:48,684 --> 01:57:51,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like you got your hands on at least a lot of the 3DS titles today.

1615
01:57:51,265 --> 01:57:54,127
[SPEAKER_10]: What was your favorite out of the bunch?

1616
01:57:54,247 --> 01:57:55,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably

1617
01:57:55,797 --> 01:57:59,559
[SPEAKER_05]: A tie between Mario Kart and Kid Icarus.

1618
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:02,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I forgot to say Kid Icarus, beautiful.

1619
01:58:03,622 --> 01:58:04,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely beautiful.

1620
01:58:04,823 --> 01:58:09,966
[SPEAKER_05]: The water in that game, as Nintendo is known to do, just was amazing.

1621
01:58:10,026 --> 01:58:10,806
[SPEAKER_05]: It blew me away.

1622
01:58:11,507 --> 01:58:12,727
[SPEAKER_10]: One more 3DS question.

1623
01:58:12,747 --> 01:58:19,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you're aware, but Nintendo unloaded onto the eShop today trailers for Animal Crossing and Paper Mario as well.

1624
01:58:20,412 --> 01:58:21,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Were those games anywhere to be seen?

1625
01:58:23,174 --> 01:58:28,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I saw because I really wanted to play at least Animal Crossing.

1626
01:58:28,338 --> 01:58:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I did download the trailer though when I got back to the hotel room for Animal Crossing and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it or not.

1627
01:58:36,283 --> 01:58:37,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

1628
01:58:38,605 --> 01:58:38,965
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1629
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:39,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks what?

1630
01:58:41,787 --> 01:58:45,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it's got some really cool new features.

1631
01:58:46,170 --> 01:58:49,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you guys... Yeah, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

1632
01:58:49,232 --> 01:58:50,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting on benches and swimming?

1633
01:58:51,174 --> 01:58:51,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1634
01:58:52,094 --> 01:58:52,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1635
01:58:52,235 --> 01:58:52,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1636
01:58:53,397 --> 01:58:54,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

1637
01:58:56,119 --> 01:58:58,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Was your mind blown by swimming?

1638
01:58:58,021 --> 01:59:00,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh my god, I can sit down.

1639
01:59:00,943 --> 01:59:04,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, Mikulatov, did Animal Crossing have colored balloons?

1640
01:59:06,067 --> 01:59:07,688
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, it wasn't that cool.

1641
01:59:09,209 --> 01:59:12,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what else did you do at the show today?

1642
01:59:12,512 --> 01:59:16,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Since you didn't stand in line for the Vita all day like Bobby had to, what did you get your hands on today?

1643
01:59:18,176 --> 01:59:21,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also want to quickly throw in that I played Zelda as well on the 3DS.

1644
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:25,071
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was fan-freaking-tastic.

1645
01:59:25,111 --> 01:59:27,733
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a close call for my tie for best 3DS game I played.

1646
01:59:28,233 --> 01:59:29,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?

1647
01:59:30,294 --> 01:59:31,094
[SPEAKER_10]: What made it so great?

1648
01:59:53,126 --> 01:59:56,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I could say I was playing a 13-year-old game.

1649
01:59:58,207 --> 02:00:02,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that the graphics are definitely much nicer.

1650
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The frame rate is crazy nice.

1651
02:00:07,669 --> 02:00:09,589
[SPEAKER_05]: The 3D effect, I didn't really care for.

1652
02:00:09,849 --> 02:00:11,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really do anything for me.

1653
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:18,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I did like people switching to the slingshot or the hookshot would...

1654
02:00:19,989 --> 02:00:26,833
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1655
02:00:27,293 --> 02:00:28,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what else did you get to play at the show today?

1656
02:00:30,475 --> 02:00:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1657
02:00:31,035 --> 02:00:36,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I firstly walked around, which is kind of, you know, a waste of a day.

1658
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:40,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the new Silent Hill game, both in 3D and in 2D.

1659
02:00:41,301 --> 02:00:41,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1660
02:00:41,822 --> 02:00:42,262
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you think?

1661
02:00:44,143 --> 02:00:45,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap, is what I think.

1662
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:53,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It was terrible in 3D and it was terrible in 3D, so this is definitely a pass for me.

1663
02:00:53,192 --> 02:00:54,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even interested.

1664
02:00:55,173 --> 02:00:56,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Why was it terrible?

1665
02:00:56,153 --> 02:00:56,894
[SPEAKER_10]: What did it play like?

1666
02:00:56,954 --> 02:00:59,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it more like the Wii Silent Hill, which I don't see?

1667
02:00:59,355 --> 02:01:00,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it more like Alan Wake?

1668
02:01:00,695 --> 02:01:01,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it Alan Wake?

1669
02:01:01,575 --> 02:01:02,056
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

1670
02:01:03,356 --> 02:01:04,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it was like Alan Wake.

1671
02:01:04,997 --> 02:01:05,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I like Alan Wake.

1672
02:01:05,997 --> 02:01:07,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even Shattered Memories.

1673
02:01:08,418 --> 02:01:15,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a generic survival horror that ran really choppy

1674
02:01:16,873 --> 02:01:18,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and was boring.

1675
02:01:19,135 --> 02:01:20,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And not scary.

1676
02:01:20,515 --> 02:01:27,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, at least in every other demo that I've played at E3 for a Silent Hill game, something has been kind of freaky about it.

1677
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:28,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Not this one.

1678
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:30,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just boring.

1679
02:01:31,482 --> 02:01:33,063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Silent Hill if it's not freaky.

1680
02:01:34,323 --> 02:01:34,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1681
02:01:35,644 --> 02:01:38,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just dull.

1682
02:01:38,606 --> 02:01:45,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, there was an enemy that jumped out and I think was supposed to scare me, but this more annoyed me because they aren't scary.

1683
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:45,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1684
02:01:46,511 --> 02:01:53,114
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I ever saw for Tomb Raider wasn't on the floor It's during the Microsoft conference So I was over in Square Enix's booth for a bit today And I didn't see it anywhere

1685
02:02:12,714 --> 02:02:16,657
[SPEAKER_05]: but I was also playing the entire demo for Final Fantasy XIII too.

1686
02:02:17,258 --> 02:02:18,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, what'd you think of that?

1687
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:23,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually really like XIII despite what other people think.

1688
02:02:23,803 --> 02:02:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like this one a lot.

1689
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:31,289
[SPEAKER_05]: They added some interesting features like a what's that called?

1690
02:02:31,329 --> 02:02:38,275
[SPEAKER_05]: The real-time segments like God of War and Heavy Rain have.

1691
02:02:39,376 --> 02:02:42,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was, you know, it's a little out of place but it was still neat

1692
02:02:42,714 --> 02:02:43,495
[SPEAKER_05]: But no Dressphere.

1693
02:03:08,134 --> 02:03:08,975
[SPEAKER_05]: No just fears.

1694
02:03:08,995 --> 02:03:12,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely don't know who the main character is that I was playing as.

1695
02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:40,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but there's a lot of Sonic stuff for their new Sonic game.

1696
02:03:40,159 --> 02:03:43,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually didn't look that bad.

1697
02:03:43,559 --> 02:03:46,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get to play it though yet.

1698
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:46,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1699
02:04:04,614 --> 02:04:07,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, you'll have to let us know when you do finally get your hands on it.

1700
02:04:08,155 --> 02:04:08,435
[SPEAKER_10]: What else?

1701
02:04:10,135 --> 02:04:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: There was this really neat Kinect game by Konami.

1702
02:04:14,056 --> 02:04:17,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Lead Me's, I believe.

1703
02:04:18,497 --> 02:04:22,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's both Kinect, and I believe it's a download title, they said.

1704
02:04:22,597 --> 02:04:24,818
[SPEAKER_05]: But it plays a little bit like Lemmings.

1705
02:04:25,678 --> 02:04:31,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So you stand in front of the Kinect sensor, and you become this wireframe character, pretty much.

1706
02:04:32,492 --> 02:04:39,816
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have these little adorable things that fall down and you have to get them to safety by using your limbs as bridges, stuff like that.

1707
02:04:41,117 --> 02:04:41,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1708
02:04:41,817 --> 02:04:48,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So you use your body to build the path to get these guys safe, basically.

1709
02:04:48,921 --> 02:04:49,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1710
02:04:49,561 --> 02:04:50,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1711
02:04:51,762 --> 02:04:53,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're a big fan of music games too.

1712
02:04:54,464 --> 02:04:56,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Any music games that you saw besides Dance Central 2?

1713
02:04:58,602 --> 02:05:05,367
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I saw DDR, but it's laughable nowadays, so it's not even worth talking about.

1714
02:05:06,027 --> 02:05:08,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, but I kind of wanted to know how laughable it was.

1715
02:05:11,071 --> 02:05:24,220
[SPEAKER_05]: They had four licenses, I believe, in the Red Fork Nominee Originals, and what I watched looked like the character models looked like DDR PC quality, but not as awesome.

1716
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:26,950
[SPEAKER_05]: because there was no Mr. Spanky or anything like that.

1717
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:29,771
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just like really poorly done character models.

1718
02:05:29,931 --> 02:05:31,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody loves Mr. Spanky.

1719
02:05:31,331 --> 02:05:33,672
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that?

1720
02:05:34,072 --> 02:05:34,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

1721
02:05:36,432 --> 02:05:37,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1722
02:05:37,132 --> 02:05:43,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not hear you because I'm hearing me talk every time I talk.

1723
02:05:43,353 --> 02:05:44,274
[SPEAKER_10]: No Dance Masters 2?

1724
02:05:45,934 --> 02:05:46,814
[SPEAKER_05]: No Dance Masters 2.

1725
02:05:47,794 --> 02:05:52,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know the only thing that's behind closed doors at Konami because I still have my hookup.

1726
02:05:53,561 --> 02:05:54,862
[SPEAKER_05]: is Pro Evolution Soccer.

1727
02:05:54,902 --> 02:05:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything else that's on the floor is all they're showing.

1728
02:05:58,424 --> 02:05:58,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1729
02:05:58,944 --> 02:06:00,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty sad also.

1730
02:06:01,005 --> 02:06:09,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this E3 has been kind of let down in terms of what's being shown despite having two new consoles.

1731
02:06:10,789 --> 02:06:13,050
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Dance Central 2?

1732
02:06:13,330 --> 02:06:14,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you say you had some hands-on time with that?

1733
02:06:16,071 --> 02:06:17,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I played Dance Central 2.

1734
02:06:17,092 --> 02:06:19,513
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fantastic.

1735
02:06:20,151 --> 02:06:23,233
[SPEAKER_05]: but it was just in Central with new characters and new moves.

1736
02:06:23,913 --> 02:06:25,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Harmonix showing anything else at their booth?

1737
02:06:25,554 --> 02:06:26,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't they supposed to be unveiling a new game?

1738
02:06:28,436 --> 02:06:30,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't see that at Harmonix booth.

1739
02:06:30,437 --> 02:06:32,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen a Harmonix booth at all.

1740
02:06:32,319 --> 02:06:33,039
[SPEAKER_05]: That was at Microsoft.

1741
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:34,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1742
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:37,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So it must be kind of a behind closed doors thing or in a conference room.

1743
02:06:37,602 --> 02:06:38,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1744
02:06:38,563 --> 02:06:39,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1745
02:06:40,704 --> 02:06:40,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1746
02:06:41,264 --> 02:06:44,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anything else that you had some hands-on time with you want to share with us tonight?

1747
02:06:45,707 --> 02:06:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wracking my brain.

1748
02:06:48,249 --> 02:06:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1749
02:06:50,839 --> 02:06:52,679
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your plan for tomorrow?

1750
02:06:52,739 --> 02:06:52,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm...

1751
02:07:16,943 --> 02:07:28,431
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be in a coin later to decide if I'm standing in line for Vita or Wii U. Personally, I'm leaning more towards Vita because I don't really think I care much about the Wii U at this point.

1752
02:07:29,372 --> 02:07:29,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

1753
02:07:30,032 --> 02:07:31,653
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, yeah, we need someone to go play the Vita.

1754
02:07:31,673 --> 02:07:33,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Bobby will get around to it tomorrow, so I think you should do that.

1755
02:07:35,516 --> 02:07:36,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the Vita?

1756
02:07:36,517 --> 02:07:36,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1757
02:07:37,157 --> 02:07:37,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try that one.

1758
02:07:38,458 --> 02:07:43,662
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, anything else you want to share before we let you go so we can get to some other callers from our chat room at 1-877-GAMELAR?

1759
02:07:46,072 --> 02:07:49,514
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing, okay, this will be cool to some of those people out there.

1760
02:07:50,735 --> 02:07:52,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with the lamer one first.

1761
02:07:52,455 --> 02:07:58,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was walking down Hollywood Boulevard yesterday because that's where my place I'm staying at is.

1762
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people follow reality TV at all or gay porn, I totally ran into Dustin Zito from either Real World or Flat Pad.

1763
02:08:08,924 --> 02:08:11,145
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty funny.

1764
02:08:11,205 --> 02:08:13,467
[SPEAKER_10]: The one with the sordid past, apparently, yes.

1765
02:08:13,847 --> 02:08:14,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1766
02:08:14,594 --> 02:08:17,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to just go up to him and be like, hey, I've seen you naked.

1767
02:08:17,495 --> 02:08:19,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That might have been awkward.

1768
02:08:19,775 --> 02:08:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1769
02:08:20,895 --> 02:08:21,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just slightly.

1770
02:08:23,176 --> 02:08:33,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But the actual cool thing that people may care about is right when I walked out of the Nokia theater today after Nintendo was done, I ran Snapchat instead of Kiriyama Oka.

1771
02:08:33,478 --> 02:08:34,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really cool.

1772
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:35,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.

1773
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:36,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you get a picture or anything or say hello?

1774
02:08:36,839 --> 02:08:38,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got a picture.

1775
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:39,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I said hello.

1776
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:40,420
[SPEAKER_05]: We shook hands.

1777
02:08:41,538 --> 02:08:45,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I tweeted him actually after the fact, and he tweeted back.

1778
02:08:45,702 --> 02:08:51,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And him tweeting back at me, somehow G4 is not following my Twitter, which is a waste of their time.

1779
02:08:53,529 --> 02:08:57,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be one of those spam Twitters, so look out, because I see a lot of those.

1780
02:08:57,953 --> 02:08:58,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real one.

1781
02:08:58,953 --> 02:09:00,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked into it.

1782
02:09:00,955 --> 02:09:01,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Weird.

1783
02:09:01,215 --> 02:09:02,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, whatever.

1784
02:09:02,877 --> 02:09:05,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, Miklatov, enjoy the rest of the show.

1785
02:09:05,719 --> 02:09:08,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Get some hands-on with Vita tomorrow and whatever else, and we'll talk to you again tomorrow, okay?

1786
02:09:10,086 --> 02:09:17,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, sounds good Alright, and try to stalk more celebrities for us Yes, I will do that Take care, buddy Alright, bye

1787
02:09:18,667 --> 02:09:23,991
[SPEAKER_10]: We're running a little long tonight, but we will open it up for a few quick, quick calls if anyone wants to call and just talk impressions.

1788
02:09:24,051 --> 02:09:25,052
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

1789
02:09:25,332 --> 02:09:25,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you at?

1790
02:09:26,072 --> 02:09:30,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we completely off base with what we're saying about Wii U or Kinect or the Vita?

1791
02:09:31,536 --> 02:09:36,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a call 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_10]: Before you give us a call again What were your impressions?

1795
02:09:44,346 --> 02:09:57,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure many of you You know, I didn't want to just recap the news tonight with you guys Because I'm sure most of you were watching it Although I'm liking hearing about these hidden things Like that Konami game that sounds like Lemmings I want to hear about more of those types of games

1796
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we'll see.

1799
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:19,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, we're doing research for Disney Connect Adventures.

1800
02:10:19,964 --> 02:10:21,924
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to make sure that Disney Connect game is accurate.

1801
02:10:22,284 --> 02:10:22,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1802
02:10:23,005 --> 02:10:24,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will leave no stone unturned.

1803
02:10:25,545 --> 02:10:27,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And there have to be hidden cats in the game for it to be accurate.

1804
02:10:28,227 --> 02:10:31,529
[SPEAKER_10]: But we will be back next Sunday on Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_08]: I have to point out, Sega did not announce a system

1813
02:11:15,504 --> 02:11:16,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1814
02:11:16,564 --> 02:11:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apology, that's kind of a gray area.

1815
02:11:20,745 --> 02:11:22,146
[SPEAKER_06]: He said they weren't even going to mention it.

1816
02:11:22,926 --> 02:11:23,566
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

1817
02:11:23,606 --> 02:11:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Which they let off with by saying, mentioning.

1818
02:11:25,767 --> 02:11:27,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let me get to the phones.

1819

[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:11:32,849 --> 02:11:33,969
[SPEAKER_07]: How's E3 going for you?

1824
02:11:34,009 --> 02:11:34,589
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts?

1825
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:38,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty awesome.

1826
02:11:39,191 --> 02:11:40,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want a Vita.

1827
02:11:41,091 --> 02:11:41,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1828
02:11:42,912 --> 02:11:43,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter vs Tekken.

1829
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:47,553
[SPEAKER_10]: But can't you get that on the PS3 or the 360?

1830
02:11:48,454 --> 02:11:49,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but come on, man.

1831
02:11:49,535 --> 02:11:50,456
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a portable version.

1832
02:11:50,596 --> 02:11:51,517
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just awesome.

1833
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:54,780
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think about this whole announcement that Cole's in it as well?

1834
02:11:55,921 --> 02:11:57,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what?

1835
02:11:57,803 --> 02:11:58,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1836
02:11:59,425 --> 02:11:59,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1837
02:11:59,945 --> 02:12:01,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of random, right?

1838
02:12:01,707 --> 02:12:04,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's pretty common for Namco, though.

1839
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:09,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you've got Tekken characters and, like, Urban Rain, so...

1840
02:12:10,712 --> 02:12:11,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's true.

1841
02:12:12,493 --> 02:12:14,554
[SPEAKER_07]: They do that kind of stuff all the time.

1842
02:12:14,854 --> 02:12:18,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo... I don't know.

1843
02:12:18,796 --> 02:12:21,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I still can't get my head around this name.

1844
02:12:22,279 --> 02:12:26,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know, the name's a little weird, but remember, I mean, and I don't like the name either, to be honest.

1845
02:12:27,001 --> 02:12:32,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they should have just called it the Nintendo U, and we could have just all said, oh, the U stands for Ultra, or something like that, you know?

1846
02:12:33,604 --> 02:12:40,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if they wanted to go back to, like, the old school, they could have called it the U-Force, like that old peripheral.

1847
02:12:41,368 --> 02:12:42,588
[SPEAKER_10]: The Super Wii.

1848
02:12:43,049 --> 02:12:45,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii, Wii.

1849
02:12:45,490 --> 02:12:46,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've been doing that all day, too.

1850
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:49,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just like, oh, my God.

1851
02:12:50,032 --> 02:12:50,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1852
02:12:52,202 --> 02:12:53,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Dammit, where was I going with this?

1853
02:12:53,923 --> 02:12:59,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's got an opinion on the Wii U. What do you think of the console itself besides just the name?

1854
02:13:02,969 --> 02:13:06,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I do think everyone will get used to eventually, by the way.

1855
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:08,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, do we have a network outage?

1856
02:13:08,392 --> 02:13:08,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we did.

1857
02:13:08,792 --> 02:13:09,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we had a drop.

1858
02:13:09,573 --> 02:13:09,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

1859
02:13:10,713 --> 02:13:11,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we still on Ustream?

1860
02:13:15,156 --> 02:13:17,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if we're even still broadcasting at this point.

1861
02:13:17,577 --> 02:13:18,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we are.

1862
02:13:18,998 --> 02:13:21,800
[SPEAKER_10]: But we had an internet... Okay, we had an internet downtime...

1863
02:13:23,411 --> 02:13:26,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wow, we just reconnected right away with Strelok.

1864
02:13:27,052 --> 02:13:31,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah, we had a weird drop thing happen there, so that's weird, but we're back.

1865
02:13:31,514 --> 02:13:32,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Silly internets.

1866
02:13:33,054 --> 02:13:33,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, silly internets.

1867
02:13:34,434 --> 02:13:35,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, whatever.

1868
02:13:35,875 --> 02:13:39,476
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what's on your mind with the Wii U?

1869
02:13:40,476 --> 02:13:43,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see more from it, just, you know, this Ectema stuff.

1870
02:13:44,978 --> 02:13:49,279
[SPEAKER_07]: The controller is kind of interesting, even though I honestly really can't...

1871
02:13:50,575 --> 02:14:17,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to use too much of it but it's an interesting concept but really what has me excited is something from the Microsoft it's not the only thing that I really cared about from the Microsoft press conference but something they kind of touched on briefly was the whole Bing thing with Kinect where you could you can

1872
02:14:19,526 --> 02:14:21,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell it what to play.

1873
02:14:23,308 --> 02:14:26,650
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to search for a game and then play it by voice, you can do that.

1874
02:14:27,130 --> 02:14:28,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really exciting.

1875
02:14:28,791 --> 02:14:30,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox, Bing, pornography.

1876
02:14:30,892 --> 02:14:31,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1877
02:14:32,513 --> 02:14:32,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1878
02:14:33,753 --> 02:14:34,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Indeed.

1879
02:14:34,093 --> 02:14:42,878
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people are kind of on what Microsoft showed.

1880
02:14:43,058 --> 02:14:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of the press conference overall?

1881
02:14:45,552 --> 02:14:47,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall, the Microsoft conference, yeah, exactly.

1882
02:14:47,734 --> 02:14:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just kind of like, really?

1883
02:14:48,555 --> 02:14:49,115
[SPEAKER_07]: More shooters?

1884
02:14:49,415 --> 02:14:49,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't care.

1885
02:14:50,856 --> 02:14:51,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Too many first-person shooters, huh?

1886
02:14:51,957 --> 02:14:52,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many shooters.

1887
02:14:52,898 --> 02:14:54,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It's oversaturated.

1888
02:14:54,279 --> 02:14:54,539
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1889
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:56,401
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to let you go as we get some other calls.

1890
02:14:56,461 --> 02:14:58,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we do, any other final thoughts for us?

1891
02:15:01,045 --> 02:15:02,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want more.

1892
02:15:03,087 --> 02:15:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I want Konami to announce the Snatcher game, but that didn't happen.

1893
02:15:08,891 --> 02:15:09,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, it's probably not going to.

1894
02:15:10,092 --> 02:15:11,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't hold your breath.

1895
02:15:11,053 --> 02:15:11,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say.

1896
02:15:11,694 --> 02:15:11,934
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1897
02:15:11,954 --> 02:15:12,614
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, buddy.

1898
02:15:12,634 --> 02:15:14,496
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to let you go to get some more calls, but have a good one, okay?

1899
02:15:15,037 --> 02:15:15,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks.

1900
02:15:15,597 --> 02:15:16,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thank you.

1901
02:15:16,558 --> 02:15:17,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for putting up with the internet outage, too.

1902
02:15:17,998 --> 02:15:18,639
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of weird.

1903
02:15:19,139 --> 02:15:20,400
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just another day here at OLR.

1904
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:22,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've been having... Hey, what's up, guys?

1905
02:15:22,681 --> 02:15:23,421
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Kaijudo.

1906
02:15:23,681 --> 02:15:24,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Kaijudo, what's on your mind, buddy?

1907
02:15:26,302 --> 02:15:33,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say that the Wii U, the controller, scares the fucking hell out of me.

1908
02:15:33,346 --> 02:15:34,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Why does it scare you?

1909
02:15:35,907 --> 02:15:38,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it looks like it's going to break.

1910
02:15:38,628 --> 02:15:40,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, all the stuff they want you to do with it,

1911
02:15:41,058 --> 02:15:43,502
[SPEAKER_13]: doesn't seem very safe for the controller.

1912
02:15:43,522 --> 02:15:48,048
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like putting it down on the floor, sticking it on that gun and swinging it around.

1913
02:15:49,114 --> 02:15:50,996
[SPEAKER_13]: It just looks like a lot of kids are going to break that thing.

1914
02:15:51,116 --> 02:16:03,027
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think you're kind of on to something here because I can't tell you, and this is kind of embarrassing, but I can't tell you how many headsets I've broken on my computer because I'll sit it down on my chair when I get up to go to the bathroom and then when I come back, crunch, my fat ass sits on it and crunches it.

1915
02:16:03,267 --> 02:16:04,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to be really careful.

1916
02:16:04,729 --> 02:16:12,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you're going to need, everybody needs a coffee table to put that controller on and that's away from the dogs and the cats that tend to eat things.

1917
02:16:12,636 --> 02:16:13,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like the big...

1918
02:16:13,857 --> 02:16:19,402
[SPEAKER_13]: The big glass on it, it's like, you know, it just, to me, it seems like it's going to just break within a couple of weeks.

1919
02:16:19,442 --> 02:16:20,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, though.

1920
02:16:20,423 --> 02:16:21,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real.

1921
02:16:21,263 --> 02:16:22,564
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really glass.

1922
02:16:22,624 --> 02:16:25,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that cheap plastic-y thing that the DSs use.

1923
02:16:25,147 --> 02:16:27,068
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same touchscreen from a DS, just bigger.

1924
02:16:28,169 --> 02:16:28,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1925
02:16:28,429 --> 02:16:29,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that.

1926
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:30,111
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like glass to me.

1927
02:16:30,231 --> 02:16:32,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they will get, it'll still get broken, but yeah.

1928
02:16:32,853 --> 02:16:38,638
[SPEAKER_10]: So, well, let's say that controller is invincible.

1929
02:16:39,358 --> 02:16:41,160
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your thoughts about Wii U otherwise?

1930
02:16:43,424 --> 02:16:46,547
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as being innovative, I think they're going somewhere with it.

1931
02:16:46,707 --> 02:16:48,488
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to agree with Bobby Blackwolf.

1932
02:16:48,548 --> 02:16:51,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw a lot of potential with what they were showing that you could do with it.

1933
02:16:52,391 --> 02:17:04,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's still not something that I want to run out and get right away until I see something that I really like, but I do appreciate them for trying to bring some innovation to the game.

1934
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:09,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though they're recycling the same old games, just putting Mario on everything, but

1935
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:14,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than that, I mean, they are innovative with their shit.

1936
02:17:16,772 --> 02:17:22,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I get a lot of feedback, by the way, just to let you know.

1937
02:17:22,454 --> 02:17:23,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like hearing myself talking.

1938
02:17:23,554 --> 02:17:25,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we have an echo thing going on.

1939
02:17:25,975 --> 02:17:27,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have the Ustream running?

1940
02:17:27,635 --> 02:17:28,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you've got to pause it.

1941
02:17:29,516 --> 02:17:35,858
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing is, at what price do you think the Wii U becomes too expensive right now? $3.99.

1942
02:17:40,371 --> 02:17:42,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So if it's $3.98, you might be there.

1943
02:17:43,373 --> 02:17:46,657
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I get it at $2.98.

1944
02:17:48,198 --> 02:17:46,657
$2.99, $2.98.

1945
02:17:49,139 --> 02:17:53,102
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, Kajudo, we're going to let you go to see if we can get another call, but thanks so much for the call.

1946
02:17:53,143 --> 02:17:53,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, buddy.

1947
02:17:54,464 --> 02:17:55,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, goodnight.

1948
02:17:55,685 --> 02:17:56,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

1949
02:17:56,165 --> 02:17:59,246
[SPEAKER_10]: 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1950
02:17:59,286 --> 02:17:59,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a call.

1951
02:18:00,447 --> 02:18:05,789
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we start to wrap up here while we wait for one more call, where are you guys at?

1952
02:18:05,849 --> 02:18:10,091
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of people feel the need to rank Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony.

1953
02:18:10,471 --> 02:18:12,952
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me kind of leave it here with this.

1954
02:18:13,192 --> 02:18:17,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of what we've talked about tonight, what are you most excited about?

1955
02:18:17,294 --> 02:18:19,955
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you most interested in hearing more about?

1956
02:18:20,775 --> 02:18:21,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura?

1957
02:18:21,555 --> 02:18:22,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing.

1958
02:18:23,036 --> 02:18:23,296
Okay.

1959
02:18:24,837 --> 02:18:25,238
[SPEAKER_12]: No, really.

1960
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:31,063
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, I'm still actually kind of meh about a bunch of it, really.

1961
02:18:32,825 --> 02:18:35,787
[SPEAKER_08]: There were things I had hoped to see that didn't pop out.

1962
02:18:37,109 --> 02:18:42,694
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, it was a lot more of what I expected, although I do really like that new controller.

1963
02:18:43,154 --> 02:18:48,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more excited about that controller for the Wii U, even though the name is, you know, stupid.

1964
02:18:48,599 --> 02:18:53,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll get to the other feedback in studio here in a minute, but we do have another call coming in, so let's get to that.

1965
02:18:53,222 --> 02:18:54,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1966
02:18:55,604 --> 02:18:57,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is Blender from Napa, what's going on?

1967
02:18:58,006 --> 02:18:59,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Blender, what's on your mind?

1968
02:19:00,127 --> 02:19:11,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing, I just, one thing, I don't know if you guys mentioned, I was like five minutes late getting into the show, and nobody mentioned, I was really interested in the Bioshock Infinite

1969
02:19:11,548 --> 02:19:12,749
[SPEAKER_03]: with the move support.

1970
02:19:31,344 --> 02:19:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll finally get to wipe the cobwebs off of my move.

1971
02:19:33,926 --> 02:19:36,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, kind of like Gabe Newell last year.

1972
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:53,460
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, we like money.

1973
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:56,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, all right, put move support in your game.

1974
02:19:56,201 --> 02:19:59,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, oh, okay, and say something good about the move for us.

1975
02:20:00,222 --> 02:20:02,082
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I can do that because I like money.

1976
02:20:02,302 --> 02:20:04,883
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Gabe Newell last year with the whole Valve thing.

1977
02:20:05,623 --> 02:20:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1978
02:20:08,483 --> 02:20:09,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what else caught your eye, Blender?

1979
02:20:10,964 --> 02:20:14,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Uncharted 3, of course.

1980
02:20:14,604 --> 02:20:16,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just a huge Uncharted fan.

1981
02:20:16,025 --> 02:20:17,565
[SPEAKER_03]: The multiplayer looks fantastic.

1982
02:20:17,945 --> 02:20:18,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

1983
02:20:18,925 --> 02:20:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, well, see, I only own one system.

1984
02:20:22,107 --> 02:20:26,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I only own the Sony, so... So there's not a lot for you on the other ones.

1985
02:20:26,789 --> 02:20:32,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Did maybe, I have to ask it, did Microsoft or Nintendo maybe make you think twice about picking up another one?

1986
02:20:33,693 --> 02:20:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Nintendo, but Microsoft, I mean, I'm still kind of on the edge.

1987
02:20:38,115 --> 02:20:41,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not a fanboy.

1988
02:20:42,057 --> 02:20:44,458
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had the money, I would pick up another system, you know.

1989
02:20:45,338 --> 02:20:45,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just...

1990
02:20:47,702 --> 02:20:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly, what I've been listening to is just for the Microsoft thing.

1991
02:20:53,968 --> 02:20:54,188
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1992
02:20:54,248 --> 02:20:57,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Would be like, if they did it, they'd need to make a Kinect, like an L.A.

1993
02:20:58,031 --> 02:20:59,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire Kinect game.

1994
02:21:00,353 --> 02:21:01,474
[SPEAKER_03]: That would tell me.

1995
02:21:01,554 --> 02:21:03,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Where I can just slap the bitch if I think they're lying.

1996
02:21:03,656 --> 02:21:05,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1997
02:21:05,858 --> 02:21:06,098
Pop.

1998
02:21:06,138 --> 02:21:06,459
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1999
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:10,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Or have your partner do, hey, go over there and go investigate this for me.

2000
02:21:10,022 --> 02:21:10,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go have a beer.

2001
02:21:10,883 --> 02:21:11,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2002
02:21:11,368 --> 02:21:11,689
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2003
02:21:12,049 --> 02:21:14,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Blinder, any other last thoughts for us before we let you go?

2004
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:14,773
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's it.

2005
02:21:14,933 --> 02:21:15,214
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2006
02:21:15,474 --> 02:21:15,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

2007
02:21:16,315 --> 02:21:16,876
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you later.

2008
02:21:16,896 --> 02:21:17,076
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2009
02:21:17,096 --> 02:21:17,377
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

2010
02:21:17,517 --> 02:21:17,737
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2011
02:21:17,777 --> 02:21:17,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2012
02:21:18,518 --> 02:21:18,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2013
02:21:18,939 --> 02:21:20,621
[SPEAKER_10]: We are going to go ahead and close the Skype line, guys.

2014
02:21:20,641 --> 02:21:22,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

2015
02:21:22,344 --> 02:21:27,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget, we're going to be back tomorrow, and we'll have a little more time to take more calls tomorrow.

2016
02:21:27,782 --> 02:21:29,283
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you didn't get through tonight, don't be mad.

2017
02:21:29,523 --> 02:21:32,205
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

2018
02:21:32,225 --> 02:21:35,547
[SPEAKER_10]: We will go to the mailbag tomorrow because we won't have press conferences.

2019
02:21:35,807 --> 02:21:37,668
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to hear about other games tomorrow.

2020
02:21:37,968 --> 02:21:39,089
[SPEAKER_10]: We still haven't talked Skyrim.

2021
02:21:39,109 --> 02:21:40,349
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to talk a little bit about Skyrim.

2022
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:41,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the other games.

2023
02:21:41,310 --> 02:21:43,051
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll probably dive into Bioshock a little more.

2024
02:21:43,291 --> 02:21:47,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever it is that Bobby and Shane can get their hands on, we're going to talk a little more about tomorrow.

2025
02:21:47,374 --> 02:21:49,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And your calls will really help fill in and emails tomorrow.

2026
02:21:50,035 --> 02:21:51,175
[SPEAKER_08]: and Chibi Wolf.

2027
02:21:51,576 --> 02:21:52,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And Chibi Wolf, let's hope.

2028
02:21:53,476 --> 02:21:55,957
[SPEAKER_10]: For now, I want to go around and get everybody's kind of last thought here.

2029
02:21:56,337 --> 02:22:00,739
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, guys, sorry to cut it off, but we were only intending on going until 9 and it's almost 9.30.

2030
02:22:01,579 --> 02:22:05,380
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to try and wrap up and everybody's being a real trooper for staying with us.

2031
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:08,481
[SPEAKER_10]: But Dan, what are you walking away from this most excited about?

2032
02:22:09,262 --> 02:22:12,503
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii U. The Wii U. Why is that?

2033
02:22:14,904 --> 02:22:16,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be really awesome.

2034
02:22:17,228 --> 02:22:19,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it could fucking suck.

2035
02:22:19,269 --> 02:22:20,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's exactly it.

2036
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:29,814
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo comes through with the price, they come through with the games, and some people do some great development for it, I mean, it could be really, really smooth.

2037
02:22:30,835 --> 02:22:32,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And it could do a lot of cool stuff.

2038
02:22:32,696 --> 02:22:35,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it could be an absolute waste of technology.

2039
02:22:35,057 --> 02:22:37,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nintendo's scary because Nintendo does that.

2040
02:22:37,818 --> 02:22:40,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Nintendo hits something and they just knock it out of the park.

2041
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:45,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometimes Nintendo's just like, yeah, look at our great thing.

2042
02:22:45,362 --> 02:22:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: We have no fucking idea what to do with it

2043
02:23:07,589 --> 02:23:17,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, maybe Sony's learned a thing, but it's just a better PSP where the Vita could be something completely new.

2044
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:20,523
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't just say, okay, here's a new Wii controller.

2045
02:23:20,563 --> 02:23:24,788
[SPEAKER_06]: They said, here is a new different thing that no one's done before.

2046
02:23:25,649 --> 02:23:27,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could be pretty slick.

2047
02:23:28,382 --> 02:23:29,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with you there.

2048
02:23:29,482 --> 02:23:36,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go to chat real quick because one of the other games that's being brought up in chat right now that we didn't get into depth about today, Randy Yu says, Batman, Batman, Batman.

2049
02:23:37,285 --> 02:23:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And Blender says, did you see the Catwoman trailer, Randy Yu?

2050
02:23:40,045 --> 02:23:42,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Which was shown at one of the press conferences.

2051
02:23:42,306 --> 02:23:49,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I got to say, there were two things out of the whole three press conferences that made me audibly say, what?

2052
02:23:50,828 --> 02:23:51,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2053
02:23:51,568 --> 02:23:53,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I said wow twice during the press conferences.

2054
02:23:54,209 --> 02:23:56,990
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them was the $499 3D monitor.

2055
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I said wow.

2056
02:23:58,011 --> 02:24:03,392
[SPEAKER_10]: The other one was when they announced that Batman Arkham City was going to be on the Wii U. Batman on Nintendo.

2057
02:24:04,533 --> 02:24:05,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

2058
02:24:05,073 --> 02:24:06,293
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just crazy to me.

2059
02:24:07,254 --> 02:24:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't have to make huge graphic compromises, it means that the Wii U has at least the horsepower of the current generation of consoles.

2060
02:24:14,028 --> 02:24:14,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

2061
02:24:14,769 --> 02:24:16,031
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

2062
02:24:16,872 --> 02:24:18,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, I know you still need to answer.

2063
02:24:18,634 --> 02:24:19,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go first here.

2064
02:24:20,336 --> 02:24:23,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say the thing I am most excited to see more about.

2065
02:24:23,881 --> 02:24:24,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be honest.

2066
02:24:24,702 --> 02:24:26,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go kind of off the beaten path here a little bit.

2067
02:24:26,584 --> 02:24:29,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Although the Wii U, yes, of course I'm going to see more of that.

2068
02:24:29,207 --> 02:24:30,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I really just feel like...

2069
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:33,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything is fucking speculation until next year.

2070
02:24:34,193 --> 02:24:35,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so, so early.

2071
02:24:35,754 --> 02:24:39,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we know that most of the rumors were true and we've seen where they're going with it.

2072
02:24:39,578 --> 02:24:47,907
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me, the more immediate question, I actually want to see these hardcore games with the Kinect functionality.

2073
02:24:48,247 --> 02:24:50,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see how the public responds to it.

2074
02:24:50,569 --> 02:24:51,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see...

2075
02:24:53,152 --> 02:24:56,154
[SPEAKER_10]: When I play Connect, I do really like it.

2076
02:24:56,394 --> 02:25:01,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really want so much more out of the Connect.

2077
02:25:01,458 --> 02:25:04,340
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really curious how some of these shooters are going to play.

2078
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:09,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of even want to play the Ghost Recon game just to check it out.

2079
02:25:09,804 --> 02:25:11,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That is never a game I'd be interested in otherwise.

2080
02:25:12,025 --> 02:25:12,566
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so weird.

2081
02:25:12,606 --> 02:25:13,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll save you the trouble.

2082
02:25:14,087 --> 02:25:15,628
[SPEAKER_06]: The response is going to be, eh.

2083
02:25:18,353 --> 02:25:20,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe two people are going to buy it.

2084
02:25:20,495 --> 02:25:24,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Twitter will say, but what will the dollars say?

2085
02:25:24,927 --> 02:25:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the dollars are going to say.

2086
02:25:26,748 --> 02:25:27,168
[SPEAKER_06]: You think?

2087
02:25:27,388 --> 02:25:28,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I disagree.

2088
02:25:29,109 --> 02:25:32,411
[SPEAKER_06]: In my life, I've dealt with a lot of mainstream gamers.

2089
02:25:32,771 --> 02:25:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked at game stores for 10 years, and I've seen those guys come into the store, and the Twitter crowd, as much as I hate to say it, is kind of the voice of the quote-unquote hardcore gamer, the guy who cares enough to be

2090
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:56,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting on the computer watching that press conference and not because he's going to come on here tonight and talk about it.

2091
02:25:58,045 --> 02:26:01,628
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just not going to be a lot of interest.

2092
02:26:01,848 --> 02:26:03,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be sweet if they could pull it off.

2093
02:26:03,589 --> 02:26:06,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the first guy to admit I have an unopened connect.

2094
02:26:06,151 --> 02:26:06,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Jamie's.

2095
02:26:09,284 --> 02:26:10,125
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2096
02:26:29,608 --> 02:26:31,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Ghost Squad on the Wii is fucking awesome Ghost Squad is an awesome game

2097
02:26:40,856 --> 02:26:42,957
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Wii Zapper is a good Ghost Squad controller.

2098
02:26:43,017 --> 02:26:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted the Ghost Squad rifle.

2099
02:26:44,579 --> 02:26:46,039
[SPEAKER_09]: No, okay, that's a little too far there.

2100
02:26:46,059 --> 02:26:48,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's got the little trigger and it's got the pull thing.

2101
02:26:48,541 --> 02:26:48,921
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

2102
02:26:49,001 --> 02:26:50,002
[SPEAKER_06]: The Leico perfect shot.

2103
02:26:50,162 --> 02:26:51,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, that's a little better.

2104
02:26:51,823 --> 02:26:56,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted the Ghost Squad rifle to be the Xbox 360 rifle and it just never happened.

2105
02:26:56,346 --> 02:26:58,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that new Kinect looking rifle.

2106
02:26:58,448 --> 02:26:59,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, not Kinect, the Move rifle, by the way.

2107
02:26:59,969 --> 02:27:00,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks cool.

2108
02:27:00,589 --> 02:27:15,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say though, Dan, I'm not disagreeing with your perspective necessarily about who the hardcore gamers are and all that, but I gotta say, I really think that with no Wii U this year, Microsoft kind of has that Nintendo soccer mom casual market cornered this year.

2109
02:27:15,883 --> 02:27:19,505
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just going to be interesting to see what Kinect games rise to the top.

2110
02:27:19,765 --> 02:27:22,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it just be Dance Central 2, number one seller this year?

2111
02:27:22,647 --> 02:27:27,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Or will that Kinect functionality float a hardcore game up to the top?

2112
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:31,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they need to come up with their Wii Sports Resort or with their Wii Fit.

2113
02:27:32,353 --> 02:27:35,214
[SPEAKER_06]: That one game that just every Kinect owner has to have.

2114
02:27:35,234 --> 02:27:35,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Central.

2115
02:27:35,775 --> 02:27:36,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Dance Central.

2116
02:27:36,935 --> 02:27:38,076
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not Dance Central.

2117
02:27:38,496 --> 02:27:47,483
[SPEAKER_06]: All the dance fans love Dance Central, but the common folks aren't just like, oh man, Dance Central, because I was in a room full of common people the other day, and nobody really liked Dance Central.

2118
02:27:47,523 --> 02:27:47,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2119
02:27:48,344 --> 02:27:54,929
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I would say Dance Central, not just like music fans like us who've been following it for years, but like rock band fans, which is a much wider audience.

2120
02:27:55,290 --> 02:27:56,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Air guitar freaks!

2121
02:27:56,771 --> 02:27:58,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we gotta get towards wrapping up.

2122
02:27:58,252 --> 02:27:59,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotta let Loki have his say.

2123
02:27:59,633 --> 02:28:01,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what left you wanting more?

2124
02:28:02,675 --> 02:28:03,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Saints Row 3.

2125
02:28:04,895 --> 02:28:05,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Earth Saints Row the 3rd.

2126
02:28:06,316 --> 02:28:06,937
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

2127
02:28:07,217 --> 02:28:10,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And goddammit, I wish they'd just announce a new Grand Theft Auto and be done with it.

2128
02:28:11,241 --> 02:28:11,942
[SPEAKER_06]: No kidding.

2129
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:13,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And Half-Life 2 Episode 3.

2130
02:28:14,104 --> 02:28:14,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Valve.

2131
02:28:15,005 --> 02:28:16,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you right in the ear.

2132
02:28:16,466 --> 02:28:17,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it's coming.

2133
02:28:17,287 --> 02:28:18,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

2134
02:28:18,328 --> 02:28:20,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Just come out and say it.

2135
02:28:21,411 --> 02:28:22,092
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really it.

2136
02:28:23,467 --> 02:28:24,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fuck that!

2137
02:28:45,797 --> 02:28:50,923
[SPEAKER_09]: What titles Nintendo is going to have that are exclusive to this that are actually going to be worth my time.

2138
02:28:51,443 --> 02:28:53,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of saying, hey, look, we got this really cool thing.

2139
02:28:53,806 --> 02:28:55,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Because here's the problem.

2140
02:28:55,527 --> 02:29:01,914
[SPEAKER_09]: They're hoping that the publishers are going to be creative enough to use this technology that they built.

2141
02:29:02,435 --> 02:29:06,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time I checked, it never was a problem that, oh, these games aren't creative enough.

2142
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:07,320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's...

2143
02:29:07,901 --> 02:29:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we just don't give a crap about fleshing out this game to the point of, you know, attracting other people other than casual gamers because, eh, casual gamers still buy whatever as long as it's $19.99.

2144
02:29:23,522 --> 02:29:23,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2145
02:29:24,903 --> 02:29:29,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anything you guys are hoping... Well, Loki, you're not going to be here tomorrow.

2146
02:29:29,285 --> 02:29:30,646
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to be here.

2147
02:29:30,806 --> 02:29:33,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And Dan will be here and DarkSakura and myself.

2148
02:29:34,248 --> 02:29:39,511
[SPEAKER_10]: But since you kind of have... This is your last chance to say whatever you want on the show here about E3 till next Sunday.

2149
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:42,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you kind of want to get out about your thoughts on the show?

2150
02:29:43,734 --> 02:29:47,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, other than just like some of the stuff that's already been out.

2151
02:29:47,676 --> 02:29:49,477
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing really that's like brand new.

2152
02:29:49,497 --> 02:29:53,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing out of those conferences that was really just caught me off guard.

2153
02:29:53,740 --> 02:29:56,362
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't know.

2154
02:29:56,482 --> 02:29:58,624
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just no real surprises.

2155
02:29:58,784 --> 02:30:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing like, oh my God, that's so amazing.

2156
02:30:00,585 --> 02:30:01,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And you could see it.

2157
02:30:01,325 --> 02:30:02,946
[SPEAKER_06]: The crowds weren't into it.

2158
02:30:02,986 --> 02:30:07,930
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like one or two pops when something that they were supposed to pop at came.

2159
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:12,253
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of pauses where the companies expected applause and nobody was into it.

2160
02:30:13,402 --> 02:30:20,998
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a very apathetic attitude even the big stuff that people were supposed to be into just didn't win people over

2161
02:30:22,925 --> 02:30:26,306
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back tomorrow to do some more E3 coverage.

2162
02:30:26,686 --> 02:30:30,367
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, myself, Dan, and you guys in our chat room.

2163
02:30:30,387 --> 02:30:36,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, in LA, a big thanks to Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov are both in LA.

2164
02:30:36,249 --> 02:30:38,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll be back with more game opinions tomorrow.

2165
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:41,850
[SPEAKER_10]: But for tonight, we say goodnight.

2166
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

2167
02:30:43,351 --> 02:30:47,272
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you back here tomorrow at our little temporary space here on Ustream.

2168
02:30:47,872 --> 02:30:49,732
[SPEAKER_10]: 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

2169
02:30:50,393 --> 02:30:51,473
[SPEAKER_10]: No video yet.

2170
02:30:52,153 --> 02:31:00,176
[SPEAKER_10]: But hopefully you stream in the future, and not tomorrow either, but you stream in the future, we might have some more video features, kind of like we used to back in the day on OLR.

2171
02:31:00,376 --> 02:31:04,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides that, I'm so completely unglamorous right now, I can't be on video or it will explode.

2172
02:31:04,978 --> 02:31:07,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to do it for our E3 coverage tonight.

2173
02:31:07,139 --> 02:31:09,400
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back tomorrow, 7 o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

2174
02:31:09,640 --> 02:31:10,300
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you here.
