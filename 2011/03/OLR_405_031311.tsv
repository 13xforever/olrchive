13790	24137	Tonight, March 13th, 2011, Microsoft shatters sales records, EA bans a player from Dragon Age 2 unintentionally, and despite what's happened to Guitar Hero, could Dance Hero be a reality?
31687	36068	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36128	38529	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38889	46150	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at allgames.com, www.allgames.com.
46510	47351	My name is Rob Roberts.
47371	53612	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, not here tonight sadly, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54012	55652	She is out of town.
55872	57013	Don't feel too bad for her though.
57033	58093	She's on her way to Disneyland.
58473	62714	So, you know, how can you feel sorry for her when she's going to the happiest freaking place on Earth?
63095	64815	And we're stuck here doing the show in her place.
65495	65735	Oh, well.
66195	69176	Anyhow, so she might be joining us a little later for a call.
69196	69537	We'll see.
69597	73738	But joining us here, as always, say hello at least to Tech Master Loki is here.
74258	74398	Matt2
95186	96047	Hello, Rob No.
96067	96047	1.
96127	96887	How are you doing, Matt 2?
97147	97587	I'm doing well.
97607	98008	Yourself?
98248	99168	I'm pretty good.
99348	101069	I feel like we just had this conversation.
101169	105832	It seems like deja vu, but we're not in the Matrix or anything, so it can't be.
106192	112956	For the podcast listeners, this is take two of the live show because we had a little screw up, but just pretend I didn't ask you these questions just five minutes ago.
113716	118822	Anyhow, Matt number two has been here in about two years and five studios ago.
118922	122246	No, we've had like five studios throughout all of OLR.
122706	123928	You were in the last one that we did.
123948	125670	So it's been a little while.
126611	131196	But some of the folks that listen to Horde House, my Warcraft show, might know you as Grandpa Warcraft.
131696	132297	Yes, that's right.
132357	134379	I am the Deckard Cain of your show.
134499	134700	Yes.
135413	137114	All right, so what types of video games do you play?
137134	137614	Just tell us generally.
137634	142457	I'll ask you about your gaming week in a little bit, but generally, what types of video games do you like to play and what consoles do you own?
142617	145458	It's mainly MMOs for the moment and a lot of iOS games.
145559	149661	I'm playing a lot of games on the iPhone 4 and soon my iPad 2, if it ever gets here.
150861	153383	But I own a 360 and I'm still debating whether getting a Kinect.
154183	183537	and uh but my console history goes way back to Atari 5200 and every NES system and then made the transition to PC games when uh games like Descent and Duke Nukem 3D were uber back in the day so is that really like where you like to game the most is PC it kind of fell into PC I got the 360 because of uh Halo I was definitely a fan of the Halo series until recently and other first-person shooters but um oh you say that a little like stinging like I did not like a certain Halo game that really ruined it for me is that what's going on
183797	191039	Oh, I bought Reach, and I beat it on hard, not legendary, within the first few hours.
191059	194460	I went, oh, this is going to be focusing on the multiplayer side, isn't it?
194520	195201	And sure enough, it does.
196281	203583	Which I'm an okay fan of, but I do like a lot of story, and I was really disappointed in how quick the first person went through.
203823	208865	But, you know, there's other first person shooters out there, Call of Duty, Gears of War, things like that, but
209755	215380	For the time being, it's 360, debating on the Kinect, and a lot of Warcraft on the PC and iOS 4 games.
215500	217181	You do anything else on the PC besides Warcraft?
217822	218943	Not as of recent.
218983	220144	I tried Star Trek Online.
220684	222485	Jamie Summers convinced me to give it a try.
222646	223026	Of course.
224327	226609	As a huge, huge, huge Trekkie, tried it.
226629	228811	All your WoW characters are named after Star Trek characters.
228851	229832	They used to be.
230892	233935	I thought you had one named, like, B'Elanna, and I'm like, I know who that is.
234135	234375	I do.
234956	236557	I was the other guy that watched Voyager.
236757	237318	When I first...
239079	239660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
256201	259264	I never leveled her up, she's a rogue sitting there collecting dust, obviously.
260045	265411	And now they're all Latin names, because now I'm a lion, so it's much more formal on that side of the... Yeah, exactly.
265431	271398	But PC games-wise, A Fable, I played a lot of Fable back in the day, and stuff like that.
271718	274542	All right, so it sounds like you've played quite a variety of different things.
274822	275163	I try to.
275283	276685	Do you do the iOS stuff now?
277105	279429	That's where gaming seems to be going in some ways.
279449	279569	I do.
279589	280430	At least it's casual.
280550	284716	I confess I downloaded Angry Birds Seasons today because I figured it's appropriate.
284736	285477	It's St.
285497	286678	Patrick's Day on Thursday.
286718	287019	Ah, okay.
287759	316524	they play Irish music in the background and there's shamrocks everywhere and pots of gold if you hit you get bonus points so yeah that's my new addiction I did download reluctantly or regretfully Mega Man 2 and it doesn't work when you don't have an actual tactile controller don't get me started I know and I listened to your podcast about it and it made sense but I love Mega Man it's a huge huge favorite series of mine so I wanted to get it because I'm a supporter and I can't get through the air stage because I can't manipulate the buttons so
317369	327511	Well they have those little stickers that you can put on your iPad or iPods or whatever to create tactile controls for the touchpad stuff.
328102	333927	I might invest in that with my iPad 2 because little buttons like on my phone and you got to take them off and put it back on.
333967	334327	I don't know.
334367	335568	They actually have some pretty sweet ones.
335648	339792	There's ones that were through like ThinkGeek or whatever.
339832	345436	They had actual, looks like an arcade joystick that plugs on there, which is kind of cool.
345517	349680	And then they had some that just kind of stick to the side suction cup wise.
349800	352062	But apparently they're pretty decent.
352122	355665	I mean, but really they just need to come out with something better.
355985	362988	So, yeah, when it comes to the iPhone 4, and my iPhone 4 and iOS games is kind of my main focus right now.
363028	364429	I'm not on WoW or the PC games.
365489	366810	They're good bathroom games.
368310	370951	Cut the Rope is a great potty game, actually.
371111	372032	For cutting the rope?
372672	372952	Yes.
373292	373972	For pinching the loaf?
376654	378614	Out on the iStore coming soon.
379455	380355	Anyhow, speaking of St.
380375	381336	Patrick's Day, since you brought up St.
381356	382676	Patrick's Day, you were kind enough.
383036	383637	I like this.
383677	385958	When we invite you to the show, you do bribe us a little bit.
386738	392320	You brought this gigantic beer in a green can thing.
392660	394041	It's imported from Canada.
395662	396542	I love Canada.
396562	397082	America's hat.
399645	401686	America's big liberal loving hat.
401746	402767	It's America's suburb.
403567	405428	Anyhow, no, obviously I'm just giving him a hard time.
406769	407849	So I'm going to drink this beer.
407889	409690	Since you drove tonight, I can drink a beer.
409790	410150	That's right.
410250	412151	I'm going to get drunk in Jamie's house when she's not here.
412531	413172	Yay!
413592	414092	I brought it for Loki.
414112	416633	Then I'm going to go pass out in the vault and watch Dan murder me.
416653	419915	I have to drive and I don't like beer, so sorry.
420155	422476	So anyway, let's start the celebrating a little early.
422496	423537	There you go.
423617	425258	I was so hoping that would explode in your face.
426579	427619	Hey, that's not nice.
427639	429200	Because it would ruin his microphone.
429240	430841	Ruin the microphone and the keyboard.
430961	437303	Now, what the audience doesn't know is it's not your average Budweiser 12-ounce can of beer.
437323	438503	This is a 40.
438943	439804	No, and it's not 40.
440384	441584	It's 18 ounces, I believe, or 20.
442464	445966	And it's a Pilsner with a mild aftertaste, and it's very hoppy.
445986	447006	What do you think, Rob?
447046	447766	Not bad for beer.
448086	448547	Okay, good.
449827	450328	I can drink one of those.
450348	451809	You know, usually I don't screw around with beer.
452210	452590	You don't?
452710	452930	No.
453191	456694	I'm just like, let's fill the glass with vodka, splash a cranberry, I'm good.
457035	457695	And a twist of lime.
457916	458056	Yeah.
458596	465344	But after one of those, Rob, I do get a little tipsy, so I can only imagine what my driving you home is going to be like in a couple hours.
465384	468867	Well, look, this will be, I guess you could say in some ways, my gift to the listeners.
468887	469388	Because you know what?
469488	469788	It's been...
470589	472090	It's been a crazy week in the world.
472170	491605	It has been a crazy week in the world, and I realize some people play video games to escape sometimes the crazy things that are going on in the world, and I like this show to kind of be like that too, that if we can give you a few lulls tonight to take your mind off of some of the not-so-lullsy things going on in the world, then I think mission accomplished.
491885	492545	Sounds like a plan.
492665	493546	Share some.
493840	498722	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the type of video games that you've been playing this week since we do always start off the show that way.
499282	500382	Loki, how was your gaming week?
500402	501003	What have you been playing?
501303	502083	I didn't play much.
502443	503864	I played Grand Theft Auto at work.
504084	510906	I played Naughty Bear for like a few minutes, which the game is really low budget.
511086	516889	But it's kind of funny because they have this British guy who yells out these...
518590	520172	Defluffication is a really low-budget game.
534249	534729	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
554597	555618	The only downside to it.
556919	559780	And then mainly just working on Grand Theft Auto edits at home.
560301	569106	And I finally finished, I think, some of the stuff that I got to burn my new discs that we're going to be playing at work now.
570027	573449	Which is incredibly bloody now because I made the blood effects really huge.
573949	575470	But it serves two purposes.
575670	576811	Needs more blood!
576831	578092	It serves two purposes.
578252	584416	One, people are always saying, well, I swear I hit you with the minigun or something like that.
584556	585757	And I'm like, no, you didn't.
586077	593582	Well, this way you'll know if you hit somebody because the blood effect is just so huge that you'll see that bullet spray from pretty far away.
594022	595663	And because it looks fucking awesome.
595823	600306	Because you shoot somebody and it's just hilarious because there's all this blood everywhere.
601146	602988	Thanks for watching!
621502	622703	I'm thinking she should have her own video game.
638820	639940	I don't know, there's something about Lil' Kim.
640040	641101	No, I don't think so.
641141	642581	What, you wouldn't play a Lil' Kim video game?
642741	644241	No, I would not play a Lil' Kim video game.
644901	649302	Because, I'm sorry, she thinks she's some sort of sexy samurai there?
649563	651323	I'm sorry, that is not happening.
651363	652523	She's got big old boobies.
653363	657704	Oh, well in that case, she has all the requirements to fill the samurai position.
658065	659405	Big tits, done.
660285	661326	You're a samurai now.
661346	664769	If there were a video game called Big Titted Samurai, you would check it out.
664809	667271	You would at least kind of look... You would pick up the box and look at the back.
667331	674557	I would look at that, but, you know... I'm just saying, though, it... Only feels rated M. It's just... It's stupid.
675418	675858	It's stupid.
675878	678281	It's stupid that artists have feuds.
678701	679922	No one cares.
680883	683105	Oh, no, this artist doesn't like this artist.
683805	685547	Oh, no, who cares?
685867	686287	It's just...
687148	688672	Westside Rap and East Coast Rap.
689294	689835	Oh, God.
690316	691218	So stupid.
691239	692522	Yeah, you're all gangsters.
692662	693504	Oh, my God.
694206	695228	Oh, such the feud.
697895	698535	That's terrible.
698555	700376	Sorry to derail the conversation, but I don't know.
700396	705897	When you were talking about Grand Theft Auto and blood splattering everywhere, I was thinking about that album cover I saw, and I was like, I would play her in a game.
706517	707377	Yes, exactly.
707537	709217	I agree with Kitsune.
709718	711418	I would play a Robo Geisha video game.
712278	721120	I'd play anything from that company because Robo Geisha is really weird, as many of the other movies that they put out.
721340	725884	Since I'm very rude and the second take made me derail a little bit, I forgot to introduce the chat room tonight.
725924	732770	Chat.orangeontradio.com If you are listening live at All Games Radio on this Sunday, March the 13th, you should hop on over to our chat room and join us live.
732850	738895	Chat.orangeontradio.com And besides, a big tit samurai game, that's just basically the last Ninja Gaiden game.
738955	745120	Could they just take Dead or Alive 4 and all those big titty characters and give them swords?
745600	747942	They already got the basic code down for that.
747962	749264	That's kind of Soul Calibur.
750024	750625	or Soul Calibur.
750645	752406	Well, they already kind of did that though.
752446	761754	With the last Ninja Gaiden game, they had bonus characters from Dead or Alive and from the other DS, Dragon Sword game and that kind of stuff.
761774	768000	But once again, I don't think we should really give a rap star a video game.
768473	769654	Have we not learned from 50 Cent?
769674	772197	50 Cent Blood in the Sand was amazing.
773378	782148	I do give you the fact that it is so ridiculous that it is awesome, but I just don't think Lil' Kim has that same appeal.
782228	783529	Well, rap stars have their own games, and I would...
784410	785431	Rapstar, Rap Hero
808720	812723	They're the only ones that are really doing something new and exciting is Def Jam Rap Star.
812743	814844	Despite if you're into the music or not.
814924	817846	With their community features, that's really amazing that they have all that.
817926	819427	And they didn't put it into anything else.
819767	825230	Hey, we have this cool dancing game that has camera support that people dance in front of a camera.
826231	827692	Could we have community support for that?
828212	828372	Nope.
828773	829013	Sorry.
829553	831094	That would be forward thinking, of course.
832375	833776	Or how about...
835327	835988	Now's the time.
836068	842076	Seriously, Guitar Freaks, you know, Drum Mania, maybe you give it another go and not make a crappy game this time.
842236	842817	No, no.
842897	843298	Let it be.
844039	844399	Let it be.
844820	845581	Put it out to pasture.
846462	846722	Moo.
847082	847403	Alright.
847643	849526	Oh, I bet we'll get another Guitar Hero game.
850727	851048	We'll see.
853203	854404	They know the money's there.
854784	859928	They're just waiting for, you know, they've milked the cow dry, they just have to wait for the milk to come back.
860088	863270	So you're not saying, like, we're having a Guitar Hero game, like, this year or next year?
863290	868554	Because, no, they announced it's done, but you think there'll be that renaissance in, like, three years' time?
868674	871016	They didn't say that they've dissolved the franchise completely.
871036	873978	They said there's no Guitar Hero, no Tony Hawk game this year.
875322	879425	Okay, alright, that's very tinfoil hat of you, but we'll see.
879685	882126	Oh, come on, they think money's there.
882187	897737	I mean, we were talking with Bobby beforehand, and it's going to be a story we're going to be covering later on, talking about a trademark that they had a long time ago, remember, with Drum Villain and Dance Hero, and everyone's like, oh no, here they go, copying DDR.
898037	902800	Well, you know what, I mean, seriously, they're just like, okay, what's Marnix doing that...
903500	904260	Seems profitable.
904300	907922	I would like to see what that whole guitar villain idea was all about.
908342	911403	I always envisioned that that was just to protect someone else from doing it.
912383	914544	That would be dumb.
914584	922247	But anyways, they're basically just going to look at whatever Harmonix is doing that's profitable, then they're going to copy it.
923808	924788	What's going to happen?
924868	932311	Seriously, if Rock Band 3 continues to be profitable, granted the game didn't sell as well as maybe 2 did, but
933095	933555	Thanks for watching!
959221	963187	You know, our wonderful hero franchise that we support greatly.
963848	966192	No, we didn't kill off the hero franchise.
966232	967815	We're bringing it back with Dance Hero.
970188	970949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
993704	996447	They'll do whatever has money behind it.
996527	998328	If they can make money doing it, they're going to do it.
998749	1001931	Just like there's going to be another Call of Duty game because it's Call of Duty.
1002291	1002772	It makes money.
1003664	1007086	All right, somewhere in there we were talking about Loki's gaming week, and I get the feeling he's done.
1007186	1010609	So, Matt, too, do you want to share your gaming week and what you've been playing?
1010809	1011549	I'm afraid.
1012250	1015912	No, my gaming week, again, I do play Warcraft semi-regularly.
1016212	1018674	I'm in class right now, so that inhibits some things.
1018714	1027020	I've got different characters I work on there and part of a guild with some IRL friends, so that helps pass the time with WoW.
1028301	1030642	Gaming week, you know, Angry Birds is really addicting.
1030662	1032964	I'm going through all of them, trying to get three stars and everything.
1033184	1033424	Really?
1034044	1036966	I... For me, it's all about the physics, the math behind it.
1037027	1039568	If I get the right angle and the right... I don't know.
1039688	1040689	Maybe I'm... You know what?
1040769	1041430	I feel for him.
1041530	1043391	I don't want to cut the rope, but I do.
1043731	1043891	No.
1044692	1045192	I'm sorry.
1045613	1051917	I understand the physics part of it and that's kind of cool and stuff, but... I promise I only play when I poop.
1053670	1054631	I do not play when I poop.
1054851	1057073	Sometimes I play in bed.
1057253	1059535	I have played in bed, actually.
1060036	1066922	I have tried to give Angry Birds... I gave Angry Birds a try, because this is one of the games I bought, and I'm like, oh, everybody likes it, so I'm going to buy it.
1067002	1067542	It's 99 cents.
1067562	1067922	What the hell?
1068183	1074488	And I didn't play it for the longest time, and then I actually played it, and it's okay, but I just...
1075629	1077690	I don't see how everybody's so obsessed about this game.
1077910	1082133	If it was Scorched Earth, there's no discussion.
1082233	1086095	And that has physics and angle calculation and all that fun stuff.
1086495	1087136	And tanks.
1087556	1090177	See, that's what really Angry Birds needs is Scorched Earth.
1090358	1097322	If you played Angry Birds and they released an ad, maybe another 99 cents, and every time you killed a pig it would explode bloody, would you then play it?
1097822	1101444	No, I wouldn't because it's a cheap cash-in, just like all these holiday add-ons.
1101664	1102585	are cheap cashes.
1102605	1102985	They are.
1103025	1107209	What if the pig exploded and then bacon comes out the USB slot on your phone?
1107269	1108510	No, that's okay.
1108590	1109310	Really, it's all right.
1109390	1110311	Keep your protein to yourself.
1110331	1116636	See, the thing about... Oh, I forgot to mention it because it wasn't really part of my gaming week, but I made bacon ice cream this week.
1117977	1118198	Ew.
1118878	1120940	It's actually breakfast ice cream.
1121060	1122481	Breakfast ice cream?
1122902	1125784	Well, it's because there's waffle cone in there and maple syrup.
1125844	1127526	So, you know, bacon, waffles.
1127666	1128567	Did you cover it in chocolate?
1128587	1132190	That's like something you'd order at IHOP where you can get dessert for breakfast.
1132230	1132871	Like, seriously.
1133391	1137134	That French toast that's fucking stuffed with cream cheese and all that shit, that is not breakfast!
1137415	1140297	I had chicken and waffles for breakfast today from the IHOP.
1140317	1142479	That's better than bacon-flavored ice cream.
1143119	1146663	Actually, any way to think about getting chicken and waffles at IHOP, don't.
1147583	1150005	It's alright, but it's not good.
1150025	1152728	I mean, it's not like, mmm, that's really yummy.
1152788	1154209	It's kind of, yeah, I'm full now.
1154429	1155390	Loki, how's your food week?
1155490	1161334	Somewhere in here was Angry Birds and Ayas, and now we're talking about frying the birds and serving them with waffles.
1161354	1161734	You said bacon!
1161754	1162495	This is all your fault.
1162615	1163515	You did say bacon.
1163595	1166417	No, but anyway, so I did make bacon ice cream.
1166657	1169639	I think I put too much bacon in it, and I know how... Nonsense!
1170400	1170880	Exactly!
1171080	1171441	Nonsense.
1171921	1180747	But it's just... You have to really be in the mood for bacon ice cream, because if you're eating it, it's ice creamy, and then all of a sudden salty.
1181367	1182088	And it's just like, huh?
1182848	1183968	Why is there salt in there?
1184028	1186149	I mean, it's a little strange.
1186169	1187469	My wife likes it, actually, though.
1187509	1190170	She likes the bacon ice cream.
1190330	1191710	She is a horrible Jew.
1193491	1195231	Horrible, horrible.
1195591	1196211	No, I'm just kidding.
1196231	1196792	You know I love her.
1197172	1197472	All right.
1198152	1199892	Anyhow, so yeah, Angry Birds, right?
1200452	1204113	Yeah, it's a lot of iOS games on my iPhone 4.
1204333	1205634	Again, as I mentioned, I'm getting an iPad 2.
1205674	1207174	Hopefully, a week's end.
1207434	1210195	I don't want to wait in lines and get it, so I ordered it online and
1210955	1216520	Once I have that, I'll sink in and play Angry Birds in huge, huge, what is that, 9.7 inch?
1216560	1217821	Angry Birds HD.
1218021	1218261	HD.
1218341	1223045	Well, it's not retina display, unfortunately, but it is HD because it's 9.7 inch diagonal screen, whatever.
1223085	1226328	Holy crap, that's a game that's really going to utilize HD graphics.
1226368	1226928	Hell yeah.
1227349	1229230	You see those pigs, beady eyes, winking at you?
1230471	1233294	Aside from that, I... The pig is saying no.
1233754	1234595	The pig is saying no.
1234935	1235355	Thanks for watching!
1250729	1251590	DLC content.
1252190	1253351	I liked the DLC content.
1253871	1257014	I was disappointed that it was very out of chronological order.
1257954	1265040	Once you pass the game, you download some DLC, it pretty much says, oh, just pretend that you didn't end the game and this is extra stuff.
1265760	1268462	But I'm curious about Dragon Age 2, getting reviews.
1268722	1272485	I'm hearing mostly good, but I defer to your chat room if anyone's bought it.
1273126	1278870	I appreciate your opinions and I might be picking up that and detoxing from WoW for a bit and then going over to my Xbox.
1279810	1289677	You should have a normal life Not be tied down to a fugitive with no future But I don't ever want to leave you Don't ever leave Do you mean that?
1289697	1291939	Would you have me here, living with you?
1309985	1313826	Here's why I have a problem with Bioware.
1313846	1315406	There's such fucking teases.
1315826	1319027	There's no nudity, and there's definitely no sex scenes.
1319367	1320688	I mean, there's implied stuff.
1320728	1322688	They just kind of, like, jump on the bed.
1322908	1327689	I'm looking forward to this.
1327729	1331210	See, look at that.
1331270	1332790	That's tongue right there.
1332810	1334891	That was some tongue, some big gay kissing.
1335498	1339199	Yes, there's woman on woman and man on woman too, whatever you want.
1339219	1344300	I mean, if we can have boobs in God of War, why can't we have boobs in, you know, Dragon Age or Mass Effect?
1344400	1345960	Because it just wouldn't be classy.
1346420	1347100	Oh, who cares?
1347120	1348740	If you listen to that dialogue, it was classy.
1348760	1349721	The British are classy folk.
1350181	1353101	I would rather die than spend a moment not here with you.
1353121	1353681	Well, then fine.
1353701	1359322	They need to, you know, consult with Hugh Hefner to make a classy, you know, topless woman game, okay?
1359462	1362783	I mean, seriously, I don't understand why they can't do this.
1363363	1363944	and you know what?
1364024	1366046	They can do full frontal for guys on there.
1366226	1369730	They did it in Grand Theft Auto in the Lost in Damn expansion.
1369830	1373414	So if they can do it classy there, then why can't they?
1373454	1374876	But the important thing is classy.
1374916	1377779	You want your video game to be classy, topless women.
1378980	1380602	I'm trying to think of a classy penis.
1380622	1381583	And I don't think there really is one.
1382524	1385587	Oh, why yes, Guinevere, this tea tastes rather lovely.
1386888	1390270	Yes, I'm quite enjoying this little tea and crumpets that we're having today.
1390650	1392672	Oh, but I seem to have lost my bra.
1392952	1394113	Have you seen my bra?
1396035	1397576	That would be the game that Loki wants to play.
1397656	1398637	Classy, topless woman.
1398737	1399878	That sounds very boring.
1404038	1408803	That would conclude my gaming week because we're moving on to another topic that I think is probably a different podcast.
1409584	1411246	Then moving on, my gaming week.
1411686	1415571	A lot of the same old stuff, Warcraft, You Don't Know Jack, and a lot of those fun games.
1416011	1418193	But I did play one new game this week that I wanted to talk about.
1418554	1423219	And if you've been listening over the past couple weeks, you know I've been very excited about Torchlight coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
1423519	1424120	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1442155	1445736	But in a nutshell, Torchlight is very much inspired by Diablo 2.
1446537	1448597	And obviously we've gone through a huge drought.
1448617	1450638	There hasn't been a Diablo game in many, many years.
1450818	1452819	The last Diablo game was, what, 99, 2000?
1454279	1457620	Yes, there's one coming out, but that doesn't help me now.
1458040	1460121	So Torchlight was really there to fill the void.
1460381	1466023	If you like those dungeon-crawling games where you kind of get the items and socket the items, have your talent trees, all that stuff.
1466643	1469444	The one thing it lacked, unfortunately, multiplayer.
1469804	1470945	Thanks for watching!
1489577	1490278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1509241	1509682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1526300	1534985	So it was very interesting to kind of see that style of game now on the Xbox because this isn't really the type of game we see a lot on Xbox, I think.
1535746	1539148	You know, it's not an action-y game like Tomb Raider.
1539228	1542550	It's not an intense role-playing game like Final Fantasy.
1542890	1543991	It's kind of somewhere in between.
1545131	1549252	So it's neat to see something like this on Xbox, but they had to change some things.
1549672	1550852	There's less pointing and clicking.
1550892	1552633	You attack with the X button.
1552993	1558354	Your menus are totally different now because you don't really have the bag that you have everything in.
1558414	1559074	It's just straight up.
1559114	1561395	You have 50 slots and different tabs.
1561435	1562595	It's really weird to navigate.
1562655	1564235	It's a little overwhelming at first.
1565396	1566356	And I gotta be honest.
1566696	1580274	Torchlight's biggest drawback for me on the Xbox 360 is what they had to do to convert it to console I think in some ways the text is very small so if you don't have a big TV you might be in a little bit of trouble
1582136	1582816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1597982	1622790	um and uh you know just the weird having so many buttons like to send your pet to town you have to bring up your menu with start hit the back button to bring up the pet menu and then hit the y button to send him to town like it's just you know there's a lot to it which I understand that's what they have to do to make a PC game work on the Xbox 360 with minimal um you know kind of loss you know you don't want the game to lose anything and the good news is it doesn't
1623150	1623951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1639099	1667883	I think you're good like you really only need this if you insist like I've got to have something to play on the TV or I really want to have this on console I want to go for the achievements those are all really good reasons I suppose you know but I would say if you've never played the game before and you're kind of trying to decide like do I want to play this go check out the PC demo not the Xbox 360 one because I think the PC demo is a little bit better representative of what Torchlight really is so that would be my recommendation but it's not a
1668303	1668883	Bad game.
1668943	1672585	I just feel like it lost a little something when it came over from the PC.
1672625	1676266	The PC version is really superior.
1676726	1678627	So check that out on the PC.
1678707	1684889	And if you must, if you don't have a computer good enough or something, I guess you could always use the Xbox 360 One as a substitute.
1684969	1685789	It's not bad.
1686149	1688210	It's just not, again, that same level as the PC.
1688530	1690331	So that was pretty much my gaming week.
1690951	1692992	So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping.
1694172	1696614	Not a whole lot in housekeeping I want to talk about right now.
1696674	1698575	I want to talk about something after this first story here.
1699016	1701818	But I will say, of course, our Twitter.
1702138	1704479	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to add us on Twitter.
1704900	1706841	Or you can always add us on Facebook as well.
1706901	1708502	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1708802	1711764	A good way to always follow us and see what the latest and greatest is about our show.
1712085	1713726	Forgot to mention my game week.
1713806	1713986	Sure.
1714086	1716168	Since I'm not really playing it yet, but I will be tomorrow.
1716548	1718209	I'm getting a Japanese 3DS.
1718529	1719530	So that's coming tomorrow.
1719550	1719650	Nice.
1720090	1720390	Nice.
1721371	1723852	What made you decide to take the plunge and get the Japanese 3DS?
1723972	1725253	Because I like everything early.
1728975	1730136	Even his ice cream for breakfast.
1730696	1736400	I have a problem with needing to have things early.
1737260	1745465	No, I'm getting a Japanese 3DS with Nintendogs and then Ridge Racer.
1746766	1749007	Only because Pilotwings wasn't out yet, right?
1749027	1750567	Otherwise we would have gotten Pilotwings.
1750767	1755590	We have to bring that to the studio next week because I got to see one a while ago, but I want to kind of see what that finished product looks like.
1755610	1757571	I'm sure Jamie would love to check it out too.
1757591	1765615	Yeah, but it would be fun too if they have good import games later on because sometimes Japan gets stuff before we do, like Smash Brothers and stuff.
1766155	1769397	And I'm still getting a US one when that comes out with Street Fighter 4.
1770217	1771398	Because you have an addiction.
1771498	1778884	It's so funny, too, because just last week, you were all... Last week was a really good Loki hating on Nintendo show, and now he's sitting here going, yeah, I'm buying 2DS, 3DSes.
1778904	1781166	It's just really funny.
1781406	1783247	Hey, I never said I wasn't buying the 3DS.
1783327	1784168	No, I know, I know.
1784628	1787010	It just makes you mad that they don't reach their full potential.
1787210	1787731	Exactly.
1787751	1791274	I don't have a problem with Nintendo as far as making hardware and stuff.
1791474	1792695	I just have a problem with them not...
1794036	1795898	Yeah, like you said, reaching their full potential.
1796298	1797700	Remaking games, come on.
1797740	1802485	These Nintendo 64 ports to the 3DS, that's just some cheap shit right there.
1803327	1809254	Going into our chatroom at chat.orange.com, DarkToagak says, Loki is going to make 3D porn on it, no doubt.
1809474	1810415	No, I'm not.
1811997	1812398	Let's see.
1812738	1815341	Yeah, what's the old adage about new hardware coming out?
1815561	1819706	Time to penis is the whole, like, how long before somebody tries to put their penis on it?
1819966	1822109	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Loki bought Nintendogs.
1822169	1823170	He's part of the problem.
1823735	1824395	You are part of the problem.
1824596	1825876	I am part of the problem.
1826357	1829199	But, okay, here's why I bought Nintendogs, okay?
1829379	1833261	And this is a completely weird reason for it.
1833481	1834702	That's the reason I wanted it.
1834922	1835943	Well, not the cats, too.
1836003	1837864	I have a cat that's already annoying.
1839005	1848832	No, the reason I bought Nintendogs plus cats is because I think that shows off the 3D pretty well, and this is something I'm really going to be kind of showing to my coworkers to kind of say, hey, look, check out the thing.
1848932	1849912	Research purposes.
1849932	1850092	Yes.
1850573	1850753	Yes.
1852856	1855477	I mean, I, yeah, whatever.
1855497	1857317	Alright, fair enough.
1857577	1862798	It was, okay, it was either that or Professor Layton, because I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do me any good.
1863158	1869640	Or there's like some cube puzzle game, no thanks, and then the rest of the games are coming out over here anyways.
1869740	1875401	Once again, it would have been, if they had Pilotwings, I would have bought Pilotwings, I will get Pilotwings when it comes out in the US.
1876841	1879964	Alright, well we'll be hearing more about the 3DS next week then for sure.
1880224	1880845	Yes, absolutely.
1880905	1881165	Awesome.
1881605	1883287	Alright, well let's get into the news tonight.
1884127	1886109	And Loki's going to start us off with some news.
1886329	1892835	And like I mentioned a bit ago, a lot of stuff going on in the world and some of it reaching into video games for all of us.
1893550	1894691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1919763	1946327	um so because of that uh Square Enix has decided to shut off the servers for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy 11 for at least one week and um also other companies affected by this as well Konami um they're shutting off the servers for Metal Gear Online which to be honest until I read that I forgot that Metal Gear Online even existed so uh yeah I'm sure lots of people playing that um
1948283	1952444	So yeah, those are the two companies so far that are included in part of that.
1952684	1956545	Who knows what other companies will be having that.
1956686	1961447	That's still pretty big, though, because you're talking about two major MMOs, for better or for worse.
1961487	1963788	I mean, I know we've given Final Fantasy XIV a hard time on the show.
1963808	1964508	One major MMO.
1965288	1966210	One major pile of crap.
1966390	1970336	But you and I spent many years on Final Fantasy XI and it still certainly has its fans.
1970396	1979569	So that's kind of not something we hear a lot in the gaming world where it's like an MMO literally gets put on hold because of real life.
1979609	1980130	And it's just kind of...
1981031	1988753	There's an old adage, especially in Warcraft, and I'm sure the other MMOs have this too, is that RL greater than wow, or whatever your game of choice is.
1988773	1994614	And I think that especially is kind of what's coming into play this week, and I can't see how really anyone can complain about this.
1994754	1998275	I'm curious if they're going to shut down for that week, if they're going to issue credits to all those customers for that week.
1998315	2001076	Because it's on their bad, and their decision to shut it down.
2001136	2002396	I think they're going to.
2002436	2004437	I think they're going to do like a free month or something like that.
2006618	2010920	I think they will, and I think I read somewhere it is confirmed they're going to gift them the month of April.
2011340	2012701	I think that's awfully generous.
2013241	2018504	I honestly, in a situation like this, I really don't think they would necessarily owe them anything.
2018684	2021726	I think most people would understand, but you would always have that one person who's like,
2022147	2026473	And I'm sure all of us have probably seen the pictures and the damage, and if you haven't, definitely take a moment to look at that.
2026894	2033964	But I don't... My gut tells me the extensive damage they have, one week, them shutting down, I think it's going to be the first of many weeks or rotating weeks off.
2033984	2035226	Well, that's why I said at least a week.
2035286	2035466	Yeah.
2035807	2035987	Yeah.
2036468	2036608	So...
2037469	2038550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2056751	2057492	There are no words.
2057792	2061635	There are no words for what is happening and what we're seeing on the television.
2062115	2067319	I couldn't imagine that scale of what a tsunami can do.
2069200	2071101	I really would challenge you all, our listeners.
2071121	2074364	We've been doing this show for nine plus years.
2075144	2077146	Never once have we ever asked you for money.
2077706	2094191	tonight I'm going to ask you for money and I'm going to say you need to buy one less game this month or one less arcade game, Xbox Live Arcade game or maybe not pay for an MMO for a month take the money that you're saving on Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XIV
2095351	2101796	and go to RedCross.org R-E-D-C-R-O-S-S.org and please make a donation.
2103196	2104597	Everybody should try to do at least $10.
2105178	2113864	If all the OLR listeners could donate $10, that, you know, it's still a little bit for what they're really going to need in the big picture, but it's a start.
2114384	2118046	And, you know, just whatever you guys can give would be so appreciated.
2118887	2123030	So please consider cutting back on a game this month and giving money to
2123550	2123930	RedCross.org
2146155	2154018	because even if you strap for cash, there's probably a lot of other volunteer types of things you could do to help, and that would all go a long way as well.
2154318	2156239	So I needed to get that out there.
2156379	2162362	I know I talked about our show being an escape, but there is the reality that, well, there's people that need help.
2164643	2168324	Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.
2168945	2170986	And this has to do with the Microsoft Kinect.
2171706	2176608	A lot of big news this week about the Kinect and some of the sales figures.
2177549	2181711	Some reports coming out there that 10 million Kinect units
2182091	2183631	have been sold.
2184452	2190593	That is from Aaron Greenberg, who is one of the executives at Xbox, wrote a tweet.
2191853	2201955	And apparently this is so fast and so reaching that Guinness World Records actually went out and said that the Kinect is the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time.
2202935	2208036	133,000 plus units each day for the first 60 days.
2208316	2210877	That's faster than the iPhone or the iPad.
2211457	2221026	That's really surprising to me because I thought with all this iPad abaloo last year and everything, I would have thought for sure the iPad sold faster, but I guess not.
2221666	2228833	Congratulations to Microsoft for that, but seriously, Guinness, you need to find some different types of records to put in your book.
2229633	2234578	Look for some tall people or people that are fat or people that can eat dog food or something like that.
2234858	2237839	I don't know, just not like Consumer Electronics.
2238259	2241800	Seriously, the gamer edition of the Guinness Book of World Records is just retarded.
2242040	2245301	It's just most popular character.
2245961	2246861	It's like, ugh.
2247421	2255323	Well, look, something else to follow that up with is that Microsoft also apparently had the biggest non-holiday month ever.
2256023	2284994	February 2011 they sold over half a million Xbox 360s 535,000 to be exact the biggest non-holiday month ever 27% up over last year that's pretty significant considering nothing's really coming out for them it's all this Kinect momentum because obviously it's these bundles with the Kinect and Kinect Adventures and now that people are starting to play them at friends houses and see them on shows and hear about it in school and so forth I think the word is really starting to spread about this and I think that's what's kind of keeping it going
2286849	2288691	So, very interesting.
2289732	2291193	Not hearing a lot about the move.
2291513	2293815	From what I understand, though, Sony didn't have a bad month.
2293956	2295617	I think Sony sold quite a few units, too.
2295637	2296918	They're getting closer to Nintendo.
2297239	2301282	Nintendo's about to slip into third place, which is really big news.
2301362	2304745	Nintendo is not even going to slip into third place or first place.
2305666	2308589	No, I believe they sold more 360s than Wiis last month, didn't they?
2308809	2309910	Yeah, last month.
2310070	2311951	But overall, they're in first place.
2311991	2313471	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2313511	2317494	I mean, they've got a lot of catching up to do before they're in third place.
2319555	2329860	Honestly, though, I think with the move, it's kind of funny because from a retail standpoint, they're treating it like there's still shortages on the move stuff.
2331365	2334646	Which makes no sense because there's no demand for the move stuff at all.
2335426	2338847	And yet, you know, this stuff is hard to get for some reason.
2339367	2345429	But, yeah, I mean, they're doing some stuff with the move now that people are actually interested in.
2345469	2354091	You'd be surprised, like, the SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3 stuff with the, you know, their stupid move gun that they have.
2354671	2356492	People are actually interested in that.
2356712	2357332	And it's just...
2358472	2368456	Never would have guessed, it seems really stupid, but the actual peripherals that they've made for it aren't just shells like the Zapper.
2368496	2378040	These are actual things that do have integrated buttons and triggers and stuff like that that aren't just, okay, I pull this trigger and it pulls a lever that pushes this button.
2378380	2379221	It's not anything like that.
2379321	2384463	It's actual, some special stuff that they're adding to these, so it's a little bit
2385303	2386964	Better, but still kind of ridiculous.
2387224	2390985	I mean, I think the play of first-person shooter that way, but people are interested.
2391125	2392106	So that may help.
2392326	2397468	I am so curious about this year's E3 and where the Kinect goes.
2397888	2406252	Props to Sony, though, for at least allowing the move to be supported by their big tentpole titles that they're putting out.
2406292	2408332	Because the Kinect, not really having that.
2408512	2410473	I mean, you have the Kinect games, and that's it.
2410513	2414535	You're not going to see Kinect support for Gears of War, at least not Gears of War 3.
2414735	2415816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2433716	2434417	Actually, that's funny.
2434657	2444827	Yeah, there are no first part Microsoft titles right now for a while, probably the fourth quarter, but we're not seeing anything like Patches of the Fable or something like that.
2444847	2446508	There's no Kinect support for that stuff.
2448030	2450212	They haven't really embraced it yet, I guess.
2450832	2473137	well I mean they have their first party Kinect games that they made but there's no like you know core games that are part of that again E3 I think is going to really be telling as to what their strategical direction is for you know phase two of the software you know so and possibly integrating that into their core lineup especially didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about the whole Halo remake happening that now the rumor is it could be Kinect
2473997	2493087	Yeah, well, I don't think, once again, I mean, they should have it be optional, obviously, and then the other thing is I think they should have a couple different levels that you go with it where, you know, not necessarily everything's motion controlled, but maybe head tracking, once again, I think head tracking added to a first-person shooter is just no-brainer.
2493127	2497970	You should be doing this anyways for, you know, just having that part Kinect-enabled.
2497990	2500551	You don't need to be running around with Kinect for everything, just...
2500771	2519131	Yeah, like it shouldn't be like mass arm flailing all over the place, like that's what I fear, but it might be kind of cool, like okay, you have the controller or whatever, and maybe like to lob a bomb or something, you would like throw your hand up or something, like you know, like lob a bomb, like something very subtle, where you know, you're not kind of breaking out of that controller thing, but I don't know.
2519631	2520151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2541823	2544324	If you don't want to move your head around, fine, then don't.
2544664	2545264	You don't have to.
2545904	2547424	Or you can just turn that off.
2548264	2550225	That kind of support would be awesome.
2550765	2552165	There's a ton of first-person shooters coming out.
2552185	2553165	I mean, come on.
2553405	2554886	Seriously, you should be able to do that.
2555046	2564207	They've got to find a way to keep reinventing or adding to FPSs because, at least for me, the allure has kind of died away, like I mentioned earlier with Halo and just kind of, eh.
2564307	2566748	Even Medal of Honor and stuff like that.
2567008	2568549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2584608	2585229	Thanks for watching!
2603304	2604025	Crysis
2620760	2624263	It would be good thinking about it, thinking forward with Kinect.
2624643	2626105	It's an unknown game that maybe people don't remember.
2626125	2628366	PsyOps came out for Xbox a while back.
2628807	2632230	You gain telekinesis power and can move things with your mind.
2632250	2633511	It was a puzzle, first person shooter.
2633931	2636373	Third person if you readjust the video settings right.
2636393	2638835	And I can see that having a lot of fun with Kinect.
2639115	2642999	You move your arm to move a box out of the way and then you go back to your controller and shoot things.
2643039	2646422	You could throw a box at enemies and knock them around.
2646442	2647963	That would be pretty freaking amazing.
2648103	2652165	How about an Xbox Live Arcade game that's Kinect-enabled called Slap-a-Bitch?
2652806	2658629	And what you would do is just, you know, you walk around with a controller or whatever, and then you can just reach out and slap a bitch.
2659009	2662371	Like, you know, and it's other people that are on the Kinect.
2662732	2665053	You know, it's like Halo, but it's slapping.
2665293	2665733	It's a slap fight
2690985	2698636	Once they release that development kit, or I should say the software development kit for the indie marketplace, there will be a slap a bitch.
2698756	2699597	I guarantee it.
2699837	2701359	Slap a hoe, slap a bitch, slap a baby.
2701500	2702401	Slap that ass.
2704744	2705425	We're so bad.
2705665	2705866	I know.
2706522	2707062	All right, moving on.
2707082	2708203	How about some more gaming news?
2708443	2709604	I'm going over to Matt, too, tonight.
2709784	2710064	Sure.
2710144	2720011	So keeping with the whole Microsoft company discussion, turns out those codes on the back of your Microsoft Live cards actually have a pattern to them.
2720531	2731118	So a group of smart hackers decided to look at those codes, take some old Xbox Live Points cards and Xbox Gold trial codes, and they figured out an algorithm that
2731258	2731719	DarkSakura,
2747912	2748593	Spacebucks.
2748973	2749594	Spacebucks.
2749754	2751135	One million Spacebucks.
2751736	2755219	So, of course, Microsoft caught on to this and pulled the codes online.
2755720	2759283	But as I was reviewing some of the news, it tossed a question to me.
2759303	2764588	The algorithm is still enforced to the cards on Walmart and Target walls.
2764608	2764728	So...
2765769	2771016	Yeah, I'm not understanding, because, okay, they pull these codes that were posted online, but aren't they still sitting on shelves somewhere?
2771036	2771296	Correct.
2771336	2780949	So my thinking, or my thoughts were, when I was reading this, like, okay, cool, that's great, you pulled the codes, but the existing codes on store shelves are still probably the same algorithm, or maybe a set of algorithms.
2781249	2782090	Yeah, there might be several.
2782490	2786933	Yeah, and so they must be in their new batch of product for that.
2786953	2789394	They've got to be redoing the algorithm on that.
2789414	2790455	I wonder if there'll be a recall.
2790555	2800640	Maybe the algorithm... Because I'm sure these codes probably not just tell that it's a Microsoft code, but it probably actually tells Microsoft where the card was bought.
2800880	2801221	Absolutely.
2801261	2805963	I would imagine the GameStop chain probably all has similar digits in the beginning or something like that.
2806603	2810005	So whatever algorithm was cracked is probably tied to one particular retail chain.
2810326	2810606	I don't know.
2811706	2812387	and Beyond Points.
2812427	2816950	I might sound like an idiot to the folks that did this because I don't profess to know how you crack an algorithm.
2816970	2819271	These aren't necessarily like the 1600 point cards.
2819291	2823474	These are like the 160 Microsoft point cards that you get with some games and stuff.
2823494	2830578	Right, the actual point value is 160, so we're not talking a lot, but they were able to refresh and then regenerate the algorithm and keep going.
2830939	2834481	And even they were able to find the code for bringing in props to Halo Reach and things like that.
2834541	2836262	So on top of digital tchotchkes and...
2836722	2837403	and Spacebucks.
2837803	2839385	They were able to figure out the codes and the patterns.
2839405	2840606	DarkToyGag has a really good question.
2840626	2841827	Don't these things have to be activated?
2842007	2843669	Like when you buy the cards at the store?
2844349	2847152	I always thought once they scan on the barcode then they're active or whatever.
2847272	2847432	No.
2848012	2848213	Huh.
2848713	2852857	It's just a piece of cardboard that has a code underneath it.
2853578	2868413	that's what makes me wonder I can understand they did the 160 point cards those things but if they started doing 1600 point cards there would be no way for them to track that how would they even be able to figure out which ones are sold and stuff
2868720	2869521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2890836	2894378	Okay, well actually it wasn't from cards from what I'm looking up here real quick.
2894518	2898820	It's actually from a website that was generating these codes.
2898880	2900140	It's kind of like a promotion thing.
2900420	2902781	So they figured out that you can go to this website.
2903202	2905082	Because really you're only supposed to be able to go there once.
2905102	2912366	You can go to this website, change part of this URL that's in there, and you can see if the code's working or not.
2913466	2917148	And then basically you keep...
2917808	2919389	It looks like the forum where it's located.
2920270	2921851	But again, the algorithm stays.
2921951	2924973	And if they're existing cards, I don't know.
2926614	2927775	I always figured there's a pattern to it.
2927835	2932238	But someone found the exploit and they shared it with the community and bought them for about a million bucks.
2932557	2938118	I gotta be honest, I mean, this news kind of sucks for Microsoft, but I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen sooner.
2939278	2939578	That's true.
2939598	2942899	Considering how long those types of cards have been around, I'm surprised.
2942919	2952541	Well, I mean, again, I guess it wasn't the cards, and maybe it took this website flaw or whatever to really rip the hole open to get these points, but I'm really surprised it didn't happen sooner, to be honest.
2952561	2956782	And I wonder if other gaming companies or consoles like this, Sony, we...
2957583	2962812	I wonder if they are taking stock in this and how they procure their point cards and stuff.
2963107	2966549	I'm really wondering what effect this might have on digital distribution down the line.
2990060	2992881	You gotta kind of be wondering if people are able to exploit that system.
2993021	2996462	Is digital download as smart of an idea as we all thought?
2997122	2998803	Or does it need some time to get more secure?
2999363	3005065	I'd have lulled harder if they were exploiting those Facebook gift cards you can buy in the stores.
3005145	3006265	There's no value in that.
3006485	3008246	I'm curious if even one of those is sold yet.
3008646	3009726	So that's been reported.
3010066	3013147	You saw this week though, they started renting movies on Facebook.
3013647	3014027	Oh lord.
3014808	3015308	Yeah, that's true.
3016092	3020015	and something else for people to spend their space bucks on or give credit cards over to.
3020115	3023538	Ironically enough, the first movie that they started renting was The Dark Knight, right?
3023618	3029642	The Batman movie with Heath Ledger and all I could think of in my mind was and here we go.
3032236	3033717	Maybe that was the joke, I don't know.
3034337	3037598	So I will be avoiding that part of Facebook.
3037618	3039839	I don't want them to have my credit card information, that's for damn sure.
3040780	3050704	So yeah, a million bucks has been bled dry from the coffers of Microsoft, and they've quickly in their lesson have to start changing their strategy on how to deal with codes, perhaps.
3051624	3054305	Be interesting to see the ramifications of this six months from now.
3054746	3057827	Well, they can figure out who uses those codes, so they're going to punish them.
3059209	3059449	DarkSakura,
3081024	3082245	Your PlayStation Plus subscriber.
3082265	3082825	I was just about to ask.
3082845	3085447	I'm like, no, you have to be PlayStation Plus for that, right?
3085467	3085907	Exactly.
3085967	3091651	If you're PlayStation Plus, you can save some games or your game saves online.
3092251	3100517	And also, apparently, according to one of the PlayStation 3 hackers, it has re-secured the PlayStation 3.
3100577	3110183	Because obviously the keys are still in there, but they've just moved them to someplace else and they have another key in place.
3110883	3116066	So, for now, it's been secured, but it's just a matter of time.
3116467	3123431	Really, you can't... Even calling it re-secured, that just doomed it for failure right there.
3124852	3126252	Just saying, nope, still broken.
3127433	3128354	Nothing to see here.
3129494	3130255	Keep on moving.
3131296	3132536	But it's hack-proof, Loki.
3133017	3134798	This new firmware is hacker-proof.
3135438	3135959	It's not hacker-proof.
3136059	3137341	Nobody will hack it.
3137501	3138522	Nothing is hacker-proof.
3138623	3149538	And no one's bothering to even... Well, here's the thing, though, is no one's bothering to update their firmware right now because you can spoof it anyway, so you can still connect to the PlayStation Network if you really want to, but...
3152466	3154689	is cloud saving something that interests anyone in this room?
3155410	3166945	I do think it's kind of neat because if I go to visit friends in the Bay Area or something I could connect to the cloud I guess and get my game saves especially for things like
3168026	3191939	I own this on the 360 so maybe it's a moot point but you don't know Jack like you remember when I was reviewing the game I talked about you really want to make sure that save file goes with you otherwise you're going to be recycling games because of the dumb way you have only five episodes at a time able to lock or whatever if you don't take that game save with you you're going to end up recycling games very quickly in that so the cloud save would be very useful for that because I don't always think to copy my save file to a card and so on
3192119	3195241	I was gonna say, yeah, you just... I mean, thumb drives are fucking cheap.
3195301	3201045	I mean, why would I spend money on PlayStation Plus to... I have two jump drives right here.
3201125	3202546	Both of these cost me less than $10.
3203046	3205447	I mean, why would I... And those are 8 gigs.
3205988	3213312	Why would I even waste my time with... I think they have... I think the cap was 150... I don't know if it's 150 saves or if it's 150 megabytes.
3213773	3214613	I can't remember what it was.
3214733	3219977	The honest thing I can say is that sometimes you just don't know when you're gonna need a game save file.
3220777	3221658	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3236536	3237236	I know one person.
3238377	3247363	Well, I feel the same way about cloud saving with the whole Rock Band Guitar Hero things because I go to one of my buddy's houses who has played Rock Band extensively and unlocked a lot of the games.
3247403	3251686	I come back to my house and I haven't finished those parts of the tours and unlocked the songs to play.
3251726	3253647	So cloud saving would make a lot of sense.
3254007	3255908	Or you could just go in the menu and do the all unlock.
3256549	3258650	That would be cheating, Rob.
3258710	3263313	Yeah, but here's the other problem too with the cloud saving thing is don't you have to put your profile on their system anyways?
3264858	3267541	I mean, you can't just dump the save off the internet.
3268562	3271605	Well, with Xbox, yeah, it is profile-centric.
3271965	3272306	That's true.
3273971	3275292	Here's a better idea, okay?
3275492	3279576	And this is great, and this will cost you no money, so fuck PlayStation Plus.
3280036	3281117	You take that game save.
3281477	3282298	It's not very big.
3282698	3283999	You email it to yourself.
3284180	3284420	Boom!
3284460	3285180	It's on the cloud!
3285441	3286982	Don't need to fucking pay them for shit.
3287302	3287783	You want that?
3287843	3289044	Download that save anywhere.
3289204	3290065	Download the save.
3290085	3291546	Just go to a PC, download it.
3291766	3296310	But your friends who don't have a PC, I don't believe you, because everybody has a PC nowadays.
3298190	3300051	And seriously, why am I going to pay?
3300091	3300932	Oh, it's on the cloud.
3301732	3302873	Love it.
3303353	3304054	Emeril Lagasse.
3304614	3306555	And he pointed up, you know, let us know in the studio.
3306575	3308557	He pointed up towards the cloud in case we were confused.
3308777	3310458	Just in case we didn't know, he pointed up at the cloud.
3310518	3311418	It's on the cloud.
3311699	3312739	Boom, headshot on the cloud.
3312979	3313239	All right.
3314800	3318823	GameGuru in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, my USB drive is bigger than the cloud.
3320084	3320384	Hot.
3321725	3325027	Google Mail, Gmail, bigger than the cloud.
3325047	3325947	7.8 gigs, right?
3328460	3345592	and you know if I remember correctly I believe you can download stuff through the web browser on the PlayStation 3 I think I'm not sure what you can download if it's just images and stuff like that to save to your system but you may very well be able to download game saves
3346670	3350573	Now here's a point from SpazinatorPC, can't wait to hear your response to this in our chatroom.
3351154	3355818	Loki, most saves can be copied to jump drives, external hard drives, but some are copy locked.
3356158	3358220	In those occasions, cloud saving comes in handy.
3359561	3365326	And then the only person you can, or the only people you can blame for that would be Sony for being dicks.
3365346	3366347	Yeah.
3366687	3369749	But maybe for a PlayStation Plus member, they'll give you the keys to unlock that.
3369769	3370349	Oh, yeah.
3370389	3371289	How generous of them.
3371670	3373110	I can have access to my saves?
3373391	3374851	Oh, thank you, great master!
3375271	3377513	I mean, it's like, what the hell?
3378133	3380394	Sorry, no, you can't have your saved data.
3380434	3384476	But you can pay for the privilege to access that data.
3384556	3385897	Last week was Nintendo, this week is Sony.
3385917	3387017	I know, you gotta love Loki.
3387138	3391940	One week it'll be Apple, then it's Nintendo, now this week it's Sony, Microsoft, you're on notice.
3391960	3394141	But back in the day, wasn't Loki a staunch, uh...
3396062	3399826	Angry, angsty man against iOS and iPad and iPhone stuff.
3399846	3401248	But he still is in many ways.
3402089	3403170	No, I hate Apple.
3403390	3407114	The only reason he has it, he got it for free through a work pension.
3407254	3411359	You have to understand, I hate Apple because their computers are shit.
3411619	3412940	They're overpriced shit.
3413741	3435275	and that's all it is who thought it was a fucking genius idea to have a computer with no ports whatsoever other than one USB slot that's awesome that's awesomely stupid I mean but people buy that for like two grand when you can spend two grand on a laptop you get a fucking nice laptop I can get two fucking nice laptops for that same kind of price but people go oh my god new Apple product I gotta go buy it
3436415	3438356	That's where I have my problems.
3438796	3443997	I'm still giving props for the iPhone because it probably is the best smartphone out there right now.
3446098	3450079	And even the iPod Touch because it's probably the best MP3 player out there.
3450099	3451939	It's not even really an MP3 player.
3451959	3453940	It's an iPhone without the phone.
3454800	3460522	Um, but I'll be damned if I buy a fucking Apple computer.
3461062	3461602	Fuck that.
3461802	3463242	I mean, seriously, that is a waste.
3463703	3465343	You might as well just set fire to your money.
3465383	3472005	I mean, cause that, you'd be doing yourself a great injustice to buy an Apple computer.
3472541	3472982	Oh, Loki.
3473282	3475504	I think in a new segment, Loki's angst.
3475805	3476706	That's the show.
3476906	3481250	I don't know if you've listened to OLR before, but that's not a segment.
3481271	3482031	That's the show.
3482612	3484053	And I still don't get the iPad.
3484194	3486236	I mean, I still don't get it.
3486536	3491501	I mean, I guess it's better than having a netbook, maybe, but...
3492822	3494003	I can't put it in my pocket.
3494063	3494983	What good is that for me?
3515993	3524680	No, no, I just, and of course everybody's now putting out tablet PCs because that worked really well back in the 90s.
3524721	3526302	Because everybody wants to touch something.
3526704	3532168	Hey, I remember when tablet PC... Fuck, I remember when my uncle worked for Wattcom and they were making tablet PCs.
3532708	3534429	Yeah, that's old school shit.
3534449	3537471	It's like, oh my god, you have to use a stylus on this.
3538852	3539773	Alright, anyway.
3539933	3542555	Let's move on to some other stories going on here.
3542675	3545277	And this is a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
3545317	3547939	Remember that scandalous game, We Dare?
3548419	3548979	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3567445	3579494	And yes, Ubisoft just spoke to the Daily Telegraph this week saying, following the public reaction to the 12 plus rating of We Dare, Ubisoft has made the decision not to sell the game in the United Kingdom.
3580214	3583656	So this means that the game will not be sold anymore in the UK.
3583957	3587399	They will have to import it from someplace where this game will be sold.
3588820	3590501	I don't know where that's going to end up being.
3590521	3593843	Is that like Canada or Australia or what?
3594364	3594684	It's stupid.
3594684	3595224	DarkSakura.com
3621627	3626852	Yeah, that's really all you need is lots of alcohol and slutty chicks.
3627032	3629114	And then they'll go and make out and stuff.
3629415	3631317	A Wii game is not going to get them to do that.
3631437	3633238	It will not get you laid.
3634760	3638363	And I trust you, if you bought this game, you'd be very bored.
3638684	3640245	Because who the hell are you going to play this with?
3640846	3641707	I mean, seriously.
3641927	3643148	You're going to invite your friends over and play this?
3643168	3643789	Play against the computer?
3644469	3645549	playing against the computer.
3646790	3649471	If you want to fucking... I'm sorry, Dave.
3649651	3651151	I cannot let you spank me.
3651191	3652712	So they're not selling it in the UK.
3652752	3654572	Were they not selling Twister in the UK?
3654632	3656293	They're not selling bottles in the UK?
3656313	3658493	Because that's all you need, too, for fucking...
3660874	3663276	Was it an erotic night with your friends or something like that?
3663337	3665238	I mean, I just don't understand.
3665439	3668461	This just proves that the UK is possibly more prudish than the Americans.
3668802	3671204	No, they're just as prudish because we're not selling it over here either.
3672505	3673947	By the way, just real quick.
3674427	3679332	Also, Ubisoft got a stern warning from the Europeans rating board, PEGI.
3680413	3682575	Not Bundy, but P-E-G-I, PEGI.
3683396	3687081	asking Ubisoft to basically remove the We Dare ads from the internet.
3687161	3690246	Oh yeah, because once something hits the internet, it can totally be erased, you guys.
3690987	3691367	Whatever.
3691588	3691908	You know what?
3692369	3693070	I think it can.
3693891	3697356	Try to find anything from Bean Bobby Brown on the internet.
3697657	3698137	You can't.
3698978	3699778	It just doesn't exist.
3699879	3703300	I have an icon of Whitney Houston saying, I know you do.
3703740	3704400	I have looked.
3704640	3709962	I have scoured the internet trying to find those episodes for my wife because that would be like... They never released it on DVD?
3710163	3712784	No, she filed lawsuits to block that.
3712904	3714184	It never came out on DVD.
3714424	3714824	Really?
3714924	3715965	Yes, oh man.
3716265	3717085	That would be worth a lot.
3717105	3719366	If anyone's got that on VHS... That was an amazing fucking show.
3719726	3726189	We need to send Sam Flynn to break into the headquarters of Bravo or whatever fucking network or air that show and steal the master tapes because seriously...
3726909	3727289	DarkSakura.com
3752994	3757276	It's just a ploy to get people to buy that game because they're like, oh, it's so dirty.
3758136	3759477	No, it's crap, okay?
3759617	3760377	It's Ubisoft.
3760397	3769620	This is the same company that puts out the Pets games or the Imagine games or all that stuff.
3770040	3771481	Imagine Sex Party.
3771721	3773402	I mean, that's basically what this is.
3773522	3778724	Well, unfortunately, I couldn't find the We Dare gameplay, but I did find a trailer for We Dare Island.
3781445	3781905	Oh, he's cute.
3784000	3786862	She's spinning a tie in slow motion.
3789463	3790083	Or is that a bra?
3790243	3791084	I can't tell from back here.
3793785	3799028	So the ladies are on the couch giggling at the boys and they're one pseudo stripping and they're dancing and they're having a gay old time.
3800703	3804084	Question is though, is it going in reverse?
3804185	3805725	Oh, now the girl's spanking the girl in her lap.
3805745	3807006	I think it is going in reverse.
3811648	3812588	God, I love YouTube.
3813308	3814429	I'm going to link that in the chat.
3814449	3816150	That's more like Xtube going on right there.
3816630	3821352	Alright, so MrBlackWolf has given me the appropriate link that we should be looking at here.
3822392	3825176	If the game doesn't have full frontal, it's not We Dare.
3825276	3826197	I mean, seriously.
3829141	3830043	We can check it out.
3830924	3832586	There's us being all adventurous.
3833147	3834509	Ooh, I want that dress.
3835489	3835969	You do, huh?
3836169	3836509	Yes.
3837130	3837430	Okay.
3838250	3840691	Oh, these guys are sassy.
3840891	3841992	Come on.
3842012	3843152	You really like this song?
3843613	3844033	Yes.
3844913	3846614	How can you not like this song?
3846874	3849355	I guess it's okay, but I'm just sick of hearing it.
3849635	3851296	I'm sick of hearing you.
3851996	3853597	Not to mention it's a cover.
3853637	3854938	It's kind of like Just Dance.
3855178	3855578	Is that it?
3856298	3858099	Alright, I'm bored of that video already.
3858139	3861581	What is that on Farmhouse Media 3000?
3861641	3863602	It has that little YouTube clip we were just playing.
3867663	3870043	Anyhow, let's move on.
3871304	3872324	Matt2, what do you have for us?
3872544	3873044	Some more news.
3873104	3884087	So it looks like that if you play Dragon Age 2 and you have some angst and you want to get unleashed in the forums, watch what you say because if you call EA the devil, you might actually get shut off.
3884927	3892109	So a player actually posted online on their forums and for whatever reason referenced EA and called them the devil.
3892449	3893369	You can have your opinion about that.
3894089	3904795	and EA, not liking this bad PR, decided to temporarily suspend the player's account on the forums because that's not unusual whether you play WoW or other onlines.
3904835	3907476	If you go off and say some naughty things, they'll do that.
3907856	3913039	But someone flipped the other master switch and temporarily suspended this guy's account for three days.
3913579	3926093	So when he loaded the game and played the game, could not actually play it, all because he called the exact quote from the forums was, quote, have you sold your souls to the EA devil?
3927214	3927494	Really?
3927935	3928415	Wow.
3928495	3928736	Really?
3929116	3929697	A ban for...
3930057	3931638	It's the Activision devil, by the way.
3931658	3933498	Yeah, exactly.
3934379	3937460	But the other part of it, too, so that's not so bad.
3937520	3940601	I mean, if you've seen and read other forums, then you've probably seen some pretty dirty stuff.
3940661	3942982	It's like, don't come into my house and then call me the devil.
3943102	3943302	True.
3943642	3944683	But here's the thing.
3944763	3948384	So EA's like, we strictly enforce the community against profanity.
3949839	3952540	There's no profane, well, you know, El Diablo here.
3952560	3953941	I guess that's a bad term.
3954241	3955802	But there really isn't anything profane about it.
3955822	3958463	It's just really kind of a nasty spun comment.
3958483	3962025	So, of course, EA was like, oh, our bad.
3962085	3962745	Sorry about that.
3962785	3963885	And they apologized.
3963926	3964726	It was a glitch between...
3965226	3965546	and DarkSakura.
3982020	3985123	And Rob and I have posted and read some of the WoW forms and things like that.
3985143	3989268	And there's some pretty angsty 12-year-olds on there, but this is pretty bad.
3989288	3990729	God, I kind of wish Blizzard did this.
3991070	3991650	Yeah, I know, huh?
3991710	3994533	Like read the forum post and then was like, oops, sorry, we banned you.
3994573	3994954	My bad.
3996375	3999799	So be careful what you say on the... We need to take that Ragnarok online approach.
4000199	4001381	You want to talk bad about our game?
4001581	4002281	We ban you.
4002362	4003563	You can't play the game anymore.
4003843	4004484	How do you like that?
4005564	4008585	It just proves that you better watch what you see on the internet because people are watching.
4008886	4010366	And this is obviously a mistake.
4010386	4015448	This is not what happens if you were to call EA the devil or go off with profane language on their website.
4015468	4017789	So just something kind of funny.
4017889	4022151	But it just shows how much control video game distributors do have.
4022191	4025833	They can flip a switch and you're gone or you're banned or you're suspended.
4026152	4026492	That's right.
4026532	4029715	So you guys think twice next time about calling EA the devil.
4029815	4031376	Call them dirty cum guzzlers instead.
4031596	4031957	Hot.
4032497	4033498	All right, moving on.
4033798	4036300	Let's travel the world and look at some release dates.
4036721	4038122	We'll start with the U.S., Loki.
4039245	4041026	This week's not a lot of stuff coming out.
4041506	4043867	We got a few budget games and then some decent stuff.
4044327	4049888	So starting off with the budget games, Maximum Racing, Dragon Stock, and Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing.
4049908	4052889	These are very budget games coming out for the Wii.
4054570	4055250	Let's see.
4056310	4060392	God's Eater Burst coming out on PSP this week from D3.
4060692	4061432	Looks pretty awesome.
4062333	4064575	Um, Jakondia and the Timeless Land.
4064615	4069279	This is the game that's very similar to, um, uh, 32nd Hero.
4069699	4075324	So I believe this is the one that actually lets you, uh, pick how much time you have and then you can play the game for that long.
4076125	4079328	Um, and then of course, uh, on the Wii, Trackmania Build to Race.
4079909	4083092	Um, awesome, awesome game on the PC.
4083172	4084993	So I'm sure it'd be pretty good on the Wii.
4085814	4090835	Homefront, the big game for this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4092295	4097036	Kind of the first that we'll see of the Just Dance series, but a little bit of a spin-off of it.
4097236	4100357	Dance on Broadway coming to the PlayStation 3 for the move.
4101757	4107859	Also on PlayStation 3, Yakuza 4, with less stuff changed this time from the Japanese version.
4108959	4112480	Is it just me, or was that kind of a fast turnaround this time?
4112740	4113920	It was a pretty fast turnaround.
4113960	4114320	Good job.
4114900	4120764	R. Tonalico, Koga, Nell of Arceal on PlayStation 3 this week as well.
4123505	4124125	Let's see.
4124646	4129869	Also, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and I believe the Wii.
4130829	4133431	Top Spin 4 coming out this week as well.
4134691	4140315	And then, surprisingly enough, the Xbox 360 version of this got canceled, but Warriors Legend of Troy.
4140815	4141315	It's a...
4143365	4145506	Trojan version of Dynasty Warriors.
4145846	4146866	So, yeah, check that out.
4147606	4154788	And then finally, yet another Ubisoft fitness game, Fit'n 6 on the Wii and PlayStation 3.
4154829	4157429	Of course, PlayStation 3 with move support there.
4157609	4163271	It's kind of like their answer to the Yourself Fitness since that never came out on other systems other than 360.
4163491	4168673	So that's it for this week.
4168993	4169473	Yes, that's it.
4169873	4171874	Alright, I'm going to move on to Japanese release dates.
4172655	4175957	I do realize things going on could have an effect on this.
4176157	4177298	I'm just going to read them as I see them.
4178159	4184142	On the Xbox 360, Dragon Age Origins Awakening, that would be the expansion to the original Dragon Age, is going to be out on March 17th.
4185183	4189966	Going on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out some of the releases there.
4190286	4192488	Yakuza, I'm sorry, that's a US release.
4193429	4198472	Motostorm 3 Apocalypse comes out in Japan, as well as the Dragon Age Origins expansion.
4199093	4202415	Ryu Ga Gotoku of the End comes out in Japan as well.
4203937	4205618	I'm not sure what that game is.
4205698	4211823	It's from Sega, and it's related to the Yakuza universe, but I think it's a bit more of the action-adventure type of game.
4212583	4213023	There you go.
4214124	4214604	Let's see.
4214784	4216305	Coming out on some other systems.
4216545	4219566	I want to see the Wii real quick if there's anything coming out there.
4220246	4222207	I don't believe so.
4222367	4227209	No, nothing this week because, of course, Nintendo's focused on the 3DS and the recent launch that happened there.
4227269	4234732	So you can check out Steel Diver this week in Japan and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D, both of those getting released on the 3DS this week in Japan.
4235893	4238014	And lastly on the PSP...
4240713	4242755	We have, oh, where'd it go?
4246618	4249420	No, I guess, is there anything on the PSP this week?
4252303	4253003	Doesn't look like it.
4254965	4257427	For some reason, I'm not able to find the dates on my list.
4257447	4257967	There we go.
4258328	4258988	Never mind, there it is.
4259068	4262451	The Little Battlers is the big release on the PSP this week.
4264637	4282471	Little Battlers is a game from level 5 it's a RPG coming out over there looks like you battle these little kind of polygonal types of things it looks a little bit Valkyria profile to me kind of mixed with traditional RPG mechanics so that could be kind of neat so there you go that's it for Japanese releases what about the UK?
4283228	4291574	Alright, so from our friends across the pond, coming out on Ides of March, that's March 15th for those who are not Shakespearean buffs, is Total War Shotgun 2, coming out on PC.
4292454	4296277	And then for releases on the 18th, Friday, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on PC.
4297017	4300239	We also have coming up God's Eater Burst on the PSP.
4300900	4302601	I am just intrigued by the title.
4303421	4307984	Homefront is coming out on the 360, PS3, and PC, also again on Friday the 18th.
4309365	4313908	MotoGP coming out also on Friday, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.
4314769	4317331	Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on the PS3.
4318291	4319752	Okimaden Chisaki Taiyo.
4320232	4322394	See, I can do Japanese pretty well, huh?
4322674	4323034	Huh, Rob?
4323435	4325576	I was worried about any type of Japanese releases I might read tonight.
4328938	4357774	coming out on DS also Topspin 4 for 360 PS3 and Wii coming out and finally Yakuza 4 as mentioned before coming out on the 18th for PS3 I remember buying Topspin original for 360 and was not a fan it made me frustrated yeah I did not like the original Topspin game that was on 360 either that's it this week for the UK alright just a few more news stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week but first something from Loki
4359533	4361636	I'm sorry, I'm very distracted right now.
4362016	4362497	What was that?
4362998	4366903	They finally released the Grand Theft Auto 4 texture editor.
4367003	4368925	Remember the one they got ripped off for trying to buy?
4368945	4371108	Yeah, someone finally released it.
4371449	4374653	All the things I can do, it's just so mind-boggling.
4374873	4376615	Anyways, let's talk about Pokemon.
4378116	4383541	Apparently, there was a rumor, and of course, you know there's always rumors when the stuff's coming from Twitter.
4384722	4390948	There was a rumor back when this whole disaster went down in Japan that the Pokemon creator died.
4392369	4392469	Um...
4393630	4395791	That would have been tragic, except it's not true.
4396711	4400233	Basically, the company tweeted back and said, False.
4400413	4403534	Everyone at Pokemon Company and Game Freak is fine.
4404375	4405815	So, no one's dead.
4406716	4408056	Some people are sick.
4409037	4409237	Yeah.
4410277	4410758	That's all.
4411158	4411438	Sick.
4414259	4422265	Maybe it was a very unfortunate case, a mistaken identity or mistranslation, but unfortunately that probably was not the case.
4423946	4425447	Sick people.
4425967	4427749	Moving on, one other news story for you guys.
4427809	4430271	It has to do with the MMO Free Realms.
4430291	4431992	I don't know if you've ever checked this game out.
4432032	4433974	It's a casual MMO.
4434354	4435975	The weird thing is it's free to play.
4436776	4438257	It's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
4440098	4441798	The funny thing is, it's coming out very soon.
4442659	4443619	March 29th.
4444119	4450640	It was originally on the PC, and now it's going to be a free-to-play casual MMO on the PlayStation Network.
4451180	4455701	So it's not like DC Universe Online, which is kind of the other big MMO on PlayStation 3 right now.
4456502	4458002	Free Realms is going to be different.
4459102	4463423	They say that they did take some things from DC Universe Online, Sony Online Entertainment of course,
4463923	4465344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4492465	4494887	Maybe it's one of those things that's only open to PlayStation Plus though.
4496008	4496348	I don't know.
4496508	4497348	No word on that yet.
4497408	4500010	So we'll see when the game comes out in just a couple weeks.
4501171	4507075	Alright, for now, it's that time of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and look at the classic game of the week.
4509804	4510384	and DarkSakura.
4533815	4534696	No, I'm kidding.
4534896	4540238	We decided since Matt 2 was good enough to step in and fill in for Jamie tonight, why doesn't he get to pick the Classic Game of the Week?
4540258	4542920	So, Matt 2, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week?
4542940	4547001	Alright, well I'll never presume to take over for Jamie, but I'm honored to do this segment here.
4547062	4555346	So, after being locked in the vault for 24 hours and a dog pile ensued, I sifted through it and found this little gem on Super Nintendo.
4556046	4557987	One of my favorites, Actraiser.
4559267	4564270	and Actraiser was produced and distributed back in 1990, so 20 years ago.
4564290	4564770	Imagine that.
4564871	4566191	Oh my god, I'm so old.
4566211	4566852	Yes, we are old.
4567732	4569093	Exclusive for Super Nintendo at the time.
4569413	4572235	It was put out by Enix then, now Squeenix as we know it.
4573055	4575656	And the whole idea of this game was it was two-fold.
4576717	4582680	You were a platform side-scrolling action as well as city-building, almost like RTS.
4583441	4583561	And
4584181	4591547	The whole premise was that you were God, or a God, I should say, and you would have to run around and kill stuff and defend the land.
4592208	4602397	You then also, once you completed the level, which was, again, very basic side-scrolling levels here, you would then turn into an angel and fly around and protect the city from other monsters.
4602477	4603438	And you could see his butt.
4603658	4604519	You can definitely see his ass.
4604539	4608543	You fly around in an angel form and help defend the city.
4608563	4612067	You'd also have to do things like help crops grow by being God.
4612087	4617753	You'd have to make it rain on the crops and lightning to burn bushes so your city could grow and things like that.
4618314	4621898	At the time, when I was playing it, I really enjoyed the music from the game.
4621918	4624521	I thought it was pretty top-notch, honestly, for the time.
4624981	4632386	The gameplay is pretty straightforward on the platform side and the RTS side.
4632866	4634868	So anywho, a little bit more background about the game.
4634928	4640191	Again, the idea that you are a god or a master and you take the form of the overseer in a cloud.
4640471	4641652	Not cloud saves, but just cloud.
4642132	4649978	And then when your citizens call upon you to help defend the land, you would beam on down to the world and take over in a humanoid form.
4651299	4660590	The funny part is, there was an Actraiser 2 prequel to the game, but a lot of religious subtext was discovered about it.
4661151	4668700	People were concerned about the game because in the Japanese text for this prequel, they actually call the main character God and the villain of the game Satan.
4669381	4671282	So here we got to talk about the devil again tonight, Rob.
4672223	4677686	But it was a very engaging game because, again, it had two parts to it.
4677726	4680008	You had to, again, defend the city and build your cities.
4680688	4684751	And if you didn't do these certain tasks, your citizens would die and you would lose the game.
4686232	4686912	One of my favorites.
4687112	4692716	It later came out for Virtual Console and also released on mobile phone devices.
4692756	4694877	So this is out there to play.
4695777	4696998	And I don't know.
4697018	4699260	I just really enjoyed the music from this game at the time.
4699460	4704883	So the Classic Video Game of the Week is ActRaiser on Super Nintendo and Virtual Console and mobile phones.
4705023	4706764	An excellent fucking choice.
4706825	4712949	And I remember when Matt2 told me what game he wanted to do for the Classic Game of the Week, I was like, no, Jamie had to have picked that at some point.
4713410	4713810	I asked about it.
4713830	4714431	Go check the wiki.
4714631	4715491	Jamie picked that, right?
4715912	4718414	And it hadn't been picked yet.
4718454	4725820	Well, I checked the wiki just to be certain, and then I sent her a message and said, hey, these are the three games I would like to review.
4726640	4728581	and these are on the wiki but I want to run past you.
4728601	4731881	She goes, oh, I totally had Actraiser on my list to do so yeah, go ahead and take that.
4732921	4740943	I also gave two other suggestions to Rob and I told him one of them and I think he was impressed on how far back my video gaming experience went.
4740963	4741843	Do you remember the game I told you?
4742364	4742604	No.
4743084	4744064	But Congo Bongo?
4744364	4745324	Oh yeah, that's right, that's right.
4745344	4752406	Totally remember that game from the Atari 5200 but anywho, so Actraiser is definitely a great game.
4752446	4752926	Check it out.
4753126	4756332	Yeah, so let's not take attention away from ActRaiser because this game is amazing.
4756412	4758856	It's definitely in my top ten video games ever.
4758897	4759237	Definitely.
4759257	4760640	The sequel doesn't hold a candle to it.
4760680	4762343	No, and it actually bankrupted the series, I think.
4762731	4763372	That's too bad.
4763952	4765573	Enix made great games.
4765653	4768275	Enix made so many good freaking games on the Super Nintendo.
4768856	4771638	I'm not even talking about Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior, that series.
4771698	4776942	I'm talking about the Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.
4776982	4779944	That was in Soul Blazer, I think was one of the other games.
4781185	4782286	That whole series was awesome.
4782306	4786449	And of course, they were the ones that did Busta Move slash Busta Groove, depending on what country you were in.
4787329	4787990	That was all Enix.
4788550	4791433	And a lot of that's disappeared since the Square merger, which is unfortunate.
4791453	4791913	Which is sad.
4792233	4803615	One of the high-tech graphic things about this game was whenever you had to warp down to the world to defend it, the screen would spin around, and it was just high-tech, and it made you feel like you were falling into the earth.
4803655	4813437	So as your citizens gain power-ups and learn smarter, they can learn how to build better buildings and better crops and things like that.
4813797	4819598	It definitely had a SimCities and a platform feel to it, so definitely check it out.
4820256	4823720	Alright, your classic of the week for the Super Nintendo from Enix, ActRaiser.
4824461	4828746	And for heaven's sake, at least just listen to the soundtrack, because it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever.
4828766	4834412	I believe it's Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack to that, who's just... No, no, what am I saying?
4834832	4835313	That's...
4836454	4838456	She sang a song for Evangelion or something.
4838736	4844742	Yuzo Koshiro did the music to that, and he did a DDR song back in the day.
4844762	4850448	I believe he's the same guy that does Wine Game, Midnight Maximum Tune, Streets of Rage, lots of great stuff.
4850768	4851689	So, very cool.
4852509	4860476	Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, there's plenty more of OLR to come when we get back, including the mailbag, your tweets!
4860656	4861998	So get those in, please, your Twitters.
4862378	4865681	Twitter.com slash OLR to get in your tweets, and of course, more news.
4865961	4872487	We're going to talk about those Dance Hero rumors, some games being cancelled at Sony, and what's going to happen to NBA Jam.
4872847	4876631	We'll find out after this, a quick break, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4882990	4885471	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4885511	4890793	We are live tonight with the 405th episode of our show on this March 13th of 2011.
4891913	4897855	We are live at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
4898535	4903717	Obviously, it's been a crazy week, and if you are just joining us, I did make a plea in Part A, and I'll say it again.
4903777	4904657	Please, please, please...
4905478	4913585	For those folks in Japan that have had to go through such a crazy, horrific thing going on right now, please consider donating to the Red Cross.
4914486	4916008	You can go to redcross.org.
4916748	4918930	I'm really encouraging all of our listeners to part with $10.
4920292	4921113	It's not that much.
4921393	4923835	That's like less than the cost of one month of an MMO.
4923895	4925237	That's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
4925257	4929501	You can go without this week and put the money to where it's really, really needed right now.
4930502	4933986	Anyhow, moving on, we're going to get back into some gaming news and some rapid fire news.
4934026	4937730	And your Twitter, all the tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
4937770	4939392	We'll read those on the show here in just a minute.
4939972	4940513	So get those in.
4940533	4941454	This is your last chance.
4942195	4943997	Also, I got to do a plug for the spinoff shows.
4944437	4949623	Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she does do a fun little show with Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
4949643	4951265	It's called Comic Insanity.
4951605	4977477	but that's with no I it's Comic N Sanity and you can find that on Twitter or you can also find it at Infamous.net again just the letter N Infamous.net if you like World of Warcraft check out my spin-off show with Extifer The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth also known as Horde House for short and all of that coming to a new website also this week that I'll be able to give out and I'm very excited so that's all on its way to being done
4978357	4981699	In the meantime, some rapid fire news, some quick stories for you guys.
4982059	4982859	Let's start with Loki.
4983780	4992905	According to the new issue of the French gaming magazine Joystick, Bethesda's next game in their, well, next announced game is going to be Prey 2.
4993445	4998728	That's right, the sequel to the first person shooter game that came out from 3D Realms and 2K Games.
4998948	4999148	Wow.
4999448	5014842	Of course, 3D Realms is no longer around, and Bethesda was purchased by ZeniMax, which snatched up the company id Software, so it makes perfect sense that they're going to be putting out shooter games.
5015723	5020107	No word exactly on when that's coming out, but probably something that we'll be hearing more about during E3 this year.
5020788	5024890	I'm kind of surprised that Prey is getting a sequel because the first one didn't really do too hot.
5024970	5028812	I mean, it was a good game, especially for dummies.
5028892	5032074	Like, it was a first-person shooter for dummies because you could never die in Prey.
5032114	5034716	And that's one of the things I really liked about it because I suck at first-person shooters.
5035516	5038618	The story was pretty good, too, even though it, like, totally cut off abruptly.
5039258	5041079	Like, you're playing the game and then just it's over.
5041619	5042160	It was weird.
5042500	5043560	So it's set up for a sequel.
5043681	5044341	Like The Sopranos.
5044781	5046702	Yeah, kind of like that, but not really.
5047423	5047983	Without the journey.
5050481	5051302	This is kind of neat.
5051322	5055083	It's a little Easter egg, I guess, for the Google Chrome browser.
5055903	5061945	If you're using it, there's actually a piece of JavaScript you can paste into the Chrome's address.
5062825	5069748	And when you do that, it activates a hack which reloads a page and basically allows you to roll around a ball.
5071168	5072569	Katamari Ball, to be exact.
5073089	5077312	And pick up all the words and images on the screen like you would at Katamari.
5077752	5078092	Awesome.
5078692	5083495	And you can find this piece of code at kathack.com.
5083535	5086057	That's K-A-T-H-A-C-K-D-O-T-C-O-M.
5086877	5088998	And you can check it out.
5089138	5089679	It's kind of a neat one.
5089699	5090859	Does it play the music too?
5091400	5093361	I don't think it does.
5093381	5094781	But thanks to the...
5095942	5104200	Advent of the MP3, you could provide your own soundtrack for your webpage rolling up adventures.
5104300	5105342	It's just not the same.
5105663	5105904	Nice.
5107770	5114753	And then finally, there's a company out of San Francisco that wants to make your life the RPG.
5115374	5117395	So basically it's life the RPG.
5118275	5118895	But it's you!
5119736	5120356	Yes, it's you.
5120496	5123397	It's coming from a company called Green Goose.
5124378	5128159	And basically what it is, it's this package that you get.
5128179	5132641	It's packaged with a water bottle, toothbrush, and vitamin container.
5133182	5136043	And it says the Green Goose logs how many times a week...
5136443	5137423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5154751	5167436	The points that the player earns will not really do anything, but it's meant to encourage a healthy lifestyle, I guess, and clean teeth.
5169897	5170578	Okie dokie.
5171958	5172358	I don't know.
5172738	5174399	It's neat.
5175119	5178921	This is something I could see them selling at a dentist office or something like that.
5179560	5188482	I remember all those like toothbrushing games and stuff that you could play on like the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 that were supposed to like, you know, teach the good habits and all that.
5189883	5193024	It would be kind of funny like a life of the game or something like that.
5193704	5204947	Well, they kind of have that like in the 3DS where you earn points for walking or shaking the 3DS, you know, and you award the same points for walking or throttling something.
5205839	5206119	All right.
5206999	5213522	Let's move on here to some other news about The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time 3D.
5213922	5216623	There is some new things that are supposed to be in there.
5216663	5221164	It's not just a direct port of the 64 version.
5221284	5223305	The 3DS version is supposed to have some other stuff.
5223725	5229607	And this is in an interview that happened with Miyamoto talking about the 3DS version of Ocarina of Time.
5229807	5230187	Thanks for watching!
5257080	5257300	Hmm.
5258361	5261984	By the way, quick follow-up from Essex in our chatroom on the Katamari Damacy add-in.
5262265	5264186	It does play the music, just so you know.
5264206	5264246	Oh.
5264567	5264727	Yep.
5264867	5265908	Well, that's good to know.
5266008	5266889	That's coming from our chat.
5268180	5271841	Some rumors about Grand Theft Auto V is the codename Rush.
5272381	5273802	That could be what's going on.
5274182	5277583	I guess that's some casting details that were done on a Google search.
5277943	5284666	Apparently there's this project called Rush and it has to do with Grand Theft Auto V. Rush is tied to Take-Two Interactive.
5285006	5286326	They own Rockstar Games.
5286986	5289947	Apparently it's a video game set in the Los Angeles area.
5290007	5291748	So maybe they've gone from New York to L.A.,
5292608	5295189	Who knows, but that is apparently some of the rumors about the game.
5295509	5309692	Some of the casting that is in the game, there's a 38-year-old FBI agent in grape shape, a 25-year-old young Mexican-American FBI agent, a 23-year-old moron, white trash hillbilly named Clyde, and so on and so on.
5309752	5311812	So lots of parts that they're casting for.
5311832	5319674	That's either going to be a Grand Theft Auto game, which I can only hope, or it's going to be a sequel to Midnight Club LA.
5321054	5327798	And lastly, Valve is going to be bridging Portal and Portal 2 with some type of surprise.
5328418	5332560	We don't exactly know what that is, but that was from coming out of PAX East.
5333100	5337783	Something that will tie the story of the interim time between Portal and Portal 2.
5338623	5339543	Is that a comic book?
5339583	5340724	Is that an arcade game?
5340804	5342785	Is that YouTube?
5343265	5343806	Who knows?
5344286	5349268	Apparently something will be coming to tie the two worlds together in the future.
5349789	5350269	So we'll see.
5351029	5377574	Matt 2 Alright, so there is some DLC content coming out for Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock You can pick them up as the Modern Rock Mega Pack In your respective WePoints or Microsoft Live download content These are some of my favorite bands here So I'm excited about this I wish I had Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band 2 Just a smathering of what's on that pack You've got Sorrow by Bad Religion She's a Genius by Jet Psycho by Puddle of Mud
5378714	5381936	Saliva's song Always, and Headstrong by Trapped.
5382236	5384517	So that's just half of what's in that pack.
5385037	5389078	These are all those angsty boy frat bands that you like, huh?
5389158	5390419	Yes, this is good music, Rob.
5390899	5391179	Whatever.
5391279	5393380	It sounds like men with vaginas when I hear it.
5394180	5395401	Sorry, that's how I feel.
5395421	5398402	I'm sure a lot of our listeners are like, you're an asshole, Rob.
5398422	5399523	You like Lady Gaga.
5400703	5402964	I heard she did a great song, a copy of Madonna's song?
5404345	5405125	Weren't you in the middle of some news?
5406219	5407280	Yes sir, let me continue.
5407721	5411226	So anyway, those are for respective points on Microsoft or Wii.
5411446	5412988	So check that out if you're into rock music.
5414250	5415892	Other stories that are coming up?
5418206	5419146	XBOX Live Arcade
5439533	5446537	and when it came down to it, it was just abruptly cancelled due to some various... It's a weird reason to cancel a game.
5446617	5447598	It's a very weird reason.
5447618	5452581	There must have been like a dirty word in mistranslation or something.
5452681	5453161	I don't know.
5453702	5456063	There's a lot of debate whether it was a bug or a text issue.
5456103	5467811	Everyone's kind of pointing each other's fingers but basically it was quoted saying we're not privy to the decision making process providing the game but it was due to bugs in the translation because the game has never been translated to Japanese.
5469611	5478634	Since there was no existing Japanese version of the game, the complexity of a new translation combined with the randomly generated naming scheme for Torchlight made it beyond the scope of the project.
5491554	5492394	I don't understand.
5492454	5493955	Google Translate won't work for this game.
5494575	5498616	So, and, you know, Robbie made a point that the text on the screen was awfully small.
5498916	5499976	Yeah, maybe he couldn't read it.
5500136	5504697	So maybe the Japanese ideography of the characters didn't look right.
5504737	5505438	So, you know, who knows?
5505558	5510839	So maybe look for that in the future if they figure out how to translate it, or maybe that's just a wah-wah-wah.
5511619	5517541	So unfortunately no Torchlight for the Xbox Live for the Japanese version.
5518181	5524643	And I really don't want to have to share this news because the first iteration of this was just so horrible.
5525223	5529024	There's work that a new Doom movie is coming out.
5530086	5544461	Yes, we all remember in 2005, The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, did a, me being sarcastic here, wonderful version of Doom, in an attempt to do a movie on the first person shooter that got us in the early 90s.
5545021	5550087	But there's a reboot in the works that's going to completely ignore Dwayne Johnson's first version, thank God.
5551447	5559691	and of course like everything else in this freaking time and day it'll be in 3D oh of course will we have scenes with the gun in 3D?
5559851	5579220	probably or acid splatterings or bullets coming at you it wasn't in 3D but the perspective you were running around for parts of the scene with the gun swinging back and forth like you were in the video game I would be okay with this if they just struck Doom and made it Duke Nukem 3D sorry I'm just looking real quick I'm trying to bring back some memories here
5579480	5580241	Oh god, please don't.
5580741	5585064	I saw this on USA Network or TNT or something like that.
5585104	5589708	Oh, then they cut out all the violence.
5589848	5591969	Oh, they did, and the swearing, and it was still horrible.
5591989	5594831	Swearing and violence would have made it better.
5609262	5611185	Yeah, it was just bad people.
5611245	5612106	Doom is waiting.
5613287	5614148	So there's no release date.
5614168	5614769	There's no nothing.
5614809	5618593	It's just in the preliminary works and it's just a new project in the early stages.
5618794	5620055	Yay, another Hollywood reboot.
5620095	5620656	Just what we needed.
5620911	5647109	And in 3D, can't forget it's in 3D Oh my gosh We've run out of ideas completely Exactly, so Time to remake crap Look for that, hopefully, in the near future Oh yeah, can't wait There will be no hopefully looking forward to Much anticipation Alright, I promised someone we'd do a quick phone call here at this point in the show So we're going to make a phone call real quick And try to get this all taken care of I hope it's going through, I'm kind of relying on Skype tonight
5648621	5650161	and sometimes it can be a little... There we go.
5650301	5650981	One ringy dingy.
5652722	5653562	Two ringy dingys.
5656943	5658483	Hopefully there's an answer.
5658523	5659443	That might be quite embarrassing.
5659483	5659883	What?
5660303	5660763	Hi!
5660983	5662244	Is this DarkSakura?
5663564	5664724	Yes, this is.
5665024	5665404	How are you?
5665424	5666784	Did you make it to Disneyland in one piece?
5668105	5669205	Well, we're not at Disneyland yet.
5669245	5672605	We're going tomorrow, but we made it to the hotel room.
5673646	5675206	You're in that area, right?
5675226	5675466	Right.
5676593	5678835	I can look out of the window and see the parking structure.
5678915	5679496	There you go.
5679736	5685042	Now, aren't you down there because you get to hang out with the official OLR lesbians this week, or at least one of them?
5686363	5687624	Well, both of them on Tuesday.
5687704	5689164	We're going to Goofy's Kitchen together.
5689425	5690705	Well, I played a little solitaire.
5690725	5691466	Mostly I was vlogging.
5691486	5691646	And, uh...
5715313	5721497	Just singing along with some classic rock that happened to come on on a CD that I made so I knew it was on there.
5723478	5727760	And played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 during the week.
5731102	5734004	Looking forward to the new characters to be paid to unlock?
5736158	5737379	Well, we're getting to McGrath.
5737759	5738559	Jill's not worth it.
5739179	5739840	Jill's not worth it.
5741341	5744502	So I gotta say, Matt2's doing a pretty good job filling in tonight.
5744982	5746943	His classic game of the week was very well received.
5747624	5749785	But he totally set the vault on fire.
5750405	5754547	And I just want to apologize for that in advance, that everything is on fire.
5756008	5758549	You realize Dan's going to castrate you before he kills you, right?
5760510	5761691	Dan scares Matt2.
5764494	5769577	Although, I did admit, yeah, the vault wasn't on fire.
5769637	5773479	It was a small ember burning, and you overreacted.
5773939	5777181	Luckily, they had a dry cam fire extinguisher under the sink, and I put it out.
5777241	5779422	He was putting his cigarette out in there, and I'm kidding.
5779462	5780522	I'm totally kidding.
5780622	5781563	We haven't even gone in there.
5781783	5782443	I know, I know.
5782623	5783284	I will say this.
5784344	5786806	Matt 2 brought me beer tonight, and not you.
5787066	5787266	Ha ha.
5789156	5789476	Okay.
5789937	5791678	It wasn't true, OLL Fashion List.
5791738	5795681	One of the hosts was slightly intoxicated, so I offered it to Loki.
5795741	5800045	Loki looked at me in disbelief and then said, er, and he handed it to Rob.
5801146	5806470	All right, so we're about to get into Twitter topics, but is there anything you wanted to say to the listeners tonight?
5808492	5809533	I have the best husband ever.
5810794	5811294	Why is that?
5813226	5813686	I just do.
5814526	5815247	He's pretty cool.
5815807	5816367	He's okay.
5816447	5816807	He's a keeper.
5816827	5817687	Because he's awesome.
5817767	5818668	Because he's awesome.
5820188	5824529	And he likes the pita sandwiches at the place you took me to this week, and that was pretty awesome.
5824589	5824849	All right.
5824869	5825930	That's what we had for breakfast.
5826610	5826950	All right.
5827990	5829731	Oh, no, I just kicked Shermie on accident.
5829751	5830631	I'm sorry, Shermie.
5831571	5833032	Did you notice what I did for you?
5834531	5838472	I washed her bed so it would not stink for you.
5838752	5839913	That is a big cat.
5840193	5840693	I know.
5841053	5844174	I washed her butt for you.
5844935	5845915	Thank you, that's so kind.
5845935	5846975	So that it would not stink.
5848116	5851177	Because her butt stinks.
5851237	5853257	The great lengths you go to for OLR.
5853718	5859380	Okay, so we've got to get back into video gaming news, but I wanted you to at least be able to say hello to the listeners.
5859420	5860520	So anything else before I let you go?
5862523	5863003	Listeners?
5863043	5863604	Why do I care?
5863664	5864044	No, hi.
5864785	5866766	Hi, everybody.
5867146	5869128	I'm at Disneyland and you're not.
5869228	5870388	You guys stay safe.
5870508	5872130	Have tons of fun at the park tomorrow.
5872170	5873991	Tell the OLR lesbians we said hi.
5874391	5876112	And Marissa, too, if you end up seeing her.
5877353	5878534	Marissa has a disease.
5879615	5880455	Oh, how sad.
5880595	5884798	She has the in-bed-with-cold-chills-and-running-fever disease.
5885218	5886019	Oh, sorry to hear it.
5886199	5889841	So everyone send Marissa happy thoughts because we love Marissa.
5889861	5890122	We do.
5890142	5890402	We do.
5891181	5891521	All right.
5891781	5892441	Well, you have fun.
5892561	5892922	Take care.
5892982	5893762	Until then, we said hey.
5894942	5895162	Will do.
5895202	5895402	Bye.
5895462	5896863	And we only stole one game.
5898043	5898443	I'm just kidding.
5898463	5898763	Huh?
5898983	5900184	And we only stole one game.
5901104	5901784	I'm just kidding.
5901804	5902004	Okay.
5902044	5902985	It better be Gyromite.
5903005	5903865	We've got like three of them.
5904065	5904385	All right.
5904485	5904985	Take care.
5906246	5906606	Bye.
5907106	5909407	She totally just gave us permission to steal Gyromite.
5909607	5910027	Sweet.
5910427	5910707	All right.
5911347	5912308	Is there Robbie back there too?
5912928	5913468	There might be.
5913528	5913908	I don't know.
5914448	5914808	All right.
5914848	5916389	Let's get to some Twitter topics.
5916529	5920090	I've been messing around, but she wanted to come on the show at some point.
5920663	5921463	Let's go to the tweets.
5921503	5927464	Twitter.com slash OLR Every week you guys send us your tweets and we sometimes read them on the show.
5927504	5929264	It just depends if we feel like it or not.
5929325	5929665	I don't know.
5929685	5929945	Alright.
5930425	5930845	No, I'm kidding.
5932885	5935005	Spazinator starts us off tonight sending us some tweets.
5935426	5938526	There is a few new free videos on the PSM Video Store.
5939946	5940446	Excuse me.
5940566	5941847	I have like beer burps tonight.
5941867	5943047	That's not good for radio.
5944867	5946888	Listen to this happy music while I cough up beer.
5946988	5947368	Pets!
5950578	5957121	Anyway, Spazinator says there's a few new free videos on the PSN Video Store, such as a rental of Ghost Rider and a few TV shows.
5957721	5959782	And he actually linked us to a blog post.
5960142	5964504	I guess Sony is now actually blogging about this stuff in some of the free movies.
5964524	5965764	There's some anime episodes.
5966184	5971086	So like right now, Full Metal Alchemist Brother and Afro Samurai are free right now.
5971566	5975508	Next week, FLCL and Trigun, Death Note, Kakaishi...
5976329	5996931	Naruto Shippuden and Vampire Knight Inuyasha, Bleach lots of free shit right now on PlayStation Network so check that out also yeah they're blogging all about that on the official PlayStation blog so poor Spazinator's gonna have to find something else to talk about on the show if I could just log into the PlayStation blog and see the video releases now I'm kidding alright
5998833	6002236	Moving on, a few folks talking to us from PAX East.
6002276	6004078	Hopefully some of them will call in when we get to the calls.
6004919	6010085	Let's see, Actdeft wants to tell us about a new rhythm game coming to PlayStation Network called Dyad.
6010605	6013308	It was shown at PAX East.
6013348	6015530	Linking us to a little trailer here on YouTube.
6015570	6018033	Hold on, let me stop the cute music here.
6021944	6023706	You're like zooming down this tunnel.
6023806	6029972	It's kind of like a Wipeout HD mixed with... Oh, what was that freaking game?
6030072	6032335	Audio Surf on Steam.
6032795	6033736	That's what this looks like to me.
6033756	6035598	That's cute.
6037420	6038801	I'm not sure how that's a music game.
6044089	6046271	It's like chiptunes or something is the music.
6046371	6048152	I wonder if that's the whole deal.
6048633	6050734	I will have to research more about that a little later.
6051935	6054057	Moving on to some more tweets.
6054137	6059521	Redertainment tweeting us saying, It's good to see Square issuing refunds over the Final Fantasy XI outage.
6059921	6063684	Treats their customers better than the airlines would in the same situation.
6063824	6064305	Oh, snap.
6064345	6064845	Good point.
6065245	6065826	Very good point.
6066686	6068086	Tiger Claw wants to bring this up.
6068206	6073308	AT&T is going to be introducing a bandwidth cap for DSL and U-verse customers this May.
6074268	6077089	Yes, Comcast folks have been dealing with this for some time.
6077529	6086591	But apparently now there is going to be a 150 gigabyte monthly usage cap for DSL customers and 250 gigabyte cap for U-verse users starting on May 2nd.
6087111	6094473	AT&T users from now through March 31st are going to start receiving notices informing them of the change in the company's terms of service.
6095193	6103800	There will also be overage charges if you go over, I guess it's $10 for every 50 gigabytes over the 150 or 250 gigabyte limit.
6104061	6111086	That's actually not bad because Comcast has been doing this for a few months now and they threaten to pull your coverage all together if you go over the 250 cap.
6111407	6113108	It takes a lot to go over.
6113188	6114129	It takes a lot to get over 250.
6114369	6115710	I was looking at my usage.
6115770	6117111	I think in the month of January I used 18 gigs.
6118112	6119473	and I play a lot of WoW.
6119493	6120153	That's my question.
6120173	6123094	I was going to say MMOs would be the suck off that.
6123455	6128337	I've never gone over 250 gigs and I download a lot of porn video.
6129638	6129958	Yeah.
6130962	6132042	Not ISOs at all.
6151249	6152951	Don't get me started on net neutrality.
6173650	6176474	Cable companies are going to destroy themselves with all this crap.
6176494	6177035	Just watch.
6177135	6180180	It's going to make piracy worse.
6180460	6180761	Watch.
6180901	6183325	It's going to make piracy worse.
6183986	6187251	All the net neutrality stuff is going to make it worse.
6187751	6188312	I'm telling you.
6190339	6191962	Look at the behavior of the internet.
6192022	6205162	And if you don't think that charging people extra money to access certain services is going to encourage people to get around that gate or for new services to start up to offer the same stuff in less legitimate ways, just you wait.
6206883	6211126	TigerClaw sends us another tweet about voice acting in Portal 2.
6211547	6213568	Announced at PAX, J.K.
6213628	6215890	Simmons will be doing a voice in Portal 2.
6216770	6221534	That is Juno's dad from Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson.
6222375	6222855	J.K.
6222915	6224917	Simmons will be doing this.
6225437	6229300	Cave Johnson is the character, the president and founder of Aperture Science.
6229340	6230200	That's a pretty big role.
6231041	6231501	There you go.
6232582	6233223	That'll be fun.
6233763	6235404	Was that demo at PAX East for Portal 2?
6235624	6236724	That's pretty awesome if it was.
6236865	6239906	Probably one of those behind closed doors thing, which is a little silly.
6240726	6241987	Blue Swim sends us a tweet.
6242807	6250271	Apparently a pro wrestler was one of the first to pitch a perfect MLB 2K11 game.
6250731	6251571	Yeah, here's the deal.
6251611	6255213	Did you know that they're doing this contest right now for MLB 2K11?
6255233	6256374	I saw a commercial for this the other day.
6256794	6260896	If you are the first to pitch a perfect game, you can win a million dollars.
6261816	6262897	Michael Manna, Stevie Richards,
6283712	6301905	and it's supposed to be harder than it was last year because you can't I think you have to actually use the legitimate rosters for players that are current up to that date you can't just you know power load your team or whatever like they did last year so it should be slightly harder so it may take like
6302782	6304863	Two days instead of one day.
6305783	6313787	And lastly, a tweet from Blue Swim saying Dead or Alive announced for the 3DS that there is going to be some DLC.
6314548	6317009	So yes, some DLC coming to the 3DS.
6317429	6324572	And it's going to be, let's see, the series boss characters, Alpha 152, Alpha Kasumi, Genra, and Tengu.
6324692	6325933	I'm sorry, they are not DLC.
6326013	6327874	They are just going to be in the game, which is pretty cool.
6328534	6332878	However, free downloadable content, 28 additional costumes.
6333058	6333618	Going to be free.
6334059	6338322	Cheerleader, Leifang, Ninja outfit, Ayana, and so on and so on.
6338382	6340644	La Mariposa in a white cat outfit.
6342385	6342786	Indeed.
6343646	6347289	More information available in Famitsu Magazine, which broke the news this week.
6347349	6348150	That's pretty awesome.
6349251	6350132	That's going to do it for tweets.
6350232	6353614	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to show us your tweets next time.
6354555	6356537	In the meantime, let's go back into some news.
6358291	6359552	Yes.
6360212	6362453	So, I don't know.
6364955	6367356	I kind of ranted about this a little bit in the beginning.
6369197	6375180	But really, Dance Hero, apparently there were trademarks registered a while back.
6375220	6378682	I remember we were talking about Guitar Villain and Dance Hero and stuff like that.
6378702	6381144	We're like, oh no, they're going to do something like DDR.
6382285	6386308	Well, now apparently there's some more info regarding it.
6386428	6389190	Apparently, they're saying that...
6390270	6394553	There's some artists working with Activision on the franchise.
6394573	6402237	Yes, Timbaland, Jay Sean, The Prodigy, and Afrojack all have songs, I guess, that are going to be in this.
6403418	6405539	It's... I don't know.
6405719	6412664	I mean, I guess I could see them doing something similar like this, like Dance Central, because it's made money.
6412704	6413824	It's what's popular right now.
6413844	6413904	And...
6418578	6418738	Yeah, um...
6439659	6464354	Basically, they're saying the songs that are licensed so far 2012 by Jay Sean Featuring Nicki Minaj Out of Space by The Prodigy The Way I Are by Timbaland Take Over Control by Afrojack I don't know what they're going to really do with this I assume it's going to be something similar to Just Dance or Dance Central
6466829	6473030	Thanks, I hope they ruin this genre as well.
6474091	6476071	Haven't you done enough bad?
6476611	6483073	Interesting comment from GameGuru in our chatroom saying, I don't think Activision is following Dance Central, they are following just dance.
6485433	6488174	Okay, those aren't that different.
6489659	6500141	Well, they aren't, but I also kind of see the point that he might be making there with the whole kind of the style of the games and the way they control is a little bit different.
6500241	6510024	I guarantee this is probably coming out in the fall this year, you might guess, because they're going to have to have something to fill, I mean, what have they really announced that they're going to be putting out this year?
6510464	6510964	Call of Duty.
6511693	6513934	My question is, how is it going to be different?
6514114	6520197	Because otherwise, they're just setting themselves up for the same goddamn situation that got Guitar Hero canned.
6520937	6526640	If they come out at E3 and announce this fucking game, they need to say, and here's how it's different.
6526960	6530202	You better acknowledge your competition and tell us why it's better.
6530782	6532223	Otherwise, fuck off.
6533745	6538634	Our new Guitar Hero game is different because now it has drums and singing in it.
6538654	6543443	I don't care what it is, but you know Harmonix is bringing Dance Central 2 to E3 this year.
6543503	6544044	You know it.
6544953	6546994	That's gotta be their thing that they're working on now.
6547034	6548175	You know that's gonna be shown.
6548475	6555959	So if you can walk down the hall and see Activision and their little game, they better be prepared to say, this is how our game's different.
6556019	6557580	Otherwise, I do not give a fuck.
6557760	6562123	And you better bet your ass that Ubisoft's bringing Just Dance to the other consoles this year as well.
6562143	6565284	I mean, that thing sold out like crazy on the Wii.
6565665	6567946	Of course they're gonna be bringing it to the Kinect and the Move.
6568346	6572709	So they've already got right there two competitors for this, you know, genre.
6573009	6577452	And then whatever Konami's gonna just randomly show, too, could be involved in there, too.
6578312	6581214	I mean, I don't think Dance Masters exactly sold millions, but you never know.
6581254	6583755	Konami, bless their hearts, they're still trying.
6584356	6585016	They got DDR.
6585136	6591040	And props to them, though, for at least trying Dance Masters, what I consider a very Japanese game.
6591860	6592861	You're right.
6593461	6596463	Dance Masters is very different from Dance Central.
6597064	6597684	It really is.
6597984	6603648	You're not really looking deep at the music game if you pass them both off as the same game.
6603768	6605669	Because Dance Masters does function very different.
6605869	6611913	And that's the only thing that's kind of frustrating about it is the fact that it's so hard to really kind of get into, you know what I mean?
6612113	6616996	It's just like, I guess it's very much like Para where you just do it.
6617959	6618580	and that's it.
6619882	6626189	If they had a little bit more structure, if they had an actual tutorial or something to it, it might be better.
6627050	6628632	Hey, you know, sequel.
6628913	6629854	That'd be kind of cool.
6631215	6634356	Alright, well, Sony Europe has actually cancelled some games.
6634436	6637498	I don't know if any of these were dance games, like maybe SingStar, I don't know.
6637858	6641279	But unfortunately, I doubt that, by the way, I'm just trolling.
6641819	6656185	But Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has mentioned to the staffs at Studio Liverpool, London Studio, Evolution Studios, that they are going to be streamlining and closing various projects to move the development to other higher priority first party offerings.
6656505	6660047	So we're not talking layoffs or anything, we're just talking about these little games you are making?
6660127	6660267	Yes.
6660447	6661188	Sony Exclusives?
6683925	6685205	Yeah, I don't know.
6685785	6686205	So who knows?
6686485	6688526	Sony didn't say what projects were affected.
6688806	6690286	They didn't say anything about layoffs.
6690626	6694667	They did reiterate there is no impact in the role that the first party studios play.
6695207	6697487	It's just, I guess, moving the resources around.
6697707	6701808	Maybe they didn't like that LittleBigPlanet 2 didn't make Christmas because maybe it impacted sales.
6702248	6702888	I bet it did.
6703308	6708769	So maybe they're really stretching to make Christmas this year and they're really just kind of bringing it home on some of the first party games.
6708789	6711570	They're really going to put it all behind, which I could understand that.
6712070	6712710	I could understand that.
6713090	6713891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6729867	6752089	I mean, they've got, what, first quarter so far, they've had LittleBigPlanet 2, they're gonna be having, well, Killzone 3, DC Universe, and PlayStation Move Heroes will be coming out, and then possibly Sorcery, and I think the Ico and Shadow of the Colossus collection, although both of those, I think, may have been delayed.
6752569	6759435	And then second quarter so far, they've got SOCOM 4, Motorstorm Apocalypse, Infamous 2.
6760696	6764919	I mean, I wouldn't say they're definitely putting out the releases.
6766581	6767201	So who knows?
6767281	6771585	I don't know what they're... I mean, Uncharted 3, they have for the fourth quarter.
6772045	6773506	Oh, that'll be the big thing they show you.
6773526	6773907	Resistance 3.
6773947	6774167	And then...
6778450	6780171	and I guess Twisted Metal possibly.
6780251	6782953	I wouldn't be surprised if that wouldn't be quarter one of next year.
6785074	6785414	All right.
6785814	6787255	Well, let's move on with a couple more stories.
6787295	6788936	We'll get to the mailbag here in just a moment.
6788956	6789977	But first, Matt Tu.
6790817	6791137	All right.
6791197	6799022	So for those who are fans of NBA Jam, your time with that game might be coming to an end.
6799582	6800883	So EA Sports is kind of a...
6801403	6802624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6821997	6842565	to round out the great gameplay that defines a franchise for us to include roster and title update possibilities would have been a sacrifice of quality in those key areas and thus made the difficult decision not to include them so with NBA Jam and their post game releases as well as roster updates looks like the franchise is coming to an end
6843345	6846006	This franchise was so badly mismanaged from the beginning.
6846106	6846286	It was.
6846346	6850788	And it's really sad because it was this whole like, okay, it's only going to come out on the Wii.
6851168	6851889	No, just kidding.
6851929	6853309	It's coming on the PlayStation 3 and the 360.
6853889	6856090	But we're not going to do the obvious arcade thing.
6856130	6862733	And no, it's only going to be an exclusive with this subpar basketball game to try and get it to sell extra copies.
6863113	6863573	Oh, fuck.
6863633	6865074	This basketball game really sucks.
6865114	6865894	It's getting canceled.
6866134	6866535	Well, shit.
6866595	6868435	Now we better charge like $60 for four of these.
6868455	6870196	I mean, this franchise was horrible.
6870516	6884429	Horribly mismanaged from the start Shame on whoever ran this thing I mean, I guess they were trying to think of something outside the box But you fucked up Yeah, the marketing project manager on this was streamlined Probably out the door You know what?
6884530	6894659	I hate to say it, but they kind of deserve it This was a horribly mismanaged franchise This game should have been huge And it should have been on arcade Or it should have been a budget title If this game had been $30...
6896363	6897184	It would have sold.
6897244	6898024	Millions of people would have it.
6898585	6907911	But of course, classic sport games like their Madden franchise will still continue to get roster updates and support because that thing is still on fire and it's got a huge following for the Madden series.
6908393	6911094	They literally had to bring this game up.
6911154	6917498	They had to bump this from a B title to an A title to fill in the gap of a game that was so fucking terrible they had to can it.
6917998	6920379	Like, this game was set up to fail.
6921480	6922620	Absolutely set up to fail.
6922640	6927803	The time, money, energy spent to not release it is definitely a hit in their bottom line.
6927843	6931345	So for those fans of NBA Jam, looks like...
6932545	6936046	Whatever last copy you have to own or rent is the last iteration you're going to have.
6936106	6938366	Sell the franchise to someone who knows what to do with it.
6938446	6938987	Seriously.
6939267	6939607	Konami?
6941187	6941607	You never know.
6941767	6942147	I don't know.
6942187	6944508	Well, Konami did make Double Dribble back in the day, which is pretty sweet.
6944908	6945908	Oh, Double Dribble.
6946748	6947408	Who did Blades of Steel?
6947428	6948209	Was that Konami as well?
6948729	6949049	Yeah.
6949269	6951189	Konami knows how to do some pretty sweet sport games.
6951509	6953650	They're winning 11s.
6953750	6959311	Unfortunately, soccer is not big here in the U.S., but it's huge everywhere else, and that's a huge franchise.
6959531	6960291	I just remember playing that game.
6960351	6961592	Blades of Steel!
6961732	6965874	The only time that it had speech in an 8-bit NES game.
6966594	6968354	And Ten Yard Rush?
6968775	6969335	Ten Yard Dash?
6970095	6973216	I think Ten Yard Rush was the first party Nintendo title, I think.
6973436	6974077	That was another classic.
6974097	6975137	An old school game.
6975517	6976778	But anyway, so NBA Jam.
6978839	6979299	Coming to an end.
6979519	6983460	I mean, well, we don't know if it's dead for... I mean, they're stopping the roster updates.
6983480	6985001	They're not going to support NBA Jam.
6985021	6987062	It doesn't necessarily mean the death of it, but it's...
6988797	6991220	If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would say, Outlook not good.
6993623	6994043	Definitely.
6994484	6996586	My gut says it's coming to an abrupt end.
6997667	6999189	Sorry to the fans of that game.
6999693	7006621	Spazinator in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, if NBA Jam was either Xbox Live Arcade or PSN, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat, but no such luck.
7006682	7007523	I would have done the same thing.
7007903	7008043	Yeah.
7008924	7010526	Lots of people would.
7010847	7012368	Where did NBA Jam get its start?
7012469	7013490	In the arcade.
7014651	7014952	Right.
7015893	7019257	Even if they had just buffed up the old version with new rosters, I would have been all over that.
7019597	7027744	I guess maybe the troubling part is getting the rosters to match the look and feel of the players of the animated heads and all that.
7027805	7028125	I don't know.
7028785	7034030	If you download something, it's an awful lot of content recreated visually to someone's exploited head.
7034591	7034911	I don't know.
7035331	7036012	It's sad.
7036332	7038134	But it's another sporting game that's kind of dying.
7038314	7040917	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, sell the franchise to Activision?
7040998	7043120	They'll end up releasing new NBA jams every year.
7044202	7045884	At least they'll get maintained, right?
7046925	7047386	We'll see.
7048287	7049689	Alright, moving on with some more news.
7053987	7054407	I don't know.
7055487	7067611	We talked a little bit about this, how there was a temporary injunction where LG won against Sony and they got some of the PlayStation 3 shipments held in Europe.
7068071	7074913	Well, Sony actually won overall and this was due to a patent dispute.
7075553	7082214	and now it's C, I guess they're saying that all the C's PlayStations have been released.
7083175	7085875	So that was quick.
7085975	7091076	And they actually only took about a day in the courts to settle everything.
7092977	7093697	Well, that was fast.
7093837	7094077	Yeah, exactly.
7094137	7097918	After all that news about like, oh my God, it's going to be a shortage of PlayStation 3.
7097958	7097998	No.
7099284	7100125	No, it's done.
7100325	7101466	And then on top of all that.
7101486	7103407	And here we stop.
7103788	7106450	And then on top of all that, LG had to pay legal fees.
7107270	7108772	Oh, they got laughed out of court.
7108792	7117659	And also they're saying that for each day that LG failed to comply, it would be fined the rate of 200,000 euros.
7118459	7118659	Ouch.
7119660	7121301	Which is still a buck and a half each.
7121322	7121862	That's a lot of money.
7121882	7122522	That's $275,000 in U.S.
7122542	7122683	dollars.
7128222	7131945	I think we might actually have some audio from the proceedings of the trial.
7131965	7132445	Let's see here.
7132685	7133606	I got ripped!
7133626	7134507	Ah, goddammit.
7134547	7136188	Somebody bombing on YouTube.
7136828	7137288	Never mind.
7137909	7138849	Did you just get Rickrolled?
7139070	7140090	I think I did a little bit.
7140110	7141711	I was trying to find a clip here.
7141731	7144513	Let me see if I can find this.
7147035	7150897	Okay, I think we have a clip here from the trial's proceedings here.
7150957	7153159	Let's see if we can get this out here.
7154465	7155026	That bitch scares me.
7155046	7156107	Fucking love Judge Judy.
7156187	7156728	You would.
7156748	7157509	She's amazing.
7168462	7187620	Did you see the episode with, she's doing her usual, you know, killing people with her eyes and her nose, and someone lit up a cigarette in the audience, not a plaintiff or defendant, but an actual audience member just chilling in the back, and she's there, you know, going off in her, you know, Diablo fire, spewing, and, who's, anyone smell smoke?
7188100	7188661	I smell smoke!
7189221	7193065	And some guy in the back, like, actually pretty well dressed, looked like in a suit, or at least in a sport coat,
7193365	7194045	Are you smoking, sir?
7194546	7195466	Get out of my damn courtroom!
7196547	7198768	Smoking a cigarette on TV on Judge Judy.
7199889	7200609	How random is that?
7202630	7203350	She still scares me.
7206752	7208233	I'm trying to see if I can find that in this.
7208693	7209474	It's not on YouTube.
7210274	7214837	It was a random episode that I just had me watching when I was, you know... There is this one, though.
7214857	7216237	What kind of cigarettes did you buy?
7216537	7217278	Marlboro Reds.
7217778	7217998	What?
7218478	7219159	Marlboro Reds.
7219739	7220440	Marlboro Reds?
7220880	7221040	Yep.
7222739	7223139	What is that?
7223339	7224560	Marlboro Reds.
7225200	7226401	Marlboro Reds.
7228942	7231023	It's my hearing or his speech.
7231103	7231763	It's his speech.
7231943	7233023	I'm not sure.
7233083	7234444	I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette.
7234584	7236565	I don't think I've ever seen the bailiff get sassy.
7236685	7237245	Did you hear that?
7237905	7238005	No.
7238025	7238766	No, it's his speech.
7239526	7240667	The bailiff is getting a little sassy.
7241387	7243808	I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette before going to court.
7245422	7246222	Anyhow, moving on.
7247623	7249684	There is no overturning this ruling.
7250004	7257467	If you want to sell your Game Boy Advance crap to GameStop, you better do it quick because they're going to stop buying all of this in April.
7258247	7261509	So I think right now they will buy a Game Boy Advance for maybe like $20.
7262449	7263370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7281889	7285992	Although I will say I thought some GameStop still kind of specialized in selling old shit.
7286092	7290176	Like usually in a big city there's at least one GameStop that does kind of still carry the old shit.
7290596	7295620	Like the stockpile of NES games or I've seen regular Game Boy games for sale at GameStop.
7295660	7297401	Are GameStops franchised or corporate owned?
7298703	7299283	Corporate.
7299523	7301445	Then probably they conform to corporate doctrine.
7301605	7304988	But it doesn't mean that you can't put your GBA up on eBay.
7305768	7306028	Oh yeah.
7306329	7308570	Of course there's always eBay and there's indie stores as well.
7308590	7309972	Which by the way the one by my house closed.
7310893	7312561	Yeah, there used to be an indie store by my house.
7312642	7313104	It closed.
7313465	7313827	It's not the time.
7313847	7314631	It's just like arcades.
7314992	7315233	I know.
7315434	7315635	Sad.
7317202	7320485	Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
7320645	7323967	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7324908	7327690	And we like to pick a few of our favorites and read them here live on air.
7328051	7330232	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7330292	7331734	Very thin email bag this week.
7331774	7333035	I'm very disappointed in all of you.
7333135	7334035	Why look at me when you say that?
7334316	7335597	I don't know, because you're here.
7335617	7337118	Because Loki doesn't look at me during the show.
7337558	7340561	So anyway, he's too into his Grand Theft Auto hacking thing, so...
7341241	7343063	Which by the way doesn't seem to be working too well.
7343603	7346886	So we've got one email this week that I'm going to read for you guys.
7347546	7348907	But it's a good one because it's from Belgium.
7349868	7350128	Yeah?
7350368	7350588	Yeah.
7350989	7352130	So this is an email from Belgium.
7352150	7352670	They make good waffles.
7353170	7354592	Hello good folks at OLR.
7354992	7356313	My TV is about to die on me.
7356653	7358214	I'll have to buy a new one in the near future.
7358274	7365140	Can you give me any advice on what makes a good TV for gaming and watching DVDs on a 360 and watching analog cable TV?
7365720	7368502	How much milliseconds is good for gaming, contrast, etc. ?
7370104	7387127	you already seem to know what you're looking for because the delay is what you're going to want for gaming and the refresh rate on the screen I believe for like PC monitors you don't want to go any higher than four most monitors now are like two and I think the TVs are the same way aren't they two millisecond refresh something like that
7387327	7387787	Something like that.
7387867	7390128	I know I have a... Here's how nerdy I am.
7390148	7393970	I've got a 46-inch TV as my monitor for my office, for my PC computer.
7393990	7396391	Playing WoW on that thing is pretty fucking amazing.
7396691	7400492	It is slightly orgasmic and videos, quote-unquote, are nice on it too.
7400853	7403294	But definitely look at refresh rates.
7403314	7406775	Definitely look at megahertz refresh rate as well.
7408055	7408336	60 or 120.
7409316	7411757	High refresh is also preferred as well.
7411917	7416538	And keep in mind that the cheapy TVs right now only go as high as 720p in HD.
7416918	7419699	So definitely look at the pixelage on the TV.
7420019	7426041	Mine only goes as high as 1080i because I bought an HD TV kind of on the cheap when HD technology was still newish.
7426221	7427701	So they cut back kind of that way.
7428762	7429842	So double check that.
7430322	7431282	Don't forget to look...
7433303	7438024	at the obvious because sometimes they will kind of brush that over to cut a couple hundred dollars.
7438404	7440024	If it's cheap, there's probably a reason.
7440244	7440825	Always remember that.
7440865	7446686	Definitely 1080p and refresh rates are probably your two pieces of information you want to hold up.
7446706	7450046	Many people will tell you, though, you can't tell the difference between 1080p and 1080i.
7450787	7451667	I kind of beg to differ.
7451687	7454427	I think I can see it a little bit, especially in Blu-rays is where I can see it.
7454927	7457288	And also HDMI cables.
7457608	7458828	Get the gold-plated ones if you can.
7459368	7461449	There's a better strength to that, at least I've noticed.
7461789	7462009	All right.
7463927	7468952	SpazinatorPC in our chatroom says, Vizio's supposedly coming out with a $300 3D HD TV this year.
7469052	7470793	See, something's got to be wrong with it.
7470873	7476899	Although, I don't know, my main TV is a Vizio, and I've been relatively happy with it, except for the fact that it doesn't do 1080p.
7477380	7484126	Well, I have to look at, I paid only, what, $700 for it several years ago when HD TV was still kind of newish.
7484526	7485007	So, I...
7485667	7486848	I can't complain too much.
7486928	7491189	My TV monitor in my room is a LG 46-inch.
7491470	7492590	I forget the model number.
7493030	7493650	It's amazing.
7493731	7495331	Again, while on, it plays very well.
7495591	7498412	It serves well for monitor use and all that.
7498993	7504495	And yeah, don't skip on those two parts, the resolution and the refresh rate.
7504875	7506896	Well, moving on with our email from Belgium, there's more to it.
7507535	7510759	Also, I ripped the ligaments of my ankle a month ago during a soccer game.
7510959	7511940	Yes, sports are healthy.
7512321	7514944	Because of this, I'm unable to play any game on Kinect.
7515725	7520210	It made me think of the many disabled people who cannot play movement controlled games because of their condition.
7520651	7527339	When the future of gaming really is Kinect, Move, Wii, or whatever will be next, I hope there will be a proper alternative for them to play games.
7527819	7528279	Good point.
7528380	7528780	Interesting.
7528800	7529440	I don't know.
7529460	7530181	It's very interesting.
7530321	7537547	And it's something I think we've mentioned on the show before is that gaming can't always 100% be these technologies.
7537987	7541090	It's nice to have, but it shouldn't always be a necessity.
7541671	7548856	And I think there will always be something for that core gamer who just wants that controller in their hand to play an RPG or a shoot-em-up, whatever it is.
7548877	7550118	There will always be something for us.
7550678	7551218	Definitely.
7551619	7552860	A good mix is a good thing.
7553340	7569110	or maybe even games that take disabilities into consideration would be a great thing I mean unfortunately there's many ways a person can be disabled and you can't always think of everything but it's always good to see game companies be at least considerate of you know especially the big ones definitely
7570691	7572852	Well, thanks again for making the show every week.
7572892	7573813	You guys are awesome.
7574253	7576454	Greetings from Febreze, Belgium.
7577274	7577774	Thank you very much.
7577994	7578495	Wow.
7578655	7579535	Sounds like Febreze.
7579995	7581796	Not Febreze, I believe is the name.
7581856	7583997	I wonder if we can send the studio some waffles.
7584417	7584717	Alright.
7585558	7586058	And chocolate.
7587338	7588519	Chocolate waffles with chicken.
7588559	7589100	And fries.
7589540	7590681	Oh my god, Belgian fries.
7591561	7592061	Oh my god.
7592882	7593602	Road trip.
7593682	7594283	Seriously.
7594363	7606391	No, there's a place in New York City I went to once and there was this restaurant in New York City that just sold nothing but Belgian, like the French fry type thing, but like the Belgian big ones and like 20 different kinds of dips for the fries.
7606411	7607931	That's the only damn thing the store sold.
7608112	7608432	Packed.
7608992	7609292	Packed.
7609452	7609933	Wall to wall.
7610433	7611874	There's actually a place like that in Old Sacramento.
7612374	7612834	Is there really?
7612874	7613375	But not Belgium.
7613775	7616156	They do fries with different toppings or dips to represent another world.
7616176	7618097	Why has my fat ass not been to this place?
7618117	7618817	This sounds amazing.
7618837	7621299	Because Old Sacramento is touristy and we live here and we don't go there.
7621399	7621939	I guess.
7622239	7624140	I've been to Old Sac before.
7624180	7624640	It's weird.
7624800	7631183	They have Spanish with jalapenos and nacho cheese and they go to France and they've got blue cheese on them and crap like that.
7631244	7634805	The only problem I have, I can't believe this email is leading to talk about French fries, but whatever.
7634825	7635666	It's Orange Launch Foodio.
7635686	7636026	Deal with it.
7637367	7643971	The thing is that those restaurants usually, like the fries or the dips, like half of them are always mayo based and I, nope, those are out.
7644372	7645532	I won't do mayo based things.
7645713	7647334	Like french fries with mayonnaise, disgusting.
7648134	7649415	Anything with mayonnaise, disgusting.
7649455	7653478	If you've known me for any length of time, I hate, hate mayonnaise.
7653858	7654399	Good to know.
7655039	7655639	Yeah.
7655680	7657821	I won't be making any type of chicken salad for you for lunch today.
7658181	7662143	or put a honey mustard dip in it or something that's not freaking mayonnaise.
7663043	7663284	Anyhow.
7664964	7666865	Aw, the chat room's all, you guys are making me hungry.
7667105	7667386	Sorry.
7668226	7668466	Sorry.
7669146	7669507	All right.
7669807	7674769	Well, I guess maybe the hunger might lead to a little bit of angst because I know when I don't eat, I get mad.
7674929	7676470	So it's time for the FUs of the week.
7691656	7692777	Loki, start us off tonight.
7694058	7697121	Uh, fuck you to the stupid Grand Theft Auto texture editor.
7698162	7702526	It's out there, but it doesn't seem to do anything that's working or whatever.
7704087	7704848	Hate that crap.
7705228	7709052	And then, um... Yeah, that's basically it.
7709512	7709932	Screw that.
7710573	7712535	I waited all this time and it doesn't open anything.
7713075	7716799	Well, I'm sure there's something wrong or it's buggy or something, but I'll figure it out.
7718861	7744089	Matt Tu Fuck you to midterms, I've got two of them this week And I'm looking forward to finishing those And fuck you to income taxes, I'll have to be finishing those up here soon So I can mail out a check to Uncle Sam and Governor Brown Although it's really good to not say Governator anymore I will yield to that And F you to Loki's text your editor thing that I don't understand That he seemed pretty angsty about
7746103	7773523	F you to natural disasters because F you mother nature seriously because I'm really glad that everybody I know over in Japan is safe but unfortunately I know like thousands of people aren't safe and that's just it's just really hard to read because that could really happen anywhere so I just very sad so anyway there's an F you to that and I would also say F you to money I don't have enough of it I never do
7773871	7774291	and DarkSakura.com
7795413	7802397	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7802417	7803898	That's not open yet, but it will be in a moment.
7804958	7821908	Yes, in case you're wondering why Activision does what Activision does, that is put game sequel out year after year, it's because they're only encouraged by people that buy those games and this isn't going to help if you're hoping for the Call of Duty franchise to go away.
7822768	7827290	Call of Duty Black Ops is the US's best selling game ever.
7828010	7831892	It has beaten everything in only about four months.
7832792	7840095	And that includes also the sales of Wii Play, which Nintendo claims is around 13 million copies.
7842136	7843196	I thought this was a down economy.
7844039	7849022	Oh my gosh, 13 million copies of Wii Play is way too many of that freaking game.
7850002	7851703	But even, oh my gosh.
7852023	7853504	See, I don't really play the Call of Duty games.
7853544	7854465	I can't really hate on them.
7854985	7856346	I've seen them played.
7857166	7861468	I understand why dudes like them, but not a series I personally get into.
7861568	7864130	So this is now the best selling game of all time?
7864270	7864630	All time.
7864950	7866652	Oh my gosh, that's crazy.
7867433	7867853	It really is.
7867893	7869515	Bigger than Mario 3.
7869896	7870236	Halo.
7870256	7873199	They sold 5.6 million units day one.
7874460	7875161	Bigger than WoW?
7875181	7876543	I guess so.
7876583	7877303	Bigger than everything.
7877704	7882309	Well, are you counting subscription base or are you counting true sales of the original expansions?
7883406	7884367	XBOX 720 and a Wii 2 announcement at E3.
7903366	7914076	Well, it has to do, and here's where they're coming from, it has to do with some tech demos that Epic is showing about the next-gen graphics because their whole Unreal Engine upgrade and all that.
7914877	7925427	The Guardian in the UK is reporting that there is going to be a Wii 2 that will include a Blu-ray drive, a quad-core processor, and a built-in LED projector.
7925847	7927729	The projector will display gameplay.
7928789	7931250	Weren't these the early rumors of the revolution?
7931630	7933490	That the 3D was going to be projected?
7933850	7937891	Although, funny enough, isn't it funny that we did end up getting 3D from Nintendo?
7937931	7940452	It just wasn't the Wii, it was the 3DS.
7940512	7944973	The Guardian should not be a source for anything when it comes to consoles.
7945313	7948494	Duh, there's going to... Sequel to successful console?
7949174	7950035	Really?
7950335	7952275	There's going to be a new console for Nintendo?
7952635	7954656	Whoa, I did not see that coming at all.
7954896	7955576	I love this too.
7956136	7971634	It's also the right time because Nintendo does console announcements every five years The Nintendo 64 in 96, the GameCube in 2001, and the Wii in 2006 So surely, Loki, surely the time is right for Wii 2
7972495	7980842	You know, we didn't become the super game analysts of the world for nothing, so let me just tell you how it's actually done, The Guardian.
7982323	7989730	First off, they're trying to extend their console cycles now because, well, it sucks making a new console every few years.
7989890	7995054	And honestly, technology does get better, but graphics-wise, what are you going to really push now anyways?
7995254	7998517	and they don't really care about graphics because they're Nintendo.
7999838	8002600	And that would make the price of their console go up quite a bit.
8003020	8008184	Now, not to say that we're not going to see another Nintendo console that's the Wii.
8008204	8017692	We may see something like we were seeing before that's kind of a next step like people were saying the Wii HD or something that may be a little bit more souped up.
8017852	8020394	Is it going to have an LCD projector in it?
8021014	8021655	Probably not.
8021935	8022355	Because that's...
8023436	8024156	That's stupid.
8025137	8026397	That's just kind of weird.
8026517	8028178	It's just ridiculous.
8028618	8031219	Why would I need a projector on my console?
8031239	8033180	To project things onto my naked body.
8036721	8038302	That's a horrible, horrible thought.
8039403	8040203	I have no words.
8041410	8043371	Mario could jump up and down on my wang
8061380	8070262	No, he took an LCD projector and respective cables and components and was able to project the image of the game on a blank wall.
8070302	8072543	But that's because we had to take down posters.
8072583	8076584	So a projector is going to need space, blank canvas to work on?
8076664	8076804	No.
8076984	8077824	It's not going to happen.
8078825	8080025	No, that's dumb.
8080325	8080845	I'm sorry.
8082266	8083406	No, they're not going to do that.
8084026	8087769	and, you know, quad core processor or something like that.
8088289	8088629	Really?
8088990	8089250	Really?
8089390	8090631	Quad core processor?
8091772	8094273	Is that what you think the fastest thing is out there?
8094333	8099297	I mean, you know, I mean, shit, the fucking 360 has more cores than that.
8099631	8103294	Nintendo's main release, I think, this year is not the Wii 2 or the Wii Squared.
8103334	8104595	It is the 3DS.
8105016	8107218	And that's what they're going to stick to.
8107438	8112842	They don't need to even think about a new console until their system starts becoming number one.
8113223	8114164	The Wii is still popular.
8114224	8115765	It's releasing still decent games.
8116125	8116806	People are still buying it.
8116846	8117606	People are still playing it.
8118327	8119388	The 3DS is going to continue that.
8119548	8126812	Now the thought is, of course, that they may want to try to get the jump on the next generation because 360 did have that jump and they did pretty well.
8128813	8129214	I don't know.
8130154	8133996	They're just not going to do some sort of Blu-ray crazy.
8134276	8134977	They don't need to.
8134997	8135157	Why?
8135217	8136358	For one, Sony owns Blu-rays.
8136398	8137358	That would be kind of weird.
8139039	8147365	Well, I still think that the next gen of consoles, especially on the 360s, you're going to see a Blu-ray drive or you're going to see something that's not a DVD drive.
8147525	8148545	They have to because of the capacity.
8148666	8149946	Yeah, because you just can't.
8150347	8154850	Essex says, didn't they always say never to use projectors with games?
8154910	8157191	It was always the first line in the various instruction manuals.
8157211	8160914	Yeah, because of burn-in, but that's just old school projectors, I think.
8161694	8169481	And even still, you're not going to want to do that because old school, even projectors nowadays, there's still some latency for that.
8170882	8173785	But no, why would you even have a fucking projector on a console?
8173805	8174786	That makes no sense.
8175546	8178449	Like I said, to project Mario onto my naked body.
8178989	8182870	It's seriously some guy making a story that, you know.
8182890	8183511	The cell tabloid.
8183531	8184831	Yeah, seriously, the guardian.
8184891	8185491	I mean, come on.
8185591	8189573	Spazinator in our chatroom says, Sky, that's a mental picture I seriously didn't need.
8189653	8190093	Thank you.
8190493	8193794	Is it possible to bleach a mental picture out of one's mind?
8194114	8195495	Yes, just pour the bleach into your ears.
8195695	8196075	I don't know.
8196355	8197155	Let me ask you here.
8197215	8197555	Hold on.
8198236	8202397	And now I present a little bit of Mario jumping on my wang.
8203738	8203998	Hold on.
8204038	8205058	Let's see if I can get this.
8205838	8207619	Project Mario here jumping on my wang.
8211092	8211533	Really don't.
8211654	8211875	OW!
8219145	8219965	Did he jump on a ball?
8220165	8224026	That was like the shittiest NES rip of a game I've ever seen.
8224126	8225086	Fucking YouTube.
8226667	8233948	No, but seriously, if they're going to do something with their next console or Wii, the next Wii or whatever, it's going to be just kind of an HD upgrade.
8234008	8248391	It's not going to be... I don't even think it would need to be necessarily on non-DVD platform because right now, I mean, fuck, they're not even really using dual-layer... There's like two games that have used dual-layer DVDs for the Wii.
8249171	8251533	There's no real need to do that.
8251593	8260498	In order for the Wii to be competitive, like for like, you need to throw in Blu-ray capacity and some type of body sensing motion device because that's what the two consoles have right now.
8261599	8262980	As Rob giggles like a little schoolgirl.
8263560	8265942	So what is the Wii squared to?
8265982	8266943	Maybe it's not a projector.
8267003	8269464	Maybe it's like a connect thing.
8270965	8274227	Well, then they're already on par with their competition.
8274427	8276548	They'd have to exceed their competition.
8276728	8283311	Now, this is getting off of Star Trek in me, but if they did some type of holography or hologram or something like that instead of a projection, then they'd have something.
8283351	8284352	But again, what would you use it for?
8284852	8286473	But no, it's The Guardian.
8286733	8287773	They're not really newsworthy.
8288734	8289254	It's entertaining.
8289514	8290315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8315177	8320390	They called the most popular console in America right now is called the Wii.
8321393	8323859	That's what little girls do when they sit on the toilet.
8323899	8324420	They Wii.
8327245	8328386	I remember the commercials when it came out.
8328406	8330347	Those two creepy Asian guys would come up.
8330667	8331567	We would like to play.
8331587	8334929	I'm like, whoa, this game's for pedophiles or something like that.
8335129	8336570	This console's a little bit weird.
8337230	8340612	And then it was motion controlled and hilarity ensued.
8341973	8344914	What would you call the red ring of death on a console called Bacon?
8344994	8346535	I don't know.
8346595	8348516	There's got to be some type of joke there someplace.
8348576	8349176	It's not coming to me.
8349316	8353899	There would never be a ring or red on any Microsoft console going forward.
8353919	8354999	A Jewish Xbox?
8357655	8358836	This Xbox is kosher!
8363119	8364059	It's made by Jewish monks.
8364179	8365480	I tease because I love.
8365520	8366260	Come on, people.
8366381	8366681	All right.
8367401	8376647	I guess I could say something about, well, there is job postings at Microsoft looking for hardware engineers to, quote, define and deliver next-generation console architectures.
8376947	8378988	Well, no shit they're making a new Xbox.
8379048	8380729	Doesn't mean it's coming out at E3 this year.
8381590	8383951	These things are going to be, like, four years out, you know?
8384272	8384732	Be a while.
8385652	8385813	So...
8387253	8390574	Do you think Apple is rumored to release some type of a gaming console?
8390634	8393795	That's a lot of buzz in the whole Apple world.
8393855	8396256	Yes, it's called the iPad.
8396376	8397837	That is their gaming console.
8397997	8398677	Come on, people.
8398717	8400578	That's retarded, first off.
8400698	8404819	Oh, goody, I get to plug an HDMI cable into my iPad and be tethered to my TV.
8406843	8407203	No thanks.
8407744	8411646	Oh, and I'm sure that cable cost you $40 to make, fuckers.
8412346	8411646	$30.
8413067	8414387	Oh, my mistake, $30.
8414448	8415668	Well, that totally makes sense.
8415688	8416149	I bought one.
8416189	8419811	A piece of cable that's like a few feet long.
8419851	8421792	What, like six feet?
8422312	8422912	I remember the size.
8422952	8433619	It was $29.99 for the HD adapter thing to send in 1080p from the pad to a compatible TV.
8434184	8440627	So I'm going to credit AkumaJP in our chatroom for this comment, but perhaps this could be the sequel to the Nintendo Wii, could be this.
8442868	8443848	She's an awfully jolly lady.
8461897	8468682	Sitting on a toilet, sitting on a toilet, sitting on a toilet, now flush The Nintendo Flush, this year at E3 It's videos like that that keep me gay
8494116	8495717	Rob, why do you do this to me?
8495777	8496457	I thought we were friends.
8496497	8497317	It was the chatters.
8497437	8498397	The chatters said it.
8498798	8499678	But you played it.
8499778	8502219	It's every gamer has a voice, even that lady.
8503239	8513063	She's one of those challenge people that probably couldn't use the Kinect because she'd be sitting on the toilet and have minimal body movement for the Kinect.
8514923	8515323	Oh, Lord.
8517784	8519325	I had to go home and favorite that now.
8520445	8520945	It's pretty awesome.
8520965	8521465	Spread it around.
8522626	8523106	You gotta admit.
8525989	8529864	I was trying to find the 8-bit remix of that song to prove that she plays video games, but...
8530370	8532091	I don't know, I guess it's not on YouTube anymore, whatever.
8532751	8536033	Anyhow, I guess we can open up the Skype line now and take some calls.
8536053	8539756	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8540756	8543618	Give us a call, we'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.
8544258	8548041	Hopefully it's gaming related, but if you want to talk about sitting on the toilet, then more power to you.
8548481	8550202	So the phones are open right now, let's take some calls.
8550482	8552383	We'd rather you didn't talk about sitting on the toilet.
8552443	8554064	That's true, so let's go to some calls.
8554985	8556166	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8557065	8560087	This is that one, Ake Ripper from Sweden.
8560327	8561427	What's up, Ake Ripper?
8561447	8562448	I haven't heard from you in a while.
8562468	8562948	How you doing?
8563648	8567630	Yeah, well, I have been away or... Oh, no, I haven't been away.
8567750	8570532	I've just been sleeping like when you're on.
8571652	8573873	Unfortunately, so... No worries.
8573893	8574534	What's on your mind tonight?
8575478	8576318	What was I going to say?
8576398	8580640	Well, I could talk about Dragon Age 2, which I have already finished.
8581120	8581780	Ah, what did you think?
8581800	8584641	It's marvelous.
8584761	8589882	Once again, the minor story behind it, well, I got it on, what was it, Wednesday?
8591863	8596904	Wednesday, and I got it pretty early, because it locked up.
8597805	8601186	It was unlocked at midnight to Thursday, my time.
8601826	8604567	So, like, what is it, at 3 o'clock
8605627	8631236	on Wednesday your time I think it is uh-huh and uh get on lock yeah yeah yada yada uh and like well well it's like 40 or 50 hours later I beat it and it was quite nice yeah really it's thumbs up do you recommend it um I do recommend it highly how was the lovemaking huh how was the lovemaking
8632827	8635548	It was quite nice, I do say.
8636389	8637609	It was quite nice.
8638450	8640591	Yes, it's a nice.
8640951	8642072	It's quite a nice.
8643693	8645494	But here's the other thing, though.
8646074	8649877	Since, really, I almost... But here's the other thing.
8651077	8656000	Well, I did make love to one of the characters, but here's the other thing, though.
8656661	8656681	I...
8657561	8671866	What, I, since really, really, really, these love scenes in both Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins and Origins 1 is awkward beyond fucking awkward!
8673926	8678168	It's like, I don't even want to see, I close my eyes!
8684801	8685262	Really?
8685742	8686142	Really?
8686403	8692048	What the hell?
8692408	8695171	This is the best video game review we've ever had on this show.
8696392	8697753	I'm glad to be here present for this.
8702577	8707382	But other than that, it really is a kick-assing ass game.
8708920	8723837	Unfortunately, a bit shorter than the first Origins, but it's on par with Mass Effect 2, and maybe even longer than Mass Effect 2 on second thought, so...
8725444	8727466	Well, I would say really bye.
8727806	8735154	And also, it really makes up for wondering, yeah, how the fuck will they continue this?
8735915	8747787	Even though, one of the comments that I found on Twitter is that the whole story in Dragon Age 2 is like an origin story, if that makes sense.
8749989	8751850	Overall, yeah, so thumbs up.
8752490	8758993	Also, Tactics Orger has finally been released, and that's quite funny.
8759493	8766157	Also, on side notes, as usual, I play as a girl character because...
8767357	8769458	I don't... Because here's the other thing, though.
8769478	8785145	I don't even like playing as a male character because, well, hello, I'm one of those trannies, whatever, that's not... If I even would choose... I don't even want to be a man, and I don't want to be a girl, either.
8785245	8795829	That doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with it, though, because I like to play... All of my characters in World of Warcraft are women, and that's just because people are nicer to you because they think you have big boobs sitting there behind the monitor.
8797070	8799271	It's totally like selfish reasons, like, you know.
8801152	8801712	Well, in a way.
8802612	8805474	Also, yeah, and yeah.
8805874	8822243	And also, in a kind of way, there are, I should point out also, I play as usual, I play, I was on the difficulty settings of casual, which means that I in one way breeze it through and was all like, yeah, yeah, whatever.
8823683	8824544	But here's the other thing, though.
8824844	8831467	Even though if you play on casual, you will actually have minor problems.
8831847	8833668	On two places, though.
8835589	8849116	Which I did have problems on two places, but after all I did some thoughts on two things, and was like, yeah, it's not that hard, really.
8849756	8853418	But it will be kind of hard in some places.
8854478	8856240	Well, I don't blame you for playing on the easiest level.
8856260	8861546	I've been playing Torchlight on the easiest level, because I just want to jam through the game and kind of see everything that's there.
8861606	8866952	But sometimes you just want to kind of take in the story, or in some cases, get straight to the lovemaking.
8867653	8869155	Yeah, but also...
8871477	8889962	Also, since I've seen the ending to Dragon Age 2, it makes me wonder, it makes me actually want to replay Origins, so my warden can make love to a certain character.
8891202	8897584	So to set up certain things in Origins 2.
8897904	8902365	You have to go back and get the right characters to fall in love so that the lovemaking can continue in 2 now.
8902425	8903125	Or the STDs.
8903206	8906166	Yeah, can you pass STDs from one game to another?
8906226	8910908	Alright, Aki Ripper, to be quite honest, I don't ever want this call to end.
8911248	8912528	Also, before I go, also...
8916970	8922635	There has been released a new trailer for apparently two expansions on Sims games.
8923255	8923596	Ah, yes.
8924336	8934225	One apparently animal expansion for the console version, and then we have called, like, what is it, Sims 3 Pets or something?
8934385	8934605	Right.
8934745	8938668	And then you have some Sims 3 Generations.
8938688	8939249	Right.
8939676	8941597	Which is apparently for the PC version.
8942698	8946180	Unfortunately, though, there has been no signs of weather effects.
8946821	8950243	Which is a bit sad, because I do want weather effects.
8950323	8951784	But here's the other thing, though.
8952044	8957488	It makes interesting, because, well, raising kids in Sims is quite fun.
8958268	8961611	And with this expansion, it will expand that.
8962851	8964813	Do you think there'll be a Sims 4 anytime soon?
8966627	8967467	Not likely.
8968708	8969628	Not that it seems so.
8970788	8983732	Also, side note, they don't say any date for the Generations 1, but for the Animal Expansion on console, it said November 2011.
8983832	8984032	So, yeah.
8987972	8988252	Alright.
8988573	8993359	Well, I gotta let you go so I can get to some of the calls because I got people from PAX East that are just dying to get through.
8993379	8997204	Honestly, you need to have a video game review podcast.
8997224	8999627	You need to think about it.
9000508	9001049	Later on!
9001209	9001830	Take care, buddy.
9002410	9003091	Yeah, later.
9003191	9003492	Bye.
9005751	9006512	Where is he from again?
9006752	9007193	Sweden.
9007433	9008053	I'm going to Sweden.
9027533	9047226	I'm going to do a rare outbound call because I promised these guys they could get through and it's about PAX East so I want to do this call real quick if I can sorry to those folks trying to get through right now but I did promise this call because I want to talk to at least one person that went to PAX East this week we'll do some more incoming calls in a minute just hold on hold on guys
9053056	9064442	By the way, a question in the chat room if I've played Mortal Kombat Hey, it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio Hello It's Rob from Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9065363	9073868	Hey, it's DJ Ranma S and DDR Gollum Bill Hey you guys, some of our regular callers here at Orange Launch Radio But I know you guys went to PAX East, right?
9075809	9078030	So fucking tell us about it, what happened, what'd you see?
9079272	9083514	It was great, but Rob, before we continue, there's one thing you need to know.
9083614	9083854	What?
9084295	9084515	Yeah.
9085415	9089557	The anime title, SLCL, it's called Fuli Kuli.
9090478	9091138	Oh, my bad.
9092299	9096541	I'm just, I'm not, you know, cultured enough to know these things.
9096581	9097001	I'm sorry.
9097321	9097762	I knew that.
9099062	9099583	It's okay.
9099623	9100523	We forgive you.
9100723	9101143	All right.
9102344	9103705	I've learned something here on the show tonight.
9103725	9104825	Tell me about PAX East already.
9104845	9105966	I don't care about that damn anime.
9107352	9111837	Okay, Rob, I played the 3DS, it's fucking awesome, yeah
9129734	9131155	No, doesn't matter at all.
9131255	9132636	It's the technology, right?
9132656	9139161	The first time you see it, it's kind of, did you do that thing where you looked at it and then you went, whoa, whoa, this is like real.
9140802	9153851	Yeah, and the funny thing is, back where I used to live, where I used to get my monthly bus passes, they actually had a 3D effect similar to the 3D screen, so I was automatically used to it.
9154131	9154371	Right.
9154991	9155912	So what did you get to play on it?
9157148	9159629	The Legend of Zelda The Ocarina of Time And what did you think?
9161050	9186021	It was great Now here's something I don't know if you've covered it Because the stream was dropping As we were traveling But when you play with When you grab the slingshot You can actually move the 3DS around For targeting in the game See these are some of the new features Oh that's it I have to totally buy this Rehash of a 64 game Because they have motion controls now Oh It's different
9187685	9191669	He's been hatin' for a couple weeks now, it's alright.
9191689	9195012	But yet, did you hear the part where he's ordered both a Japanese and an American 3DS?
9206175	9208237	I didn't, but Alpha Conagrin, he was, he was like, it was amazing.
9208677	9208817	Wow.
9208837	9209858	Get that look of like, fucking orgasm.
9209878	9210299	It was amazing.
9230873	9231234	Of course!
9257390	9257890	Of course.
9258210	9259471	Of course everybody's going to be playing that.
9259491	9261291	Did you check out the Classic Gaming Room while you were there?
9262452	9263812	Yeah, I got in there for a little bit.
9263872	9265773	It had all of your favorite games in there too.
9266653	9266913	Awesome.
9267573	9268294	What about panels?
9268334	9270234	Did you spend any time going to a panel or anything?
9271275	9273995	I went to the video game music panels.
9274035	9281518	I went to one about OC Remix where two of the composers did live the opening to Final Fantasy VI.
9281698	9282378	Oh, that's hot.
9283478	9283699	Yeah.
9283859	9285019	Was that as awesome as it sounds?
9287093	9288495	Was that as awesome as it sounds?
9293499	9293919	Nice.
9294279	9295080	Very cool.
9295440	9298302	Alright, so what was like the best thing about PAX East altogether?
9299603	9303386	What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?
9317064	9318966	What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?
9320228	9321109	Was there titties?
9333459	9334720	Real life titties, yes.
9335080	9335460	Oh, yeah.
9335640	9337280	Wait, wait, wait.
9337360	9342121	Are we talking about Duke Nukem Forever still or are we talking about like you just saw titties in the expo hall like randomly?
9342482	9344962	I'm talking about the booth babes, my brother.
9344982	9346022	The booth babes.
9346182	9347743	Of course, the booth babes.
9348543	9348903	Nice.
9350684	9353184	Well, anything else you want to get out about PAX East before I get to more calls?
9354505	9355585	It was fun.
9356185	9359906	It's worth it to come because as we were hanging out Saturday night,
9360509	9363810	The way it was laid out, it was not really stressful.
9363930	9366871	It kind of revitalized the reason why I go to conventions.
9367431	9372673	And also, there was no appointment per se set up for demos.
9373093	9380535	You could email them, and they would email you back if you wanted time to come in to check out particular products and games.
9380955	9388057	But even though I was pressed, you had to wait just like everybody else, except on Saturday, where you were allowed in an hour early.
9388760	9392403	We couldn't do that because we had to drop off Misty and Alpha Cananagram at the train station and the airport.
9414920	9415481	Aw, bummer.
9416122	9418226	Alright, well, maybe somebody in chat will yell it out.
9418266	9419829	I'm sure it's hit the internet somewhere.
9420835	9422516	and OLR Invasion next year.
9422556	9426018	Next year, PAX East 2012, OLRCon.
9426278	9434483	It's going to be you, me, DarkSakura, Loki, DDR Dollar Bill, Misty, Alpha Cananogram, Zaku, the whole crew.
9434743	9435784	We're getting a suite.
9435984	9437124	We're getting some alcohol.
9437404	9438405	We're bringing the 360s.
9438505	9440086	We're going to jury rig the TV.
9440266	9442327	We're going to get our gaming on.
9442467	9442928	And boobs.
9442968	9443648	Hell yeah.
9443688	9444048	Alright.
9446277	9447517	All right, well, you guys have fun.
9447557	9452039	Be safe on your drive back, and thanks for letting me bug you, even though you're on the show every week anyway, Ranma.
9453059	9454980	All right, later, guys.
9455000	9456100	Later, DDR Dollar Bill.
9457261	9457761	Drive safe.
9458601	9459921	I said later, DDR Dollar Bill, too.
9459961	9460602	Drive safe, you guys.
9462522	9462802	Later.
9464663	9464883	Awesome.
9464903	9465743	Let's get some more calls.
9466764	9467564	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9467584	9467904	Who's this?
9468564	9469424	Zaku here.
9469444	9470325	Hey, Zaku, buddy.
9470345	9470925	What's on your mind?
9472045	9475586	Yep, I also, I too also went to PAX with Adam.
9475926	9476426	Awesome!
9476546	9477386	Also known as Rama.
9477646	9486548	You were also, uh... Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure, it was my first PAX, but at least, at least I was able to, you know, to pull off a decent trip to Boston.
9488269	9492610	Even though it was like, the way I see it is this, what the fuck?
9495441	9495881	It's all good.
9495941	9497182	What did you think of PAX East?
9497202	9497862	What did you play?
9497882	9506745	So what I was saying is that, yeah, I mean, you know, I did try to partake in most of the things, you know, on the show floor, but they were just like, the lines were too long.
9506845	9512247	It's like, there was no way I was going to spend two hours waiting to see what's inside the L.A.
9512267	9514727	Knorr booth, let alone the Battlefield 3 one.
9515247	9522910	By the way, just quickly, I know Adam Perfect, he endured whatever he did to see the 3DS, but it was just like,
9523470	9524251	Pax is a poor man's E3
9539212	9539752	Pretty much.
9539812	9552015	I mean, compared to all the other cons I've been to, you know, even the ones I've been to in the Javits Center in New York, this was by far one of the largest I've ever been to.
9552975	9555956	Well, I gotta say, you know, the East Coast sadly doesn't get a lot.
9556116	9559116	So I'm not surprised at all that everybody comes in.
9559136	9563837	So PAX does fill that void for folks that can't actually make it out to E3.
9564538	9565158	So it's like...
9566638	9576081	It's creating that whole experience, that experience itself, without having to go on the other side of the country.
9576641	9584463	But more to my point, I did cosplay on Saturday, and I'm just trying to upload the picture I took personally.
9585063	9589264	I mean, I post for several pictures, some for media, but I didn't make Kotaku's role.
9589865	9590965	But I'll upload mine.
9591445	9592526	Well, let me ask you quickly.
9592546	9594006	I want to take it back to the games a little bit.
9594967	9598108	Even though the lines were long, I'm assuming you got your hands on some things, right?
9598528	9599109	Yeah, some.
9599389	9605412	I wouldn't say a lot, but it's like I was just going from some booths.
9605752	9608113	What did you play that's worth talking about right now?
9608733	9609334	Oh, man.
9609374	9611855	I can't even think off the top of my head.
9611895	9612335	Homefront.
9612415	9612995	Homefront, yeah.
9614585	9619612	Pretty much, that's definitely one thing I'm going to buy on Tuesday.
9620113	9623619	Well, for PC that is, but the 360 version is just as good.
9626124	9630588	That was what I was able to get my hands on without having to wait hours in line.
9631649	9639537	Most of the major titles there, you're going to spend hours just going through two or three of them.
9639957	9642840	And that's going to cut into most of your day on the show floor.
9642940	9644902	Did you get to do any other of the sights and sounds of E3?
9644942	9647464	Yeah, I went to the harmonics panel.
9647624	9648145	Oh, how was that?
9648325	9648725	Saturday.
9650176	9655839	Did they comment on the whole sale from MTV and all that?
9656759	9670326	No, it was just like, well, what they did was like a reverse Q&A where they actually, you know, where the panel asked questions to, you know, the fans that lined up to speak.
9670946	9675969	So I was basically asked a question on, you know, how to deal with, like, asshole...
9676909	9684296	You know, fans that complain about some of the most obvious and unrealistic things about the game.
9685117	9691763	And so I was basically asked my opinion on that particular subject.
9691783	9692323	What'd you say?
9692343	9696447	I managed to relate it to the DDR scene.
9696647	9698029	Well, my local DDR scene.
9698049	9701131	And I pretty much got a pretty good ovation out of it.
9701412	9701572	Hmm.
9702655	9707557	If it was recorded live, I'm pretty sure my comment was up there.
9709438	9712899	If the panel mentions a military zombie, that was me.
9713519	9715120	So are you going back to PAX next year?
9715940	9722243	Yeah, I mean, this time I have to stay in the hotel right next to the con.
9722743	9724083	But yeah, I'll definitely do it.
9724143	9730066	It's just that I may have to take that day off, that Friday off, just to get...
9730746	9732267	just to get my hands on the show early.
9732287	9735508	I took a whole week off to go to E3, although I'm probably not going this year.
9735568	9737188	But, yeah, it's a lot.
9738129	9741550	All right, well, Zacho, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show.
9741970	9745691	Even if you can get your hands on all the good stuff, sounds like you found a few gems in there somewhere.
9745991	9746631	Yep, sure did.
9746791	9748372	All right, well, hopefully see you next year.
9749332	9750453	Definitely Alright, later Bye
9767586	9768227	New York is a lot of fun
9788562	9791623	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9791643	9792003	What the hell?
9792023	9793924	We usually only do three, but I'm feeling generous tonight.
9793944	9794684	Let's do one more call.
9796225	9797985	While we wait for a call... Oh, call's coming in right now.
9798405	9799246	I guess we'll go to it.
9799266	9800146	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9800166	9800486	Who's this?
9801546	9802987	Hey, this is Baz in here.
9803127	9803467	Hey, buddy.
9803487	9804027	What's on your mind?
9805808	9813330	Just to be different this week, rather than talking about videos, I'll be touching on MMOs this time.
9813450	9814271	All right, MMOs.
9815391	9817032	Yeah, specifically two of them.
9818921	9848020	DC Universe Online and Final Fantasy XI yeah mainly because you guys kind of touched on them earlier so well one thing that wasn't mentioned that is kind of interesting if not is that supposedly at least with DC Universe Online sometime within the near future I think within the next month or two
9848820	9875941	There's going to be a digital download version appearing on the PSN store I had heard of that, that they're going to do a full digital download Which wouldn't be too unrealistic I mean, Xbox 360 does something similar already with some of the games I believe PlayStation has a handful of games you can buy I want to say one of them was day and date of Street Release War of Warcraft, the latest expansion was full digital download as well Which was awesome
9876021	9879042	Yeah, well, some doing that has ups and downs depending on how you look at it.
9879102	9880182	On one hand, yeah, there's...
9905854	9909197	The convenience factor, no doubt about that.
9912519	9923468	At least with the beta that went on, granted it was beta, not the full retail releases, obviously there's going to be differences.
9924168	9929332	But at least with the beta, that was a pretty freaking huge file.
9929512	9933796	I mean, it was like, what, ballpark figure of 15 gigabytes?
9935016	9935957	It was huge.
9936717	9947241	Yeah, and even if you got a pretty hefty hard drive inside your system, there's still a good chunk of your hard drive dedicated to one game.
9950963	9960447	But hopefully most PS3 owners have already, at least at one point or another, already upgraded their hard drive at least once.
9960467	9962188	So what do you want to say about Final Fantasy XIV?
9963951	9965292	Oh, actually 11, not 14.
9965372	9965953	Oh, sorry, 11.
9966673	9982827	Yeah, but, well, you know how you were mentioning that, at least temporarily speaking, that they're going to be shutting down the servers for the game because of the recent earthquake?
9983107	9984068	Right.
9984609	9992295	Well, just prior to that earthquake hitting, they had made an announcement saying,
9993191	9998654	that they're already going to be like consolidating some of the servers.
9999175	9999955	Uh-oh.
10000015	10004157	That's usually the sign for the MMO that things are going downhill.
10004197	10006659	But you know what, though?
10006719	10007099	Come on.
10007179	10015523	Final Fantasy XI's had a good run and Sony did kind of probably siphon some of the players with the release of XIV.
10015623	10017925	Kind of cannibalized XI a little bit.
10019165	10019786	Yeah, well...
10021266	10029688	Now, I hate to mention a rival podcast, but this is where I got the information from.
10030249	10038351	There's a podcast that's dedicated to Final Fantasy XI called Limit Break Radio.
10038911	10040672	I've heard of that show.
10040752	10048654	And they had a very small podcast, their most recent entry was
10049659	10051761	for that show on their website.
10053342	10064730	The main host had mentioned that the first time they consolidated the servers, there was a need for it then.
10064831	10071876	Yeah, they could see what they did, but the second round of consolidation of servers, they
10072659	10094810	They don't see what the logic behind that was, because once this new round of consolidation goes through, the servers would probably actually be overpopulated, and for those trying to do the endgame kind of thing, it's going to be a lot more difficult for those people, because the competition for the...
10097912	10106258	They might be worried that they're going to hemorrhage more users because of some of the other MMOs that are out, you know, just with Rift and DC Universe and so on.
10106278	10107098	Maybe they're just worried.
10107298	10108819	They're kind of being proactive, I suppose.
10110480	10122048	Yeah, well, it's kind of sad to see Final Fantasy XI going to throat for the reasons that you just mentioned, because
10123126	10125168	It's kind of like foreboding.
10126170	10130696	Granted, I haven't played the game in a year or two now because of financial reasons.
10131587	10139454	but I was always hoping that eventually once I was able to I could get back into the game because I love the game so much.
10139615	10141516	There'll always be at least one server up.
10141556	10142758	It's a Final Fantasy game.
10142798	10143979	It'll never die completely.
10145040	10152827	I want to ask you real quick before I let you go since you brought up MMOs and I know you're big on Sony products and Sony fanboy and all that and you like free things.
10152887	10156591	What do you think about the announcement of Free Realms coming to PlayStation 3?
10158464	10171066	Well, I really haven't formed an opinion as of yet because, honestly, I haven't played three rounds either on the PS3 because it hasn't come out yet for it.
10171346	10181628	And I just got my computer not even two months ago and it just barely runs some games, albeit poorly.
10183328	10186609	So until I actually play something, I can't really...
10188157	10190518	I'm willing to at least give it a try.
10190538	10196679	I'll tell you what, once I give it a try, let's see, for a multitude, I'll either send an email or call in and
10210655	10212557	essentially give a mini review of it.
10212837	10213177	All right.
10213557	10216540	That way I can be a little bit more fair and be honest about it.
10216860	10217220	All right.
10217461	10218762	We'll be looking to hear from you.
10219202	10219422	All right.
10219442	10221844	But for now, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10221904	10222605	But have a good one, buddy.
10223726	10223906	Yep.
10223926	10224306	You too.
10224346	10224687	Take care.
10224847	10225067	Later.
10226682	10228724	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10228744	10229985	Thank you guys so much for calling.
10230365	10231587	Sorry to those that didn't get through.
10231627	10234089	If you didn't get through tonight, you know, you can always send us an email.
10234189	10236271	Our mailbag had like one email in it tonight, you guys.
10236311	10241135	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Type out your thoughts and we'll read them next week on the show.
10241515	10243237	But for now, last minute stories.
10243277	10244037	I forgot to ask Loki.
10244398	10245639	We had some back-to-back calls tonight.
10245679	10246780	Loki, did you have any last minute stories?
10247572	10248913	Not too much, actually.
10249453	10253277	This is kind of stupid considering DJ Hero.
10253477	10254138	I care about that.
10254178	10254938	I don't really care about this.
10255379	10259723	But Guitar Hero, hey, look, there's more DLC coming out.
10259763	10266309	I know we said that we weren't going to put anything out because we're done with that series, but the fans asked for it, so we're putting out more DLC.
10266429	10271594	Well, thank you for graciously giving us DLC for your game that you've decided to discontinue.
10272655	10272995	Whatever.
10273475	10284603	Anyway, so those tracks coming to Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, they're from the artist Trapped, and you get modern... Didn't you read this earlier in the show?
10284664	10285104	I already did.
10285224	10286205	Shame on you, Loki.
10286225	10286385	Sorry!
10286405	10288526	You were trying to design textures for GTA.
10288546	10290248	There can be only one Matt.
10291471	10293232	I didn't read the story with any angst.
10293713	10299317	I was trying to do a little bit of a journalistic... It's still stupid, though, because they say... Oh, well, we're just continuing the series.
10299517	10300058	Ah, just kidding.
10300078	10301839	We're going to put it out because the fans want it.
10303480	10304501	Who listens to the fans?
10307043	10307143	Um...
10308948	10309108	Toastie!
10327242	10327542	All right.
10329143	10330664	Well, that's going to do it.
10330985	10332646	I guess if that's it for the last minute stories.
10333166	10333927	I believe it is.
10334147	10338510	Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio has come to a close, but not before we say goodnight to everybody.
10338990	10339971	Starting off with Matt, too.
10340011	10342092	Thank you for being here tonight and filling in for DarkSakura.
10342152	10342733	Thanks for the invite.
10342753	10343293	I appreciate it.
10343313	10344594	You did a good job with the news tonight.
10344894	10345935	Well, thank you very much.
10346275	10346596	All right.
10346656	10348517	So we'll have to have you back again sometime.
10348803	10350284	Hopefully not to fill in for someone.
10350384	10350864	Exactly.
10351345	10353426	Just to be the fourth wheel at another point.
10353586	10353806	Fifth.
10353946	10354527	You've got the chat room.
10354547	10354807	That's true.
10354827	10355567	We do have the chat room.
10355827	10357709	They are the always present fourth guest on the show.
10357749	10358509	I'll be the spare tire.
10358529	10359029	The fifth wheel.
10359170	10360230	I'll be the spare tire in the back.
10360410	10360751	Excellent.
10360771	10361691	I'll be the junk in your trunk.
10361951	10363592	Well, we'll see you again.
10363672	10364973	Don't wait two years before coming back.
10364993	10366134	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10366836	10368237	Um, Nutrisystem sucks.
10369618	10370659	Although it's working, it sucks.
10371140	10377825	I did have dinner tonight consisting of buffalo wing pretzel bites and macaroni and cheese in a cup.
10378065	10378606	Delicious.
10378806	10379026	Yes.
10379266	10379606	Not.
10379707	10381248	I'm gonna go eat something else when I get home.
10382489	10385051	Final thoughts, no, really great to be here.
10385391	10391336	Hopefully I'll be invited back on your other podcast in the future so I can be the Deckard Cain of your show and
10391778	10393080	Stay a while and listen.
10393340	10393681	Of course.
10394142	10395203	But no, thank you for having me, Loki.
10395243	10396044	Always a pleasure seeing you.
10396705	10398688	And I will work on my angst next time.
10398708	10399569	And thanks for the beer!
10399990	10400451	Did it work?
10401292	10401552	Maybe.
10402113	10402394	Maybe.
10403035	10403916	I've got two more at home.
10405214	10405474	Awesome.
10406415	10409197	Alright, I want to say a final thought.
10409697	10410538	Headaches suck.
10411358	10412739	Beer doesn't make headaches better either.
10412879	10413440	That's too bad.
10414040	10415001	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10415361	10416862	I am tracking my 3DS.
10417122	10422286	It's coming out of Oakland right now, so I will have that tomorrow for sure.
10422346	10425288	Unless the plane crashes or they lose it.
10425988	10427229	Or it doesn't get stolen in Oakland.
10427850	10430591	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10430631	10432672	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.
10432973	10434673	We really appreciate it.
10434713	10442778	We don't ask for anything to do this show except tonight we do ask you to donate at least $10 to the Red Cross, forego a game, and donate to those in need this week.
10442818	10443478	It's very important.
10444058	10449341	However, outside of that, the way you can help promote this show and continue what we do here, just tell a friend.
10449461	10450321	Tell a friend about the show.
10450902	10457445	Even if you like, I don't know who to tell about the show, leave a nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast at, forums,
10458145	10464790	I actually get the little emails from Google and see people talk about it on forums and I just really appreciate you guys that say nice things about the show.
10464850	10466031	It doesn't go unnoticed.
10466131	10466872	I really appreciate it.
10467272	10471215	So until next time, we'll be back with DarkSakura to do it all again next week.
10471595	10475218	I hope you all have a wonderful night and until then, bye-bye.
10475398	10476179	Be safe this week.
