10000	13000	Sky and Loki

16000	18000	Microsoft shatters sales records
18000	21000	EA bans a player from Dragon Age 2 unintentionally
21000	25000	And despite what's happened to Guitar Hero, could Dance Hero be a reality?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	It's the show where every gamer has a voice
38000	41000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific
41000	43000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com
43000	46000	www.AllGames.com
46000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host
49000	51000	Not here tonight, sadly
51000	53000	The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
53000	56000	She is out of town, don't feel too bad for her though
56000	58000	She's on her way to Disneyland
58000	62000	So, you know, how can you feel sorry for her when she's going to the happiest freaking place on earth
62000	65000	And we're stuck here doing the show in her place
65000	66000	Oh well
66000	69000	Anyhow, so she might be joining us a little later for a call, we'll see
69000	73000	But joining us here, as always, say hello at least to tech master, Loki is here
73000	74000	Yes I am
74000	75000	Yes, how you doing, Loki?
75000	76000	I'm doing great
76000	78000	Awesome, good to hear it
78000	80000	Everything going well with the baby and all that good stuff?
80000	81000	Yes
81000	82000	Good, good
82000	87000	Alright, and joining us tonight, since unfortunately Dark Sakura is not here
87000	90000	We do have a third host sitting in the studio with us
90000	93000	And he hasn't been on the show in quite some time
93000	95000	But say hello everybody to Matt2
95000	96000	Well hello Rob number one
96000	97000	How are you doing Matt2?
97000	98000	I'm doing well yourself
98000	101000	I'm pretty good, I feel like we just had this conversation
101000	106000	It seems like deja vu, but you know, we're not in the matrix or anything so it can't be
106000	110000	Yeah, for the podcast listeners, this is take two of the live show because we had a little screw up
110000	113000	But just pretend I didn't ask you these questions just five minutes ago
113000	119000	Anyhow, Matt2 hasn't been here in about two years and five studios ago
119000	122000	No, we've had like five studios throughout all of OLR
122000	124000	You were in the last one that we did
124000	126000	So it's been a little while
126000	131000	But some of the folks that listen to Hoard House, my Warcraft show, might know you as Grandpa Warcraft
131000	134000	Yes, that's right, I am the Deckard Cain of your show
134000	135000	Yes
135000	137000	Alright, so what types of video games do you play?
137000	139000	Just tell us, I'll ask you about your gaming weekend a little bit
139000	142000	But generally, what types of video games do you like to play? What consoles do you own?
142000	145000	It's mainly MMOs for the moment and a lot of iOS games
145000	150000	I'm playing a lot of games on the iPhone 4 and soon my iPad 2 if it ever gets here
150000	154000	But I own a 360 and I'm still debating on whether getting a Kinect
154000	159000	But my console history goes way back to Atari 5200 and every NES system
159000	166000	And then made the transition to PC games when games like Descent and Duke Nukem 3D were uber back in the day
166000	169000	So is that really where you like to game the most, just PC?
169000	172000	It kind of fell into PC. I got the 360 because of Halo
172000	175000	I was definitely a fan of the Halo series until recently
175000	177000	And other first-person shooters
177000	182000	Oh, you say that a little stinging like, I did not like a certain Halo game that really ruined it for me
182000	184000	Is that what's going on?
184000	191000	Well, I bought Reach and I beat it on hard, not legendary, within the first few hours
191000	194000	I went, oh, this is going to be focusing on the multiplayer side, isn't it?
194000	196000	And sure enough it does
196000	198000	Which I'm an okay fan of
198000	200000	But I do like a lot of story
200000	204000	And I was really disappointed in how quick the first person went through
204000	209000	But, you know, there's other first-person shooters out there, Call of Duty, Gears of War, things like that
209000	212000	But for the time being it's 360, debating on the Kinect
212000	215000	And a lot of Warcraft on the PC and iOS 4 games
215000	217000	You do anything else on the PC besides Warcraft?
217000	220000	Not as of recent, I tried Star Trek Online
220000	223000	Jamie Summers convinced me to give it a try
223000	226000	As a huge, huge, huge Trekkie
226000	229000	All your WoW characters are named after Star Trek characters
229000	231000	They used to be
231000	233000	I thought you had one named like, B'Elanna
233000	235000	And I'm like, I know who that is
235000	237000	I was the other guy that watched Voyager
237000	243000	When I first started Warcraft, all my characters were named after obscure Star Trek characters
243000	246000	Not Picard and Riker, because that's just too pretentious
246000	248000	And those names are taken in five minutes
248000	249000	Yeah, I'm sure they are
249000	253000	I went Neelix, Kes, B'Elanna, Darmok
253000	254000	If you remember the Darmok
254000	255000	Who liked Kes?
255000	257000	Well, I never leveled her up
257000	259000	She's a rogue sitting there collecting dust, obviously
259000	261000	And now they're all Latin names
261000	262000	Because now I'm Alliance
262000	264000	And it's much more formal on that side of the...
264000	265000	Ho ho
265000	266000	Yeah, exactly
267000	270000	PC games-wise, Fable, I played a lot of Fable back in the day
270000	271000	Awesome
271000	272000	And stuff like that
272000	274000	Alright, so it sounds like you've played quite a variety of different things
274000	275000	I try to
275000	277000	Do you do the iOS stuff now?
277000	279000	That's where gaming seems to be going in some ways
279000	280000	I do
280000	281000	At least it's casual
281000	283000	I confess I downloaded Angry Birds Seasons today
283000	285000	Because I figured it's appropriate
285000	287000	It's St. Patrick's Day on Thursday
287000	289000	They play Irish music in the background
289000	291000	And there's shamrocks everywhere
291000	293000	And pots of gold if you hit, you get bonus points
293000	295000	So yeah, that's my new diction
295000	299000	I did download, reluctantly, or regretfully, Mega Man 2
299000	303000	And it doesn't work when you don't have an actual tactile controller
303000	304000	Don't get me started
304000	307000	I know, and I listened to your podcast about it and it made sense
307000	309000	But I love Mega Man
309000	311000	It's a huge, huge favorite series of mine
311000	313000	So I wanted to get it because I'm a supporter
313000	315000	And I can't even get through the air stage because I can't
315000	317000	When they play the buttons, so
317000	321000	Well, they have those little things, like stickers that you can put on your iPad
321000	323000	Or, you know, iPods or whatever
323000	327000	To create tactile controls for the touchpad stuff
327000	331000	I might invest in that with my iPad 2
331000	334000	Because little buttons like on my phone and you gotta take them off and put them back on
334000	335000	I don't know
335000	336000	They actually have some pretty sweet ones
336000	340000	There's ones that were through, like, ThinkGeek or whatever
340000	345000	They had actual, looks like an arcade joystick that plugs on there
345000	346000	Which is kind of cool
346000	350000	And then they had some that just kind of stick to the side suction cup wise
350000	352000	But apparently they're pretty decent
352000	356000	I mean, but really they just need to come out with something better
356000	359000	So yeah, when it comes to the iPhone 4
359000	363000	And what my iPhone 4 and iOS games is kind of my main focus right now
363000	365000	I'm not on WoW or the PC games
365000	367000	They're good bathroom games
367000	371000	I find the, like, Cut the Rope is a great potty game, actually
371000	372000	For cutting the rope?
372000	373000	Yes
373000	375000	For pinching the loaf?
375000	376000	Wow
376000	379000	Out on the ice tour coming soon
379000	382000	Anyhow, speaking of St. Patrick's Day, since you brought up St. Patrick's Day
382000	383000	You were kind enough
383000	386000	I like this, when we invite you to the show you do bribe us a little bit
386000	387000	Well, yeah
387000	391000	I brought this gigantic beer in a green, like, can thing
391000	392000	It is green, I didn't think of that
392000	394000	It's imported from Canadian
394000	396000	I love Canadian
396000	397000	I know, yeah, we love Canadian
397000	399000	America's hat
399000	401000	America's big, liberal, loving hat
401000	403000	It's America's suburb
403000	405000	Anyhow, no, obviously I'm just giving them a hard time
405000	407000	But, so I'm gonna drink this beer
407000	409000	Since you drove tonight, I can drink a beer
409000	410000	That's right
410000	412000	I'm gonna get drunk in Jamie's house when she's not here
412000	413000	Yay!
413000	414000	I brought her for Loki
414000	415000	Then I'm gonna go pass out in the vault
415000	416000	I brought her for Loki
416000	420000	Yeah, but I have to drive and I don't like beer, so, sorry
420000	423000	So, anyway, let's start the celebrating a little early
423000	424000	There you go
424000	426000	Oh, I was so hoping that would explode in your face
426000	427000	Hey, that's not nice
427000	429000	It would ruin his microphone
429000	431000	It would ruin the microphone and the keyboard
431000	432000	Now, the audience
432000	433000	I have to do a third take
433000	437000	No, the audience doesn't know is it's not your average, you know, Budweiser 12 ounce can of beer
437000	438000	It's 18
438000	439000	It's a 40
439000	440000	No, it's not a 40
440000	442000	It's 18 ounces, I believe, or 20
442000	446000	And it's a Pilsner with a mild aftertaste and it's very hoppy
446000	447000	What do you think, Rob?
447000	448000	Not bad for beer
448000	449000	Okay, good
449000	450000	But I can drink one of these
450000	452000	You know, usually I don't screw around with beer
452000	453000	You don't?
453000	457000	No, I'm just like, let's fill the glass with vodka, splash of cranberry, I'm good
457000	458000	And a twist of lime
458000	459000	Yeah
459000	462000	But after one of those, Rob, I do get a little tipsy, so I can only imagine what the drive home
462000	465000	My driving you home is gonna be like in a couple hours
465000	469000	Well, look, this will be, I guess you could say in some ways, my gift to the listeners
469000	472000	You know what, it's been, it's been a crazy week in the world
472000	478000	It has been a crazy week in the world and, you know, I realize some people play video games to escape
478000	481000	Sometimes the crazy things that are going on in the world
481000	483000	And I like this show to kind of be like that too
483000	490000	That, you know, if we can give you a few lulls tonight to take your mind off of some of the not so lullsy things going on in the world
490000	491000	Then I think mission accomplished
491000	492000	Sounds like a plan
492000	493000	So
493000	494000	Share some
494000	495000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks
495000	497000	And the type of video games that you've been playing this week
497000	498000	Since we do always start off the show that way
498000	501000	Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
501000	502000	I didn't play much
502000	504000	I played Grand Theft Auto at work
504000	508000	I played Naughty Bear for like a few minutes
508000	511000	Which the game is really low budget
511000	519000	But it's kind of funny because they have this like British guy who, you know, yells out these, you know, different things like
519000	521000	De-fluffication!
521000	523000	You know, it's just like, it's so weird
523000	526000	It's just a weird, weird game
526000	529000	De-fluffication sounds like something you could go to prison for
529000	530000	I know
530000	534000	But yeah, it's a weird, really low budget game
534000	538000	They're doing a game of the year edition that's coming out in May
538000	542000	So if you want to, you know, pick it up later on I guess you could
542000	545000	But honestly it's really low budget
545000	547000	But it's kind of fun, I guess
547000	552000	Because I mean the whole game feels like a really kiddie game but you're just brutally murdering these teddy bears
552000	556000	It's just not bloody enough though, that's the only downside to it
556000	560000	And then mainly just working on Grand Theft Auto edits at home
560000	569000	And I finally finished, I think, some of the stuff that I got to burn my new discs that we're going to be playing at work now
569000	574000	Which is incredibly bloody now because I made the blood effects really huge
574000	576000	But it serves two purposes
576000	577000	Needs more blood!
577000	584000	It serves two purposes. One, people are always saying, well, you know, I swear I hit you with those, you know, the minigun or something like that
584000	586000	And I'm like, no you didn't
586000	594000	Well this way you'll know if you hit somebody because the blood effect is just so huge that you'll see that bullet spray from, you know, pretty far away
594000	596000	And because it looks fucking awesome
596000	601000	Because you shoot somebody and it's just hilarious because it's just all this blood everywhere
601000	604000	Um, I'm trying to think of one else
604000	606000	Is there ever enough blood for you, Loki?
606000	610000	Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's just fun to see what I can do with the game
610000	614000	On a completely random note since you're talking about blood and all of this stuff
614000	618000	One of these things that I saw this week that, um, I think she needs her own video game
618000	620000	You know the rap artist Lil' Kim?
620000	623000	She has a new album out called Black Friday
623000	628000	And I don't know if you've seen the album cover but it's very like Kill Bill with blood splattering everywhere
628000	632000	And there's this little decapitated pink wig that's on the ground on the album cover
632000	635000	That I think is supposed to symbolize Nicki Minaj and their little feud, I don't know
635000	638000	But, um, I'm thinking she should have her own video game
638000	640000	I don't know, there's something about Lil' Kim
640000	641000	No, I don't think so
641000	643000	What, you wouldn't play a Lil' Kim video game?
643000	644000	No, I would not play a Lil' Kim video game
644000	645000	Why is that?
645000	649000	Because, I, I'm sorry, she, what, she thinks she's some sort of sexy samurai there?
649000	651000	I'm sorry, that does not happen
651000	653000	She's got big ol' boobies
653000	658000	Oh, oh, well in that case she has all the requirements to fill, you know, the samurai position
658000	660000	Big tits, done
660000	661000	You're a samurai now
661000	665000	If there were a video game called Big Titted Samurai, you would check it out
665000	667000	You would at least kind of look, you would pick up the box and look at the back
667000	671000	I would look at that, but, you know, I'm just saying though, it
671000	673000	Only goes rated M
673000	675000	It, it's just, it's stupid
675000	678000	It's stupid, it's stupid that artists have feuds
678000	680000	No one cares
680000	683000	Oh no, this artist doesn't like this artist
683000	687000	Oh no, who cares, it's just
687000	689000	Westside rap and East Coast rap
689000	691000	Oh god, so stupid
691000	694000	Yeah, you're all gangsters, oh my god
694000	696000	Oh, such the feud
698000	700000	Alright, sorry to derail the conversation
700000	702000	But I don't know, when you were talking about Gran Todano and blood splattering everywhere
702000	704000	I was thinking about that album cover I saw and I was like
704000	706000	I would play her in a game
706000	709000	Yes, exactly, I agree with Kitsune
709000	711000	I would play a Robogatia video game
711000	714000	I'd play anything from that company because
714000	716000	Robogatia's really weird
716000	718000	As, you know
718000	720000	And by the way
720000	722000	Many of the other movies that they put out
722000	725000	Since I'm very rude and the second take made me derail a little bit
725000	726000	I forgot to introduce the chat room tonight
726000	728000	Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com
728000	731000	If you are listening live at All Games Radio on this Sunday, March the 13th
731000	733000	You should hop on over to our chat room and join us live
733000	735000	Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com
735000	739000	And besides, a big-tit samurai game, that's just basically, you know, the last Ninja Gaiden game
739000	743000	Couldn't they just take, was Dead or Alive 4
743000	745000	And all those big-titty characters and give them swords
745000	748000	And they already got the basic code down for that
748000	750000	That's kind of Soul Calibur
750000	751000	Or Soul Calibur
751000	753000	Well, they already kind of did that though
753000	755000	With the last Ninja Gaiden game, they had, you know
755000	757000	Bonus characters from Dead or Alive
757000	761000	And from the other, you know, DS, Dragon Sword game
761000	763000	And that kind of stuff, but
763000	766000	Once again, you know, I don't think we should really give
766000	768000	A rap star a video game
768000	770000	Have we not learned from 50 Cent?
770000	773000	Really, I mean, Blood in the Sand was amazing
773000	776000	I do give you the fact that it is so ridiculous
776000	778000	That it is awesome, but
779000	782000	I just don't think Lil' Kim has that same appeal
782000	784000	Well, rap stars have their own game, isn't it?
784000	786000	Rap star, rap hero
786000	787000	Which is not a bad game
787000	788000	It really isn't
788000	789000	A lot of people want to pass it off, it's like
789000	792000	Oh, I don't like rap, but if you look at it as a game
792000	795000	They invested more in, especially coming from Konami
795000	798000	Or what, I'm sure somebody else did it and they published it
798000	801000	But coming from that kind of that same family
801000	803000	If you look at that next to like DDR
803000	805000	Which has been recycled so many times
805000	807000	Or the Karaoke Revolution games
807000	810000	It's like, wow, they're the only ones that are like
810000	813000	Really doing something new and exciting as Def Jam rap stars
813000	816000	With their community features
816000	818000	That's really amazing that they have all that
818000	820000	And they didn't put in anything else
820000	823000	Hey, we have this cool dancing game that has camera support
823000	826000	That we, you know, people dance in front of a camera
826000	828000	Could we have community support for that?
828000	832000	Nope, sorry, that would be forward thinking, of course
832000	835000	Or, you know, how about
835000	839000	Now's the time, seriously, Guitar Freaks, you know, Drummania
839000	842000	Maybe you give it another go and not make a crappy game this time
842000	844000	No, no, let it be, let it be
844000	846000	Put it out to pasture
846000	847000	Moo
847000	848000	Alright
848000	850000	Oh, I bet we'll get another Guitar Hero game
850000	853000	We'll see
853000	854000	They're looking at you like
854000	855000	The money's there
855000	856000	They're just waiting for, you know
856000	858000	They've milked the cow dry
858000	860000	They just have to wait for it to melt to come back
860000	862000	So you're not saying like we're gonna have a new Guitar Hero game
862000	863000	Like this year or next year
863000	864000	Because, no, they announced it's done
864000	865000	This year
865000	867000	But you think there'll be that renaissance
867000	868000	In like three years' time
868000	871000	They've announced, they didn't say that they've dissolved the franchise completely
871000	874000	They said there's no Guitar Hero, no Tony Hawk game this year
874000	876000	Okay, alright
876000	879000	That's very tinfoil hat of you, but we'll see
879000	880000	Oh, come on
880000	882000	They think money's there
882000	885000	I mean, we were talking with Bobby beforehand
885000	888000	You know, and it's gonna be a story we're gonna be covering later on
888000	890000	Talking about a trademark that they had
890000	893000	A long time ago, I remember with Drum Villain and Dance Hero
893000	895000	And everyone was like, oh no
895000	898000	Here they go, copying DDR
898000	900000	Well, you know what, I mean, seriously
900000	904000	They're just like, okay, what's Homarnax doing that seems profitable
904000	907000	I would like to see what that whole Guitar Villain idea was all about
907000	912000	Unless that was, I always envisioned that that was just to protect someone else from doing it
912000	914000	That'd be dumb
914000	916000	I mean, but anyways
916000	918000	They're basically just gonna look at whatever
918000	920000	Homarnax is doing that's profitable
920000	922000	Then they're gonna copy it
922000	924000	I mean, that's...
924000	926000	What's gonna happen? I mean, seriously
926000	928000	If Rockman 3 continues to be profitable
928000	931000	I mean, granted the game didn't sell as well as
931000	933000	You know, maybe 2 did, but
933000	935000	Once again, they have a lot of download content
935000	937000	It's not really market
937000	939000	You can't really look at the game sales
939000	941000	And say, oh, this game, you know, the series is dead
941000	944000	It's just, I think their download content is doing really well
944000	947000	But, once again though
947000	949000	The dance games are doing really well now
949000	952000	Like Just Dance and Dance Central and stuff like that
952000	954000	So, of course they're gonna be like
954000	956000	We have this completely original idea that we're gonna put out
956000	959000	And you're gonna buy it because it's part of the hero franchise
959000	963000	You know, our wonderful hero franchise that we support greatly
963000	966000	No, we didn't kill off the hero franchise
966000	968000	We're bringing it back with dance hero
968000	971000	I think Matt's got some angst left over from last week
971000	973000	No, it's just...
973000	975000	It's just so retarded
975000	977000	They're so two-faced
977000	980000	Oh, the music industry, music genre's dead
980000	982000	It's so dead
982000	984000	Oh, but here's our dance game
984000	986000	It's part of the music genre, right?
986000	988000	No, it's a different music genre
988000	991000	We were talking about the other music genre
993000	996000	They'll do whatever, you know, has money behind it
996000	998000	If they can make money doing it, they're gonna do it
998000	1000000	Just like there's gonna be another Call of Duty game
1000000	1002000	Because it's Call of Duty
1002000	1004000	It makes money
1004000	1006000	Somewhere in there we were talking about Loki's gaming week
1006000	1008000	And I get the feeling he's done
1008000	1010000	So, Matt, too, do you want to share your gaming week?
1010000	1011000	What you've been playing?
1011000	1012000	I'm afraid
1012000	1014000	No, my gaming week
1014000	1016000	Again, I do play Warcraft semi-regularly
1016000	1018000	I'm in class right now
1018000	1020000	So that inhibits some things
1020000	1022000	I've got different characters I work on there
1022000	1024000	I'm part of a guild with some IRL friends
1024000	1028000	So that helps pass the time with WoW
1028000	1030000	Gaming week, Angry Birds is really addicting
1030000	1032000	I'm going through all of them
1032000	1034000	Trying to get three stars and everything
1034000	1036000	For me, it's all about the physics
1036000	1038000	The math behind it, I get the right angle
1038000	1040000	And the right, I don't know
1040000	1042000	You know what, I feel for him
1042000	1044000	I don't want to cut the rope, but I do
1044000	1046000	No, I'm sorry
1046000	1048000	I understand the physics part of it
1048000	1050000	And that's kind of cool and stuff
1050000	1052000	I promise I only play when I poop
1052000	1054000	I do not play when I poop
1054000	1056000	Sometimes I play in bed
1056000	1058000	I tried to give
1058000	1060000	I have played in bed, actually
1060000	1062000	I have tried to give Angry Birds
1062000	1064000	I gave Angry Birds a try
1064000	1066000	This is one of the games I bought
1066000	1068000	Everybody likes it, so I'm going to buy it
1068000	1070000	It's 99 cents, what the hell
1070000	1072000	I didn't play it for the longest time
1072000	1074000	I actually played it
1074000	1076000	It's okay, but I just
1076000	1078000	I don't see how everybody's so obsessed about this game
1078000	1080000	If it was Scorched Earth
1080000	1082000	There's no discussion
1082000	1084000	And that has physics
1084000	1086000	And angle calculation and all that fun stuff
1086000	1088000	And tanks
1088000	1090000	See, that's what Angry Birds needs
1090000	1092000	If you played Angry Birds
1092000	1094000	And they released an ad
1094000	1096000	Every time you killed a pig, it would explode bloody
1096000	1098000	Would you then play it?
1098000	1100000	No, I wouldn't, because it's a cheap cash-in
1100000	1102000	Just like all these holiday add-ons are cheap cash-in
1102000	1104000	What if the pig exploded
1104000	1106000	And then bacon comes out the USB slot
1106000	1108000	On your phone?
1108000	1110000	Okay, really it's alright
1110000	1112000	Keep your protein to yourself
1112000	1114000	I forgot to mention it because it wasn't really part of my gaming week
1114000	1116000	But I made bacon ice cream this week
1116000	1118000	Eww
1118000	1120000	It's actually breakfast ice cream
1120000	1122000	Breakfast ice cream?
1122000	1124000	Well, it's because there's waffle cone in there
1124000	1126000	And maple syrup
1126000	1128000	Bacon waffles
1128000	1130000	Did you cover it in chocolate butter?
1130000	1132000	That's something you'd order at IHOP
1132000	1134000	Where you can get dessert for breakfast
1134000	1136000	Seriously, that French toast that's fucking stuffed with cream cheese
1136000	1138000	That is not breakfast
1138000	1140000	I had chicken and waffles for breakfast today
1140000	1142000	That's better than bacon-flavored ice cream
1142000	1144000	Uh, actually
1144000	1146000	Anyways, think about getting chicken and waffles at IHOP
1146000	1148000	Don't. It's alright
1148000	1150000	But it's not good
1150000	1152000	I mean, it's not like
1152000	1154000	Mmm, that's really yummy
1154000	1156000	I'm full now
1156000	1158000	Somewhere in here was Angry Birds and IOS
1158000	1160000	And now we're talking about frying the birds
1160000	1162000	You said bacon! This is all your fault
1162000	1164000	You did say bacon
1164000	1166000	Okay, so I did make bacon ice cream
1166000	1168000	I think I put too much bacon in it
1168000	1170000	And I know how- Nonsense!
1170000	1172000	Exactly, nonsense
1172000	1174000	But it's just
1174000	1176000	You have to really be in the mood for bacon ice cream
1176000	1178000	Because if you're eating it
1178000	1180000	It's ice cream-y and then all of a sudden salty
1180000	1182000	And it's just like
1182000	1184000	Huh? Why is there salt in there?
1184000	1186000	I mean, it's a little strange
1186000	1188000	My wife likes it actually, though
1188000	1190000	She likes the bacon ice cream
1190000	1192000	She is a horrible Jew
1192000	1194000	Horrible
1194000	1196000	Horrible
1196000	1198000	Nah, I'm just kidding. You know I love her
1198000	1200000	Anyhow, so yeah, Angry Birds, right?
1200000	1202000	Yeah, it's a lot of
1202000	1204000	IOS games on my iPhone 4
1204000	1206000	And again, as I mentioned, I'm getting an iPad 2
1206000	1208000	Hopefully by week's end
1208000	1210000	I don't want to wait in lines and get it
1210000	1212000	So I ordered it online
1212000	1214000	Once I have that, it'll sync in and play Angry Birds
1214000	1216000	And huge, huge, uh
1216000	1218000	What's that? 9.7 inch- Angry Birds HD
1218000	1220000	HD, well, it's not Retina display, unfortunately
1220000	1222000	It's HD because it's in the 9.7 inch
1222000	1224000	Diagonal screen, whatever
1224000	1226000	Holy crap, that's a game that's really gonna utilize HD graphics
1226000	1228000	Hell yeah
1228000	1230000	You see those pigs' beady eyes winking at you
1230000	1232000	Aside from that, I
1232000	1234000	The pig is saying no
1234000	1236000	To see you know
1236000	1238000	The last thing I'm thinking about picking up
1238000	1240000	And hopefully you're fourth guest in the chat room at
1240000	1242000	chat.orangeloudradia.com
1242000	1244000	Yeah, so you have been listening for a little while
1244000	1246000	I think you've been slipping into this role very easily
1246000	1248000	I've been thinking about picking up Dragon Age 2
1248000	1250000	I had original Dragon Age, I downloaded a lot of the
1250000	1252000	DLC content
1252000	1254000	I like the DLC content
1254000	1256000	I was disappointed that it was very out of
1256000	1258000	chronological order
1258000	1260000	Once you pass the game, you download some DLC
1260000	1262000	It pretty much says, oh, just pretend that you didn't
1262000	1264000	You know, end the game and
1264000	1266000	This is extra stuff
1266000	1268000	But I'm curious about Dragon Age 2
1268000	1270000	Getting reviews, I'm hearing mostly good
1270000	1272000	But I defer to your chat room if anyone's
1272000	1274000	Bought it, I appreciate your opinions
1274000	1276000	And I might be picking up that and
1276000	1278000	Detoxing from WoW for a bit
1278000	1280000	And then going over to my Xbox
1280000	1282000	And of course, you know what
1282000	1284000	The best part about any new Dragon
1284000	1286000	Age game coming out is of course going to be
1286000	1288000	Gay sex scene!
1288000	1290000	Yay! Gay sex scene in Dragon
1290000	1292000	Age! Hooray!
1292000	1300000	Let's talk you more penis
1312000	1314000	Here's what I have a problem with Bioware
1314000	1316000	There's such fucking teases
1316000	1318000	There's no nudity, and there's definitely
1318000	1320000	No sex scenes
1320000	1322000	They just kind of like, jump on the bed
1328000	1330000	I'm looking for this
1330000	1332000	See, look at that, that's tongue right there
1332000	1334000	That was some tongue, some big gay kissing
1334000	1336000	Yes, there's
1336000	1338000	Woman on woman and man on woman
1338000	1340000	Whatever you want, it's all there
1340000	1342000	If we can have boobs in God of War, why can't we have boobs
1342000	1344000	In, you know, Dragon Age, or Mass Effect
1344000	1346000	Because it just wouldn't be classy
1346000	1348000	Oh, who cares!
1348000	1350000	I thought it was classy
1350000	1352000	I would rather die than spend a moment
1352000	1354000	Not here with you
1354000	1356000	Well then fine, they need to consult with Hugh Hefner
1356000	1358000	To make a classy, you know
1358000	1360000	Topless woman game, okay
1360000	1362000	I mean, seriously
1362000	1364000	I don't understand why they can't do this
1364000	1366000	And you know what, they can do full frontal for guys on there
1366000	1368000	They did it in Grand Theft Auto
1368000	1370000	In, you know, the Lost in Damned expansion
1370000	1372000	So, if they can do it classy there
1372000	1374000	Then why can't they
1374000	1376000	But the important thing is classy
1376000	1378000	Classy, topless women
1378000	1380000	I'm trying to think of a classy penis
1380000	1382000	And I don't think there really is one
1382000	1384000	Oh, why yes, Guinevere
1384000	1386000	This tea tastes rather lovely
1386000	1388000	Yes, I'm quite enjoying
1388000	1390000	This little tea and crumpets that we're having today
1390000	1392000	Oh, but I seem to have lost my bra
1392000	1394000	Have you seen my bra?
1396000	1398000	That would be the game that Loki wants to play
1398000	1400000	Classy, topless women
1400000	1402000	That sounds very boring
1402000	1404000	They only have swords
1404000	1406000	That would conclude my gaming week because we're moving on to another topic
1406000	1408000	That I think is probably a different podcast
1408000	1410000	Right, then
1410000	1412000	Moving on, my gaming week
1412000	1414000	A lot of the same old stuff, Warcraft
1414000	1416000	You Don't Know Jack and a lot of those fun games
1416000	1418000	But I did play one new game this week that I wanted to talk about
1418000	1420000	And if you've been listening over the past couple of weeks
1420000	1422000	You know I've been very excited about Torchlight
1422000	1424000	Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade
1424000	1426000	Torchlight
1426000	1428000	Was kind of an indie, it's a startup
1428000	1430000	Studio, some of the folks that used to be
1430000	1432000	Blizzard are a part of this studio
1432000	1434000	They put together Torchlight
1434000	1436000	And it was on Steam a couple of years ago
1436000	1438000	And it's been the subject of some of their
1438000	1440000	$10 sales
1440000	1442000	I think at one point you might have been able to get the game for $5
1442000	1444000	But in a nutshell, Torchlight
1444000	1446000	Is very much inspired by Diablo 2
1446000	1448000	And obviously we've gone through a huge drought
1448000	1450000	There hasn't been a Diablo game in many
1450000	1452000	Many years, the last Diablo game was
1452000	1454000	What, 99? 2000?
1454000	1456000	Yes, there's one coming out
1456000	1458000	But that doesn't help me now
1458000	1460000	So Torchlight was really there to fill the void
1460000	1462000	If you like those dungeon crawling games
1462000	1464000	Where you kind of get the items
1464000	1466000	And socket the items, have your talent trees, all that stuff
1466000	1468000	The one thing it lacked
1468000	1470000	Unfortunately, multiplayer
1470000	1472000	Multiplayer was lacking in the game
1472000	1474000	But it is a $10 game
1474000	1476000	At some point, $20 I think is the most you're going to pay for Torchlight
1476000	1478000	I think if you buy it at retail
1478000	1480000	Which is still pretty good value considering
1480000	1482000	I think they still charge $30 for Diablo 2
1482000	1484000	In the battle chest all these years later
1484000	1486000	So it's not a bad deal
1486000	1488000	Randomly generated dungeons and all that good stuff
1488000	1490000	Never the same game twice, woohoo
1490000	1492000	So finally they ported this thing to Xbox Live Arcade
1492000	1494000	And they've had to make some changes with the game
1494000	1496000	And that kind of had a lot of people nervous
1496000	1500000	Because the dungeon crawly games are usually very reliant on point and click
1500000	1506000	And these style of games I kind of throw all the way back to
1506000	1508000	I don't know if you remember this on the PC
1508000	1510000	A very, very old PC game called Rogue
1510000	1512000	Did you ever play Rogue way back in the day?
1512000	1514000	Diablo's clearly inspired by this game
1514000	1516000	From way back in the day
1516000	1518000	And I want to say, isn't NetHack a derivative of that too?
1518000	1520000	I think, or am I crazy?
1520000	1522000	I don't know, something I was reading about, I haven't played that one
1522000	1524000	I just remember Rogue back in the Commodore 64
1524000	1526000	They're all kind of like this
1526000	1530000	So it was very interesting to kind of see that style of game now on the Xbox
1530000	1536000	Because this isn't really the type of game we see a lot on Xbox I think
1536000	1539000	It's not an action-y game like Tomb Raider
1539000	1543000	It's not an intense role-playing game like Final Fantasy
1543000	1545000	It's kind of somewhere in between
1545000	1547000	So it's neat to see something like this on Xbox
1547000	1549000	But they had to change some things
1549000	1551000	There's less pointy and clicking
1551000	1553000	You attack with the X button
1553000	1555000	Your menus are totally different now
1555000	1558000	Because you don't really have the bag that you have everything in
1558000	1561000	It's just straight up, you have 50 slots and different tabs
1561000	1563000	It's really weird to navigate
1563000	1565000	It's a little overwhelming at first
1565000	1567000	And I've got to be honest
1567000	1570000	Torchlight's biggest drawback for me on the Xbox 360 is
1570000	1573000	What they had to do to convert it to console I think in some ways
1573000	1576000	The text is very small
1576000	1579000	So if you don't have a big TV
1579000	1581000	You might be in a little bit of trouble
1581000	1584000	There's some framerate issues and it's noticeable
1584000	1586000	When I was going through some of the dungeons
1586000	1588000	There's a lot of enemies on the screen at once
1588000	1590000	And you're trying to do some attacks
1590000	1592000	It just seems like the framerate really drops
1592000	1594000	And then suddenly everything's dead which is cool
1594000	1598000	But not the smoothness that I came to expect on the PC
1598000	1603000	And just the weird, having so many buttons
1603000	1606000	To send your pet to town you have to bring up your menu
1606000	1610000	With start, hit the back button to bring up the pet menu
1610000	1612000	And then hit the Y button to send him to town
1612000	1614000	There's a lot to it which I understand
1614000	1617000	That's what they have to do to make a PC game work on the Xbox 360
1617000	1620000	With minimal loss
1620000	1622000	You don't want the game to lose anything
1622000	1624000	And the good news is it doesn't
1624000	1626000	It's still got that same kind of feel to it
1626000	1628000	But unfortunately these few drawbacks
1628000	1631000	Make it really hard for me to recommend on the 360
1631000	1634000	When I know most 360 owners own a PC
1634000	1636000	So my point is
1636000	1639000	If you have this game on the PC already
1639000	1640000	I think you're good
1640000	1642000	Like you really only need this if you insist
1642000	1644000	Like I've got to have something to play on the TV
1644000	1646000	Or I really want to have this on console
1646000	1647000	I want to go for the achievements
1647000	1649000	Those are all really good reasons I suppose
1649000	1654000	But I would say if you've never played the game before
1654000	1656000	And you're kind of trying to decide
1656000	1657000	Do I want to play this?
1657000	1659000	Go check out the PC demo
1659000	1660000	Not the Xbox 360 one
1660000	1663000	Because I think the PC demo is a little bit better representative
1663000	1665000	Of what Torchlight really is
1665000	1667000	So that would be my recommendation
1667000	1669000	But it's not a bad game
1669000	1671000	I just feel like it lost a little something
1671000	1673000	When it came over from the PC
1673000	1675000	The PC version is
1675000	1677000	Excuse me, really superior
1677000	1679000	So check that out on the PC
1679000	1681000	If you must, if you don't have a computer
1681000	1682000	Good enough or something
1682000	1685000	I guess you could always use the Xbox 360 one as a substitute
1685000	1686000	It's not bad
1686000	1689000	It's just not, again, that same level as the PC
1689000	1691000	So that was pretty much my gaming week
1691000	1694000	So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping
1694000	1697000	Not a whole lot in housekeeping I want to talk about right now
1697000	1699000	I want to talk about something after this first story here
1699000	1702000	But I will say, of course, our Twitter
1702000	1705000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us on Twitter
1705000	1707000	Or you can always add us on Facebook as well
1707000	1709000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
1709000	1710000	A good way to always follow us
1710000	1712000	And we'll see what the latest and greatest is about our show
1712000	1714000	Forgot to mention my gaming week
1714000	1716000	Since I'm not really playing it yet
1716000	1717000	But it will be tomorrow
1717000	1719000	I'm getting a Japanese 3DS
1719000	1720000	So that's coming tomorrow
1720000	1724000	Nice, what made you decide to take the plunge and get the Japanese 3DS?
1724000	1726000	Because I like everything early
1726000	1730000	Even his ice cream for breakfast
1730000	1736000	I have a problem with needing to have things early
1736000	1742000	I'm getting a Japanese 3DS with Nintendogs
1742000	1746000	And then Ridge Racer
1746000	1749000	Only because Pilotwings wasn't out yet
1749000	1751000	Otherwise I would have gotten Pilotwings
1751000	1753000	We have to bring that to the studio next week
1753000	1754000	I got to see one a while ago
1754000	1756000	But I want to see what that finished product looks like
1756000	1758000	I'm sure Jamie would love to check it out too
1758000	1761000	It would be fun too if they have good import games later on
1761000	1764000	Because sometimes Japan gets stuff before we do
1764000	1766000	Like Smash Brothers and stuff
1766000	1768000	And I'm still getting a US one when that comes out
1768000	1770000	With Street Fighter 4
1770000	1771000	Because you have an addiction
1771000	1772000	It's so funny too
1772000	1774000	Because just last week you were all
1774000	1777000	Last week was a really good Loki hatin' on Nintendo show
1777000	1778000	And now he's sitting here going
1778000	1780000	Yeah, I'm buying 2DS, 3DS's
1780000	1781000	It's just really funny
1781000	1783000	Hey, I never said I wasn't buying the 3DS
1783000	1784000	No, I know, I know
1784000	1787000	It just makes you mad that they don't reach their full potential
1787000	1788000	Exactly
1788000	1791000	I don't have a problem with Nintendo as far as making hardware and stuff
1791000	1794000	I just have a problem with them not
1794000	1796000	Yeah, like you said, reaching their full potential
1796000	1798000	Remaking games, come on
1798000	1801000	These Nintendo 64 ports to the 3DS
1801000	1803000	That's just some cheap shit right there
1803000	1804000	I'm going into our chatroom
1804000	1806000	At chat.oransonshady.com
1806000	1807000	Darktoygak says
1807000	1809000	Loki is going to make 3D porn on it, no doubt
1809000	1811000	No, I'm not
1811000	1813000	Let's see
1813000	1815000	Yeah, what's the old adage about new hardware coming out?
1815000	1816000	Time to penis?
1816000	1819000	Is the whole like, how long before somebody tries to put their penis on it?
1819000	1821000	BlackWolf in our chatroom says
1821000	1823000	Loki bought Nintendogs, he's part of the problem
1823000	1825000	You are part of the problem
1825000	1826000	I am part of the problem
1826000	1827000	But, okay
1827000	1829000	Here's why I bought Nintendogs, okay
1829000	1833000	And this is a completely weird reasoning for
1833000	1835000	Cats, that's the reason I wanted
1835000	1836000	Well, not the cats too
1836000	1838000	I have a cat that's already annoying
1838000	1841000	No, the reason I bought Nintendogs plus cats
1841000	1843000	Is because I think that shows off the 3D pretty well
1843000	1846000	And this is something I'm really going to be kind of showing to my co-workers
1846000	1848000	To kind of say, hey look, check out the thing
1848000	1850000	Oh, research purposes
1850000	1852000	Yes
1852000	1854000	I mean, I
1854000	1855000	Yeah, whatever
1855000	1856000	Alright, fair enough
1856000	1859000	It was, okay, it was either that or Professor Layton
1859000	1862000	Because I can't read Japanese so that's not going to do me any good
1862000	1864000	Or there's like some
1864000	1866000	Cube puzzle game, no thanks
1866000	1869000	And then the rest of the games are coming out over here anyways
1869000	1871000	Once again, it would have been
1871000	1873000	If they had pilot wings, I would have bought pilot wings
1873000	1875000	I will get pilot wings when it comes out in the US
1875000	1876000	Alright
1876000	1880000	Alright, well we'll be hearing more about the 3DS next week then for sure
1880000	1881000	Yes, absolutely
1881000	1882000	Awesome
1882000	1884000	Alright, well let's get into the news tonight
1884000	1886000	And Loki's going to start us off with some news
1886000	1888000	And like I mentioned a minute ago
1888000	1890000	A lot of stuff going on in the world
1890000	1893000	And some of it reaching into video games for all of us
1893000	1895000	Yeah, of course
1895000	1899000	You may have heard that there were some major earthquakes in Japan
1899000	1901000	And tsunamis and all that fun stuff
1901000	1903000	That caused a lot of damage
1903000	1909000	And because of that, they're having issues with being able to keep the power up
1909000	1914000	And so they're asking companies to conserve power
1914000	1919000	And bring back their services once that power has been restored fully
1919000	1926000	So because of that, Square Enix has decided to shut off the servers for Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XI
1926000	1928000	For at least one week
1928000	1931000	And also other companies affected by this as well
1931000	1937000	Well, Konami, they're shutting off the servers for Metal Gear Online
1937000	1942000	Which, to be honest, until I read that, I forgot that Metal Gear Online even existed
1942000	1946000	So yeah, I'm sure lots of people are playing that
1946000	1952000	So yeah, those are the two companies so far that are included
1952000	1957000	Part of that, who knows what other companies will be having that
1957000	1958000	That's still pretty big though
1958000	1962000	Yeah, because you're talking about two major MMOs, for better or for worse
1962000	1964000	I mean, I know we've given Final Fantasy XIV a hard time on the show
1964000	1967000	One major MMO, one major pile of crap
1967000	1971000	But you and I spent many years on Final Fantasy XI and it still certainly has its fans
1971000	1976000	So that's kind of not something we hear a lot in the gaming world
1976000	1980000	Where it's like an MMO literally gets put on hold because of real life
1980000	1983000	And it's just kind of, there's an old adage, especially in Warcraft
1983000	1989000	And I'm sure the other MMOs have this too, is that RL greater than wow or whatever your game of choice is
1989000	1992000	And I think that especially is kind of what's coming into play this week
1992000	1995000	And I can't see how really anyone can complain about this
1995000	1998000	I'm curious if they're going to shut down for that week if they're going to issue credits to all those customers for that week
1998000	2001000	Because it's on their bad and their decision to shut it down
2001000	2005000	I think they're going to, I think they're going to do a free month or something like that
2005000	2011000	I think they will, and I think I read somewhere it is confirmed they're going to gift them the month of April
2011000	2013000	I think that's awfully generous
2013000	2019000	I honestly, in a situation like this, I really don't think they would necessarily owe them anything
2019000	2022000	I think most people would understand but you would always have that one person
2022000	2025000	And I'm sure all of us have probably seen the pictures and the damage that we have
2025000	2027000	And definitely take a moment to look at that
2027000	2030000	But I don't, my gut tells me the extensive damage they have
2030000	2033000	One week, them shutting down, I think it's going to be the first of many weeks
2033000	2035000	Or rotating weeks off
2035000	2036000	Yeah
2036000	2042000	So just maybe time to take the games offline for a little while
2042000	2046000	Or maybe something else you could consider doing is seeing what you can do to help
2046000	2049000	And that was kind of the other thing I wanted to make sure I mentioned at some point tonight
2049000	2053000	Obviously we've all seen what's been going on in Japan
2053000	2057000	And it's just, there are no words
2057000	2061000	There are no words for what is happening and what we're seeing on the television
2061000	2067000	And I just, I couldn't imagine that scale of what a tsunami can do
2067000	2070000	So I really would challenge you, all our listeners
2070000	2074000	We've been doing this show for nine plus years
2074000	2077000	Never once have we ever asked you for money
2077000	2079000	Tonight I'm going to ask you for money
2079000	2084000	And I'm going to say, you need to buy one less game this month
2084000	2087000	Or one less arcade game, Xbox Live arcade game
2087000	2091000	Or maybe not pay for an MMO for a month
2091000	2095000	Take the money that you're saving on Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XIV
2095000	2100000	And go to redcross.org
2100000	2102000	And please make a donation
2102000	2105000	Everybody should try to do at least ten dollars
2105000	2108000	If all the OLR listeners could donate ten dollars
2108000	2113000	It's still a little bit for what they're really going to need in the big picture
2113000	2114000	But it's a start
2114000	2118000	And just whatever you guys can give would be so appreciated
2118000	2122000	So please consider cutting back on a game this month
2122000	2126000	And giving money to an organization that's going to need it to help a lot of people
2126000	2129000	So redcross.org is where you can go to donate
2129000	2131000	And there's many, you can do texts on your phone
2131000	2135000	I know a lot of people get our show on the iTunes store
2135000	2138000	There's a big little link there in the iTunes store
2138000	2141000	It says donate and you can donate and 100% of the proceeds go directly
2141000	2145000	But you know what, why don't you go look at the horse's mouth redcross.org
2145000	2146000	And see what you can do to help
2146000	2148000	Because even if you're strapped for cash
2148000	2152000	There's probably a lot of other volunteer types of things you could do to help
2152000	2154000	And that would all go a long way as well
2154000	2156000	So I needed to get that out there
2156000	2158000	I know I talked about our show being an escape
2158000	2162000	But there is the reality that there's people that need help
2162000	2164000	So alright
2164000	2168000	Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news
2168000	2171000	And this has to do with the Microsoft Kinect
2171000	2176000	A lot of big news this week about the Kinect and some of the sales figures
2176000	2183000	Some reports coming out there that 10 million Kinect units have been sold
2183000	2189000	That is from Aaron Greenberg who is one of the executives at Xbox
2189000	2191000	Wrote a tweet
2191000	2194000	And apparently this is so fast and so reaching
2194000	2202000	That Guinness World Records actually went out and said that the Kinect is the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time
2202000	2208000	133,000 plus units each day for the first 60 days
2208000	2211000	That's faster than the iPhone or the iPad
2211000	2213000	That's really surprising to me
2213000	2217000	Because I thought with all this iPad-a-balloo last year and everything
2217000	2220000	I would have thought for sure the iPad sold faster
2220000	2221000	But I guess not
2221000	2223000	Congratulations to Microsoft for that
2223000	2229000	But seriously, Guinness, you need to find some different types of records to put in your book
2229000	2234000	Look for some tall people or people that are fat or people that can eat dog food or something like that
2234000	2238000	I don't know, just not consumer electronics
2238000	2242000	Seriously, the gamer edition of the Guinness World Records is just retarded
2242000	2245000	It's just the most popular character
2245000	2247000	It's like ugh
2247000	2255000	Well look, something else to follow that up with is that Microsoft also apparently had the biggest non-holiday month ever
2255000	2259000	February 2011 they sold over half a million Xbox 360s
2259000	2261000	535,000 to be exact
2261000	2263000	The biggest non-holiday month ever
2263000	2266000	27% up over last year
2266000	2269000	That's pretty significant because nothing is really coming out for them
2269000	2271000	And it's all this Kinect momentum
2271000	2274000	Because obviously it's these bundles with the Kinect and Kinect adventures
2274000	2278000	And now that people are starting to play them at friends' houses and see them on shows
2278000	2281000	And hear about it in school and so forth
2281000	2283000	I think the word is really starting to spread about this
2283000	2286000	And I think that's what's kind of keeping it going
2286000	2289000	So, very interesting
2289000	2291000	Not hearing a lot about the move
2291000	2293000	From what I understand though, Sony didn't have a bad month
2293000	2295000	I think Sony sold quite a few units too
2295000	2297000	They're getting closer to Nintendo
2297000	2299000	Nintendo's about to slip into third place
2299000	2301000	Which is really big news
2301000	2304000	Nintendo is not even going to slip into third place
2304000	2306000	They're in first place
2306000	2308000	I believe they sold more 360s than we used last month, didn't they?
2308000	2310000	Yeah, last month
2310000	2312000	But overall, they're in first place
2312000	2317000	They've got a lot of catching up to do before they're in third place
2317000	2321000	Honestly though, I think
2321000	2324000	With the move, it's kind of funny because
2324000	2327000	From a retail standpoint
2327000	2330000	They're treating it like there's still shortages on the move stuff
2330000	2332000	Which makes no sense
2332000	2334000	Because there's no demand for the move stuff
2334000	2336000	At all
2336000	2338000	And yet, the stuff is hard to get
2338000	2340000	For some reason
2340000	2342000	But, yeah
2342000	2344000	They're doing some stuff with the move now
2344000	2346000	That people are actually interested in
2346000	2348000	You'd be surprised, like the SOCOM4
2348000	2350000	And Killzone 3 stuff
2350000	2353000	With their stupid move gun
2353000	2355000	That they have
2355000	2357000	People are actually interested in that
2357000	2359000	And it's just
2359000	2361000	I guess it seems really stupid
2361000	2363000	But the actual peripherals that they've made for it
2363000	2365000	Aren't just like
2365000	2367000	Shells
2367000	2369000	Like the Zapper
2369000	2371000	These are actual things that do have
2371000	2373000	Integrated buttons and triggers and stuff like that
2373000	2375000	That aren't just
2375000	2377000	Ok, I pull this trigger and it
2377000	2379000	Pulls a lever that pushes this button
2379000	2381000	It's not anything like that
2381000	2383000	It's actual
2383000	2385000	Some special stuff that they're adding to these
2385000	2387000	So it's a little bit better
2387000	2389000	I think to play a first person shooter that way
2389000	2391000	But people are interested
2391000	2393000	So that may help
2393000	2395000	I am so curious about
2395000	2397000	This year's E3 and where the Kinect goes
2397000	2399000	So, props to Sony though
2399000	2401000	For at least allowing
2401000	2403000	The move to be supported by
2403000	2405000	Their big tent pole
2405000	2407000	Titles that they're putting out
2407000	2409000	Because the Kinect, not really having that
2409000	2411000	You have the Kinect games and that's it
2411000	2413000	You're not going to see Kinect support for Gears of War
2413000	2415000	At least not Gears of War 3
2415000	2417000	Maybe some spinoff or something like that
2417000	2419000	And Halo
2419000	2421000	I'm sure there's going to be some sort of spinoff Halo game
2421000	2423000	But not real
2423000	2425000	We didn't see any Kinect
2425000	2427000	Kinect support for
2427000	2429000	I don't even know what the next Microsoft title is
2429000	2431000	Because they haven't really announced anything
2433000	2435000	Actually, that's funny
2435000	2437000	Yeah, there are no first priority
2437000	2439000	Microsoft titles right now for a while
2439000	2441000	Probably the fourth quarter
2441000	2443000	We're not seeing anything like
2443000	2445000	The question of the Fable or something like that
2445000	2447000	There's no Kinect support for that stuff
2447000	2449000	So, they haven't really
2449000	2451000	Embraced it yet, I guess
2451000	2453000	I mean, they have their first party Kinect games
2453000	2455000	That they made, but there's no
2455000	2457000	Core games that are a part of that
2457000	2459000	Again, E3 I think is going to
2459000	2461000	Really be telling as to what their
2461000	2463000	Strategic direction is for
2463000	2465000	Phase 2 of the software
2465000	2467000	And possibly integrating that into their core lineup
2467000	2469000	Especially, didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago
2469000	2471000	About the whole Halo remake happening
2471000	2473000	That now the rumor is it could be Kinect
2473000	2475000	Halo Kinect or whatever
2475000	2477000	Well, I don't think, once again
2477000	2479000	I mean, they should have it be optional
2479000	2481000	Obviously, and then the other thing
2481000	2483000	Is I think they should have a couple different levels
2483000	2485000	That you go with it where
2485000	2487000	Not necessarily everything is motion controlled
2487000	2489000	But maybe head tracking, once again
2489000	2491000	I think head tracking added to a
2491000	2493000	First person shooter is just no brainer
2493000	2495000	You should be doing this anyways
2495000	2497000	For having that
2497000	2499000	Part Kinect enabled, you don't need to be running around
2499000	2501000	With Kinect for everything, just do that
2501000	2503000	It shouldn't be mass arm flailing
2503000	2505000	All over the place, that's what I fear
2505000	2507000	But it might be kind of cool, you have the controller
2507000	2509000	Or whatever, and maybe to lob a bomb
2509000	2511000	Or something, you would throw your hand up
2511000	2513000	Or something, like lob a bomb
2513000	2515000	Something very subtle
2515000	2517000	Where you're not breaking out of that
2517000	2519000	Controller thing, but I don't know
2519000	2521000	I just would not want mass arm flail
2521000	2523000	Like some Wii games are
2523000	2525000	I can see someone lobbing their controller by accident
2525000	2527000	Like a real grenade, hitting their flat screen TV
2527000	2529000	I don't design the games
2529000	2531000	I'm just trying to come up with ideas
2531000	2533000	Once again though, head tracking would be
2533000	2535000	Head tracking is pretty cool
2535000	2537000	You can implement that pretty easily
2537000	2539000	And once again
2539000	2541000	It doesn't interfere with playing a game
2541000	2543000	If you don't want to move your head around
2543000	2545000	Fine, then don't
2545000	2547000	Or you can just turn that off
2547000	2549000	That kind of support would be awesome
2549000	2551000	There's a ton of first person shooters coming out
2551000	2553000	I mean, come on
2553000	2555000	Seriously, you should be able to do that
2555000	2557000	They've got to find a way to keep reinventing
2557000	2559000	Or adding to FPS
2559000	2561000	At least for me, the allure
2561000	2563000	Has kind of died away, like I mentioned earlier with Halo
2563000	2565000	Even Medal of Honor
2565000	2567000	And stuff like that
2567000	2569000	It died for me after Quake 2
2569000	2571000	I'm like, they just don't make them
2571000	2573000	Actually, I take that back, because Quake 3 I love
2573000	2575000	They don't make them like they used to
2575000	2577000	True, the last PC first person shooter
2577000	2579000	I played was actually Jedi Knight 2
2579000	2581000	From what?
2581000	2583000	The mid 90s?
2583000	2585000	I play lightsaber, that was awesome
2585000	2587000	I only play a lot of first person shooters on
2587000	2589000	Console or PC
2589000	2591000	Especially not PC, because I cannot stand keyboard, mouse
2591000	2593000	No, no thanks
2593000	2595000	I will take an Xbox 360 controller any day
2595000	2597000	And yeah, I know
2597000	2599000	That's not really good when it comes to
2599000	2601000	Playing multiplayer online
2601000	2603000	But I don't play multiplayer online, so it doesn't matter
2603000	2605000	But yeah, the last game I played was
2605000	2607000	Crysis
2607000	2609000	With the Xbox 360 controller, it was awesome
2609000	2611000	So I do plan on picking up Crysis 2 when it comes out on consoles
2611000	2613000	Screw the PC, I don't want to upgrade my PC again
2613000	2615000	To play fucking Crysis, I already built
2615000	2617000	The PC for that, that's enough
2617000	2619000	I do need to upgrade my graphics card
2619000	2621000	So they're old
2621000	2623000	We'll be good thinking about it
2623000	2625000	Thinking forward with Kinect
2625000	2627000	It's an unknown game that maybe people don't remember
2627000	2629000	PsyOps came out for Xbox while back
2629000	2631000	You gain telekinesis power
2631000	2633000	It can move things with your mind
2633000	2635000	It was a puzzle, first person shooter
2635000	2637000	Third person, if you readjust the bit of things
2637000	2639000	I can see that having a lot of fun with Kinect
2639000	2641000	You move your arm to move a box out of the way
2641000	2643000	Then you go back to your controller and shoot things
2643000	2645000	You could throw a box at enemies
2645000	2647000	And knock them around
2647000	2649000	That'd be pretty freaking amazing
2649000	2651000	How about an Xbox Live Arcade game that's
2651000	2653000	Kinect enabled called Slap-a-Bitch
2653000	2655000	And what you would do is
2655000	2657000	You walk around with the controller or whatever
2657000	2659000	And then you can just reach out and slap a bitch
2659000	2661000	It's other people that are on
2661000	2663000	The Kinect
2663000	2665000	It's like Halo, but it's slapping
2665000	2667000	Well they have a game like that for the Android
2667000	2669000	I believe, OS
2669000	2671000	You could just sneak up behind somebody
2671000	2673000	Well they have something like that for the Android OS
2673000	2675000	And it's not as content controlled as
2675000	2677000	The app store for iPhone and Apple
2677000	2679000	It's simpler
2679000	2681000	It's booty smack or booty slap
2681000	2683000	And you actually tap the phone or you slide your finger across
2683000	2685000	Your Android device and you
2685000	2687000	And you slap a bitch on her ass
2687000	2689000	So we're getting there
2689000	2691000	We're getting there, but we're not there yet for the Kinect
2691000	2693000	Once they released that development kit
2693000	2695000	I should say
2695000	2697000	Once they released that development kit for the indie marketplace
2697000	2699000	There will be a slap a bitch
2699000	2701000	I guarantee it
2701000	2703000	Slap a ho, slap a bitch, slap a baby, it'll be all good
2703000	2705000	Slap that ass
2705000	2707000	We're so bad
2707000	2709000	Alright moving on, how about some more gaming news
2709000	2711000	I'm going over to Matt too tonight
2711000	2713000	Sure, so keeping with the whole Microsoft
2713000	2715000	Company discussion
2715000	2717000	Turns out those codes
2717000	2719000	On the back of your Microsoft Live cards
2719000	2721000	Actually have a pattern to them
2721000	2723000	So a group of smart hackers
2723000	2725000	Decided to look at those codes
2725000	2727000	Take some old Xbox Live points cards
2727000	2729000	And Xbox Gold trial codes
2729000	2731000	And they figured out an algorithm
2731000	2733000	That actually allows them to
2733000	2735000	Anticipate the rest of the strings
2735000	2737000	By doing so they started to exploit
2737000	2739000	Microsoft for Microsoft points
2739000	2741000	And in doing so, and of course you post
2741000	2743000	These things on forums so everyone can do it
2743000	2745000	They bled Microsoft
2745000	2747000	For an estimated one million dollars worth of points
2747000	2749000	Space bucks
2749000	2751000	One million space bucks
2751000	2753000	So of course Microsoft
2753000	2755000	Caught on to this and pulled the codes online
2755000	2757000	But as I was reviewing
2757000	2759000	Some of the news
2759000	2761000	Tossed a question to me, the algorithm
2761000	2763000	Is still enforced to the cards on
2763000	2765000	Walmart and Target walls
2765000	2767000	I'm not understanding
2767000	2769000	Because they pull these codes that were posted online
2769000	2771000	But aren't they still sitting on shelves?
2771000	2773000	Correct, so my thinking
2773000	2775000	My thoughts were when I was reading this
2775000	2777000	That's great you pulled the codes
2777000	2779000	But the existing codes on store shelves are still
2779000	2781000	The same algorithm or maybe a set of algorithms
2781000	2783000	Yeah there might be several algorithms
2783000	2785000	And so they must be in their
2785000	2787000	New batch of product for that
2787000	2789000	They've got to be redoing the algorithm
2789000	2791000	I wonder if there will be a recall
2791000	2793000	Maybe the algorithm, because I'm sure
2793000	2795000	These codes
2795000	2797000	Probably not just tell
2797000	2799000	That it's a Microsoft code, but it probably
2799000	2801000	Actually tells Microsoft where the card was bought
2801000	2803000	I would imagine the GameStop chain
2803000	2805000	Probably all has similar digits
2805000	2807000	In the beginning or something like that
2807000	2809000	But whatever algorithm was cracked
2809000	2811000	Is probably tied to one particular retail chain
2811000	2813000	And beyond points
2813000	2815000	I might sound like an idiot to the folks that did this
2815000	2817000	Because I don't profess to know how you crack an algorithm
2817000	2819000	These aren't necessarily the 1600 point cards
2819000	2821000	These are the 160 Microsoft point cards
2821000	2823000	That you get with some games
2823000	2825000	Right, the actual point value is 160
2825000	2827000	So we're not talking a lot
2827000	2829000	But they're able to refresh and then
2829000	2831000	Regenerate the algorithm and keep going
2831000	2833000	And even they were able to find the code
2833000	2835000	For bringing in props to Halo Reach and things like that
2835000	2837000	So instead of digital tchotchkes and SpaceBucks
2837000	2839000	They were able to figure out the codes
2839000	2841000	Darktoygak has a really good question
2841000	2843000	Don't these things have to be activated?
2843000	2845000	Like when you buy the cards at the store
2845000	2847000	I always thought once they scan on the barcode
2847000	2849000	Then they're active or whatever
2849000	2851000	It's just a piece of cardboard
2851000	2853000	That has a code underneath it
2853000	2855000	That's what makes me wonder
2855000	2857000	I can understand
2857000	2859000	They did these 160 point cards
2859000	2861000	Those things
2861000	2863000	But if they started doing 1600 point cards
2863000	2865000	There'd be no way for them to track that
2865000	2867000	How would they even be able to figure out
2867000	2869000	Which ones are sold and stuff
2869000	2871000	I'm sure those codes link to some type of serial number
2871000	2873000	Some type of, not product key
2873000	2875000	Some type of way to
2875000	2877000	If Microsoft is smart
2877000	2879000	And we hope that they are
2879000	2881000	They've got to have some type of inventory tracking methodology
2881000	2883000	They generate so many codes
2883000	2885000	To so many locations
2885000	2887000	I could swear that you have to activate them at the register
2887000	2889000	Before they run
2889000	2891000	Because otherwise how easy is it to steal those cards?
2891000	2893000	Okay, well actually it wasn't from cards
2893000	2895000	From what I'm looking up here real quick
2895000	2897000	It's actually from a website that was
2897000	2899000	Generating these codes
2899000	2901000	Kind of like a promotion thing
2901000	2903000	So they figured out that you can go to this website
2903000	2905000	Because really you're only supposed to be able to go there once
2905000	2907000	You can go to this website, change part of this URL
2907000	2909000	That's in there
2909000	2911000	And you can see if
2911000	2913000	The code's working or not
2913000	2915000	And then
2915000	2917000	Basically
2917000	2919000	You keep
2919000	2921000	The code is located
2921000	2923000	But again the algorithm stays
2923000	2925000	And if there are existing cards
2925000	2927000	I don't know
2927000	2929000	I always figure there's a pattern to it
2929000	2931000	But someone found the exploit and they shared it with the community
2931000	2933000	And let them for about a million bucks
2933000	2935000	I gotta be honest
2935000	2937000	This news kind of sucks for Microsoft
2937000	2939000	But I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen sooner
2939000	2941000	That's true
2941000	2943000	Considering how long those types of cards have been around
2943000	2945000	I'm surprised
2945000	2947000	I guess it wasn't the cards
2947000	2949000	To really rip the hole open
2949000	2951000	To get these points
2951000	2953000	But I'm really surprised it didn't happen sooner
2953000	2955000	And I wonder if other gaming companies
2955000	2957000	Or consoles like this
2957000	2959000	I wonder if they are taking stock
2959000	2961000	In this
2961000	2963000	And how they procure their point cards and stuff
2963000	2965000	I'm really wondering what effect this might have
2965000	2967000	On digital distribution down the line
2967000	2969000	I mean granted this is just one little
2969000	2971000	Well it's not really little
2971000	2973000	But it's one thing that happened
2973000	2975000	And maybe it wasn't the cards after all
2975000	2977000	But you have to think about
2977000	2979000	What does digital distribution mean to our company
2979000	2981000	And you've seen the expansion happening
2981000	2983000	Kind of a GameStop where now
2983000	2985000	One of their walls is no longer game
2985000	2987000	Boxes but it's those plastic cards
2987000	2989000	For Playstation Network and so forth
2989000	2991000	So you gotta kind of be wondering
2991000	2993000	If people are able to exploit that system
2993000	2995000	Is digital download
2995000	2997000	As smart of an idea as we all thought?
2997000	2999000	Or does it need some time to get more secure?
2999000	3001000	Out of a little harder if they were exploiting
3001000	3003000	Those Facebook gift cards you can buy in the store
3003000	3005000	For your true SpaceX
3005000	3007000	There's no value in that
3007000	3009000	I'm curious if even one of those is sold yet
3009000	3011000	So that's been reported that Microsoft
3011000	3013000	This week they started renting movies on Facebook
3013000	3015000	Oh lord
3015000	3017000	Yeah that's true
3017000	3019000	That's something else for people to spend their SpaceX on
3019000	3021000	Give credit cards over to
3021000	3023000	Ironically enough the first movie that they started renting
3023000	3025000	Was The Dark Knight right?
3025000	3027000	The Batman movie with Heath Ledger
3027000	3029000	And all I could think of in my mind was
3029000	3031000	And here we go
3031000	3033000	Maybe that was the joke
3033000	3035000	I don't know
3035000	3037000	So I will be avoiding that part of Facebook
3037000	3039000	I don't want them to have my credit card information
3039000	3041000	That's for damn sure
3041000	3043000	So yeah a million bucks has been bled dry
3043000	3045000	From the coffers of Microsoft
3045000	3047000	Quickly in their lesson and have to start changing
3047000	3049000	Their strategy on how to
3049000	3051000	Deal with codes perhaps
3051000	3053000	Be interesting to see the ramifications
3053000	3055000	Of this six months from now
3055000	3057000	Well they can figure out who uses those codes
3057000	3059000	So they're gonna punish them
3059000	3061000	They'll be taken out back and flogged
3061000	3063000	Publicly
3063000	3065000	Drop the hammer or cut the rope
3065000	3067000	Yes they'll be
3067000	3069000	Cutting the rope
3069000	3071000	Let's move on
3071000	3073000	Well as rumored the new firmware for the
3073000	3075000	PlayStation 3 has come out
3075000	3077000	With cloud saves
3077000	3079000	So yes now you can actually
3079000	3081000	Save your games
3081000	3083000	If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber
3083000	3085000	I was just about to ask, I'm like nah you have to be
3085000	3087000	PlayStation Plus for that right?
3087000	3089000	So you can
3089000	3091000	Save some games
3091000	3093000	Or your game saves online
3093000	3095000	And also apparently
3095000	3097000	According to one of the PlayStation 3 hackers
3097000	3099000	It has
3099000	3101000	Resecured the PlayStation 3
3101000	3103000	For now
3103000	3105000	Cause obviously the
3105000	3107000	Keys are still in there but they've just
3107000	3109000	Moved them to someplace else
3109000	3111000	And they have another key in place
3111000	3113000	So for now
3113000	3115000	It's been secured but
3115000	3117000	It's just a matter of time
3117000	3119000	Really you can't
3119000	3121000	Even calling it re-secured
3121000	3123000	That just doomed it for failure
3123000	3125000	Right there
3125000	3127000	Just say nope still broken
3127000	3129000	Nothing to see here
3129000	3131000	Keep on moving
3131000	3133000	But it's hack proof Loki
3133000	3135000	This new firmware is hacker proof
3135000	3137000	Nobody will hack it
3137000	3139000	Nothing is hacker proof
3139000	3141000	And no one's bothering to even
3141000	3143000	Well here's the thing though
3143000	3145000	The firmware right now because you can
3145000	3147000	Spoof it anyway so you can still
3147000	3149000	Connect to the PlayStation Network if you really want to
3149000	3151000	But
3151000	3153000	Whatever
3153000	3155000	Is cloud saving something that interests anyone in this room?
3155000	3157000	I do think it's kind of neat
3157000	3159000	Because you know like
3159000	3161000	If I go to visit friends like in the bay area
3161000	3163000	You know or something I could
3163000	3165000	Connect to the cloud I guess and get my game saves
3165000	3167000	Especially for things like
3167000	3169000	I own this on the 360
3169000	3171000	So maybe it's a moot point but you don't know Jack
3171000	3173000	Like you remember when I was reviewing the game
3173000	3175000	I talked about you really want to make sure that save file
3175000	3177000	Goes with you otherwise you're going to be recycling games
3177000	3179000	Because of the dumb way
3179000	3181000	You have only five episodes at a time
3181000	3183000	Able to lock or whatever
3183000	3185000	If you don't take that game save with you you're going to end up
3185000	3187000	Recycling games very quickly and that
3187000	3189000	So the cloud save would be very useful for that
3189000	3191000	Because I don't always think to copy my save file to a card
3191000	3193000	And so on
3193000	3195000	I was going to say thumb drives are fucking cheap
3195000	3197000	I mean why would I spend money
3197000	3199000	On PlayStation Plus
3199000	3201000	I have two jump drives right here
3201000	3203000	Both of these cost me less than ten dollars
3203000	3205000	I mean why would I
3205000	3207000	And those are eight gigs
3207000	3209000	Why would I even waste my time
3209000	3211000	I think the cap was 150
3211000	3213000	I don't know if it's 150 saves
3213000	3215000	Or if it's 150 megabytes
3215000	3217000	I can't remember what it was
3217000	3219000	The honest thing I can say is that sometimes you just don't know
3219000	3221000	When you're going to need a game save file
3221000	3223000	I have never ever
3223000	3225000	Gone to a person's house and go damn
3225000	3227000	I really wish I had my game save with me
3227000	3229000	Especially not for the PS3
3229000	3231000	Because people that now have a PS3
3231000	3233000	That I go to their houses
3233000	3235000	Regularly
3235000	3237000	I know one person
3237000	3239000	Alright
3239000	3241000	Well I feel the same way about cloud saving with
3241000	3243000	The whole rock band guitar hero things
3243000	3245000	Because I go to one of my buddy's houses
3245000	3247000	Who has played rock band extensively
3247000	3249000	And unlocked a lot of the games
3249000	3251000	I come back to my house and I haven't
3251000	3253000	Finished those parts of the tour to unlock the songs to play
3253000	3255000	So cloud saving would make a lot of sense
3255000	3257000	When you do the all unlock
3257000	3259000	That would be cheating Rob
3259000	3261000	Here's the other problem too with the cloud saving thing
3261000	3263000	Don't you have to put your profile on their system anyways?
3265000	3267000	I mean you can't just dump the save off the internet
3267000	3269000	Well with Xbox
3269000	3271000	Yeah it is profile centric
3271000	3273000	That's true
3273000	3275000	Here's a better idea
3275000	3277000	This is great and this will cost you
3277000	3279000	No money so fuck Playstation Plus
3279000	3281000	You take that game save
3281000	3283000	It's not very big
3283000	3285000	Email it to yourself
3285000	3287000	Boom it's on the cloud
3287000	3289000	Don't need to fucking pay them for shit
3289000	3291000	You want that download that save anywhere
3291000	3293000	Download the save just go to a PC
3293000	3295000	Download it
3295000	3297000	But your friends don't have a PC I don't believe you
3297000	3299000	Because everybody has a PC nowadays
3299000	3301000	Seriously
3301000	3303000	Why am I going to pay
3303000	3305000	Boom it's on the cloud
3305000	3307000	And he pointed up
3307000	3309000	In the studio he pointed up towards the cloud
3309000	3311000	Just in case we didn't know
3311000	3313000	Boom headshot on the cloud
3313000	3315000	Alright
3315000	3317000	Gameguru in our chat
3317000	3319000	Says my USB drive is bigger than the cloud
3319000	3321000	Hot
3321000	3323000	Google mail
3323000	3325000	Gmail bigger than the cloud
3325000	3327000	7.8 gigs right
3327000	3329000	And you know
3329000	3331000	If I remember correctly
3331000	3333000	I believe you can download stuff
3333000	3335000	Through the web browser on
3335000	3337000	The
3337000	3339000	Playstation 3 I think
3339000	3341000	I'm not sure what you can download if it's just
3341000	3343000	Images and stuff like that to save to your system
3343000	3345000	But you may very well be able to download game
3345000	3347000	Saves
3347000	3349000	Now here's a point from Spaznator PC
3349000	3351000	Can't wait to hear your response to this in our chat room
3351000	3353000	Low key most saves can be copied
3353000	3355000	To jump drives external hard drives
3355000	3357000	But some are copy locked
3357000	3359000	In those occasions cloud saving comes in handy
3359000	3361000	And then the only person
3361000	3363000	Or the only people you can blame
3363000	3365000	For that would be Sony for being dicks
3365000	3367000	But maybe
3367000	3369000	For a Playstation Plus member they'll give you the keys
3369000	3371000	To unlock that save
3371000	3373000	Oh yeah how generous of them
3373000	3375000	I can have access to my saves
3375000	3377000	Oh thank you great master
3377000	3379000	I mean it's like
3379000	3381000	What the hell
3381000	3383000	Sorry no you can't have your saved data
3383000	3385000	But you can pay for the privilege
3385000	3387000	To access that data
3387000	3389000	Last week was Nintendo this week is Sony
3389000	3391000	I know you gotta love Loki
3391000	3393000	One week it'll be Apple then it's Nintendo
3393000	3395000	Now this week it's Sony
3395000	3397000	Angry angsty
3397000	3399000	Man against iOS and iPad
3399000	3401000	And iPhone stuff
3401000	3403000	But he still is in many ways
3403000	3405000	No I hate Apple
3405000	3407000	The only reason he has that is he got it for free through a work
3407000	3409000	No you have to understand I hate Apple
3409000	3411000	Because their computers are shit
3411000	3413000	They're overpriced shit
3413000	3415000	And that's all it is
3415000	3417000	Who thought it was a fucking genius idea to have
3417000	3419000	No ports whatsoever other than
3419000	3421000	One USB slot that's awesome
3421000	3423000	That's awesomely stupid
3423000	3425000	I mean
3425000	3427000	But people buy that for like two grand
3427000	3429000	When you can spend two grand on laptops
3429000	3431000	I can get two fucking nice laptops
3431000	3433000	For that same kind of price
3433000	3435000	But people go oh my god new Apple product
3435000	3437000	I gotta go buy it
3437000	3439000	That's where I have my problems
3439000	3441000	I'm still giving props for the
3441000	3443000	The iPhone because it probably is the best
3443000	3445000	Smartphone out there right now
3445000	3447000	And even like the iPod touch
3447000	3449000	Because it's probably the best
3449000	3451000	MP3 player out there
3451000	3453000	It's not my really MP3 player
3453000	3455000	It's an iPhone without the phone
3455000	3457000	But
3457000	3459000	I'll be damned if I buy a fucking
3459000	3461000	Apple computer
3461000	3463000	Fuck that
3463000	3465000	Seriously that is a waste
3465000	3467000	You might as well just set fire to your money
3467000	3469000	Because you'd be doing yourself
3469000	3471000	A great injustice to buy
3471000	3473000	An Apple computer
3473000	3475000	Oh Loki
3475000	3477000	I think in a new segment Loki's angst
3477000	3479000	That's the show
3479000	3481000	But that's not a segment
3481000	3483000	That's the show
3483000	3485000	And I still don't get the iPad
3485000	3487000	I don't get it
3487000	3489000	I guess it's better than having a
3489000	3491000	Netbook maybe
3491000	3493000	But
3493000	3495000	I can't put it in my pocket what good is that for me
3495000	3497000	I'm using mine, I'm planning a career in real estate
3497000	3499000	I'm using it to take pictures of listings and homes
3499000	3501000	And video so I'm putting it to a business use
3501000	3503000	Ok so yeah that's fine
3503000	3505000	And I'll be able to watch porn on it
3505000	3507000	Hey that's a frame device that has a screen
3507000	3509000	I don't play the slideshow of porn
3509000	3511000	Versus the slideshow of listings
3511000	3513000	You better have a big thing of Windex to clean that iPad with
3513000	3515000	But um
3515000	3517000	Anyway so
3517000	3519000	No no I just
3519000	3521000	Of course everybody's now putting out tablet
3521000	3523000	Right
3523000	3525000	That worked really well back in the 90's
3525000	3527000	Because everybody wants to touch something
3527000	3529000	I remember when tablet PC
3529000	3531000	Fuck I remember when my uncle worked for like
3531000	3533000	Wacom and they were making tablet PC's
3533000	3535000	Yeah that's old school shit
3535000	3537000	Oh my god you have to use a stylus
3537000	3539000	On this
3539000	3541000	Alright anyway let's move on
3541000	3543000	To some other stories going on here
3543000	3545000	And this is a follow up to something we were talking about
3545000	3547000	Last week remember that scandalous game
3547000	3549000	We Dare
3549000	3551000	Yes that was the one that's kind of like Truth or Dare
3551000	3553000	I guess but it was going to be a video game on the Wii
3553000	3555000	And the trailer video featured spanking
3555000	3557000	Which I guess was one of the mini games
3557000	3559000	Well guess what happened
3559000	3561000	Thanks to the magic of the internet I guess somebody
3561000	3563000	Realized maybe um
3563000	3565000	This game isn't really suitable for the
3565000	3567000	12 plus rating that it originally got
3567000	3569000	And yes Ubisoft
3569000	3571000	Just spoke to the Daily Telegraph
3571000	3573000	This week saying following the public
3573000	3575000	Reaction to the 12 plus rating of
3575000	3577000	We Dare Ubisoft has made the decision
3577000	3579000	Not to sell the game in the United
3579000	3581000	Kingdom so uh
3581000	3583000	This means that the game will not be sold anymore
3583000	3585000	In the UK they will have to import it
3585000	3587000	From some place where this game will be
3587000	3589000	Sold um
3589000	3591000	I don't know where that's going to end up being
3591000	3593000	Canada or Australia
3593000	3595000	Or what?
3595000	3597000	It's stupid that they're even doing that
3597000	3599000	How about download it on the internet because that's probably going to be the easiest place to get it sadly
3599000	3601000	I don't usually advocate piracy but
3601000	3603000	It's just a
3603000	3605000	Fucking game I mean seriously
3605000	3607000	First off the situation that
3607000	3609000	They posed in the stupid trailer made
3609000	3611000	No sense anyways there's first off never
3611000	3613000	Going to be two hot girls playing a game with you
3613000	3615000	And they're not going to go make out because they
3615000	3617000	Started playing you know a fucking
3617000	3619000	Wii game you know what's going to do that
3619000	3621000	Lots of alcohol
3621000	3623000	Lots of yeah that's really all you need
3623000	3625000	Lots of alcohol you know and
3625000	3627000	And uh slutty chicks
3627000	3629000	And then they'll go and make out and stuff
3629000	3631000	A Wii game is not going to get them to do that
3631000	3633000	It will not get you you know laid
3633000	3635000	Um
3635000	3637000	And I trust you if you bought this game
3637000	3639000	You'd be very bored because who the hell
3639000	3641000	Are you going to play this with?
3641000	3643000	I mean seriously you're going to invite your friends over and play this
3643000	3645000	Play against the computer?
3645000	3647000	Play against the computer I mean
3647000	3649000	You want to fucking you know
3649000	3651000	I'm sorry Dave I cannot let you spank me
3651000	3653000	So they're not they're not selling it in the UK
3653000	3655000	Were they not selling Twister in the UK?
3655000	3657000	They're not selling bottles in the UK because I mean
3657000	3659000	That's all you need too for like fucking you know
3659000	3661000	Uh
3661000	3663000	Was it an erotic night with your friends or something
3663000	3665000	Like that I mean I just don't under
3665000	3667000	This just proves that the UK
3667000	3669000	Is possibly more prudish than the Americans
3669000	3671000	No they're just as prudish because we're not selling it over here either so
3671000	3673000	By the way
3673000	3675000	Just real quick uh also
3675000	3677000	Ubisoft got a stern warning
3677000	3679000	From the Europeans rating board
3679000	3681000	Peggy um not Bundy
3681000	3683000	But P-E-G-I Peggy
3683000	3685000	Uh asking Ubisoft to basically
3685000	3687000	Remove the We Dare ads from the internet
3687000	3689000	Oh yeah because once something hits the internet
3689000	3691000	It can totally be erased you guys
3691000	3693000	Whatever you know what I think it can
3693000	3695000	Try to find anything
3695000	3697000	From uh being Bobby Brown on the internet
3697000	3699000	You can't
3699000	3701000	It just doesn't exist I have an icon of Whitney Houston
3701000	3703000	Saying kiss my ass
3703000	3705000	No you do I have looked
3705000	3707000	I have scoured the internet trying to find those episodes
3707000	3709000	For my wife because that would be like
3709000	3711000	They never released it on DVD?
3711000	3713000	No she filed lawsuits to block that
3713000	3715000	It never came out on DVD
3715000	3717000	Really? Yes oh man
3717000	3719000	That would be worth a lot if anyone's got that on VHS
3719000	3721000	That was an amazing fucking show
3721000	3723000	We need to send Sam Flynn to break into the headquarters
3723000	3725000	Of Bravo or whatever fucking network or air that show
3725000	3727000	And steal the master tapes because seriously
3727000	3729000	That was an amazing piece of television
3729000	3731000	It was awesome
3731000	3733000	Anyhow speaking of Bobby
3733000	3735000	Uh Black Wolf is in the chat room
3735000	3737000	Saying please tell me you have in your show
3737000	3739000	Role the guy who actually recorded himself
3739000	3741000	Playing the game showing how tame it really is
3741000	3743000	Of course I don't
3743000	3745000	But I believe it
3745000	3747000	I believe it's not as bad as that commercial makes it look
3747000	3749000	We saw you know the actual gameplay
3749000	3751000	I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere
3751000	3753000	It's just
3753000	3755000	It's just a ploy to get people
3755000	3757000	To buy that game because they're like oh it's so dirty
3757000	3759000	No it's crap
3759000	3761000	Okay it's Ubisoft
3761000	3763000	This is the same company that puts out you know
3763000	3765000	Uh the pets games
3765000	3767000	Or the imagine games
3767000	3769000	You know or you know all that stuff
3769000	3771000	Imagine sex party
3771000	3773000	I mean that's basically what this is
3773000	3775000	Well unfortunately I couldn't find
3775000	3777000	The We Dare gameplay but I did find
3777000	3779000	A trailer for We Dare Island
3781000	3783000	Oh he's cute
3783000	3785000	Oh she's spinning a tie
3785000	3789000	In slow motion
3789000	3791000	Or is that a bra? I can't tell from back here
3791000	3793000	Ah yes
3793000	3795000	So the ladies are on the couch
3795000	3797000	Giggling at the boys and they're one pseudo stripping
3797000	3799000	And they're dancing and they're having a gay old time
3799000	3801000	The question is though
3801000	3803000	Is it going in reverse?
3803000	3805000	Oh oh now the girls spanking
3805000	3807000	The girls are laughing I think it is going in reverse
3811000	3813000	God I love YouTube
3813000	3815000	I'm gonna link that in the chat
3815000	3817000	That's more like XTube going on right there
3817000	3819000	Alright
3819000	3821000	MrBlackWolf is giving me the appropriate link
3821000	3823000	That we should be looking at here
3823000	3825000	If the game doesn't have full frontal it's not We Dare
3825000	3827000	I mean seriously
3829000	3831000	We can check it out
3831000	3833000	There's us being all adventurous
3833000	3835000	Ooh I want that dress
3835000	3837000	You do huh? Yes
3837000	3839000	Okay
3839000	3841000	Oh these guys are sassy
3841000	3843000	You really like this song?
3843000	3845000	Yes
3845000	3847000	How can you not like this song?
3847000	3849000	I guess it's okay but I'm just sick of hearing it
3849000	3851000	I'm sick of hearing you
3851000	3853000	Not to mention it's a cover
3853000	3855000	I guess they're just dancing it's kind of like Just Dance
3855000	3857000	Is that it?
3857000	3859000	Alright I'm bored of that video already
3859000	3861000	What is that on Farmhouse media 3000
3861000	3863000	It has that little YouTube clip we were just playing
3867000	3869000	Anyhow
3869000	3871000	Let's move on
3871000	3873000	Matt2 what do you have for us?
3873000	3875000	Some more news so looks like that
3875000	3877000	If you play Dragon Age 2 and you
3877000	3879000	Have some angst and you want to get unleashed
3879000	3881000	In the forums watch what you say because
3881000	3883000	If you call EA the devil
3883000	3885000	You might actually get shut off
3885000	3887000	So a player actually posted online
3887000	3889000	On their forums and
3889000	3891000	For whatever reason reference
3891000	3893000	EA called them the devil you can have your opinion
3893000	3895000	About that and
3895000	3897000	EA not liking this bad PR
3897000	3899000	Decided to temporarily
3899000	3901000	Suspend the player's account on the
3901000	3903000	Forums because that's not
3903000	3905000	Unusual when you play WoW or other online
3905000	3907000	If you go off and say some naughty things
3907000	3909000	They'll do that but someone flipped the other master
3909000	3911000	Switch and temporarily
3911000	3913000	Suspended this guy's account for three days
3913000	3915000	So when he loaded the game and
3915000	3917000	Played the game could not
3917000	3919000	Actually play it all because he called
3919000	3921000	The exact quote from
3921000	3923000	The forums was
3923000	3925000	Quote have you sold your souls to
3925000	3927000	The EA devil?
3927000	3929000	Really?
3929000	3931000	At Banfurth
3931000	3933000	It's the Activision devil by the way
3933000	3935000	Exactly
3935000	3937000	But the other part of it too
3937000	3939000	That's not so bad
3939000	3941000	If you've seen and read other forums
3941000	3943000	It's like don't come into my house and then call me
3943000	3945000	The devil
3945000	3947000	So here's the thing
3947000	3949000	We strictly enforce the community against profanity
3949000	3951000	There's no profane
3951000	3953000	El Diablo here
3953000	3955000	It's a bad term
3955000	3957000	But there really isn't anything profane about it
3957000	3959000	It's just really kind of a nasty, spun comment
3959000	3961000	So of course
3961000	3963000	EA was like oh our bad, sorry about that
3963000	3965000	And they apologized as a glitch between
3965000	3967000	Suspending the user account for
3967000	3969000	Forums versus suspending the full blown
3969000	3971000	Account for the game
3971000	3973000	They have since apologized to the player
3973000	3975000	And moved on after some gamer backlash
3975000	3977000	Isn't that ironic?
3977000	3979000	They had to come back and apologize, sorry
3979000	3981000	We're the devil and Banjuu
3981000	3983000	And Rob and I have posted and read
3983000	3985000	Some of the WoW forms and things like that
3985000	3987000	And there's some pretty angsty 12 year olds on there
3987000	3989000	But this is pretty bad
3989000	3991000	I kind of wish Blizzard did this
3991000	3993000	Like read the forum posts and was like
3993000	3995000	Oops, sorry we banned you
3995000	3997000	My bad
3997000	3999000	Be careful what you say on the...
3999000	4001000	We need to take that Ragnarok Online approach
4001000	4003000	You want to talk bad about our game? We ban you
4003000	4005000	You can't play the game anymore
4005000	4007000	How do you like that?
4007000	4009000	It just proves that you better watch or see on the internet
4009000	4011000	And this is obviously a mistake
4011000	4013000	This is not what happens if you were to
4013000	4015000	Call EA the devil or go off with profane language on their website
4015000	4017000	So
4017000	4019000	Just something kind of funny
4019000	4021000	But it just shows how much control
4021000	4023000	Video game distributors do have
4023000	4025000	They can flip a switch and you're gone
4025000	4027000	Or you're banned or you're suspended
4027000	4029000	That's right, so you guys think twice next time
4029000	4031000	About calling EA the devil
4031000	4033000	Call them dirty come guzzlers instead
4033000	4035000	Hot
4035000	4037000	Let's travel the world and look at some release dates
4037000	4039000	Let's start with the US, Loki
4039000	4041000	This week's not a lot of stuff coming out
4041000	4043000	We got a few budget games and then
4043000	4045000	Some decent stuff
4045000	4047000	So starting off with the budget games
4047000	4049000	Maximum Racing Dragonstock and Maximum Racing
4049000	4051000	GP Classic Racing
4051000	4053000	These are very budget games coming out for the Wii
4053000	4055000	Let's see
4055000	4057000	God's Eater Burst
4057000	4059000	Coming out on PSP this week
4059000	4061000	From D3
4061000	4063000	Looks pretty awesome
4063000	4065000	Jakandia and the Timeless Land
4065000	4067000	This is a game that's very similar to
4067000	4069000	30 Second Hero
4069000	4071000	So I believe this is the one that actually lets you
4071000	4073000	Pick how much time you have
4073000	4075000	And then you can play the game for that long
4075000	4077000	And then of course
4077000	4079000	On the Wii, Trackmania Build to Race
4079000	4081000	Awesome game on the PC
4081000	4083000	So I'm sure it would be pretty good on the Wii
4083000	4085000	Homefront
4085000	4087000	The big game for this week
4087000	4089000	On Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC
4089000	4091000	Kind of
4091000	4093000	The first that we'll see
4093000	4095000	Of the Just Dance series
4095000	4097000	But a little bit of a spin-off
4097000	4099000	Dance on Broadway coming into Playstation 3
4099000	4101000	For the move
4101000	4103000	Also on Playstation 3
4103000	4105000	Yakuza 4
4105000	4107000	With less stuff changed this time
4107000	4109000	From the Japanese version
4109000	4111000	Artun Liko
4111000	4113000	Is it just me or was that kind of a fast turnaround this time?
4113000	4115000	It was a pretty fast turnaround
4115000	4117000	Artun Liko Koga
4117000	4119000	Nel of Arseal
4119000	4121000	On Playstation 3 this week as well
4121000	4123000	Let's see
4123000	4125000	Also
4125000	4127000	Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4127000	4129000	And I believe the Wii
4129000	4131000	Top Spin 4
4131000	4133000	Coming out this week as well
4133000	4135000	And then
4135000	4137000	Surprisingly enough
4137000	4139000	The Xbox 360 version of this got cancelled
4139000	4141000	But Warriors Legend of Troy
4141000	4143000	It's a
4143000	4145000	Trojan version of Dynasty Warriors
4145000	4147000	So check that out
4147000	4149000	And then finally
4149000	4151000	We've got another Ubisoft
4151000	4153000	Fitness game
4153000	4155000	Fit in 6 on the Wii and Playstation 3
4155000	4157000	Of course Playstation 3
4157000	4159000	With move support there
4159000	4161000	It's kind of like their answer to the Arseal fitness
4161000	4163000	Since that never came out on other systems
4163000	4165000	Other than the 360
4165000	4167000	That's
4167000	4169000	That's it for this week
4169000	4171000	Yes, that's it
4171000	4173000	Alright, I'm gonna move on to Japanese release dates
4173000	4175000	I do realize things going on
4175000	4177000	Could have an effect on this
4177000	4179000	On the Xbox 360
4179000	4181000	Dragon Age Origins Awakening
4181000	4183000	That would be the expansion to the original Dragon Age
4183000	4185000	It's gonna be out on March 17th
4185000	4187000	Going on to the Playstation 3
4187000	4189000	And checking out some of the releases there
4189000	4191000	Yakuza
4191000	4193000	I'm sorry, that's a US release
4193000	4195000	Motorstorm 3 Apocalypse
4195000	4197000	Comes out in Japan
4197000	4199000	As well as the Dragon Age Origins expansion
4199000	4201000	Ryu Ga Gotoku of the End
4201000	4203000	Comes out in Japan as well
4203000	4205000	I'm not sure what that
4205000	4207000	Game is, it's from Sega
4207000	4209000	And it's related to the Yakuza universe
4209000	4211000	But I think it's a bit more of the action adventure
4211000	4213000	Type of game, so there you go
4213000	4215000	Let's see
4215000	4217000	Coming out on some other systems
4217000	4219000	Want to see the Wii real quick
4219000	4221000	If there's anything coming out there
4221000	4223000	I don't believe so
4223000	4225000	No, nothing this week because of course
4225000	4227000	Nintendo's focused on the 3DS
4227000	4229000	And the recent launch that happened there
4229000	4231000	So you can check out Steel Diver this week in Japan
4231000	4233000	And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D
4233000	4235000	Is on the 3DS this week in Japan
4235000	4237000	And lastly
4237000	4239000	On the PSP
4239000	4241000	We have
4241000	4243000	Where to go
4243000	4247000	No, I guess
4247000	4249000	Is there anything on the PSP this week?
4249000	4253000	Doesn't look like it
4253000	4257000	For some reason I'm not able to find the dates on my list
4257000	4259000	There we go, never mind, there it is
4259000	4261000	The Little Battlers is the big release
4261000	4263000	On the PSP this week
4263000	4265000	Little Battlers
4265000	4267000	Is a game from level 5
4267000	4269000	It's an RPG coming out over there
4269000	4271000	Looks like you battle these
4271000	4273000	Little kind of polygonal
4273000	4275000	Types of things, it looks a little bit
4275000	4277000	Valkyria profile to me
4277000	4279000	Kind of mixed with traditional RPG mechanics
4279000	4281000	So that could be kind of neat
4281000	4283000	So there you go, that's it for Japanese releases
4283000	4285000	What about the UK?
4285000	4287000	Alright, so from our friends across the pond
4287000	4289000	Coming out on Ides of March
4289000	4291000	Is Total War Shotgun 2
4291000	4293000	Coming out on PC
4293000	4295000	And then for releases on the 18th Friday
4295000	4297000	We have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on PC
4297000	4299000	We also have coming up God's Eater Burst
4299000	4301000	On the PSP
4301000	4303000	I'm just intrigued by the title
4303000	4305000	Homefront is coming out on the 360
4305000	4307000	PS3 and PC
4307000	4309000	Also again on Friday the 18th
4309000	4311000	MotoGP coming out
4311000	4313000	Also on Friday, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions
4313000	4317000	Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on the PS3
4317000	4319000	Okimada and Chisaki Taio
4319000	4321000	See, I could do Chinese
4321000	4323000	Japanese pretty well, huh?
4323000	4325000	I was worried about any
4325000	4327000	I was worried about any type of Japanese releases
4327000	4329000	I had in my read tonight
4329000	4331000	Coming out on DS
4331000	4333000	Also Topspin 4 for 360, PS3 and Wii
4333000	4335000	Coming out
4335000	4337000	And finally Yakuza 4 is mentioned before
4337000	4339000	Coming out on the 18th for PS3
4339000	4341000	I remember buying Topspin
4341000	4343000	Original for 360 and was not a fan
4343000	4345000	It made me frustrated
4345000	4347000	I did not like the original Topspin game
4347000	4349000	It was on 360 either
4349000	4351000	That's it this week for the UK
4351000	4353000	Alright
4353000	4355000	Just a few more news stories for you guys
4355000	4357000	And then we're going to get to the classic game of the week
4357000	4359000	But first, something from Loki
4359000	4361000	I'm sorry, I'm very distracted right now
4361000	4363000	What was that?
4363000	4367000	They finally released the Grand Theft Auto 4 texture editor
4367000	4369000	Remember the one that got ripped off for Trend to Buy?
4369000	4371000	Yeah, someone finally released it
4371000	4373000	All the things I can do
4373000	4375000	It's just so mind boggling
4375000	4377000	Anyways, let's talk about Pokémon
4377000	4379000	Apparently
4379000	4381000	There was a rumor
4381000	4383000	And of course, you know there's always rumors for the stuff coming from Twitter
4383000	4385000	There was a rumor
4385000	4387000	Back when this whole disaster
4387000	4389000	Went down in Japan
4389000	4391000	That the Pokémon creator died
4391000	4393000	That would have been tragic
4393000	4395000	Except it's not true
4395000	4397000	Basically
4397000	4399000	The company tweeted back
4399000	4401000	They said, false
4401000	4403000	Pokémon company and Game Freak is fine
4403000	4405000	So
4405000	4407000	No one's dead
4407000	4409000	Some people are sick
4409000	4411000	That's all
4411000	4413000	Sick
4413000	4415000	Maybe
4415000	4417000	It was a very unfortunate case
4417000	4419000	A mistaken identity or mistranslation
4419000	4421000	But unfortunately
4421000	4423000	That probably was not the case
4423000	4425000	Sick people
4425000	4427000	Alright, moving on
4427000	4429000	One other news story for you guys
4429000	4431000	Free Realms
4431000	4433000	I don't know if you've ever checked this game out
4433000	4435000	It's a casual MMO
4435000	4437000	The weird thing is it's free to play
4437000	4439000	It's coming out on the Playstation 3
4439000	4441000	The funny thing is
4441000	4443000	It's coming out very soon
4443000	4445000	March 29th
4445000	4447000	It was originally on the PC
4447000	4449000	And now it's going to be a free to play casual MMO
4449000	4451000	On the Playstation Network
4451000	4453000	So it's not like DC Universe Online
4453000	4455000	Which is kind of the other big MMO on Playstation 3 right now
4455000	4457000	Free Realms
4457000	4459000	Is going to be different
4459000	4461000	They say that they did take some things
4461000	4463000	From DC Universe Online, Sony Online Entertainment
4463000	4465000	Of course in developing this
4465000	4467000	But basically
4467000	4469000	This is kind of something basically new
4469000	4471000	They had to port the rendering over from the
4471000	4473000	Old engine from the PC
4473000	4475000	The PS3 version unfortunately
4475000	4477000	Will be independent of the PC version
4477000	4479000	You will not be able to play with your friends
4479000	4481000	On the PC version
4481000	4483000	Being able to link the accounts unfortunately isn't possible
4483000	4485000	So it'll be interesting to see how this
4485000	4487000	Works on the Playstation 3
4487000	4489000	Again it's a free to play MMO
4489000	4491000	So I would assume that means on the PS3
4491000	4493000	It's going to be that way as well
4493000	4495000	Maybe it's one of those things that's only open to Playstation Plus though
4495000	4497000	I don't know
4497000	4499000	No word on that yet
4499000	4501000	So we'll see when the game comes out in just a couple weeks
4501000	4503000	Alright for now
4503000	4505000	It's that time of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane
4505000	4507000	And look at the classic game of the week
4509000	4511000	Every week here on the show
4511000	4513000	Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault of classic gaming
4513000	4515000	And pull out a game that she thinks you guys should be checking out this week
4515000	4517000	Unfortunately she's not here this week
4517000	4519000	So we all decided to run into the vault
4519000	4521000	And knock everything over
4521000	4523000	And let everything kind of pile up on the floor
4523000	4525000	In one big pile
4525000	4527000	We jumped on in, pulled one game out
4527000	4529000	And this is what we got
4529000	4531000	After we smashed everything with the hammer
4531000	4533000	And locked me in the vault for 24 hours
4533000	4535000	No I'm kidding
4535000	4537000	We decided since Matt 2 was good enough to step in
4537000	4539000	And fill in for Jamie tonight
4539000	4541000	Why doesn't he get to pick the classic game of the week
4541000	4543000	What did you pick for the classic game of the week?
4543000	4545000	Well I'll never presume to take over for Jamie
4545000	4547000	But I'm honored to do this segment here
4547000	4549000	So after being locked in the vault for 24 hours
4549000	4551000	And a dog pile ensued
4551000	4553000	I sifted through it and found
4553000	4555000	This little gem on Super Nintendo
4555000	4557000	One of my favorites
4557000	4559000	Actraiser
4559000	4561000	And Actraiser was produced
4561000	4563000	And distributed back in 1990
4563000	4565000	So 20 years ago
4565000	4567000	Oh my god I'm so old
4567000	4569000	Exclusive for Super Nintendo at the time
4569000	4571000	It was put out by Enix then
4571000	4573000	Now Squeenix as we know it
4573000	4575000	And the whole idea of this game was
4575000	4577000	It was two fold
4577000	4579000	You were a platform side scrolling
4579000	4581000	Action as well as
4581000	4583000	City building almost like RTS
4583000	4585000	And the whole premise was that
4585000	4587000	You were god, or a god I should say
4587000	4589000	And you would have to run around
4589000	4591000	And kill stuff and defend the land
4591000	4593000	You then also
4593000	4595000	Once you completed the level which was
4595000	4597000	Again very basic side scrolling levels here
4597000	4599000	You would then turn into an angel
4599000	4601000	And fly around and protect the city
4601000	4603000	From other monsters
4603000	4605000	And you could see his butt
4605000	4607000	You could definitely see his ass
4607000	4609000	You fly around in an angel form
4609000	4611000	And help defend the city
4611000	4613000	You would also have to do things like
4613000	4615000	Help crops grow by being god
4615000	4617000	You'd have to make it rain on the crops
4617000	4619000	And lightning to burn bushes
4619000	4621000	So your city could grow and things like that
4621000	4623000	At the time when I was playing it
4623000	4625000	I really enjoyed the music from the game
4625000	4627000	The gameplay is pretty straight forward on the platform side
4627000	4629000	And the angel
4629000	4631000	Side scrolling or RTS side
4631000	4633000	But
4633000	4635000	So anywho, a little bit more background about the game
4635000	4637000	Again the idea that you were a god or a master
4637000	4639000	And you take the form of
4639000	4641000	The overseer in a cloud
4641000	4643000	Not cloud saves, but just cloud
4643000	4645000	And then when your citizens call upon you to help defend the land
4645000	4647000	You would beam on down
4647000	4649000	To the world and take over
4649000	4651000	In a humanoid form
4651000	4653000	The funny part is
4653000	4655000	There was an Actraiser 2
4655000	4657000	Really a prequel to the game
4657000	4659000	But a lot of religious subtext
4659000	4661000	Was discovered about it
4661000	4663000	People were concerned about the game
4663000	4665000	Because in the Japanese text for this prequel
4665000	4667000	They actually called the main character god
4667000	4669000	And the villain of the game Satan
4669000	4671000	So here we are talking about the devil again tonight Rob
4671000	4673000	But it was a very
4673000	4675000	It was a very
4675000	4677000	Engaging game because again it had two
4677000	4679000	Parts to it, you had to again defend the city
4679000	4681000	And build your cities
4681000	4683000	If you didn't do these certain tasks
4683000	4685000	Your citizens would die and you would lose the game
4685000	4687000	One of my favorites
4687000	4689000	It later came out for Virtual Console
4689000	4691000	And also released on
4691000	4693000	Mobile phone devices
4693000	4695000	So this is out there to play
4695000	4697000	And I don't know
4697000	4699000	I just really enjoyed the music from this game
4699000	4701000	So your classic video game of the week
4701000	4703000	Is Actraiser
4703000	4705000	On Super Nintendo and Virtual Console and Mobile Phone
4705000	4707000	An excellent fucking choice
4707000	4709000	And I remember when
4709000	4711000	Matt too told me what game he wanted to do for the classic game of the week
4711000	4713000	I was like no Jamie had to have picked that at some point
4713000	4715000	Well I asked her about it. I was like go check the wiki
4715000	4717000	Jamie picked that right
4717000	4719000	And it hadn't been picked yet
4719000	4721000	Well I checked the wiki just to be certain
4721000	4723000	And then I sent her a message
4723000	4725000	And said hey these are the three games I
4725000	4727000	Would like to review
4727000	4729000	And these are on the wiki that I want to run past you
4729000	4731000	She goes oh I totally had Actraiser on my list to do
4731000	4733000	So yeah go ahead and take that
4733000	4735000	I also gave two other suggestions to Rob
4735000	4737000	I told him one of them
4737000	4739000	I think he was impressed on how far back
4739000	4741000	My video gaming experience went
4741000	4743000	Do you remember the game I told you?
4743000	4745000	But Congo Bongo?
4745000	4747000	I totally remember that game from the Atari 5200
4747000	4749000	But anywho
4749000	4751000	So Actraiser
4751000	4753000	Is definitely a great game. Check it out
4753000	4755000	Let's not take attention away from Actraiser
4755000	4757000	Because this game is amazing
4757000	4759000	It's definitely in my top 10 video games ever
4759000	4761000	The sequel doesn't hold a candle to it
4761000	4763000	And it actually bankrupt the series I think
4763000	4765000	That's too bad
4765000	4767000	Like Enix made so many good freaking games
4767000	4769000	On the Super Nintendo
4769000	4771000	I'm not even talking about Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior
4771000	4773000	That series. I'm talking about
4773000	4775000	The Illusion of Gaia
4775000	4777000	And that whole series
4777000	4779000	That was in Soul Blazer
4779000	4781000	I think was one of the other games
4781000	4783000	That whole series was awesome
4783000	4785000	And of course they were the ones that did Busta Move
4785000	4787000	depending on what country you were in
4787000	4789000	That was all Enix
4789000	4791000	And a lot of that has disappeared since the Square merger
4791000	4793000	Which is unfortunate
4793000	4795000	One of the most graphic things about this game was
4795000	4797000	Whenever you had to warp down to the world to defend it
4797000	4799000	The screen would spin around
4799000	4801000	And it was just high-tech
4801000	4803000	And it made you feel like you were falling
4803000	4805000	Into the earth
4805000	4807000	So as your citizens
4807000	4809000	Gain power-ups and learn smarter
4809000	4811000	They can learn how to build better
4811000	4813000	Buildings and better crops
4813000	4815000	And things like that
4815000	4817000	It definitely had a SimCities
4817000	4819000	And a platform feel to it
4819000	4821000	Definitely check it out
4821000	4823000	Thank you to the week for the Super Nintendo from Enix
4823000	4825000	Actraiser
4825000	4827000	And for heaven's sake, at least just listen to this soundtrack
4827000	4829000	Because it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever
4829000	4831000	I believe it's Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack to that
4831000	4833000	Who's um, just
4833000	4835000	No, no, what am I saying?
4835000	4837000	She sang a song
4837000	4839000	For like Evangelion or something
4839000	4841000	Yuzo Koshiro did the music to that
4841000	4843000	And he did
4843000	4845000	He did a DDR song back in the day
4845000	4847000	I believe he's the same guy that does Wangan Midnight
4847000	4849000	Maximum Tune, Streets of Rage
4849000	4851000	Lots of great stuff
4851000	4853000	So, very cool
4853000	4855000	Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio
4855000	4857000	But fear not, there's plenty more of
4857000	4859000	OLR to come when we get back

4867000	4869000	Dance Hero rumors, some games being
4869000	4871000	Cancelled at Sony, and what's going to
4871000	4873000	Happen to NBA Jam
4873000	4875000	We'll find out after this, a quick break with more
4875000	4879000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
4883000	4885000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

4899000	4901000	And if you are just joining us
4901000	4903000	I did make a plea in Part A
4903000	4905000	And I'll say it again, please, please, please
4905000	4907000	For those folks in Japan
4907000	4909000	That have had to go through such a
4909000	4911000	Crazy, horrific thing going on
4911000	4913000	Right now, please consider donating to the
4913000	4915000	Red Cross, you can go to
4915000	4917000	Redcross.org, I'm really
4917000	4919000	Encouraging all of our listeners to part with
4919000	4921000	$10, it's not that much
4921000	4923000	That's like less than the cost of one month
4923000	4925000	Of an MMO, that's an Xbox Live Arcade game
4925000	4927000	You can go without this week
4927000	4929000	And put the money to where it's really, really
4929000	4931000	Needed right now, anyhow
4931000	4933000	Moving on, we're gonna get back into some gaming news
4933000	4935000	And some rapid fire news, and your Twitter

4939000	4941000	Just a minute, so get those in, this is your last chance
4941000	4943000	Also, I gotta do a plug
4943000	4945000	For the spin-off shows, unfortunately Dark
4945000	4947000	Sakura's not here tonight, but she does do a
4947000	4949000	Fun little show with Mara & Marvel
4949000	4951000	And Dan Shadow, it's called Comic Insanity
4951000	4953000	But that's with no I, it's
4953000	4955000	Comic N-sanity, and you can find
4955000	4957000	That on Twitter, or you can also find it at
4957000	4959000	Infamous.net, again, just the letter
4959000	4961000	N, Infamous.net
4961000	4963000	If you like World of Warcraft, check out my
4963000	4965000	Spin-off show with X-Defer, the best little
4965000	4967000	Horde house in Azeroth, also known
4967000	4969000	As Horde House for short
4969000	4971000	And all of that coming
4971000	4973000	To a new website also this week
4973000	4975000	That I'll be able to give out, and I'm very excited
4975000	4977000	So that's all on its way to being done
4977000	4979000	In the meantime,
4979000	4981000	Some rapid fire news, some quick stories
4981000	4983000	For you guys, let's start with Loki
4983000	4985000	According to the
4985000	4987000	New issue of the French gaming magazine
4987000	4989000	Joystick, Bethesda's next
4989000	4991000	Game in their, well, next
4991000	4993000	Announced game is gonna be Prey 2
4993000	4995000	That's right, the sequel to the
4995000	4997000	First person shooter game that came out from
4997000	4999000	3D Realms and 2K games
4999000	5001000	Wow. Of course, 3D Realms is no
5001000	5003000	Longer around, and you know
5003000	5005000	Bethesda was purchased by
5005000	5007000	ZeniMax
5007000	5009000	Which snatched up the
5009000	5011000	Company ID software
5011000	5013000	So it makes perfect sense that they're gonna be putting out
5013000	5015000	Shooter games
5015000	5017000	No word exactly on when that's coming out
5017000	5019000	But probably something that we'll be
5019000	5021000	Hearing more about during E3 this year
5021000	5023000	I'm kind of surprised that Prey is getting a sequel
5023000	5025000	Because the first one didn't really do too hot
5025000	5027000	I mean, it was a good game
5027000	5029000	Especially for dummies
5029000	5031000	Like, it was a first person shooter for dummies
5031000	5033000	Because you can never die in Prey, and that's one of the things
5033000	5035000	I really liked about it, because I suck at first person shooters
5035000	5037000	The story was pretty good too
5037000	5039000	Even though it totally cut off abruptly
5039000	5041000	Like, you play in the game and then it's over
5041000	5043000	It was weird
5043000	5045000	For a sequel
5045000	5047000	Yeah, kind of like that
5047000	5049000	But not really
5049000	5051000	Without the journey
5051000	5053000	This is kind of a neat little Easter egg
5053000	5055000	I guess for the Google Chrome browser
5055000	5057000	If you're using it
5057000	5059000	There's actually a piece of JavaScript
5059000	5061000	You can paste into the Chrome's
5061000	5063000	Address
5063000	5065000	And when you do that
5065000	5067000	It activates a hack which reloads a page
5067000	5069000	And basically allows you to
5069000	5071000	Roll around a ball
5071000	5073000	A katamari ball, to be exact
5073000	5075000	And pick up all the words
5075000	5077000	And images on the screen like you would a katamari
5077000	5079000	Awesome
5079000	5081000	And you can find this piece of code
5081000	5083000	At kathack.com
5083000	5085000	That's K-A-T
5085000	5087000	Hack.com
5087000	5089000	And check it out
5089000	5091000	It's kind of a neat one
5091000	5093000	Does it play the music too?
5093000	5095000	I don't think it does
5095000	5097000	But thanks to the advent of
5097000	5099000	The MP3
5099000	5101000	You would provide your own soundtrack
5101000	5103000	For your web page rolling up
5103000	5105000	Adventures
5105000	5107000	It's just not the same
5107000	5109000	And then finally
5109000	5111000	There's a company out of
5111000	5113000	San Francisco that wants to make your life
5113000	5115000	The RPG
5115000	5117000	So basically it's life
5117000	5119000	The RPG
5119000	5121000	But it's you
5121000	5123000	It's coming from a company called
5123000	5125000	Green Goose
5125000	5127000	And basically what it is
5127000	5129000	Is this package that you get
5129000	5131000	It's packaged with a water bottle
5131000	5133000	Toothbrush and vitamin container
5133000	5135000	And it says the Green Goose
5135000	5137000	Logs how many times a week
5137000	5139000	That you say for example
5139000	5141000	Pick up their toothbrush or whatever
5141000	5143000	Awarding them points each time that they do
5143000	5145000	There's sensors on the bottles
5145000	5147000	And on the toothbrush for tracking
5147000	5149000	As well as a credit card size
5149000	5151000	Pedometer that communicates with the
5151000	5153000	Base station that's attached
5153000	5155000	To a broadband router
5155000	5157000	The points that the player earns
5157000	5159000	Will
5159000	5161000	Not really do anything
5161000	5163000	But it's meant
5163000	5165000	To encourage a healthy
5165000	5167000	Lifestyle I guess
5167000	5169000	And clean teeth
5169000	5171000	Okie dokie
5171000	5173000	I don't know
5173000	5175000	Neat
5175000	5177000	This is something I can see them selling
5177000	5179000	At a dentist office or something like that
5179000	5181000	I remember all those toothbrushing
5181000	5183000	Games and stuff that you could play on
5183000	5185000	With the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64
5185000	5187000	That were supposed to like you know
5187000	5189000	Teach the good habits and all that
5189000	5191000	It would be kind of funny
5191000	5193000	Like a life of the game or something like that
5193000	5195000	Well they kind of have that
5195000	5197000	Like in the 3DS where you earn points for walking
5197000	5199000	Or shaking
5199000	5201000	The 3DS
5201000	5203000	And you award the same points
5203000	5205000	For walking or throttling something
5205000	5207000	Alright
5207000	5209000	Let's move on here to some
5209000	5211000	Other news about the Legend of
5211000	5213000	Zelda the Ocarina of Time 3D
5213000	5215000	There is some
5215000	5217000	New things that are supposed to be in there
5217000	5219000	It's not just a direct port
5219000	5221000	Of the 64 version
5221000	5223000	The 3DS version is supposed to have some other
5223000	5225000	Stuff and this is in an interview that
5225000	5227000	Happened with Miyamoto
5227000	5229000	Talking about the 3DS version of Ocarina
5229000	5231000	Of Time. Apparently they've set up a new system
5231000	5233000	Where when you use the A, B and X, Y
5233000	5235000	Buttons there's also some special buttons in the
5235000	5237000	Touch screen that you can use to switch
5237000	5239000	Between the items right away
5239000	5241000	Between maps and menus and so forth
5241000	5243000	Also one other
5243000	5245000	Little teaser that's there
5245000	5247000	From Satoru Iwata says
5247000	5249000	Of course the Nintendo 3DS version of
5249000	5251000	Ocarina of Time is crammed with interesting
5251000	5253000	Things that weren't in the Nintendo 64 version
5253000	5255000	But we'll wait to talk about those
5255000	5257000	To the release
5257000	5259000	By the way
5259000	5261000	Quick follow up from SX in our chat room on the
5261000	5263000	Katamari Damacy add-in. It does play the music
5263000	5265000	Just so you know
5265000	5267000	Well that's good to know. That's coming from our chat
5267000	5269000	Some rumors about Grand Theft Auto 5
5269000	5271000	Is the code name Rush
5271000	5273000	That could be what's going on
5273000	5275000	I guess that's some casting
5275000	5277000	Details that were done on a Google search
5277000	5279000	Apparently there's this project called Rush
5279000	5281000	And it has to do with Grand Theft Auto 5
5281000	5283000	Rush is tied to Take-Two Interactive
5283000	5285000	They own Rockstar Games
5285000	5287000	Apparently it's a video game
5287000	5289000	Set in the Los Angeles area
5289000	5291000	So maybe they've gone from New York to L.A.
5291000	5293000	Who knows but that is apparently
5293000	5295000	Some of the rumors about the game
5295000	5297000	Some of the casting that is in the game
5297000	5299000	There's a 38 year old FBI agent
5299000	5301000	In grape shape
5301000	5303000	A 25 year old young Mexican-American
5303000	5305000	FBI agent
5305000	5307000	23 year old moron
5307000	5309000	White trash hillbilly named Clyde
5309000	5311000	And so on and so on
5311000	5313000	So lots of parts that they're casting for
5313000	5315000	That's either going to be a Grand Theft Auto game
5315000	5317000	Which I can only hope
5317000	5319000	Or it's going to be a sequel to Midnight
5319000	5321000	Club L.A.
5321000	5323000	And lastly, Valve is going to be
5323000	5325000	Bridging Portal and Portal 2
5325000	5327000	With some type of surprise
5327000	5329000	We don't exactly know what that is
5329000	5331000	But that was from
5331000	5333000	Coming out of PAX East
5333000	5335000	Something that will tie the story
5335000	5337000	Of the interim time between Portal and Portal 2
5337000	5339000	Is that a comic book?
5339000	5341000	Is that an arcade game?
5341000	5343000	Is that YouTube?
5343000	5345000	Who knows?
5345000	5347000	Apparently something will be coming to tie
5347000	5349000	The two worlds together in the future
5349000	5351000	So we'll see
5351000	5353000	Matt 2?
5381000	5383000	This is Strong by Trapped
5383000	5385000	That's just half of what's in that pack
5385000	5387000	These are all those angsty
5387000	5389000	Boy frat bands that you like
5389000	5391000	Yes, this is good music, Rob
5391000	5393000	It sounds like men with vaginas
5393000	5395000	When I hear it
5395000	5397000	I'm sure a lot of our listeners
5397000	5399000	Are like, you're an asshole, Rob
5399000	5401000	You like Lady Gaga
5401000	5403000	I heard she did a great song
5403000	5405000	That copied Madonna's song
5405000	5407000	Weren't you in the middle of some news?
5407000	5409000	Yes sir, let me continue
5409000	5411000	So check that out if you're into rock music
5411000	5413000	Other stories that are coming up
5415000	5417000	There it goes
5417000	5419000	Torchlight
5419000	5421000	Rob talked about this in his gaming week
5421000	5423000	He's tried Torchlight, it mimics Diablo 2
5423000	5425000	And all that's great
5425000	5427000	But it was cancelled in Japan
5427000	5429000	Due to text bugs
5429000	5431000	And due to translation delays
5431000	5433000	So basically Torchlight was there
5433000	5435000	It was set to launch in the Xbox Live Arcade
5435000	5439000	And when it came down to it
5439000	5441000	It was just abruptly cancelled
5441000	5443000	Due to some various
5443000	5445000	It's a weird reason to cancel a game
5445000	5447000	It's a very weird reason
5447000	5449000	Various reasons to go back and forth
5449000	5451000	There must have been a dirty word
5451000	5453000	In mistranslation or something
5453000	5455000	I don't know, there was a lot of debate
5455000	5457000	Whether it was a bug or a text issue
5457000	5459000	Everyone was pointing at each other's fingers
5459000	5461000	But basically it was quoted saying
5461000	5463000	We're not privy to the decision making process
5463000	5465000	But it was due to bugs in the translation
5465000	5467000	Because the game has never been translated
5467000	5469000	To Japanese
5469000	5471000	Since there was no existing Japanese version
5471000	5473000	Of the game, the complexity of a new translation
5473000	5475000	Combined with the randomly generated naming
5475000	5477000	Scheme for Torchlight
5477000	5479000	Made it beyond the scope of the project
5479000	5481000	You would think that if they were going to release something
5481000	5483000	In two different countries
5483000	5485000	And countries had different languages
5485000	5487000	They would include that in the scope of the project
5487000	5489000	It still just seems so abrupt
5489000	5491000	Too hard, I don't want to do this
5491000	5493000	I don't understand!
5493000	5495000	Google Translate won't work for this game
5495000	5497000	Rob, you made a point that the text
5497000	5499000	On the screen was awfully small
5499000	5501000	Yeah, maybe you couldn't read it
5501000	5503000	So maybe the Japanese videography of the characters
5503000	5505000	Didn't look right
5505000	5507000	So who knows
5507000	5509000	Maybe look for that in the future if they figure out how to translate it
5509000	5511000	Or maybe that's just wah wah wah
5511000	5513000	So, unfortunately no Torchlight
5513000	5515000	For the Xbox Live
5515000	5517000	For the Japanese version
5517000	5519000	And
5519000	5521000	I really don't want to have to share this news
5521000	5523000	Because the first iteration of this was
5523000	5525000	Just so horrible
5525000	5527000	There's work that a new
5527000	5529000	Doom movie is coming out
5529000	5531000	Yes
5531000	5533000	We all remember in 2005 The Rock
5533000	5535000	Dwayne Johnson
5535000	5537000	Did a
5537000	5539000	Wonderful version of Doom
5539000	5541000	In an attempt to
5541000	5543000	Do a movie on the first person shooter that
5543000	5545000	Got us in the early 90s
5545000	5547000	But there's a reboot in the works
5547000	5549000	That's going to completely ignore Dwayne Johnson's
5549000	5551000	First version, thank god
5551000	5553000	And of course, like everything else
5553000	5555000	In this frickin' time and day
5555000	5557000	It'll be in 3D
5557000	5559000	Oh, of course
5559000	5561000	Will we have scenes with a gun in 3D?
5561000	5563000	Probably
5563000	5565000	Was that in the first movie?
5565000	5567000	It wasn't in 3D, but the perspective
5567000	5569000	You were running around for parts
5569000	5571000	The scene with a gun swinging back and forth
5571000	5573000	Like you were in the video game
5573000	5575000	I would be okay with this if they just
5575000	5577000	Took Doom 3D
5577000	5579000	Sorry, I'm just looking real quick
5579000	5581000	I'm trying to bring back some memories here
5581000	5583000	Oh god, please don't
5595000	5597000	I saw this on
5597000	5599000	USA Network or TNT or something like that
5599000	5601000	I think they cut out all the violence
5601000	5603000	Oh, they did, and the swearing
5603000	5607000	Swearing in violence would have made it better
5609000	5611000	Yeah, it was just bad
5611000	5613000	Doom is waiting
5613000	5615000	So there's no release date, there's no nothing
5615000	5617000	It's just in the preliminary works and it's just
5617000	5619000	A new project in the early stages
5619000	5621000	Yay, another Hollywood reboot, just what we needed
5621000	5623000	And in 3D, can't forget it's in 3D
5623000	5625000	We've run out of ideas, completely
5625000	5627000	Exactly, so
5627000	5629000	Time to remake crap
5629000	5631000	Look for that, hopefully, in the near future
5631000	5633000	Yeah, can't wait
5633000	5635000	There will be no hopefully looking forward to
5635000	5637000	Much anticipation, alright
5637000	5639000	I promised someone we'd do a quick phone call here
5639000	5641000	At this point in the show, so we're gonna make a phone call real quick
5641000	5643000	And try to get this all taken care of
5643000	5645000	I hope it's going through
5645000	5647000	I'm kind of relying on Skype tonight
5647000	5649000	And sometimes it can be a little
5649000	5651000	There we go, one ringy dingy
5651000	5653000	Two ringy dingys
5657000	5659000	Hopefully there's an answer, that might be quite embarrassing
5659000	5661000	What?
5661000	5663000	Hi, is this Dark Sakura?
5663000	5665000	Yes, this is
5665000	5667000	How are you, did you make it to Disneyland in one piece?
5667000	5669000	Well we're not at Disneyland yet
5669000	5671000	We're going tomorrow, but we
5671000	5673000	We made it to the hotel room
5673000	5675000	You're in that area, right?
5675000	5677000	I can look out of the window
5677000	5679000	And see the parking structure
5679000	5681000	There you go, now
5681000	5683000	Aren't you down there because you get to hang out with the official
5683000	5685000	OLR lesbians this week, or at least one of them?
5685000	5687000	Well both of them on Tuesday
5687000	5689000	We're going to Goofy's Kitchen together
5689000	5691000	Yay, well be sure to tell them
5691000	5693000	We all said hi and everything
5693000	5695000	Well, you know, I was gonna try to
5695000	5697000	Unfortunately it didn't work out, I was gonna have you plug
5697000	5699000	Your spin-off show, but I already did that for you
5699000	5701000	The whole comic insanity
5701000	5703000	But do you want to tell us anything about your gaming week?
5703000	5705000	Or anything maybe you've been doing to pass the time in the car?
5705000	5707000	Like on the iOS games?
5707000	5709000	Well, I played a little solitaire
5709000	5711000	Mostly I was vlogging
5711000	5713000	And just singing along with us
5713000	5717000	And just singing along with us
5717000	5719000	Some classic rock that happened to come on
5719000	5721000	Awesome
5721000	5723000	On a CD that I made so I knew it was on there
5723000	5727000	And played some Marvel vs Capcom 3 during the week
5727000	5729000	Nice
5729000	5731000	Wow
5731000	5733000	Looking forward to the new characters to be
5733000	5735000	Paid to unlock?
5735000	5737000	Well we're getting Shima Grass
5737000	5739000	Jill's not worth it
5739000	5741000	Jill's not worth it
5741000	5743000	So I gotta say Matt 2 is doing a
5743000	5745000	Pretty good job filling in tonight
5745000	5747000	His classic game of the week was very well received
5747000	5749000	But he totally set the vault
5749000	5751000	On fire and I
5751000	5753000	Just want to apologize for that in advance
5753000	5755000	That everything is on fire
5755000	5757000	You realize Dan's going to
5757000	5759000	Castrate you before he kills you right?
5759000	5761000	All of you
5761000	5763000	Dan scares Matt 2
5763000	5765000	Although I
5765000	5767000	Did admit
5767000	5769000	The vault wasn't
5769000	5771000	On fire it was a small
5771000	5773000	Ember burning and you
5773000	5775000	Overreacted and luckily they had a dry
5775000	5777000	Chem fire extinguisher under the sink and I put it out
5777000	5779000	He was putting his cigarette out in there
5779000	5781000	And I'm kidding I'm totally kidding
5781000	5783000	We haven't even gone in there
5783000	5785000	I know I know
5785000	5787000	Matt 2 brought me beer tonight and not you
5787000	5789000	Ha
5789000	5791000	Okay
5791000	5793000	It wasn't true oh well for our fashion list
5793000	5795000	One of the hosts was slightly intoxicated
5795000	5797000	I offered it to Loki
5797000	5799000	In disbelief and then said err
5799000	5801000	And handed it to Rob so
5801000	5803000	Alright so we're about to
5803000	5805000	We're about to get into Twitter topics but is there
5805000	5807000	Anything you want to say to the listeners tonight?
5807000	5809000	I have the best husband ever
5809000	5811000	Why is that?
5811000	5813000	I just do
5813000	5815000	He's pretty cool
5815000	5817000	He's okay
5817000	5819000	Because he's awesome
5819000	5821000	And he likes
5821000	5823000	The pita sandwiches at the place you took me to
5823000	5825000	This week and that was pretty awesome alright
5825000	5827000	That's what we had for breakfast
5827000	5829000	Oh no I just kicked
5829000	5831000	Shermie on accident I'm sorry Shermie
5831000	5833000	Did you notice what I did for you?
5833000	5835000	I washed her
5835000	5837000	Bed so it would not stink
5837000	5839000	For you
5839000	5841000	That is a big cat
5841000	5843000	I washed her
5843000	5845000	I washed her butt for you
5845000	5847000	Thank you that's so kind
5847000	5849000	Because it would not stink
5849000	5851000	Because her butt stinks

6011000	6013000	Who was shown at PAX East
6013000	6015000	Linking us to a little trailer here
6015000	6017000	On YouTube hold on let me uh
6017000	6019000	Let me stop the cute music here
6019000	6021000	You're like zooming down this tunnel
6021000	6023000	It's kinda like a Wipeout HD
6023000	6025000	Mixed with uh
6025000	6027000	Oh what was that frickin game
6027000	6029000	Audio Surf on uh
6029000	6031000	Steam
6031000	6033000	That's what this looks like to me
6033000	6035000	It's cute
6035000	6037000	I'm not sure how that's a music game
6041000	6043000	I like it, it's like Chiptunes or something
6043000	6045000	Is the music, I wonder if that's the whole deal
6045000	6047000	I will have to wait and see
6047000	6049000	If that's the whole deal
6049000	6051000	I will have to research more about that
6051000	6053000	A little later
6053000	6055000	Moving on to some more tweets
6055000	6057000	Reddertainment tweeting us saying
6057000	6059000	It's good to see Square issuing refunds
6059000	6061000	Over the Final Fantasy XI outage
6061000	6063000	Treats their customers better than the airlines
6063000	6065000	Would in the same situation
6065000	6067000	Oh snap good point, very good point
6067000	6069000	Tigerclaw wants to bring this up
6069000	6071000	AT&T is going to be introducing a bandwidth cap
6071000	6073000	For DSL and U-verse customers
6073000	6075000	This May
6075000	6077000	Comcast folks have been dealing with this for some time
6077000	6079000	But apparently now there is going to be
6079000	6081000	A 150GB monthly usage cap
6081000	6083000	For DSL customers and 250GB
6083000	6085000	Cap for U-verse users
6085000	6087000	Starting on May 2
6087000	6089000	AT&T users from now through March 31
6089000	6091000	Are going to start receiving notices
6091000	6093000	Informing them of the change
6093000	6095000	In the company's terms of service
6095000	6097000	There will also be overage charges
6097000	6099000	If you go over
6099000	6101000	I guess it's $10 for every 50GB
6101000	6103000	Over the 150 or 250GB limit
6103000	6105000	That's actually not bad
6105000	6107000	Because Comcast has been doing this for a few months now
6107000	6109000	And they threaten to pull your coverage all together
6109000	6111000	If you go over the 250GB cap
6111000	6113000	It takes a lot to get over
6113000	6115000	It takes a lot to get over 250GB
6115000	6117000	I was looking at my usage, I think in the month of January
6117000	6119000	I used 18GB
6119000	6121000	And I play a lot of WoW y'all
6121000	6123000	I play a lot of WoW
6123000	6125000	I've never gone over 250GB
6125000	6127000	And I download a lot of
6127000	6129000	Porn
6129000	6131000	Not ISO's at all
6131000	6133000	None of that
6133000	6135000	Never do that
6135000	6137000	But I could see with more and more
6137000	6139000	Streaming HD movies
6139000	6141000	Streaming HD movies is a couple gigs
6141000	6143000	So if you watch a
6143000	6145000	Streaming HD movie every day
6145000	6147000	You might hit this cap
6147000	6149000	It's a little bit unfortunate
6149000	6151000	Unlimited does not mean unlimited
6151000	6153000	Don't get me started on net neutrality
6153000	6155000	Oh my god
6155000	6157000	Can you believe if they started
6157000	6159000	Charging an extra $10 for Netflix
6159000	6161000	At the top of what you already pay for Netflix
6161000	6163000	It's ridiculous
6163000	6165000	They'll just find a way around it
6165000	6167000	Now they said
6167000	6169000	The whole net neutrality thing
6169000	6171000	They can throttle bandwidth on different things
6171000	6173000	Because they have the right to do that now
6173000	6175000	Cable companies are going to destroy themselves
6175000	6177000	With all this crap
6177000	6179000	Just watch
6179000	6181000	It's going to make piracy worse
6181000	6183000	It's going to make piracy worse
6183000	6185000	All the net neutrality stuff
6185000	6187000	Is going to make it worse
6187000	6189000	I'm telling you
6189000	6191000	Just look at the behavior
6191000	6193000	Of the internet
6193000	6195000	And if you don't think that charging people extra money
6195000	6197000	To access certain services is going to encourage people
6197000	6199000	To get around that gate
6199000	6201000	Or for new services to start up to offer
6201000	6203000	The same stuff in less legitimate ways
6203000	6205000	Just you wait
6205000	6207000	Tigerclaw
6207000	6209000	Sends us another tweet about
6209000	6211000	Voice acting in Portal 2
6211000	6213000	Announced at PAX
6213000	6215000	JK Simmons will be doing a voice
6215000	6217000	In Portal 2
6217000	6219000	That is Juno's dad
6219000	6221000	And from Spiderman
6221000	6223000	J. Jonah Jameson
6223000	6225000	JK Simmons will be doing this
6225000	6227000	Cave Johnson is the character
6227000	6229000	The president and founder of Aperture Science
6229000	6231000	That's a pretty big role
6231000	6233000	There you go
6233000	6235000	That'll be fun
6235000	6237000	Was that demo at PAX East for Portal 2?
6237000	6239000	That's pretty awesome if it was
6239000	6241000	Probably one of those behind closed doors things
6241000	6243000	Which is a little silly
6243000	6245000	Apparently a pro wrestler
6245000	6247000	Was one of the first to
6247000	6249000	Pitch a perfect MLB 2K11 game
6249000	6251000	Yeah here's the deal
6251000	6253000	Did you know that they're doing this
6253000	6255000	Contest right now for MLB 2K11
6255000	6257000	I saw a commercial for this the other day
6257000	6259000	If you are the first to pitch a perfect game
6259000	6261000	You can win a million dollars
6261000	6263000	By being the first to
6263000	6265000	Pitch a perfect in this game
6265000	6267000	Kinda interesting
6267000	6269000	Perfect starting April 1st
6269000	6271000	Meaning that Mana
6271000	6273000	Who did this Michael Mana is the
6273000	6275000	Professional
6275000	6277000	Wrestler known as Stevie Richards
6277000	6279000	He posted the video on YouTube
6279000	6281000	But unfortunately this doesn't start
6281000	6283000	Until April 1st so the win doesn't actually
6283000	6285000	Count and it's supposed to be harder than it was
6285000	6287000	Last year because you can't
6287000	6289000	I think you have to actually use the
6289000	6291000	Legitimate rosters for players that are
6291000	6293000	Current up to that date
6293000	6295000	You can't just power load
6295000	6297000	Your team or whatever
6297000	6299000	Like they did last year so
6299000	6301000	It should be slightly harder
6301000	6303000	So it may take like
6303000	6305000	Two days instead of one day
6305000	6307000	And lastly a tweet from
6307000	6309000	Blue Swim saying Dead or Alive
6309000	6311000	Announced for the
6311000	6313000	3DS that there is going to be some
6313000	6315000	DLC
6315000	6317000	So yes some DLC coming to the 3DS
6317000	6319000	And it's going to be
6319000	6321000	Let's see the series boss characters
6321000	6323000	Alpha 152, Alpha Kasumi
6323000	6325000	Genra and Tengu
6325000	6327000	I'm sorry they are not DLC they are just going to be
6327000	6329000	A game which is pretty cool
6329000	6331000	However free downloadable content
6331000	6333000	28 additional costumes
6333000	6335000	Going to be free Cheerleader, Leifang
6335000	6337000	Ninja Outfit, Ayana
6337000	6339000	And so on and so on
6339000	6341000	La Mera Posa in a white cat outfit
6341000	6343000	Indeed
6343000	6345000	More information available in
6345000	6347000	Famitsu Magazine which broke the news
6347000	6349000	This week that's pretty awesome
6349000	6351000	That's going to do it for tweets
6351000	6353000	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to show us your tweets
6353000	6355000	Next time
6355000	6357000	Let's go back into some news
6357000	6359000	Yes
6359000	6361000	So
6361000	6363000	I don't know
6363000	6365000	I kind of
6365000	6367000	Ranted about this a little bit in the beginning
6367000	6369000	But
6369000	6371000	Really Dance Hero
6371000	6373000	Apparently you know there were
6373000	6375000	Trademarks registered a while back
6375000	6377000	I remember we were talking about like a Tar villain
6377000	6379000	And Dance Hero and stuff like that
6379000	6381000	Oh no they are going to do something like DVR
6381000	6383000	Well now apparently
6383000	6385000	There's some more
6385000	6387000	Info regarding it
6387000	6389000	Apparently they are saying that
6389000	6391000	There are some artists
6391000	6393000	Working with
6393000	6395000	Activision on the franchise
6395000	6397000	Timbaland, J Sean
6397000	6399000	The Prodigy and Afrojack all have
6399000	6401000	Songs I guess that are
6401000	6403000	Going to be in this
6403000	6405000	It's
6405000	6407000	I don't know I mean I guess I could
6407000	6409000	See them doing something similar like this
6409000	6411000	Like Dance Central because it's
6411000	6413000	You know made money
6413000	6415000	It's what's popular right now
6415000	6417000	And
6417000	6419000	I guess
6419000	6421000	This is coming from I want to say
6421000	6423000	Some sort of
6423000	6425000	Like licensing
6425000	6427000	Thing or something I'm trying to see here real quick
6427000	6429000	I seem to remember some time
6429000	6431000	Ago we saw Activision licensing
6431000	6433000	These things and we weren't sure what they were for
6433000	6435000	Wasn't some of it for DJ Hero
6435000	6437000	But then some of it never really was explained
6437000	6439000	Yeah
6439000	6441000	Basically they're saying
6441000	6443000	The songs that are licensed so far
6443000	6445000	2012 by J Sean
6445000	6447000	Featuring Nicki Minaj
6447000	6449000	Out of Space by The Prodigy
6449000	6451000	The Way I Are by Timbaland
6451000	6453000	Take Over Control by Afrojack
6455000	6457000	Yeah
6457000	6459000	I don't know what they're going to really do with this
6459000	6461000	I assume it's going to be something similar
6461000	6463000	Like Just Dance or
6463000	6465000	Dance Central
6465000	6467000	Trying to cash in
6467000	6469000	Thanks I hope
6469000	6471000	I hope they ruin this
6471000	6473000	Genre as well
6473000	6475000	Haven't you done enough
6475000	6477000	Bad
6477000	6479000	Interesting comment from Game Guru in our chatroom saying
6479000	6481000	I don't think Activision is following Dance Central
6481000	6483000	They are following Just Dance
6485000	6487000	Okay
6487000	6489000	Those aren't that different
6489000	6491000	Well they aren't
6491000	6493000	But I also kind of see the point that
6493000	6495000	He might be making there with the whole
6495000	6497000	Kind of the style of the games
6497000	6499000	And the way they control
6499000	6501000	Is a little bit different
6501000	6503000	I guarantee this is probably going to be coming out in the fall
6503000	6505000	This year
6505000	6507000	Because they're going to have to have something to fill
6507000	6509000	I mean what if they really announced
6509000	6511000	That they're going to be putting out this year
6511000	6513000	Call of Duty
6513000	6515000	My question is how is it going to be different
6515000	6517000	Because otherwise they're just setting themselves up for the same
6517000	6519000	Goddamn situation
6519000	6521000	That got Guitar Hero canned
6521000	6523000	If they come out at E3 and announce
6523000	6525000	This fucking game
6525000	6527000	They need to say and here's how it's different
6527000	6529000	You better acknowledge your competition
6529000	6531000	And tell us why it's better
6531000	6533000	Otherwise, fuck off
6533000	6535000	For real
6535000	6537000	Our new Guitar Hero game is different because now it has drums
6537000	6539000	And singing
6539000	6541000	I don't care what it is
6541000	6543000	You know Harmonix is bringing Dance Central 2 to E3 this year
6543000	6545000	You know it
6545000	6547000	That's got to be their thing that they're working on now
6547000	6549000	You know that's going to be shown
6549000	6551000	So if you can walk down the hall
6551000	6553000	And see Activision in their little game
6553000	6555000	They better be prepared to say
6555000	6557000	This is how our game is different
6557000	6559000	Otherwise I do not give a fuck
6559000	6561000	And you better bet your ass that Ubisoft is bringing Just Dance
6561000	6563000	To the other consoles this year as well
6563000	6565000	I mean that thing sold out like crazy
6565000	6567000	On the Wii
6567000	6569000	Of course they're going to be bringing it to the connect and the move
6569000	6571000	So they've already got right there two competitors
6571000	6573000	For this genre
6573000	6575000	And whatever Konami is going to just
6575000	6577000	Randomly show too
6577000	6579000	Could be involved in there too
6579000	6581000	Dance Masters exactly sold millions
6581000	6583000	But you never know, Konami, bless their hearts
6583000	6585000	They're still trying
6585000	6587000	They got DDR
6587000	6589000	And props to them though for at least trying Dance Masters
6589000	6591000	What I consider a very Japanese game
6591000	6593000	You know what, you're right
6593000	6595000	Dance Masters is very
6595000	6597000	Different from Dance Central
6597000	6599000	It really is
6599000	6601000	You're not really looking deep
6601000	6603000	At the music game if you pass them both off
6603000	6605000	As the same game
6605000	6607000	Because Dance Masters does function very different
6607000	6609000	The thing that's kind of frustrating about it
6609000	6611000	Is the fact that it's so hard to really kind of
6611000	6613000	Get into, you know what I mean
6613000	6615000	It's just like
6615000	6617000	I guess it's very much like Para where you just
6617000	6619000	Do it
6619000	6621000	And that's it
6621000	6623000	If they had a little bit more structure
6623000	6625000	If they had like an actual tutorial or something
6625000	6627000	To it, it might be better
6627000	6629000	But hey, you know, sequel
6629000	6631000	That'd be kind of cool
6631000	6633000	Alright well Sony Europe
6633000	6635000	Has actually cancelled some games
6635000	6637000	Some of these were dance games
6637000	6639000	Like maybe SingStar, I don't know
6639000	6641000	But unfortunately, I doubt that by the way
6641000	6643000	I'm just trolling
6643000	6645000	But Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
6645000	6647000	Has mentioned to the staffs at Studio Liverpool
6647000	6649000	London Studio, Evolution Studios
6649000	6651000	That they are going to be streamlining
6651000	6653000	And closing various projects
6653000	6655000	To move the development to other
6655000	6657000	Higher priority first party offerings
6657000	6659000	So we're not talking layoffs or anything
6659000	6661000	We're just talking about these little games you are making
6661000	6663000	Yeah, no, no, you need to come
6663000	6665000	But streamlining could lead to layoffs
6665000	6667000	Streamlines of corporate work for layoffs
6667000	6669000	We don't know yet
6669000	6671000	The publisher went on to say
6671000	6673000	Quote, with the incredibly strong list of
6673000	6675000	Exclusive first party titles coming up both
6675000	6677000	This year and in the near future
6677000	6679000	Resources should be reallocated to enhance those projects
6679000	6681000	Closer to completion
6681000	6683000	Maybe they're trying to rush to meet Christmas, I don't know
6683000	6685000	Sony exclusives?
6685000	6687000	Yeah, so who knows
6687000	6689000	Sony didn't say what projects were affected
6689000	6691000	They didn't say anything about layoffs
6691000	6693000	They did reiterate there is no impact
6693000	6695000	In the role that the first party studios play
6695000	6697000	It's just, I guess, moving the resources around
6697000	6699000	Maybe they didn't like that LittleBigPlanet 2
6699000	6701000	Didn't make Christmas because maybe it impacted
6701000	6703000	Sales, I bet it did
6703000	6705000	So maybe they're really stretching
6705000	6707000	To make Christmas this year and they're really just
6707000	6709000	Bringing it home on some of the first party games
6709000	6711000	They're really going to put it all behind
6711000	6713000	Which I could understand that
6713000	6715000	And you know, there are some games
6715000	6717000	When's that Twisted Metal game supposed to come out?
6717000	6719000	Is it this holiday? So they're going to show that again
6719000	6721000	At E3, is it?
6721000	6723000	They have a lot of stuff coming out
6723000	6725000	I mean, that's for sure
6725000	6727000	It's pre-packed first quarter for them
6727000	6729000	And second quarter's starting off pretty strong
6729000	6731000	I mean, they've got
6731000	6733000	First quarter so far, they've had LittleBigPlanet 2
6733000	6735000	They're going to be having
6735000	6737000	Killzone 3
6737000	6739000	DC Universe
6739000	6741000	And PlayStation Move Heroes
6741000	6743000	Will be coming out
6743000	6745000	Possibly
6745000	6747000	Sorcery
6747000	6749000	I think the Eco and Shadow of the Colossus
6749000	6751000	Collection, although both of those
6751000	6753000	I think may have been delayed
6753000	6755000	And then second quarter so far
6755000	6757000	They've got SOCOM 4
6757000	6759000	Motorstorm Apocalypse
6759000	6761000	Infamous 2
6761000	6763000	I mean, I wouldn't say
6763000	6765000	They're definitely putting out their releases
6765000	6767000	So who knows
6767000	6769000	I don't know what they're
6769000	6771000	Uncharted 3
6771000	6773000	They have for the fourth quarter
6773000	6775000	Resistance 3
6775000	6777000	And then
6777000	6779000	I guess
6779000	6781000	Twisted Metal, possibly
6781000	6783000	I wouldn't be surprised if that wouldn't be quarter one of next year
6783000	6785000	Alright
6785000	6787000	Well, let's move on with a couple more stories
6787000	6789000	We'll get to the mailbag here in just a moment
6789000	6791000	But first, Matt2
6791000	6793000	Alright, so for those who are
6793000	6795000	fans of NBA GM
6795000	6797000	Your time with that game might be coming
6797000	6799000	to an end
6799000	6801000	So EA Sports is kind of
6801000	6803000	Going out here and saying there will be no more
6803000	6805000	Roster updates or any type of post
6805000	6807000	Release support for NBA Jam
6807000	6809000	So it's kind of the
6809000	6811000	Up and coming news that
6811000	6813000	NBA Jam is coming to
6813000	6815000	Coming to an end
6815000	6817000	EA has been quoted here
6817000	6819000	The priority for Jam on the 360
6819000	6821000	PS3 was to deliver HD graphics and online
6821000	6823000	Play to round out the
6823000	6825000	Great gameplay that defines the franchise
6825000	6827000	For us to include roster and
6827000	6829000	Title update possibilities
6829000	6831000	Would have been a sacrifice of quality
6831000	6833000	In those key areas and thus made the difficult decision
6833000	6835000	Not to include them
6835000	6837000	So with NBA Jam
6837000	6839000	And their post game
6839000	6841000	Releases as well as roster updates looks like the
6841000	6843000	The franchise is coming to an end
6843000	6845000	This franchise was so badly
6845000	6847000	Mismanaged from the beginning and it's really
6847000	6849000	Sad because it was this whole like
6849000	6851000	Okay, it's only going to come out on the Wii
6851000	6853000	No, just kidding, it's coming on the Playstation 3
6853000	6855000	And the 360 but we're not going to do the
6855000	6857000	Obvious arcade thing and no, it's only
6857000	6859000	Going to be an exclusive
6859000	6861000	With this sub-par basketball game
6861000	6863000	To try and get it to sell extra copies
6863000	6865000	Oh fuck, this basketball game really sucks
6865000	6867000	It's getting cancelled, well shit, now we better
6867000	6869000	Charge like $60 before this, I mean
6869000	6871000	This franchise was horribly
6871000	6873000	Mismanaged from the start
6873000	6875000	Shame on whoever ran this thing
6875000	6877000	I mean, I guess they were trying to think of something outside
6877000	6879000	The box, but you fucked up
6879000	6881000	Yeah, the marketing project manager on this
6881000	6883000	Was streamlined, probably out the door
6883000	6885000	You know what, I hate to say it
6885000	6887000	But they kind of deserve it
6887000	6889000	This was a horribly
6889000	6891000	Mismanaged franchise, this game should have been huge
6891000	6893000	And it should have been on arcade
6893000	6895000	Or it should have been a budget title
6895000	6897000	If this game had been $30, it would have sold
6897000	6899000	Millions of people would have it
6899000	6901000	But of course, you know, classic sport games
6901000	6903000	Like their Madden franchise will still continue to get roster updates
6903000	6905000	And support, because that thing is still on fire
6905000	6907000	And it's got a huge following
6907000	6909000	For the Madden series, so
6909000	6911000	They literally had to bring this game up
6911000	6913000	They had to bump this from a B title
6913000	6915000	To an A title to fill in the gap
6915000	6917000	Of a game that was so fucking terrible
6917000	6919000	They had to can it
6919000	6921000	This game was set up to fail
6921000	6923000	Absolutely set up to fail
6923000	6925000	The time and energy spent to not release it
6925000	6927000	Is definitely a hit in the bottom line
6927000	6929000	So for those fans of NBA Jam
6929000	6931000	Looks like
6931000	6933000	Whatever last copy you have
6933000	6935000	To own or to rent
6935000	6937000	Is the last iteration you're going to have
6937000	6939000	Sell the franchise to someone who knows what to do with it
6939000	6941000	Seriously
6941000	6943000	Konami? You never know
6943000	6945000	I remember playing Double Dribble back in the day
6945000	6947000	Which was pretty sweet
6947000	6949000	We did Blades of Steel, was that Konami as well?
6949000	6951000	Konami knows how to do some pretty sweet sport games
6951000	6953000	They're winning 11s
6953000	6955000	I mean, unfortunately, soccer is not
6955000	6957000	Big here in the US
6957000	6959000	But it's huge everywhere else
6959000	6961000	And that's a huge franchise
6961000	6963000	I just remember playing that game, Blades of Steel
6963000	6965000	The only time that it had
6965000	6967000	Speech in an 8-bit NES game
6967000	6969000	And Ten Yard Rush
6969000	6971000	Ten Yard Dash
6971000	6973000	Ten Yard Rush was the first Nintendo title
6973000	6975000	That was another classic
6975000	6977000	But anyway, NBA Jam
6977000	6979000	Coming to an end
6979000	6981000	Well, we don't know if it's dead
6981000	6983000	They're stopping the roster
6983000	6985000	They're not going to support NBA Jam
6985000	6987000	It doesn't necessarily mean the death of it
6987000	6989000	But it's
6989000	6991000	If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would say Outlook not good
6991000	6993000	Yeah
6993000	6995000	Definitely
6995000	6997000	My gut says it's coming to an abrupt end
6997000	6999000	Sorry to the fans of that game
6999000	7001000	Spaznator in our chatroom at
7001000	7003000	chat.orangelaundry.com says
7003000	7005000	If NBA Jam was either Xbox Live Arcade or PSN
7005000	7007000	I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat, but no such luck
7007000	7009000	I would have done the same thing
7009000	7011000	Lots of people would
7011000	7013000	Where did NBA Jam get its start?
7013000	7015000	In the arcade
7015000	7017000	Even if they had just buffed up
7017000	7019000	The old version with new rosters
7019000	7021000	I would have been all over that
7021000	7023000	I guess maybe the troubling part is
7023000	7025000	Getting the rosters to match the
7025000	7027000	Look and feel of the players
7027000	7029000	Exploited heads and all that
7029000	7031000	If you download something
7031000	7033000	It's an awful lot of content to recreate
7033000	7035000	Visually to someone's exploited head
7035000	7037000	I don't know, it's sad
7037000	7039000	But it's another sporting game that's kind of done
7039000	7041000	TigerKlon, our chatroom says
7041000	7043000	Sell the franchise to Activision? They'll end up releasing
7043000	7045000	New NBA Jams every year
7045000	7047000	At least they'll get maintained, right?
7047000	7049000	We'll see
7049000	7051000	Alright, moving on with some more news
7051000	7053000	Um
7053000	7055000	I don't know
7055000	7057000	We talked a little bit about this
7057000	7059000	How there was a temporary injunction
7059000	7061000	Where
7061000	7063000	LG won against Sony
7063000	7065000	And they got some of the PlayStation 3
7065000	7067000	Shipments held
7067000	7069000	In Europe
7069000	7071000	Sony actually won
7071000	7073000	Overall
7073000	7075000	This was due to a patent dispute
7075000	7077000	And now
7077000	7079000	I guess
7079000	7081000	They're saying that all the C's PlayStations
7081000	7083000	Have been released
7083000	7085000	So um
7085000	7087000	That was quick, and it actually
7087000	7089000	Only took about a day in the courts
7089000	7091000	To settle everything
7093000	7095000	Well that was fast
7095000	7097000	After all that news about like, oh my god
7097000	7099000	It's gonna be a shortage of PlayStation 3
7099000	7101000	Nope, it's done
7101000	7103000	And then on top of all that
7103000	7105000	And here we stop
7105000	7107000	And then on top of all that, LG had to pay legal fees
7107000	7109000	And they got laughed out of court
7109000	7111000	And also they're saying that for each day
7111000	7113000	If LG failed to comply
7113000	7115000	It would be fine
7115000	7117000	The rate of 200,000 euros
7117000	7119000	Ouch
7119000	7121000	Which is still a buck and a half each
7121000	7123000	That's a lot of money
7123000	7125000	That's $275,000 in
7125000	7127000	US dollars
7127000	7129000	I think we might
7129000	7131000	We might actually have some audio from the
7131000	7133000	Proceedings of the trial, let's see here
7133000	7135000	Ah god dammit
7135000	7137000	Somebody bombing on YouTube
7137000	7139000	Never mind
7139000	7141000	I think I did a little bit
7141000	7143000	I was trying to find a clip here
7143000	7145000	Let me see if I can find this
7145000	7147000	Um
7147000	7149000	Okay I think we have a clip here from
7149000	7151000	The trials proceedings here
7151000	7153000	Let's see if we can get this out here
7153000	7155000	What kind of a reliable car are you gonna get
7155000	7157000	For $1,000?
7157000	7159000	And I'm asking you, why didn't you
7159000	7161000	Finish paying your brother for the car?
7161000	7163000	Well judge, what I'm trying to say is
7163000	7165000	That bitch scares me
7165000	7167000	Fucking love Judge Judy
7167000	7169000	She's amazing
7169000	7171000	Did you see the episode with, um
7171000	7173000	She's doing her usual, you know
7173000	7175000	Killing people with her eyes and her nose
7175000	7177000	And someone lit up a cigarette
7177000	7179000	In the audience
7179000	7181000	Not a plaintiff or defendant but an actual audience member
7181000	7183000	Just chilling in the back
7183000	7185000	And she's there going off in her
7185000	7187000	Diablo fire, spewing
7187000	7189000	You want to smell smoke?
7189000	7191000	I smell smoke
7191000	7193000	And some guy in the back
7193000	7195000	Actually pretty well dressed, looked like in a suit
7195000	7197000	Damn courtroom
7197000	7199000	So what kind of cigarette on TV on Judge Judy
7199000	7201000	How random is that
7201000	7203000	She still scares me
7207000	7209000	I'm trying to see if I can find that in this
7209000	7211000	It's not on YouTube
7211000	7213000	It was a random episode that I just had me watching
7213000	7215000	When I was, you know
7215000	7217000	There is this one though
7217000	7219000	What kind of cigarettes did you buy?
7219000	7221000	Marlboro Reds
7221000	7223000	Marlboro Reds
7223000	7225000	Marlboro Reds
7225000	7227000	Marlboro Reds
7229000	7231000	It's my hearing or his speech
7231000	7233000	I'm not sure
7233000	7235000	I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette
7235000	7237000	I don't think I've ever seen the bailiff get sassy
7237000	7239000	Did you hear that? No, it's his speech
7239000	7241000	The bailiff was getting a little sassy
7241000	7243000	I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette before
7243000	7245000	Going to court
7245000	7247000	Anyhow, moving on
7247000	7249000	There is no overturning this ruling
7249000	7251000	If you want to sell your Gameboy
7251000	7253000	Advanced craft to GameStop
7253000	7255000	You better do it quick
7255000	7257000	They're going to stop buying all of this in April
7257000	7259000	So I think right now
7259000	7261000	They will buy a Gameboy Advance
7261000	7263000	For maybe like 20 bucks
7263000	7265000	But come April
7265000	7267000	They will not be buying them anymore
7267000	7269000	April 2nd supposedly is the date that's all happening
7269000	7271000	You can probably blame
7271000	7273000	The 3DS for this
7273000	7275000	Because now everything's kind of kicked back at Generations
7275000	7277000	So there you go
7277000	7279000	There's no new Advanced games
7279000	7281000	Being sold, this isn't really a big surprise anyway
7281000	7283000	Although I will say
7283000	7285000	I thought some GameStops still kind of specialized
7285000	7287000	In selling old shit
7287000	7289000	Like usually in a big city there's at least one GameStop
7289000	7291000	That does kind of still carry the old shit
7291000	7293000	Like the stockpile of NES games
7293000	7295000	I've seen regular GameBoy games for sale
7295000	7297000	At GameStop
7297000	7299000	Are GameStops franchise or corporate owned?
7299000	7301000	Corporate? Corporate
7301000	7303000	But it doesn't mean that you can't
7303000	7305000	Put your GBA up on eBay
7305000	7307000	Oh yeah
7307000	7309000	There's GBA and there's indie stores as well
7309000	7311000	Which by the way the one by my house closed
7311000	7313000	Yeah there used to be an indie store by my house
7313000	7315000	It closed
7315000	7317000	I know, sad
7317000	7319000	Anyhow
7319000	7321000	Let's go to the mailbag
7321000	7323000	Every week you guys send us emails at
7323000	7325000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7325000	7327000	And we like to pick a few of our favorites
7327000	7329000	And read them here live on air
7329000	7331000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7331000	7333000	A very thin emailbag this week
7333000	7335000	I'm very disappointed in all of you
7335000	7337000	Because Loki doesn't look at me during the show
7337000	7339000	So anyway, he's too into his
7339000	7341000	Grand Theft Auto hacking thing
7341000	7343000	Which by the way doesn't seem to be working too well
7343000	7345000	So we've got one email
7345000	7347000	This week that I'm going to read for you guys
7347000	7349000	But it's a good one because it's from Belgium
7349000	7351000	Ja? Ja
7351000	7353000	So this is an email from Belgium
7353000	7355000	Hello good folks at OLR
7355000	7357000	My TV is about to die on me
7357000	7359000	I'll have to buy a new one in the near future
7359000	7361000	Can you give me any advice on what makes a good TV for gaming
7361000	7363000	And watching DVDs on a 360
7363000	7365000	And watching analog cable TV
7365000	7367000	How much milliseconds is good for gaming
7367000	7369000	Contrast, etc.
7369000	7371000	You already seem to know
7371000	7373000	What you're looking for because the delay
7373000	7375000	Is what you're going to want for gaming
7375000	7377000	And the refresh rate on the screen
7377000	7379000	I believe for PC monitors
7379000	7381000	You don't want to go any higher than 4
7381000	7383000	Most monitors now are like 2
7383000	7385000	And I think the TVs are the same way aren't they?
7385000	7387000	2 millisecond refresh
7387000	7389000	Something like that
7389000	7391000	Here's how nerdy I am
7391000	7393000	I use TV as my monitor from my office
7393000	7395000	For my PC computer
7395000	7397000	Playing WoW on that thing is pretty fucking amazing
7397000	7399000	It is slightly orgasmic
7399000	7401000	And videos are nice on it too
7401000	7403000	But definitely look at refresh rates
7403000	7405000	Definitely look at megahertz
7405000	7407000	Refresh rate as well
7407000	7409000	60 or 120
7409000	7411000	High refresh is also preferred as well
7411000	7413000	And keep in mind that the
7413000	7415000	Cheapie TVs right now
7415000	7417000	Only go as high as 720p in HD
7417000	7419000	So definitely look at the pixelage
7419000	7421000	On the TV. Mine only goes as high as
7421000	7423000	1080i because I bought an HDTV
7423000	7425000	Kind of on the cheap when HD technology
7425000	7427000	Was still newish so they cut back
7427000	7429000	Kind of that way
7429000	7431000	So double check that
7431000	7433000	Don't forget to look
7433000	7435000	At the obvious because sometimes
7435000	7437000	They will kind of brush that over
7437000	7439000	To cut a couple hundred dollars. If it's cheap
7439000	7441000	There's probably a reason. Always remember that
7441000	7443000	Definitely 1080p and refresh
7443000	7445000	Rates are probably your two
7445000	7447000	Pieces of information you want to hold up
7447000	7449000	People will tell you though you can't tell the difference
7449000	7451000	Between 1080p and 1080i
7451000	7453000	I kind of beg to differ. I think I can see it a little bit
7453000	7455000	Especially in Blu-rays is where I can see it
7455000	7457000	And also HDMI cables
7457000	7459000	Get the gold plated ones if you can
7459000	7461000	There's a better strength to that
7461000	7463000	At least I've noticed
7463000	7465000	Spaznator PC in our chat room says
7465000	7467000	Vizio is supposedly coming out with a
7467000	7469000	$300 3D HDTV this year
7469000	7471000	See, something's got to be wrong with it
7471000	7473000	Although I don't know. My main TV is Vizio
7473000	7475000	And I've been relatively happy with it
7475000	7477000	For the fact that it doesn't do 1080p
7477000	7479000	Well, I have to look at
7479000	7481000	I paid only $700 for it
7481000	7483000	Several years ago when HDTV
7483000	7485000	Was still kind of new-ish
7485000	7487000	So I can't complain too much
7487000	7489000	My TV monitor in my room is an
7489000	7491000	LG 46 inch
7491000	7493000	I forget the model number
7493000	7495000	It's amazing. While on it plays very well
7495000	7497000	It serves well
7497000	7499000	For monitor use and all that
7499000	7501000	Don't skip
7501000	7503000	On those two parts
7503000	7505000	The resolution and the refresh rate
7505000	7507000	Well, moving on with our email from Belgium
7507000	7509000	There's more to it
7509000	7511000	Also, I ripped the ligaments of my ankle a month ago
7511000	7513000	During a soccer game
7513000	7515000	Yes, sports are healthy
7515000	7517000	Because of this, I'm unable to play any game on Kinect
7517000	7519000	It made me think of the many disabled people
7519000	7521000	Who cannot play movement controlled games
7521000	7523000	Because of their condition
7523000	7525000	When the future of gaming really is Kinect
7525000	7527000	Move, Wii, or whatever will be next
7527000	7529000	I hope there will be a proper alternative
7529000	7531000	For them to play games
7531000	7533000	I think we've mentioned on the show before
7533000	7535000	Gaming can't always 100% be
7535000	7537000	These technologies
7537000	7539000	It's nice to have
7539000	7541000	But it shouldn't always be a necessity
7541000	7543000	I think there will always be
7543000	7545000	Something for that core gamer
7545000	7547000	Who just wants that controller in their hand
7547000	7549000	To play an RPG or a shoot-em-up
7549000	7551000	Whatever it is
7551000	7553000	A good mix is a good thing
7553000	7555000	Or maybe even games that take
7555000	7557000	Disabilities into consideration
7557000	7559000	Would be a great thing
7559000	7561000	There's many ways a person can be disabled
7561000	7563000	And you can't always think of everything
7563000	7565000	But it's always good to see game companies
7565000	7567000	Be at least considerate
7567000	7569000	Especially the big ones
7569000	7571000	Definitely
7571000	7573000	Well, thanks again for making the show every week
7573000	7575000	You guys are awesome
7575000	7577000	Greetings from Fabrice, Belgium
7577000	7579000	Thank you very much
7579000	7581000	Sounds like Febreze
7581000	7583000	Not Febreze, I believe is the name
7583000	7585000	I wonder if we can send the studio some waffles
7585000	7587000	Chocolate
7587000	7589000	Chocolate waffles with chicken
7589000	7591000	And fries, oh my god, Belgian fries
7591000	7593000	Oh my god
7593000	7595000	Road trip
7595000	7597000	No, there's a place in New York City I went to once
7597000	7599000	And there was this restaurant in New York City
7599000	7601000	That just sold nothing but Belgian
7601000	7603000	Like the French fry type thing
7603000	7605000	But like the Belgian big ones
7605000	7607000	And like 20 different kinds of dips for the fries
7607000	7609000	That's the only damn thing this store sold
7609000	7611000	Packed, packed, wall to wall
7611000	7613000	There's actually a place like that in old Sacramento
7613000	7615000	Is there really?
7615000	7617000	There's a lot of toppings or dips
7617000	7619000	Why has my fat ass not been to this place?
7619000	7621000	It sounds amazing
7621000	7623000	Because old Sacramento is touristy and we live here and we don't go there
7623000	7625000	I guess
7625000	7627000	I've been to old SAC before, it's weird
7627000	7629000	They're like Spanish with jalapenos and nacho cheese
7629000	7631000	And they go to France
7631000	7633000	They've got like blue cheese on them and crap like that
7633000	7635000	The only problem I have, I can't believe this email is leading to talk about French fries
7635000	7637000	But whatever, it's orange on the studio, deal with it
7637000	7639000	The thing is that those restaurants
7639000	7641000	Usually like the fries with the dips
7641000	7643000	Half of them are always mayo based
7643000	7645000	Nope, those are out
7645000	7647000	I won't do mayo based things
7647000	7649000	French fries with mayonnaise, disgusting
7649000	7651000	Anything with mayonnaise, disgusting
7651000	7653000	If you've known me for any length of time
7653000	7655000	I hate, hate mayonnaise
7655000	7657000	Good to know
7657000	7659000	I won't be making any type of chicken salad for you for lunch
7659000	7661000	Or put a honey mustard dip in it or something
7661000	7663000	That's not frickin' mayonnaise
7663000	7665000	Anyhow
7665000	7667000	Aw, the chat room's all, you guys are making me hungry
7667000	7669000	Sorry
7669000	7671000	Alright, well I guess maybe
7671000	7673000	The hunger might lead to a little bit of angst
7673000	7675000	Cause I know when I don't eat, I get mad
7675000	7677000	So, uh, it's time for the FUs of the week
7691000	7693000	Moji, start us off tonight
7693000	7695000	Uh, fuck you too
7695000	7697000	The stupid Grant Without a Texture editor
7697000	7699000	It's out there
7699000	7701000	But it doesn't seem to do anything
7701000	7703000	Working or whatever
7703000	7705000	Hate that crap
7705000	7707000	And then, uh
7707000	7709000	Yeah, that's basically it
7709000	7711000	Screw that
7711000	7713000	I waited all this time and it doesn't open anything
7713000	7715000	Well, I'm sure there's something wrong
7715000	7717000	Or it's bugging or something, but I'll figure it out
7717000	7719000	Uh, Matt2?
7719000	7721000	Uh, I'm gonna give you
7721000	7723000	Fuck you to midterms, I've got two of them this week
7723000	7725000	And, uh
7725000	7727000	Yeah, not looking forward to finishing those
7727000	7729000	FU2 income taxes, I'll have to be
7729000	7731000	Finishing those up here soon so I can
7731000	7733000	Mail the check to Uncle Sam and
7733000	7735000	Governor Brown, although it's really good
7735000	7737000	To not say Governorator anymore
7737000	7739000	I will yield to that
7739000	7741000	Um, and FU2Loki's
7741000	7743000	Texture editor thing that I don't understand
7743000	7745000	That he seems pretty angsty about
7745000	7747000	Um, FU to natural disasters
7747000	7749000	Um, because
7749000	7751000	FU Mother Nature
7751000	7753000	Uh, seriously, because, um, yeah, it's just
7753000	7755000	Oh my gosh, I'm really glad that everybody I know
7755000	7757000	Is kinda safe, but unfortunately I know like
7757000	7759000	Thousands of people aren't safe, and that's just
7759000	7761000	It's just really hard to read
7761000	7763000	Because that could really happen anywhere
7763000	7765000	So I just, ugh, very sad
7765000	7767000	So anyway, um
7767000	7769000	There's an FU to that, and I would also say
7769000	7771000	FU to, um, money
7771000	7773000	I don't have enough of it
7773000	7775000	I never do
7775000	7777000	Banks have a lot of issues, kind of go in
7777000	7779000	And ask for it nicely
7779000	7781000	Well, if you put one of those Richard Nixon masks over your face
7781000	7783000	Yes, and offer them a chocolate gun
7783000	7785000	Maybe I could get some money
7785000	7787000	And then they'll give it to you magically
7787000	7789000	Although the pursuing, um,
7789000	7791000	Might go to jail for many years for that
7791000	7793000	The tie-in's something that Loki does often
7793000	7795000	If you get five stars after that bank chase
7795000	7797000	You're fucked
7797000	7799000	Alright, couple more stories for you guys
7799000	7801000	Then we're gonna open up the Skype line
7801000	7803000	At 1877 Game OLR
7803000	7805000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
7805000	7807000	That's not opened yet, but it will be in a moment
7807000	7809000	Yes, um, in case you're wondering why Activision
7809000	7811000	Does what Activision does
7811000	7813000	They pull out year after year
7813000	7815000	It's because they're only encouraged by people
7815000	7817000	That buy those games
7817000	7819000	And this isn't gonna help
7819000	7821000	If you're hoping for the Call of Duty franchise
7821000	7823000	To go away
7823000	7825000	Call of Duty Black Ops is the
7825000	7827000	US's best selling game ever
7827000	7829000	It has beaten everything
7829000	7831000	In only about four months
7831000	7833000	And, uh,
7833000	7835000	That includes also
7835000	7837000	The sales of Wii Play
7837000	7839000	Which Nintendo claims is around 13 million copies
7839000	7841000	I thought this was a down economy
7841000	7843000	Oh my gosh
7843000	7845000	13 million copies of Wii Play
7845000	7847000	Is way too many of that freaking game
7847000	7849000	But even, oh my gosh
7849000	7851000	See, I don't really play the Call of Duty games
7851000	7853000	I can't really hate on them
7853000	7855000	I've seen them played
7855000	7857000	I understand why dudes like them
7857000	7859000	But not a series I personally get into
7859000	7861000	So this is now the best selling game of all time?
7861000	7863000	All time
7863000	7865000	Oh my gosh, that's crazy
7865000	7867000	It really is
7867000	7869000	It really is
7869000	7871000	Halo
7871000	7873000	They sold 5.6 million units day one
7873000	7875000	Bigger than WoW?
7875000	7877000	I guess so
7877000	7879000	Bigger than everything
7879000	7881000	Well, are you counting subscription based
7881000	7883000	Or are you counting true sales of the original and expansions?
7883000	7885000	Well, I don't think you get to combine original and expansions
7885000	7887000	I think you just have to count original, I suppose
7887000	7889000	Yeah, but still
7889000	7891000	It's pretty hot
7891000	7893000	Alright, one more story for you guys
7893000	7895000	And it has to do with rumors
7895000	7897000	What a freaking shock
7897000	7899000	That the rumors are already starting about an
7899000	7901000	Xbox 720 and a Wii 2 announcement
7901000	7903000	At E3
7903000	7905000	Well, it has to do
7905000	7907000	And here's where they're coming from
7907000	7909000	It has to do with some tech demos
7909000	7911000	That Epic is showing about the next gen graphics
7911000	7913000	Because their whole Unreal
7913000	7915000	Engine upgrade and all that
7915000	7917000	The Guardian in the UK
7917000	7919000	Is reporting that there is going to be
7919000	7921000	A Wii 2 that will include a Blu-ray
7921000	7923000	Drive, a quad-core
7923000	7925000	processor, and a built-in LED projector
7925000	7927000	The projector will display
7927000	7929000	gameplay. Isn't this
7929000	7931000	Weren't these the early rumors of the revolution
7931000	7933000	That the 3D was going to be projected
7933000	7935000	Although, funny enough
7935000	7937000	Isn't it funny that we did end up getting
7937000	7939000	3D from Nintendo, it just wasn't
7939000	7941000	The Wii, it was the 3DS
7941000	7943000	The Guardian should not be a source for
7943000	7945000	Anything when it comes to, like, consoles
7945000	7947000	Duh, there's gonna
7947000	7949000	Sequel to successful console?
7949000	7951000	Really? There's gonna be
7951000	7953000	A new console for Nintendo?
7953000	7955000	Woah, I do not see that coming at all
7955000	7957000	I love this too, it's also the
7957000	7959000	Right time because Nintendo does
7959000	7961000	Console announcements every five years
7961000	7963000	The Nintendo 64 in
7963000	7965000	96, the GameCube
7965000	7967000	In 2001, and the Wii
7967000	7969000	In 2006, so surely
7969000	7971000	Loki, surely the time is
7971000	7973000	Right for Wii 2
7973000	7975000	You know, we didn't become the
7975000	7977000	Super game analysts of the world
7977000	7979000	For nothing, so let me just tell you
7979000	7981000	How it's actually done, The Guardian
7981000	7983000	First off
7983000	7985000	They're trying to extend their console
7985000	7987000	Cycles now because, well
7987000	7989000	It sucks making a new console
7989000	7991000	Every few years, and honestly, you know
7991000	7993000	Technology does get better, but I mean
7993000	7995000	Graphics-wise, what are you gonna really push now?
7995000	7997000	And they don't really care about graphics
7997000	7999000	Because they're Nintendo
7999000	8001000	And that would make the price
8001000	8003000	Of their console go up quite a bit
8003000	8005000	Now, not to say that we're not gonna
8005000	8007000	See another Nintendo console
8007000	8009000	That's the Wii, you know, we may see something
8009000	8011000	Like we were saying before, that's kind of a
8011000	8013000	Next step, like, um, you know
8013000	8015000	Like people are saying the Wii HD
8015000	8017000	Or something that may be a little bit
8017000	8019000	More souped up, is it gonna have an
8019000	8021000	LCD projector in it?
8021000	8023000	Probably not, because that's
8023000	8025000	That's stupid, I mean
8025000	8027000	That's just kind of weird
8027000	8029000	It's just ridiculous
8029000	8031000	Why would I need a projector on my console?
8031000	8033000	Project things onto my naked body
8033000	8037000	That's a horrible, horrible thought
8037000	8039000	I have no words
8039000	8041000	Mario could jump up and down on my wang
8041000	8045000	That's one platform-based game right there
8045000	8047000	Oh my god, can you think about the YouTubes
8047000	8049000	That are gonna come from a projected Wii game
8049000	8051000	I mean, it's not like it's that hard
8051000	8053000	To hook up a console to a projector
8053000	8055000	I mean, you can walk into Fry's and buy a projector
8055000	8057000	My buddy's done it before with an Xbox original
8057000	8059000	He had Mario jump on his wang?
8059000	8061000	No, he's hooking up an L
8061000	8063000	He took an LCD projector
8063000	8065000	And respective cables and components
8065000	8067000	And was able to project the image
8067000	8069000	Of the game on a blank wall
8069000	8071000	But that's because we had to take down posters
8071000	8073000	So a projector is gonna need space
8073000	8075000	Blank canvas to work on
8075000	8077000	It's not gonna happen
8077000	8079000	No, that's dumb
8079000	8081000	I'm sorry
8081000	8083000	No, they're not gonna do that
8083000	8085000	And a quad-core processor
8085000	8087000	Or something like that
8087000	8089000	Really? Really?
8089000	8091000	A quad-core processor?
8091000	8093000	Is that what you think
8093000	8095000	The fastest thing is out there?
8095000	8097000	I mean, shit
8097000	8099000	The fucking 360 has more cores than that
8099000	8101000	Nintendo's main release
8101000	8103000	I think this year is not the Wii 2
8103000	8105000	Or the Wii Squared, it is the 3DS
8105000	8107000	And that's what they're gonna stick to
8107000	8109000	They don't need to
8109000	8111000	They don't need to even think about a new console
8111000	8113000	Until their system starts becoming number one
8113000	8115000	The Wii is still popular
8115000	8117000	It's releasing decent games
8117000	8119000	They're still playing it
8119000	8121000	The 3DS is gonna continue that
8121000	8123000	Now the thought is, of course, that they may want to try to get the jump
8123000	8125000	On the next generation
8125000	8127000	Because the 360 did have that jump
8127000	8129000	And they did pretty well
8129000	8131000	I don't know
8131000	8133000	They're just not gonna do some sort of Blu-ray
8133000	8135000	Crazy
8135000	8137000	They don't need to
8137000	8139000	For one, Sony owns Blu-rays
8139000	8141000	That'd be kinda weird
8141000	8143000	Well, I still think that the next-gen consoles
8143000	8145000	Especially on the 360
8145000	8147000	Or you're gonna see something that's not a DVD drive
8147000	8149000	They have to because of the capacity
8149000	8151000	Yeah, because you just can't
8151000	8153000	Did they always say
8153000	8155000	Never to use projectors with games
8155000	8157000	It was always the first line in the various instruction manuals
8157000	8159000	Yeah, because of burn-in
8159000	8161000	But that's just old-school projectors
8161000	8163000	And even still
8163000	8165000	You're not gonna want to do that
8165000	8167000	Because old-school projectors
8167000	8169000	Nowadays, there's still some latency for that
8169000	8171000	But no
8171000	8173000	Why would you even have a fucking projector
8173000	8175000	On a console? That makes no sense
8175000	8177000	Like I said
8177000	8179000	To project Mario onto my naked body
8179000	8181000	It's seriously some guy making a story
8181000	8183000	The cell tabloid
8183000	8185000	The guardian
8185000	8187000	Spaznator in our chatroom says
8187000	8189000	Sky, that's a mental picture I seriously didn't need
8189000	8191000	Thank you
8191000	8193000	Is it possible to bleach a mental picture out of one's mind?
8193000	8195000	Yes, just pour the bleach into your ears
8195000	8197000	I don't know, let me ask you here
8197000	8199000	Hold on
8199000	8201000	And now I present a little bit of Mario
8201000	8203000	Jumping on my wang
8203000	8205000	Hold on, let's see if I can
8205000	8207000	Project Mario here
8207000	8209000	Jumping on my wang
8211000	8213000	Really don't
8215000	8217000	Ow!
8219000	8221000	Did he jump on a ball?
8221000	8223000	That was like the shittiest NES rip of a game
8223000	8225000	It really was
8225000	8227000	No, but seriously
8227000	8229000	If they're gonna do something with their next
8229000	8231000	Or Wii
8231000	8233000	The next Wii or whatever
8233000	8235000	It's gonna be just kind of an HD upgrade
8235000	8237000	I don't even think it would need to be necessarily
8237000	8239000	On
8239000	8241000	You know, non-DVD
8241000	8243000	Platform, because right now
8243000	8245000	Fuck, they are not even really using dual layer
8245000	8247000	There's like two games that use dual layer DVDs
8247000	8249000	For the Wii
8249000	8251000	There's no real need to do that
8251000	8253000	In order for the Wii to be competitive
8253000	8255000	Like for like, you need to
8255000	8257000	Throw in blu-ray capacity and some type of
8257000	8259000	Body-sensing motion device
8259000	8261000	Because that's what the two consoles have right now
8261000	8263000	As Rob Giggles, like a little school girl
8263000	8265000	So, what is the Wii
8265000	8267000	Squared to, whatever
8267000	8269000	Maybe it's not a projector, maybe it's like a
8269000	8271000	A wang
8271000	8273000	Well, then they're already on par with
8273000	8275000	Their competition, they'd have to exceed
8275000	8277000	Their competition
8277000	8279000	Now, this is getting off of Star Trek for me
8279000	8281000	But if they did some type of holography or hologram
8281000	8283000	Or something like that instead of a projection
8283000	8285000	Then they'd have something, but again, what would you use it for?
8285000	8287000	No, it's The Guardian
8287000	8289000	They're not really newsworthy
8289000	8291000	It's entertaining, although if they named the Xbox
8291000	8293000	Second iteration the 720
8293000	8295000	Really?
8295000	8297000	No, it's what everybody wants to call it
8297000	8299000	They're gonna call it something cool and hip
8299000	8301000	Well, I'll tell you what an awesome name would be, The Bacon
8301000	8303000	They just call it The Xbox Bacon
8303000	8305000	Who doesn't love bacon?
8305000	8307000	Want to come over and play with bacon? Fuck yeah!
8307000	8309000	I don't know if they should really call
8309000	8311000	The sequel of a console that had issues with heat
8311000	8313000	Baking
8313000	8315000	Not a good thing
8315000	8317000	They called a
8317000	8319000	The most popular console in America right now
8319000	8321000	Is called The Wii
8321000	8323000	That's what little girls do when they sit on the toilet
8323000	8325000	They Wii
8327000	8329000	I remember the commercials when it came out
8329000	8331000	Those two creepy HD guys would come up
8331000	8333000	We would like to play? I'm like, whoa
8333000	8335000	This game's for pedophiles or something like that
8335000	8337000	This console's a little bit weird
8337000	8339000	And then it was motion controlled
8339000	8341000	And hilarity ensued
8341000	8343000	What would you call the red ring of death
8343000	8345000	On a console called bacon?
8345000	8347000	I don't know, there's got to be some type of
8347000	8349000	Joke there someplace, it's not coming to me
8349000	8351000	There would never be a ring or red
8351000	8353000	On any Microsoft console
8353000	8355000	Going forward
8355000	8357000	A Jewish Xbox
8357000	8359000	This Xbox is kosher
8363000	8365000	It's made by Jewish monks
8365000	8367000	I tease because I love, come on people
8367000	8369000	I guess I could say something about
8369000	8371000	There is job postings at Microsoft
8371000	8373000	Looking for hardware engineers
8373000	8375000	To quote, define and deliver next
8375000	8377000	Generation console architectures
8377000	8379000	Well, no shit they're making a new Xbox
8379000	8381000	Doesn't mean it's coming out of E3 this year
8381000	8383000	These things are going to be like
8383000	8385000	Four years out, you know, it'll be a while
8385000	8387000	So
8387000	8389000	Do you think Apple is rumored to
8389000	8391000	Release some type of a gaming console?
8391000	8393000	That's a lot of buzz in the whole Apple world
8393000	8395000	What I think they're going to do is
8395000	8397000	Yes, it's called the iPad
8397000	8399000	The gaming console, come on people
8399000	8401000	That's retarded, first off
8401000	8403000	Oh goody, I get to plug an HDMI cable
8403000	8405000	Into my iPad and be tethered to my TV
8405000	8407000	No thanks
8407000	8409000	Oh, and I'm sure that
8409000	8411000	Cable cost you $40 to make
8411000	8413000	Fuckers
8413000	8415000	Oh, my mistake, $30
8415000	8417000	Well that totally makes sense, a piece of cable
8417000	8419000	That's like a few
8419000	8421000	Feet long, what, like six
8421000	8423000	Six feet?
8423000	8425000	I remember the size, it was $29.99 for the
8425000	8427000	HD adapter thing to send
8427000	8429000	And 1080p
8429000	8431000	From the pad
8431000	8433000	To a compatible
8433000	8435000	TV
8435000	8437000	So I'm going to credit AkumaJP in our chatroom for this comment
8437000	8439000	But perhaps this could be the sequel to
8439000	8441000	The Nintendo Wii, could be this
8441000	8443000	Sitting on the toilet
8443000	8445000	Sitting on the toilet
8445000	8447000	Sitting on the toilet
8447000	8449000	Sitting on the toilet
8449000	8451000	Sitting on the toilet
8451000	8453000	Sitting on the toilet
8453000	8455000	Sitting on the toilet
8455000	8457000	Sitting on the toilet
8457000	8459000	Sitting on the toilet
8459000	8461000	She's an awfully jolly lady
8461000	8463000	Sitting on the toilet
8463000	8465000	Wait, best part's coming out
8465000	8467000	Flushing? Yep
8467000	8469000	You're joking right, I've never seen this before
8469000	8471000	Here comes the punchline
8471000	8473000	Wait for it
8473000	8475000	Sitting on the toilet
8475000	8477000	Sitting on the toilet
8477000	8479000	Sitting on the toilet
8479000	8481000	Yeah, FLUSH!
8485000	8487000	The Nintendo Flush, this year at E3.
8487000	8489000	It's videos like that that keep me gay.
8494000	8496000	Rob, why do you do this to me? I thought we were friends.
8496000	8498000	It was the chatters! The chatters said it!
8498000	8500000	But you played it!
8500000	8502000	It's every gamer has a voice, even that lady.
8503000	8507000	Now she's one of those challenge people that probably couldn't use the Kinect.
8507000	8509000	Yeah, the Kinect.
8509000	8513000	Because she'd be sitting on the toilet and have minimal body movement for the Kinect.
8515000	8517000	Oh lord.
8517000	8519000	I have to go home and favorite that now.
8519000	8521000	It's pretty awesome.
8521000	8523000	Spread it around.
8523000	8525000	You gotta admit.
8525000	8531000	I was trying to find the 8-bit remix of that song to prove that she plays video games, but I don't know.
8531000	8533000	I guess it's not on YouTube anymore. Whatever.
8533000	8536000	Anyhow, I guess we can open up the Skype line now and take some calls.
8536000	8540000	1-877-GAMO-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8540000	8544000	Give us a call. We'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.
8544000	8548000	Hopefully it's gaming-related, but if you want to talk about sitting on the toilet, then more power to you.
8548000	8550000	So the phones are open right now. Let's take some calls.
8550000	8552000	We'd rather you didn't talk about sitting on the toilet.
8552000	8554000	That's true. So let's go to some calls.
8554000	8556000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8556000	8560000	This is that one, Akke Ripper from Sweden.
8560000	8563000	What's up, Akke Ripper? I haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?
8563000	8571000	Yeah, well, I have been away. Oh, no, I haven't been away. I've just been sleeping like when you're on.
8571000	8573000	Unfortunately.
8573000	8575000	No worries. What's on your mind tonight?
8575000	8581000	What was I going to say? Well, I could talk about Dragon Age 2, which I have already finished.
8581000	8582000	Ah, what do you think?
8582000	8584000	It's marvelous.
8584000	8597000	Once again, to the minor story behind it, well, I got it on Wednesday, and I got it pretty early because it locked up.
8597000	8601000	It was unlocked at midnight to Thursday, my time.
8601000	8610000	So what is it? At 3 o'clock Wednesday, your time, I think it is, and got unlocked.
8610000	8623000	And like 40 or 50 hours later, I beat it. It was quite nice, really. It's thumbs up.
8623000	8624000	Do you recommend it?
8624000	8627000	I do recommend it highly.
8627000	8629000	How was the lovemaking?
8629000	8631000	How was the lovemaking?
8631000	8636000	It was quite nice, I do say.
8636000	8640000	It was quite nice, from what I see.
8640000	8641000	It's a nice.
8641000	8643000	It's quite a nice.
8643000	8650000	But here's the other thing though. Since really I almost, but here's the other thing.
8650000	8656000	Well, I did make love to one of the characters, but here's the other thing though.
8656000	8672000	Since really, really, really, these love scenes in both Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins and Origins 1 is awkward beyond fucking awkward.
8672000	8679000	It's like, I don't even want to see, I close my eyes.
8679000	8690000	No! No! Really? Really? What the hell?
8690000	8692000	Just no, no.
8692000	8696000	This is the best video game review we've ever had on this show.
8696000	8699000	I'm glad to be here, present for this.
8699000	8709000	But other than that, it really is a kick-ass game.
8709000	8721000	Unfortunately a bit shorter than the first Origins, but it's on par with Mass Effect 2.
8721000	8725000	And maybe even longer than Mass Effect 2 on second thought.
8725000	8735000	Well, I would say really bi. And most of the, and also, it really makes up for one of the, yeah, how the fuck will they continue this?
8735000	8748000	Even though, one of the comments that I found on Twitter is that the whole story in Dragon Age 2 is like a origin story, if that makes sense.
8748000	8752000	Overall, yeah, so thumbs up.
8752000	8759000	Also, Tactics Orger has finally been released, and that's quite funny.
8759000	8769000	Also, on side notes, as usual, I play as a girl character, because I don't, because here's the other thing though.
8769000	8781000	I don't even like playing as a male character, because, well, hello, I'm one of those trannies, whatever, that's not, that, if I even would choose.
8781000	8785000	I don't even want to be a man, and I don't want to be a girl, either.
8785000	8791000	That doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with it though, because I like to play, like all of my characters in World of Warcraft are women,
8791000	8796000	and that's just because people are nicer to you, because they think you have big boobs sitting there behind the monitor.
8796000	8799000	I just, it's totally like selfish reasons, like, you know.
8799000	8817000	Yeah, well, in a way. Also, in a kind of way, there are, I should point out also, I play, as usual, I play, I was on the difficulty settings of casual,
8817000	8822000	which means that I, in one way, breezed it through, and was all like, yeah, yeah, whatever.
8822000	8833000	But here's the other thing though, even though if you play on casual, you will actually have minor problems on two places though.
8833000	8849000	Which I did have problems on two places, but after all I did some thoughts on two things, and was like, yeah, it's not that hard, really.
8849000	8854000	But it will be kind of hard in some places.
8854000	8861000	Well, I don't blame you for playing on the easiest level. I've been playing Torchlight on the easiest level, because I just want to, you know, jam through the game and kind of see everything that's there.
8861000	8867000	But, you know, sometimes you just want to kind of take in the story, or in some cases, get straight to the lovemaking.
8867000	8890000	Yeah, but also, since I've seen the ending to Dragon Age 2, it makes me actually want to replay origins, so my warden can make love to a certain character,
8890000	8898000	so to set up certain things in Origins 2.
8898000	8902000	You have to go back and get the right characters to fall in love so that the lovemaking can continue in 2 now.
8902000	8903000	Or the STDs.
8903000	8907000	Yeah, can you pass the STDs from one game to another? Alright, forget it.
8907000	8912000	Alright, Ate Ripper, to be quite honest, I don't ever want this call to end, but I've got people...
8912000	8923000	Yeah, also, before I go, there has been released a new trailer for apparently two expansions on Sims games.
8923000	8924000	Ah, yes.
8924000	8942000	One apparently animal expansion for the console version, and then we have, like, what is it, Sims 3 Pets or something, and then you have some Sims 3 Generations, which is apparently for the PC version.
8942000	8950000	Unfortunately, though, there has been no signs of weather effects, which is a bit sad, because I do want weather effects.
8950000	8962000	But here's the other thing, though. It makes interesting, because, well, raising kids in Sims is quite fun, and with this expansion, it will expand that.
8962000	8966000	Do you think there will be a Sims 4 anytime soon?
8966000	8970000	Not likely. Not that it seems so.
8970000	8985000	Also, side note, they don't say any date for the Generations 1, but for the animal expansion on console, it's at November 2011.
8985000	8986000	Alright.
8986000	8987000	So, um...
8987000	8988000	Yeah.
8988000	8994000	Alright. Well, Ate Ripper, I gotta let you go so I can get to some of the calls, because I got people from PAX East that are just dying to get through.
8994000	8995000	Yeah, well...
8995000	8998000	Honestly, you need to have a video game review podcast. You need to think about it.
8998000	9000000	Oh, well, well. Oh, well.
9000000	9002000	Later on! Take care, buddy!
9002000	9003000	Yeah, later.
9003000	9004000	Bye.
9004000	9006000	Where is he from again?
9006000	9007000	Sweden.
9007000	9008000	I'm going to Sweden.
9008000	9015000	You know, and here's the thing. He hasn't called us in quite a long time, because, you know, it's like, freaking what? Like, they're eight, nine hours ahead of us right now?
9015000	9016000	At least nine.
9016000	9022000	I don't know how Daylight Savings kind of plays that. So it's like four or five o'clock in the morning over there right now, so I can't blame him for not staying up every week to listen to OLR.
9022000	9023000	Word.
9023000	9027000	God damn, that was worth it. Alright, that was worth the wait.
9027000	9038000	Alright, I'm going to do a rare outbound call, because I promised these guys they could get through, and it's about PAX East, so I want to do this call real quick if I can.
9038000	9044000	Sorry to those folks trying to get through right now, but I did promise this call, because I want to talk to at least one person that went to PAX East this week.
9044000	9047000	We'll do some more incoming calls in a minute. Just hold on. Hold on, guys.
9047000	9058000	By the way, a question in the chatroom if I've played Mortal Kombat. Hey, hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.
9058000	9064000	Hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9064000	9068000	Hey, it's DJ Rama S and DDR Dollar Bill.
9068000	9074000	Hey, you guys. Some of our regular callers here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know you guys went to PAX East, right?
9074000	9075000	Yeah.
9075000	9078000	So fucking tell us about it. What happened? What'd you see?
9078000	9083000	It was great, but Rob, before we continue, there's one thing you need to know.
9083000	9084000	What?
9084000	9090000	Yeah. The anime title, FLCL, is called Fully Coolie.
9090000	9097000	Oh, my bad. I'm just, I'm not, you know, cultured enough to know these things. I'm sorry.
9097000	9098000	I knew that.
9098000	9100000	It's okay, we forgive you.
9100000	9101000	Alright.
9101000	9106000	I've learned something here on the show tonight. Tell me about PAX East already. I don't care about that damn anime.
9106000	9108000	Okay, Rob.
9108000	9109000	Yes.
9109000	9110000	I played the 3DS.
9110000	9111000	Yes.
9111000	9112000	It's fucking awesome. Yes.
9112000	9120000	Even though, okay, let me ask this question now, because I've been, you know, I said ever since E3, I was like, dude, the minute you play one, it will sell you one.
9120000	9128000	Like, it almost violates that golden rule of gaming, that the system is only as good as the games that are on it, because seriously, does it even matter that the games are subpar right now?
9128000	9131000	Nope. Doesn't matter at all.
9131000	9139000	It's the technology, right? The first time you see it, it's kind of, did you do that thing where you looked at it and then you went, whoa, whoa, this is like real.
9139000	9154000	Yeah. And the funny thing is, back where I used to live, when I used to get my monthly bus passes, they actually had a 3D effect similar to the 3DS screen, so I was automatically used to it.
9154000	9156000	Right. So what did you get to play on it?
9156000	9159000	The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.
9159000	9160000	And what did you think?
9160000	9176000	It was great. Now, here's something, I don't know if you've covered it, because the stream was dropping for us as we were traveling, but when you play with, when you grab the slingshot, you can actually move the 3DS around for targeting in the game.
9176000	9178000	Oh, see, these are some of like the new features from this entire game.
9178000	9184000	Oh, well, that's it. I have to totally buy this rehash of a 64 game, because they have motion controls now.
9184000	9186000	Oh.
9186000	9188000	It's different.
9188000	9196000	Damn, Loki. Who put the hater in your tree today, man? Dang, oh.
9196000	9205000	He's been hating for a couple of weeks now. It's all right. But yet, did you hear the part where he's ordered both a Japanese and an American 3DS?
9205000	9208000	I don't blame him because of region locking, so you know.
9208000	9215000	Yeah. So, what else was there? I heard Children of Eden was there, and I hear it's like amazing. Did you guys play it?
9215000	9221000	I didn't, but Alpha Kanabran, he was like, it was amazing. Yeah.
9221000	9224000	And that look was like fucking orgasm.
9224000	9228000	I want to know more about it. Well, how did the show compare to last year?
9228000	9238000	It was, in a way, kind of felt like last year was a little bit better, but on the same token, it was just oh so much to see, you know?
9238000	9239000	Yeah.
9239000	9245000	It was like, Exo Hall was twice as large, tabletop gaming was twice as huge, you know?
9245000	9246000	Wow.
9246000	9255000	And it was a lot more, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, the number one horned out game at this con.
9255000	9257000	Of course.
9257000	9262000	Of course. Of course everybody's going to be playing that. Did you check out the classic gaming room while you were there?
9262000	9266000	Yeah, I got in there for a little bit. It had all of your favorite games in there, too.
9266000	9271000	Awesome. What about panels? Did you spend any time going to a panel or anything?
9271000	9281000	I went to the video game music panels. I went to one about OC Remix, where two of the composers did live the opening to Final Fantasy VI.
9281000	9283000	Oh, that's hot.
9283000	9284000	Yeah.
9284000	9286000	Was that as awesome as it sounds?
9286000	9287000	Say what?
9287000	9289000	Was that as awesome as it sounds?
9289000	9293000	Much better. I recorded it. Instead of getting a chance, I'm going to throw it up on YouTube.
9293000	9299000	Nice. Very cool. Alright, so what was the best thing about PAX East altogether?
9299000	9302000	Oh, man. That's a lot.
9302000	9311000	That's a lot. I mean, I went just for two things. The 3DS and Duke Nukem Forever. Got my play. It was great.
9311000	9315000	What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?
9315000	9317000	What was what?
9317000	9319000	What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?
9319000	9328000	It was fucking win. I mean, you start out in a football field punching people so you get the weapon and you start blowing shit up.
9328000	9330000	Was there titties?
9330000	9335000	Real life titties, yes. Oh, yeah.
9335000	9342000	Wait, are we talking about Duke Nukem Forever still, or are we talking about like you just saw titties in the expo hall, like randomly?
9342000	9346000	I'm talking about the booth babes, my brother. The booth babes.
9346000	9350000	Of course, the booth babes. Nice.
9350000	9354000	Well, anything else you want to get out about PAX East before I get to more calls?
9354000	9364000	It was fun. It's worth it to come because as we were hanging out Saturday night, the way it was laid out, it was like not really stressful.
9364000	9373000	This kind of revitalizes the reason why I go to conventions and also there was no appointment per se set up for demos.
9373000	9381000	You could email them and they will email you back if you want a time to come in to check out particular products and games.
9381000	9389000	But even though I was pressed, you had to wait just like everybody else except on Saturday where you're allowed in an hour early.
9389000	9395000	Alright, that's cool. That's cool. I'm glad to hear it because we were getting a little worried on some of the things we heard, but I guess they were just rumors.
9395000	9400000	Last I could have heard was not exactly true. That's the problem.
9400000	9406000	Alright. Well, one other thing I want to ask. Did you guys catch, what was the last Omegathon game this year? I haven't heard yet.
9406000	9414000	We couldn't do that because we had to drop off Misty and Alpha Kinanagram at the train station and the airports.
9414000	9420000	Aw, bummer. Alright. Well, maybe somebody in chat will yell it out. I'm sure it's going to hit the internet somewhere.
9420000	9422000	O-L-R invasion next year.
9422000	9434000	Next year, PAX East 2012, O-L-R-Con. It's going to be you, me, Dark Sakura, Loki, TDR Dollar Bill, Misty, Alpha Kinanagram, Zaku, the whole crew.
9434000	9442000	We're getting a suite. We're getting some alcohol. We're bringing the 360s. We're going to jury rig the TV. We're going to get our gaming on.
9442000	9445000	And boobs. Hell yeah.
9445000	9452000	Alright. Well, you guys have fun. Be safe on your drive back and thanks for letting me bug you even though you're on the show every week anyway, Rama.
9452000	9455000	Hahahaha. Love you too, man.
9455000	9463000	Later, DDR Dollar Bill. Drive safe. I said later, DDR Dollar Bill too. Drive safe, you guys. Later.
9463000	9466000	Awesome. Let's get some more calls.
9466000	9472000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? It's Zaku here. Hey, Zaku, buddy. What's on your mind?
9472000	9478000	Yup. I, too, also went to PAX with Adam. Awesome. Also known as Rama.
9478000	9488000	I mean, yeah, sure, it was my first PAX, but at least I was able to pull off a decent trip to Boston.
9488000	9494000	Even though it was like, the way I see it is, what the fuck?
9494000	9499000	It's all good. What did you think of PAX East? What did you play?
9499000	9507000	Yeah, I mean, I did try to partake in most of the things on the show floor, but the lines were too long.
9507000	9515000	There was no way I was going to spend two hours waiting to see what's inside the LA Nor booth, let alone the Battlefield 3 one.
9515000	9525000	By the way, just quickly, I know Adam for a fact that he endured whatever he did to see the 3DS, but it was almost E3-like.
9525000	9529000	Where the lines would just stretch literally around the booth.
9529000	9536000	That's the only turn off, and I guess it's part of the fact that PAX is pretty much like a poor man's E3.
9536000	9539000	Was there just too damn many people?
9539000	9552000	Pretty much. Compared to all the other cons I've been to, even the ones I've been to in the Javits Center in New York, this was by far one of the largest I've ever been to.
9552000	9559000	Well, the East Coast sadly doesn't get a lot, so I'm not surprised at all that everybody comes in.
9559000	9576000	PAX does fill that void for folks that can't actually make it out to E3, so it's creating that whole experience, that experience itself, without having to go on the other side of the country.
9576000	9585000	But more to my point, I did cosplay on Saturday, and I'm just trying to upload the picture I took personally.
9585000	9591000	I mean, I post for several pictures, some for media, but I didn't make Kotaku's roll. But I'll upload mine.
9591000	9598000	Well, let me ask you quickly, I want to take it back to the games a little bit. Even though the lines were long, I'm assuming you got your hands on some things, right?
9598000	9605000	Yeah, some. I wouldn't say a lot, but it's like, I was just hanging, you know, just going from some booths.
9605000	9608000	What did you play that's worth talking about right now?
9608000	9613000	Oh man, I can't even think off the top of my head. Homefront. Homefront, yeah.
9613000	9615000	And how was that?
9615000	9624000	Pretty much, that's definitely one thing I'm going to buy on Tuesday. Well, for PC that is, but the 360 version is just as good.
9624000	9631000	That was what I was able to get my hands on without having to wait hours in line.
9631000	9643000	Most of the major titles there, they were, you know, it's like, you're going to spend hours just going through two or three of them, and that's going to cut into most of your day on the show floor.
9643000	9646000	Did you get to do any other of the sights and sounds of E3 that wasn't just the...
9646000	9647000	Yeah, I went to the harmonics panel.
9647000	9648000	Oh, how was that?
9648000	9652000	Saturday. It was pretty good, I mean, you know, I managed that.
9652000	9656000	Did they comment on the whole sale from MTV and all that?
9656000	9671000	No, it was just like, well, what they did was like a reverse Q&A where they actually, you know, where the panel asked questions to, you know, the fans that lined up to speak.
9671000	9685000	So, I was basically asked a question on, you know, how to deal with like asshole, you know, fans that complain about some of the most obvious and like unrealistic things about the game.
9685000	9692000	And so I had to, you know, I was basically asked my opinion on those, you know, on that particular subject.
9692000	9693000	What did you say?
9693000	9702000	So, I managed to relate it to the DDR scene, well, my local DDR scene, and I pretty much like got a pretty good ovation out of it.
9702000	9703000	Props to you, buddy.
9703000	9708000	I know, if it was recorded live, I'm pretty sure my comment was up there.
9708000	9713000	You know, if the panel, you know, mentions a military zombie, that was me.
9713000	9715000	So, are you going back to PAX next year?
9715000	9724000	Yeah, I mean, this time I have to stay in, you know, I have to stay in the hotel right next to the con, but yeah, I'll definitely do it.
9724000	9732000	It's just that I may have to like go, I may have to take that day off, you know, that Friday off just to get my hands on the show early.
9732000	9738000	I'd take a whole week off to go to E3, although I'm probably not going this year, but yeah, it's a lot, so.
9738000	9744000	Alright, well, Zacko, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even if you can get your hands on all the good stuff.
9744000	9746000	Sounds like you found a few gems in there somewhere, so.
9746000	9747000	Yep, sure did.
9747000	9749000	Alright, well, hopefully, see you next year.
9749000	9750000	Definitely.
9750000	9751000	Alright, later.
9751000	9752000	Bye.
9752000	9754000	I need to make a whole to-do of it and just go out to the East Coast.
9754000	9756000	You're a fan of New York City, right, Matt, too?
9756000	9758000	I know you love to go out to New York City and all that.
9758000	9759000	Absolutely.
9759000	9767000	We have a lot of listeners out in New York City, and I've gone out there a couple times and done like meetups, and we had some nice like Dave and Buster's fun, and did some random things out in the city, it's cool.
9767000	9769000	Yeah, New York is good, and it's expensive.
9769000	9771000	We'll go to PAX East next year, don't you want to go to Boston and play some games?
9771000	9772000	Baston?
9772000	9773000	Baston?
9773000	9775000	I have never been to Baston before, to walk in the park.
9775000	9776000	Baston is fun.
9776000	9783000	I went to Baston, I went with somebody who went to college there, say did some schooling there, so he knew the area pretty well, and we had fun.
9783000	9788000	Boston's actually on one of my lists of cities to see in the East, but yeah, New York is a lot of fun.
9788000	9795000	1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLawninsRadio, what the hell, we usually only do three, but I'm feeling generous tonight, let's do one more call.
9795000	9801000	While we wait for a call, oh, call's coming in right now, I guess we'll go to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLawninsRadio, who's this?
9801000	9803000	Hi, this is Baston here.
9803000	9805000	Hey buddy, what's on your mind?
9805000	9813000	Just to be different this week, rather than talking about videos, I'll be touching on MMOs this time.
9813000	9815000	Alright, MMOs.
9815000	9828000	Yeah, specifically two of them, DC Universe Online and Final Fantasy XI, mainly because you guys kind of touched on them earlier.
9828000	9857000	Well, one thing that wasn't mentioned that is kind of interesting is that supposedly, at least with DC Universe Online, sometime within the near future, I think within the next month or two, there's going to be a digital download version appearing on the PSN store.
9857000	9868000	And I had heard of that, that they're going to do a full digital download, which wouldn't be too unrealistic. I mean, Xbox 360 does something similar already with some of the games, and I believe PlayStation has a handful of games you can buy.
9868000	9872000	I want to say one of them was day and date of Street Release.
9872000	9876000	World of Warcraft's latest expansion was full digital download as well, which was awesome.
9876000	9887000	Hell, PC thrives on digital download. Hello Steam. I mean, Steam is like PC gaming right now. It's a big chunk of it, so I'm kind of not surprised all PS3 is going in that direction.
9887000	9896000	DC Universe Online is a Sony online entertainment, so it's another branch of the same company, same family, so not surprised at all by that news, but neat.
9896000	9909000	Yeah, well, some doing that has its ups and downs depending on how you look at it. On one hand, yeah, there's the convenience factor, no doubt about that.
9909000	9929000	At least with the beta that went on, granted, it was beta not the full retail releases, obviously there's going to be differences, but at least with the beta, that was a pretty freaking huge file.
9929000	9934000	I mean, it was like, what, ballpark figure of 15 gigabytes?
9934000	9936000	It was huge.
9936000	9961000	Yeah, and even if you got a pretty hefty hard drive inside your system, there's still a good chunk of your hard drive dedicated to one game, but hopefully most PS3 owners have already, at least at $1.40, already upgraded their hard drive at least once.
9961000	9964000	So what did you want to say on Final Fantasy XIV?
9964000	9966000	Well, actually 11, not 14.
9966000	9968000	Oops, sorry, 11.
9968000	9983000	Yeah, well, you know how you were mentioning that, at least temporarily speaking, that they're going to be shutting down the servers for the game because of the recent earthquake?
9983000	9984000	Right.
9984000	9999000	Well, just prior to that earthquake hitting, they had made an announcement that they're already going to be consolidating some of the servers.
9999000	10019000	Uh oh, that's usually the sign for the MMO that things are going downhill, but you know what though, come on, Final Fantasy XI's had a good run, and Sony did kind of probably siphon some of the players with a release of 14, kind of cannibalized 11 a little bit.
10019000	10030000	Yeah, well, I hate to mention a rival podcast, but this is where I got the information from.
10030000	10052000	There's a podcast that's dedicated to Final Fantasy XI called Limit Break Radio, and they had a very small podcast, their most recent entry for that show on their website.
10052000	10081000	The main host had mentioned that the first time they consolidate the servers, there was a need for it, then yeah, they could see what they did, but the second round of consolidation of servers, they don't see what the logic behind that was because once this new round of consolidation goes through,
10081000	10098000	the servers would probably actually be overpopulated, and for those trying to do the end game kind of thing, it's going to be a lot more difficult for those people because the competition for the mobs and...
10098000	10110000	They might be worried that they're going to hemorrhage more users because of some of the other MMOs that are out, just with Rift and DC Universe and so on, maybe they're just worried, they're kind of being proactive, I suppose.
10110000	10125000	Well, it's kind of sad to see Final Fantasy XI going this route for the reasons that you just mentioned, because it's kind of foreboding.
10125000	10139000	Granted, I haven't played the game in a year or two now because of financial reasons, but I was always hoping that eventually once I was able to, I could get back into the game because I love the game so much.
10139000	10157000	There'll always be at least one server up, it's a Final Fantasy game, it'll never die completely. I want to ask you real quick before I let you go, since you brought up MMOs and I know you're big on Sony products and Sony fanboy and all that, and you like free things, what do you think about the announcement of Free Realms coming to PlayStation 3?
10157000	10182000	Well, I really haven't formed an opinion as of yet, because obviously I haven't played Free Realms, either on PS3 because it hasn't come out yet for it, and I just got my computer not even two months ago and it just barely runs some games, albeit poorly.
10182000	10195000	So, until I actually play something, I can't really form a decent opinion about it, but I'm willing to at least give it a try.
10195000	10217000	I'll tell you what, once I give it a try, let's say for a multitude, I'll either send an email or call in and essentially give a mini review of it. That way I can be a little bit more fair and balanced about it.
10217000	10219000	Alright, we'll be looking to hear from you.
10219000	10223000	Alright, but for now we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one buddy!
10223000	10225000	Yep, you too, take care.
10225000	10226000	Alright, later!
10226000	10241000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight, thank you guys so much for calling, sorry to those who didn't get through, if you didn't get through tonight, you can always send us an email, our mailbag had like one email in it tonight you guys, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, type out your thoughts and we'll read them next week on the show.
10241000	10247000	But for now, last minute stories, I forgot to ask Loki, we had some back to back calls tonight, Loki did you have any last minute stories?
10247000	10255000	Not too much actually, this is kind of stupid, you know, same thing with DJ Hero, I care about that, I don't really care about this.
10255000	10266000	But Guitar Hero, hey look, there's more DLC coming out, now I know we said that we weren't going to put anything out because we're done with that series, but the phones asked for it so we're putting out more DLC.
10266000	10273000	Well thank you for graciously giving us DLC for your game that you've decided to discontinue, whatever.
10273000	10283000	Anyway, so those tracks coming to Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, they're from the artist Trapped, and you get modern...
10283000	10285000	Didn't you read this earlier in the show?
10285000	10286000	I already did.
10286000	10287000	Sorry!
10287000	10289000	We were trying to design textures for GTA.
10289000	10291000	I was the only one, Matt.
10291000	10296000	I didn't read the story with any angst, so I was trying to do a little bit of journalistic...
10296000	10303000	It's still stupid though because they say, oh well we're just continuing the series, ah just kidding we're going to put it out because the fans want it.
10303000	10306000	Who listens to the fans?
10306000	10320000	Um, there's apparently the guy that Dan Fortin from Midway, who's now a part of NetherRealm I guess, you may remember him as the Toasty guy.
10320000	10323000	He's coming back in the new Mortal Kombat game.
10323000	10326000	Toasty!
10326000	10327000	Yes.
10327000	10329000	Alright.
10329000	10333000	Well, that's going to do it, I guess if that's it for the last minute stories.
10333000	10334000	I believe it is.
10334000	10339000	Another episode of Orange Launch Radio has come to a close, but not before we say goodnight to everybody.
10339000	10342000	Starting off with Matt too, thank you for being here tonight and filling in for Dark Sakura.
10342000	10343000	Thanks for the invite, I appreciate it.
10343000	10345000	You did a good job with the news tonight.
10345000	10346000	Well, thank you very much.
10346000	10349000	Alright, so we'll have to have you back again sometime.
10349000	10350000	Hopefully not to fill in for someone.
10350000	10351000	Exactly.
10351000	10353000	Maybe just to be the fourth wheel at another point.
10353000	10354000	Fifth, you've got the chat room.
10354000	10355000	That's true, we do have the chat room.
10355000	10357000	Always present fourth guest on the show.
10357000	10358000	I'll be the spare tire.
10358000	10359000	The fifth wheel.
10359000	10360000	I'll be the spare tire in the back.
10360000	10361000	Excellent.
10361000	10362000	I'll be the junk in your trunk.
10362000	10364000	Well, we'll see you again, don't wait two years before coming back.
10364000	10366000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
10366000	10368000	Um, Nutrisystem sucks.
10368000	10370000	Although it's working, it sucks.
10370000	10377000	I did have dinner tonight consisting of Buffalo Wing Pretzel Bites and macaroni and cheese in a cup.
10377000	10378000	Delicious.
10378000	10379000	Yes.
10379000	10380000	Not.
10380000	10382000	I'm going to go eat something else when I get home.
10382000	10383000	Final thoughts?
10383000	10385000	No, really great to be here.
10385000	10393000	Hopefully I'll be invited back on your other podcast in the future so I can be the Deckard Cain of your show and stay a while and listen.
10393000	10394000	Of course.
10394000	10395000	But no, thank you for having me.
10395000	10399000	Look, it was a pleasure seeing you and I will work on my angst next time.
10399000	10400000	And thanks for the beer.
10400000	10401000	Did it work?
10401000	10402000	Maybe.
10402000	10403000	Maybe.
10403000	10405000	I've got two more at home.
10405000	10406000	Awesome.
10406000	10411000	Alright, I want to say a final thought, headaches suck.
10411000	10413000	Beer doesn't make headaches better either.
10413000	10414000	It's too bad.
10414000	10415000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10415000	10417000	I am tracking my 3DS.
10417000	10421000	It's coming out of Oakland right now so I will have that tomorrow for sure.
10421000	10422000	Alright.
10422000	10423000	It must get stolen first.
10423000	10425000	Unless the plane crashes or they lose it.
10425000	10427000	Or it doesn't get stolen in Oakland.
10427000	10430000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
10430000	10432000	Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.
10432000	10434000	We really appreciate it.
10434000	10438000	You know, we don't ask for anything to do this show except tonight we do ask you to
10438000	10443000	donate at least $10 to the Red Cross for a game and donate to those in need this week.
10443000	10444000	It's very important.
10444000	10448000	However, outside of that, the way you can help promote this show and continue what we
10448000	10449000	do here, just tell a friend.
10449000	10451000	Tell a friend about the show.
10451000	10454000	Even if you like, I don't know who to tell about the show, leave a nice 5 star review
10454000	10457000	on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast at.
10457000	10458000	Forums.
10458000	10461000	I actually get the little emails from Google and see people talk about it on forums and
10461000	10464000	I just really appreciate you guys that say nice things about the show.
10464000	10466000	It doesn't go unnoticed.
10466000	10467000	I really appreciate it.
10467000	10471000	So, until next time, we'll be back with Dark Soccer to do it all again next week.
10471000	10475000	I hope you all have a wonderful night and until then, bye bye.
10475000	10477000	Be safe this week.
