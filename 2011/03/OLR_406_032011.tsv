10086	12288	Sky, and Loki.
13929	17571	Tonight, March 20th, 2011, some big games get delayed.
17971	20913	The NES classic River City Ransom will soon have a sequel.
21254	24276	And could a Silent Hill game be on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?
31653	32133	DarkSakura.com
51531	53992	I beat your butt at pinball effects.
54452	55432	It's pinball effects on what?
55732	56213	PS3?
56473	56853	Xbox.
56913	60294	You were literally showing me this while the opening was going so I didn't have time to process this.
60314	61354	Because I just found the picture.
61974	63755	Yes, I'm putting it up on our thing.
63775	64395	Oh, gee, thank you.
64555	66236	No, it's the icons because I think it's cute.
66696	68236	Your icon's like, sad face.
68296	69817	Mine's like, one!
70137	71699	Oh wait, is that Next Monster 60?
71739	72681	The FX2 or whatever?
72721	73081	The new one?
73221	74543	Well, we don't have FX2.
74643	75725	We just have FX.
76145	78168	But it's got samples of the FX tables.
78368	80251	But we'll get into that in my gaming week.
80371	84477	I was going to say, at some point, I don't want to spoil your gaming week, but you should get the FX2 because the shell is free.
84537	85639	No, I totally want.
85659	86219	I totally want.
86760	87061	Go for it.
87761	92042	Also joining us tonight, say hello, as he does every week, to the one and only Tech Master, Loki!
92482	92862	Hi.
92963	93483	How are you, Loki?
93803	94083	Good.
94703	95043	Awesome.
95563	98744	And Loki's brought some new toys to the show tonight that he's been showing off.
99124	99264	Yes.
99344	101305	You want to tell our listeners about what you've brought to the studio?
102105	104006	I brought a 3DS from Japan.
105206	107406	I'm not privy enough to get one of the US ones early.
108507	110087	I am going to be getting one on time, though.
111127	111548	Nice.
111788	112948	With Street Fighter, because...
113615	114536	That's the bundle I picked.
116179	119042	And then Motor Store Apocalypse.
119163	123088	I got review code for that because Sony loves me so much.
123909	125051	Or because I bought it off eBay.
125912	126132	Nice.
130563	135228	Yes, I noticed you've been taking pictures over and over there, and you've been uploading them to originalstudio.com.
135468	141134	I actually took a picture on the 3DS of myself, so I could see myself in 3D, so that, you know, because looking in a mirror obviously isn't good enough.
141174	143116	I wanted to see what I would look like on a 3DS, the picture.
143516	145958	But I can't, like, unfortunately, I can't upload that.
146099	146379	I can't.
146559	152321	You can, but it's a format that only I think 3D devices can read.
155062	159143	It's like some sort of weird format, but it's for 3D devices.
159203	162244	So it wouldn't do me any good to upload it to OrangeLaunchRadio.com because no one would see it.
163385	174214	You wouldn't be able to see it unless you have a 3DS or maybe some of those special cameras or the phones or whatever that can view 3D stuff.
174554	175495	Or maybe a 3D TV.
175595	177376	I don't know if you could view pictures on a 3D TV.
177717	180419	I would not want to blow up that picture to the size of a 50 inch television.
182100	186523	I noticed the resolution on the camera is kind of... They're VGA cameras.
186743	188544	It's really just a gimmicky thing right now.
188724	191266	But like 10-year-olds will have a field day with it.
191486	192607	I'm having a field day with it.
192627	193047	Are you really?
193687	198270	I have to admit, I was nosy the first thing I did before I took a picture of myself was I looked at everything you were taking pictures of.
198730	199631	And it's just cat...
200171	200732	Oh, it's the cat.
201012	202233	Oh, look, more pictures of the cat.
202453	204034	Oh, here's a picture of his desk at work.
204314	205335	Oh, and here's the cat again.
205796	210980	Well, it's... She was the only... She was there at the time, so, you know, that's why I took a picture of her.
211460	213582	No, but it's... She's so exploited.
213882	216264	It works really well with stuff that has a lot of depth in it.
216504	225532	I mean, because if you just take a picture of... I took a picture of triple bacon pizza, so... Well, thankfully, my nose is gigantic, so there's a lot of depth there, but that was...
226112	233033	You can actually almost... The photo that I took of the game while I was playing it, you can actually almost see the 3D in it.
233113	233954	It's actually kind of neat.
234354	234754	Almost.
235074	235434	Almost.
236534	239475	You can actually see the layers in the image is what you can see.
239815	244956	Eventually it'll be kind of cool because maybe you can download the pictures through the web browser.
245496	249697	When it comes out in May... That's awesome.
251457	252217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
271806	275327	Maybe it would help justify to the wife the cost of everything.
275347	277268	It's like, oh, I'll get you Nintendogs.
277628	278068	Anything like that?
278088	278509	She wouldn't.
278769	279029	No.
279289	279949	She doesn't care.
280069	280469	She doesn't care.
280509	282530	She thought Nintendogs was dumb to begin with.
283170	287552	I thought Nintendogs was dumb, but I had to see what it looked like in 3D, and it looks pretty cool.
287752	288412	Very fuzzy.
288773	289553	They are very fuzzy.
289973	293194	And my whole row, they're just treating them like they're real dogs.
293294	295475	It's just like, oh, the puppies are here.
296136	297396	It's our official puppies.
297496	299617	I'm like, okay.
299637	299717	Okay.
301047	301968	I would play Nintendogs.
302008	305210	Maybe that one won't make me feel completely violently ill to my stomach.
305670	307091	I'd play it for like 15 minutes.
307612	311314	I used to play it for 15 minutes during my break at work.
312075	314637	And then I would forget about my puppies and they would run away.
314857	316738	Are you going to get one at lunch?
317198	317659	I don't know.
317759	320180	I might have to wait a little bit just because some of the other stuff is going on.
320200	320941	Yeah, it's probably fine.
320961	322042	I think it'll be okay.
322402	323303	There's only one game.
323443	324223	I mean, other than...
326903	328885	Street Fighter, then I'm getting with the US one.
328965	330746	And Street Fighter's kind of like, eh.
331147	339313	It was either, okay, well, the three options I had were Street Fighter, Samurai Warriors, which, eh, I don't care about Samurai Warriors, and...
341668	345069	I don't remember.
345529	346809	Oh, Madden or something like that.
347549	348169	I don't want Madden.
348630	349570	So I picked Street Fighter.
349850	353791	And then I'll probably pick up Pilotwings because I want to play Pilotwings.
354231	355451	Yeah, I would play Pilotwings.
355711	356231	That looks fun.
356591	358592	Otherwise, I'll probably wait for the Kid Icarus game.
359092	360512	Yeah, Kid Icarus looks awesome.
360632	364273	But Pilotwings, I'm very disappointed there's only three types of...
365493	368095	Well, but the Super Nintendo one was maybe four.
368455	376040	I guess, wow, it's kind of sad that it was more than... Oh, yeah, because they keep forgetting, like, what, every fifth stage was like this random shoot-em-up that you would have.
376080	377060	So it was actually like a fifth.
377080	383184	Well, they have that kind of stuff in there, but it's still, it's only... Hang gliding, jetpack, skydiving...
385103	385643	There's another one.
385843	386484	Oh, Biplane.
386624	387084	Biplane.
387164	388605	And then the shoot-em-up stages.
389585	389886	I don't know.
389926	390166	Anyway.
391206	391907	But, I mean, come on.
391947	396569	If you can pull off four on a Super Nintendo, I think you can maybe pull off more than that.
396849	397429	I mean, come on.
397490	399170	I mean, let's be honest here.
399531	404853	The geometry for the levels and stuff like that, you're using WooHoo Island or whatever from Wii Sports.
405073	407915	You have the island, the 3D object created.
407975	410776	I keep forgetting that WooHoo Island's like a character now.
411337	411677	Oh, it's.
411877	412778	Dumb.
413738	415239	It's a character no one cares about.
415320	416200	It's an island.
416761	417841	Big deal.
418802	422825	Someone can make an island, especially with the level of graphics that they're putting in there.
422865	423405	I mean, come on.
423505	426888	This is the type of stuff that you would have seen in Prop Cycle.
427168	429650	Hell, Prop Cycle had more detail to it than this stuff.
430210	430390	But...
431451	433892	It's just that, I mean, right there.
434232	437953	Oh, you don't have to create the island, which is kind of a major part of Pilotwings.
438834	441935	So you have to model the planes and weather vehicles and stuff.
442195	446016	And then you have to place your markers around and stuff like that and code the rest of the game.
446476	449357	It didn't seem to me that that would have been a lot of work.
449957	450357	You know what I mean?
450658	456259	Sorry, I'm just checking out some gameplay video of Pilotwings and remembering how freaking awesome this game was on Super Nintendo when it first came out.
456299	457000	Like, seriously.
458240	468349	And now that I look at it, I'm like, gosh, the basics for this, I mean, it's really just a very simple graphic of the island with the Mode 7 trick.
468909	472493	But it just, I remember this game was the shit when it came out.
472513	473473	Yeah, and you know what?
473514	477977	And I bet you anything that they're going to re-release this on the Virtual Console for that.
478238	483642	And I will bet you anything they will code a new emulator for it that everything that has goddamn Mode 7 is going to be in 3D.
484623	491348	and all the like parallax stuff that was in there, you know, different layers, sprite layers and stuff like that will be offset in certain distances.
491408	492328	That's what's going to happen.
492428	498853	Well, they said it was going to be as simple as anything that had a z-axis would be, you know, able to be made in 3D, so...
500834	501274	Kind of neat.
501614	506637	Going to our chat room, the ever-present fourth guest on our show, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
507097	511219	Big thanks to those of you guys that like to show up every week, and I love this chat, these comments here.
511579	515320	Black Wolf, our old pal that does the show before us here at All Games Radio, the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
515420	517521	He starts at 5 o'clock Pacific when we start at 6.
518542	522003	And yes, I'm leaving the Pilotwings gameplay going because I'm being nostalgic.
522323	526065	Black Wolf says, fact, Dead Island also takes place on Woohoo Island.
528010	528491	Phonely.
529151	532514	And GameGuru says, Woohoo Island as a fighter for Super Smash Bros.
532534	532514	4.
532555	534236	There you go.
536598	536899	Anyhow.
537639	539601	It'll be a stage.
540142	541864	Alright, so what else did you bring to the show with you?
542104	543585	You brought a PlayStation 3, right?
544466	546768	I brought a MotorStorm Apocalypse.
547949	549631	And it's all sorts of awesome.
550192	551032	It's basically...
551773	558556	You're racing through this city that's been destroyed by an earthquake, among other natural disasters.
559277	562238	And so now you're basically racing through that.
562718	571703	And then at the same time, they've got a little bit of a storyline going on where there's this corporation that basically wants you and these crazy homeless people out of the city.
571743	574384	And the crazy homeless people are throwing molotovs at you during the races.
574964	576245	www.DarkSakura.com
594974	612769	and this air raid siren goes off and all of a sudden the bridge starts shaking and starts collapsing right as I'm racing through it and that was all sorts of cool and then there was another stage I was racing on a motorcycle and all of a sudden this building just collapses right next to me it was awesome
613109	613609	Good times.
613849	615530	It was incredibly good times.
615991	618072	Seriously, probably my favorite one out of the series.
618492	619833	So why did you bring the PS3 with you?
619853	621814	You want to show it off a little later during the show or something?
622054	623274	Because I'm going to play it.
624435	626436	Instead of paying attention to the show, you'll just be playing it.
626456	627417	Oh, I'm paying attention to the show.
627457	628377	I'm multitasking.
628477	633180	When the calls start coming in, it's just like, oh, okay, I'll let Rob talk to the callers and I'll just sit here and play Motorstar.
633200	634540	I can't help it if they're not interesting.
636521	659935	well didn't you think I thought some of those comments was very interesting before we had a dead island taking place on woohoo island and woohoo island is a fighter for super smash brothers 4 and I was kind of thinking like you know there could be a trailer that's out there and it's like pilot wings meets zombies on woohoo island and it's very amazing
661577	663097	Just like that trailer.
663297	664698	Which, by the way, I hated that trailer.
664718	665998	I just want to throw that out there.
666018	668099	I don't think I ever talked about it on the show, but I hated that trailer.
668679	670159	I really hated that Dead Island trailer.
671059	675801	I thought it was artsy and everything, but I really didn't like it.
677381	678941	I guess I can get into the reasons why later.
679442	680622	Remind me later, I'll talk about it.
680662	683083	But for now, we always like to start off our show with, how was your gaming week?
683443	684763	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
686379	687120	It was eventful.
687240	693688	I just played some Ridge Racer on the 3DS and my eyes hurt.
695830	698313	I played Pinball FX, which I talked about earlier.
700876	704901	I played a lot of Pinball FX actually, just sitting there one night and I updated my avatar.
706022	710525	And I played that game with the big stupid dragon.
711605	713627	You know, where you click the button and they run.
714367	716709	And you press the buttons and they do stuff.
717269	718250	And the chicks have horns.
718950	719530	That type of thing.
720431	720971	World of Warcraft.
720991	722272	Oh, okay.
722292	723153	I was like, what?
724880	732362	I like the discussion that we all got into yesterday about what the Darkstalkers characters would be if they were characters in World of Warcraft.
733322	738423	So we were trying to figure out if you wanted to make Victor, would he be a Draenei or whatever.
738923	739664	So it's kind of funny.
740524	740904	That's it.
741164	742164	I'm going to go get some dinner now.
742724	743024	Awesome.
743324	743965	Enjoy the noms.
745305	749986	Well, Loki, I know we've heard a little bit about the 3DS and Motorstorm, but anything else in your gaming week you want to talk about?
751974	752414	Yeah, sure.
753935	757256	Other than Motorstorm and, well, let's see.
757456	759957	Motorstorm, I already talked about how awesome it was.
760578	763959	The 3DS played Ridge Racer, and that's Ridge Racer.
763999	766520	I mean, they didn't really change anything too much.
767981	778165	I played some of the games that are kind of packed in with the 3DS, like the Face Invaders game, which is kind of funny.
778465	787189	I took basically what was the equivalent of the drunken Mario Kart picture with the camera, so that was fun shooting my face.
787829	795435	and then I actually tried some of the cards and there's one where you're shooting targets with an arrow so that was kind of cool.
796596	805123	And then other stuff, I actually downloaded on the iOS ReRave so I was playing a little bit of that and that's pretty cool, I dug it.
805323	809187	I was pissed off for a while though and I still kind of am a little bit pissed off about it.
809547	810868	I got some pretty high scores.
810908	813210	I'm like, why aren't they appearing on the high score table?
813470	816913	Didn't realize I had to register for like a login or something like that for their thing.
817293	819794	So after I did that, it reset all my high scores.
820775	821275	Thanks.
821795	822835	Wah, wah, wah.
822875	824556	That's what you get for not signing up for the first place.
825036	830059	Well, they didn't say in order to have your scores posted to the site, you need to register for it.
830099	831319	It just says log in and register.
831339	832660	How else is it going to know who you are?
834620	835901	Well, I thought it would just take my name.
835941	836201	I'm sorry.
836221	838002	Did I throw logic into this equation?
838022	838502	Yeah, exactly.
838702	839483	I'm sorry, Loki.
839523	840463	I'll never do that again.
843368	843929	So I played that.
844269	845810	I dug some of the songs in there, of course.
846450	847811	A lot of Kyle Ward music in there.
847831	851453	So if you're a fan of In The Groove, you'll probably dig that.
853675	854435	What else did I play?
855256	857357	Grand Theft Auto, pretty much.
860074	860794	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
860894	862735	And there's some random iOS games I played.
864715	869037	Just going through some of my games I downloaded that see, like, well, hey, I haven't played this yet.
869057	871217	Let me try this out and see if it's any good or not.
871637	873918	A lot of them weren't, so I just ended up deleting them.
873938	874718	There's one I played.
875038	877979	I think it was called, like, Hyper Missile or something like that.
877999	880100	That was pretty cool.
881240	883341	Yeah, mainly Motorstorm.
883381	884721	I've been playing a lot of that, actually.
886342	887622	I'm really hyped about that game.
890487	890767	Awesome.
892068	892369	All right.
893449	895071	Well, anything else or is that it?
895871	896252	That's it.
896392	896712	All right.
896852	897913	I'll talk about my gaming week.
898393	902657	Mostly a lot of the same stuff I've played in the past, so not a whole lot of new stuff.
902697	913245	You know, the usual WoW, WoW, WoW, WoW, and Torchlight a little bit on XBLA, even though playing Torchlight on Xbox Live makes me want to go back and play it on the PC more.
913566	915187	You can go chew on that one for a little bit.
915687	916388	and some of the other stuff.
916408	917750	But I did check out a few new things.
917870	926460	One of them that Loki already mentioned, I also checked out ReRave on the iOS because obviously as a music game fan, there's definitely the roots there.
928542	935890	It's kind of a mix between Elite Beat Agents meets DJ Max Technica meets In The Groove.
936511	937552	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
960849	969197	It's funny because in retrospect, I think I appreciate what they were trying to do a lot more now than what I did then.
969578	980709	Because especially coming so far now and seeing everything that's happened where I don't think Konami ever truly had faith in that series, I can appreciate what they were trying to do in retrospect.
980729	983271	But just at the time, it really felt cheap to me.
984432	986434	and I was really longing for more DDR.
987054	995220	Anyway, sorry for the tangent, but just to give you the mindset, I was coming in here thinking, I don't know if I'm going to really dig this because I was not really ever a big fan of In The Groove.
995921	998563	But I gotta say, I enjoyed Rereave.
999103	999483	It's cool.
1000464	1001925	It's $2 to download.
1002365	1004887	Not a whole lot of songs come with it for free.
1005248	1008870	I right away downloaded a song pack that was free.
1009211	1011612	So I couldn't tell you exactly how many songs you get initially.
1011632	1012973	It must only be like two or three.
1012993	1014174	But there was a song pack of about four.
1014194	1014595	It was three.
1014835	1017877	Yeah, there was a song pack of about another four or five songs you get for free.
1018337	1023661	And then, of course, it wants to charge you more money to get extra song packs.
1023741	1025082	Song pack one, song pack two.
1025883	1029386	With a bunch of songs that are very similar to what you hear in the default packs.
1030066	1032107	Not a lot of name recognition in those packs.
1032127	1035409	You're not exactly going to get Lady Gaga, Rihanna type of stuff.
1035449	1036229	There's one of them.
1036589	1037950	I actually bought all the packs.
1038070	1038330	Did you?
1038731	1040712	Because I wanted some actual songs to play.
1041312	1044213	And I was in a let me buy some stuff mood.
1044674	1046775	But I played some songs.
1046875	1052118	Once again, I don't recognize the artist, but there's one of those songs from one of the Geico commercials was in there.
1052138	1052798	Oh, jeez, really?
1052818	1052898	Yeah.
1053078	1054939	No, see, I wouldn't recognize the artist, but that makes sense.
1054979	1055720	Yeah.
1056200	1057561	So, I mean, okay, whatever, cool.
1057641	1066788	I mean, and a lot of the music games on, I'm sorry, Xbox Live, on iOS are set up the same way, and DDR itself being one of them.
1066808	1071111	There's like a DDR-S game that comes with like no songs and everything you have to buy in songpacks.
1071151	1073512	So, I mean, this is nothing new, the model.
1073933	1077936	But as far as like the seven songs that come with it or so, I've been playing most of them, and I enjoy the songs.
1077976	1078536	They're pretty good.
1078976	1081438	And the gameplay is pretty slick, actually.
1081618	1082639	I like the whole, like,
1083019	1083520	Thanks for watching!
1098092	1099073	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1116932	1117212	and many more.
1136706	1137267	Check this out.
1137307	1138108	I mean, it's two bucks.
1138229	1139431	It's not a bad deal.
1140092	1143278	It's unfortunate there's no demo or anything so that people can see what it is first.
1143338	1144701	But there's videos online.
1144721	1147346	They'll probably give you a pretty good idea what it is.
1148382	1172687	so yeah re-rave on the iOS the other game I checked out this week this is a demo I don't like to review games based off the demo but this is one very high profile game I've had a lot of anticipation going for and that's Mortal Kombat the demo is now out on PlayStation Network for everybody you don't have to just be a plus subscriber regular or plus can now get the demo on PS3 so I spent a little time with that just to see if it was going to be as awesome as I was hoping and
1174264	1178507	I don't want to say I didn't like it because I did, but I felt it was lacking.
1178887	1180428	And granted, it was a demo.
1180648	1181929	It's supposed to be lacking.
1181969	1183070	It was only bare bones.
1183170	1189954	But when you get that mode that's, you know, fighter versus fighter, that's still kind of the core part of the game.
1189994	1190454	And I don't know.
1190494	1196338	It just wasn't as action-packed as I was hoping and as fast-paced as I remember the Mortal Kombat games being.
1196678	1202542	However, I am saying that very open-mindedly because I realize, again, it's a demo game.
1202842	1217609	I was playing it single player and I think Mortal Kombat really best shines in multiplayer modes so I'm totally not being fair when I'm saying that right now but that was my honest to god reaction as I walked away from it going gosh I was hoping I'd have more fun with that
1218049	1218909	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1240999	1243022	Yeah, but there's a difference.
1243623	1244785	There's a very clear difference.
1244825	1250535	There's a difference with, like, okay, you must torture yourself for my amusement, and there's a difference between, like,
1251038	1251498	Ha ha!
1251778	1253199	Your face is going to get ripped off!
1253579	1253999	Ha ha!
1254199	1262361	The Saw movies are trying to be real and trying to teach these moral lessons through these really sick things that I don't like.
1262841	1266202	But Mortal Kombat is basically one step above a cartoon.
1266542	1268963	It's about the Netherrealm.
1269163	1270963	It's not real.
1271203	1272323	Do you want to play a game?
1272343	1273384	You forgot to feed your cat.
1273424	1274544	Now I'm going to feed you to a tiger!
1275124	1276105	I don't see how that works.
1294500	1319167	I did like about Mortal Kombat that I was able to pick it right up and like it just felt like playing Mortal Kombat 2 in like Street Fighter 4 style graphics and that part was pretty awesome like being able to select Mileena and just remember that toward toward low kick was the little drop I mean cool things like that really easy to get back into so that same sort of learning curve where you were able to kind of slip right into Street Fighter 4 from Street Fighter 2 I think a
1321348	1322069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1340567	1342107	So that's what I really did walk away.
1342147	1343048	So check out the demo.
1343088	1344548	See if you had the same reaction.
1345248	1347049	I talked to a friend of mine who felt the same way I did.
1347649	1350110	Very excited about the game after playing the demo.
1350490	1350970	I don't know.
1351290	1352910	It just wasn't what I remember.
1354131	1355771	But anyway, there you go.
1356491	1357712	Those are the games I played this week.
1358272	1361593	So chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to join us in our chat room.
1363593	1368798	Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, Sky, the fatality that looks the most funny is the one showing Liu Kang getting hit by a taxi.
1369159	1371341	Oh yeah, that was pretty funny too.
1371641	1373383	And I like the x-ray attack stuff.
1373663	1375005	I mean, that stuff was funny.
1375345	1377607	I hope there's more of them in the regular game.
1377867	1381291	Like not just one x-ray attack for every character because I think some of those might get old quick.
1381751	1383473	But I cracked up at some of them.
1383513	1384975	They were pretty funny.
1388058	1388499	There you go.
1389340	1391543	A lot of the same old moves coming back.
1391583	1393565	Johnny Cage can punch people in the balls still.
1394967	1396389	In fact, he likes to do it over and over again.
1396409	1397511	I think he has an issue.
1398027	1399848	Anyway, let's move on.
1399888	1401609	Some housekeeping for tonight.
1402090	1406432	Our Twitter, you can join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, all the updates for what's going on with the show.
1406833	1410015	Also our Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1410395	1421162	Otherwise, we have no planned shows off or trips we're taking or anything, so every Sunday night in the near future at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is where you can hear us live.
1422022	1422963	So, yes ma'am.
1423365	1424345	I have an arcade report.
1424605	1425006	What's that?
1425726	1426306	Disneyland.
1426966	1427646	Oh yeah, that's right.
1427686	1429527	You were gone last week because you were at Disneyland.
1429567	1429807	Yes.
1430467	1431248	Did you have fun?
1431508	1432068	I had a great time.
1432728	1434389	Did you do the Toy Story Midway Mania?
1434509	1435029	We totally did.
1435689	1436669	It's like a giant video game.
1436689	1436989	I love it.
1437610	1441491	Dan totally kicked my ass, but I kicked his butt at Astro Blasters.
1441631	1451254	But the Starcade is actually now also the home of Star Trader because they've closed down the Star Trader and Star Tours for the revamp.
1452503	1453184	Oh, interesting.
1453224	1453844	I didn't know that.
1454064	1456886	I saw when they had shut down Star Tours.
1456966	1458766	But the Star Trader is also being redone.
1459067	1459307	Right.
1459327	1461328	Well, to get all the new merchandise, I'm sure.
1462428	1466851	So, well, that and they sort of would have to go through there to take care of the hallway if they need to redo the hallway.
1467151	1467331	Right.
1468151	1473594	So, it's now kind of half the arcade it used to be, literally.
1473814	1474815	That's it.
1475255	1475715	Interesting.
1475795	1475975	Yeah.
1476676	1477156	All right.
1477176	1477876	That's my arcade report.
1477896	1478596	We didn't play anything there.
1479837	1480437	It's expensive.
1480457	1481398	Lens was closed.
1481758	1482359	What else?
1482559	1483079	Oh, I know.
1483140	1485282	Because Electronica doesn't go under the weekend.
1485322	1487564	They had said that it was going to during spring break and then they didn't.
1487604	1488685	Is Captain EO back already?
1488846	1489066	Yes.
1489767	1494952	It's the original 77mm film with grain and everything.
1495032	1496013	It's showing its age.
1496233	1496414	Mm-hmm.
1497014	1499696	The Cheeseball 3D that was not great.
1500777	1503759	And here's the summary of Captain EO.
1505380	1515987	Is that Michael Jackson flies through space with a bunch of Muppets, lands on the Borg homeworld, and turns all the Borg into extras from Xanadu ruled by Angelica Houston.
1516788	1517128	The end.
1517288	1517929	And it's awesome.
1517949	1518369	All of it.
1518389	1518989	And it's awesome.
1520170	1521211	But am I not right?
1521491	1523132	No, that's a pretty good way of summarizing it.
1523833	1524753	So, the end.
1525154	1525234	So.
1526394	1533719	I'm going to be sad when they get rid of that finally because you know there's going to come a time when they're finally going to have to get rid of Captain EO again for a new movie.
1533759	1536520	It better not be Honey, I Shrunk the Audience again because that movie was terrible.
1536901	1539582	But anyway, let's actually get into some other video game news.
1539902	1542624	No Captain EO game to talk about this week, but maybe some other video games.
1542684	1543745	We'll start off with Loki tonight.
1544245	1546966	There's been a few games delayed from Japan.
1547747	1554449	Not necessarily because of the whole tsunami earthquake thing, but you could probably attribute some of that to it.
1555970	1565054	Starting off, Warriors Legends of Troy on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Dead or Alive Dimensions, both coming from Tecmo Koei.
1566094	1571597	Those have been delayed and won't make their scheduled release dates of March 24th and March 31st.
1572937	1574217	Honestly, not a big surprise.
1574657	1579238	Dead or Alive Dimensions has been delayed a few times already for the U.S.
1579599	1583499	And Warriors Legends of Troy, not even coming out on the 360 in the U.S.
1584260	1585580	That's been delayed indefinitely.
1585780	1588600	So, I'm not surprised one bit.
1588921	1591381	And that was prior to the whole earthquake thing.
1591461	1594782	So, take that for what you will.
1596002	1599663	And then, on top of all that, of course, this is a little bit too...
1602103	1627871	Various reasons why they're delaying some of this stuff Yakuza of the End, Motorstorm Apocalypse, and Disaster Report 4 Well, Disaster Report 4 has been cancelled from Sega Which, you know, a game about wandering around in a city that has undergone some traumatic disaster Might not be the most sensitive thing to put out
1629171	1631092	Unfortunately, the game was a disaster.
1653444	1665708	Well, you know, people are being hypersensitive about it, but I sort of get it, because when you put down multi-millions of dollars on these projects, you have to release them just right.
1666088	1670749	And right now, you've got an entire country that probably doesn't want to be thinking about the apocalypse.
1671209	1674730	You know what I mean?
1675111	1677631	I can see where people would be concerned it's in bad taste.
1677651	1679152	But Nuclear Boy, Rob...
1680232	1681493	That's a whole other thing, though.
1681553	1683754	You're talking about the little YouTube thing.
1684014	1686256	He needs something to distract him from having to poop.
1687376	1696321	And then, well, the other thing is, not only did they announce it was going to be delayed in Japan, but Motorsome Apocalypse also got delayed in Europe and then later on in the U.S.
1697342	1699523	I don't understand why, because the game is done, but...
1700582	1700982	Whatever.
1701162	1701863	Okay.
1701983	1702603	You're delaying it.
1703723	1704123	That's fine.
1706404	1710085	Again, if your game comes out the wrong week, it might get destroyed.
1710205	1710786	Like Blur.
1711486	1715007	I would say a lot of the big reason Blur didn't do well is it came out the wrong week.
1715347	1716468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1737324	1740168	It doesn't look like... It's not Japan, for one.
1740829	1744534	It's just completely... You know, it looks like San Francisco.
1745215	1748479	In fact, I would probably be willing to bet it's based off San Francisco.
1748499	1750842	Because San Francisco, kind of known for earthquakes.
1751002	1752785	So, you know, that's not a stretch.
1753666	1754467	And, you know, the...
1756033	1763360	Actually, I'm going to say it is goddamn San Francisco because having played some of the tracks and stuff, it looks like San Francisco.
1763380	1766783	There is a Sony office right outside San Francisco, so it wouldn't surprise me at all.
1768325	1774811	I don't understand delaying it there or in Europe, but okay, whatever.
1775592	1781017	They want to wait and release it in May or something where it's packed full of releases, then fine.
1781857	1786942	I really think they should just keep it with the April 12th release date because it was perfect.
1786962	1791326	There's nothing else coming out.
1791546	1793548	Are we talking maybe it'll just be a couple weeks?
1794509	1794769	Maybe.
1794989	1797151	Maybe a couple weeks, but really a couple weeks...
1798032	1800734	That's going to put it out in a lot of... Let me put it this way.
1801095	1805619	You've got MX vs. ATV Alive coming out in about a month after it was originally coming out.
1805979	1809963	So if you wait a little bit longer, you're going to have another off-road racing game.
1810043	1815167	Granted, both of them are completely different from each other, but they're still both kind of in the same genre.
1816408	1818370	I just think it's kind of a mistake to move it.
1818750	1821132	It should have really come out at that time because it would have been perfect.
1821653	1822634	There's nothing else coming out.
1824896	1824976	Um...
1826731	1827173	It's awesome.
1827274	1828682	So seriously, pick it up when it does come out.
1829668	1830634	It's all sorts of awesome.
1833022	1839208	I'm going into the chatroom at chat.orange.com Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says, Actually, yes, people in the U.S.
1839268	1840329	find things insensitive.
1840729	1845993	They bashed the event because it did an episode this week about a nuclear power plant being threatened.
1846614	1848896	And everyone was like, How dare NBC air this?
1849236	1850337	Oh, God.
1851018	1851458	You know what?
1851498	1853300	They need to just stop listening to those people.
1853660	1856963	I'm going to boycott your show.
1857123	1858925	I'm not going to watch it next week.
1859665	1862047	But I'll catch it on DVR if you still want to know what happens.
1862067	1864709	Well, there's been a lot of... I mean, I'm just playing the devil's advocate here.
1864789	1868412	I also think people are maybe blowing this out of proportion, but... People are dumb.
1868452	1873636	There has been... On the West Coast, and you know this as well as I do, there's been a lot of talk.
1873676	1880042	Like, the news is dominated with this talk about, could the radiation from the power plant in Japan get to the West Coast?
1880102	1881082	I need to get my tinfoil hat.
1881102	1885346	Yes, because they're going to spin it any way they can to make it sound like it's terrible.
1885706	1886307	Thanks for watching!
1903444	1906666	Vote Republican or this will happen.
1906726	1908506	Seriously, they just blow it way up.
1908626	1909807	Because what else are they going to talk about?
1909847	1910968	Charlie Sheen?
1911068	1912868	Seriously, they've got to talk about something.
1912888	1916210	They've got to get you to watch the news.
1916910	1923133	Look, we've got to be careful how we tread here because I think to some extent it is a very frightful thing.
1923473	1928556	If this was all going on at that Rancho Seco place, I know they shut it down years ago, but...
1929376	1937362	Don't get me wrong, it is a frightening thing, but what's going on there and what the reporting is going on there is completely different.
1937742	1941104	I am honestly going to say it's a lot like Nuclear Boy.
1942545	1943866	I'm sorry to those who haven't seen it.
1944266	1949590	The worst that's going to happen is they're going to have to evacuate Fukushima and then
1951494	1952415	Fish are gonna be sick.
1952555	1953755	You can't go fishing near there.
1954436	1956097	Plants are gonna be irradiated.
1956117	1964722	You're gonna have to deal with this for probably the next seven to ten years, I think, is what it takes for nuclear radiation to be cleaned out of land.
1964822	1968404	And our technology is a lot better than it was, you know, around, say, Chernobyl.
1969835	1970276	DarkSakura.com
1987638	2004827	So something like this coming up and having everything still pretty much hold intact with just a few problems, that has to say something pretty amazing for, you know, the level of care and, you know, thought that went into the construction of these places.
2005988	2010650	You know, and also should make everybody in Sacramento shut up about us having nuclear power here.
2011650	2012871	Because we don't have earthquakes.
2013872	2014192	Shut up.
2014332	2016453	Well, I got the perfect location for a nuclear power plant.
2016997	2017437	Thanks for watching!
2037071	2037352	DarkSakura
2050632	2052652	It's not terrible that those dolphins are so smart.
2052712	2054633	It's terrible that they're using it for evil, okay?
2054713	2058374	Let's talk about something that's definitely fiction.
2058394	2060674	Let's get away from the real world stuff and get to a land of fiction.
2060694	2063415	And one of our favorite fictional places, Silent Hill.
2063695	2073637	Of course, Silent Hill is, well, at least a one-time awesome video game series that's kind of slipped into a, okay, yeah, I really like this series because I used to like it.
2074077	2074737	Silent Hill.
2074977	2077117	We're experimenting with new weather patterns now.
2077598	2079018	So anyhow, here's the deal.
2079918	2109465	apparently Silent Hill is going to have a release on Xbox Live if rumors are to be believed and here's where the rumors are coming from it's an interview with the Italian based Xbox 360 magazine and it's from the art director for Silent Hill Downpour saying quote at the moment there will be no multiplayer modes in Silent Hill Downpour Konami is investigating a separate chapter devoted entirely to the multiplayer now he went on in this interview to say that he doesn't know any details but it's supposed to be Xbox Live Arcade and quote
2109932	2112934	that most players have to survive in the town of Silent Hill.
2113874	2117737	Now, I kind of look at this and go, that's... Silent Hill cash-in.
2118197	2123180	Well, Silent Hill was always supposed to be a very single-player experience.
2123200	2126822	Like, I don't see this turning into a shoot-em-up type of thing.
2126882	2130164	Like, I don't really see it as a bang-bang, you know, kill the others.
2130624	2130864	Really?
2131344	2133566	It would be kind of cool if, like, one person could be Pyramid Head.
2134506	2134726	Really?
2134766	2136868	And everybody else is trying to run away from Pyramid Head.
2136888	2139089	You get bonus points for, you know, mannequin rape.
2139309	2147016	You don't see it as a bang-bang shoot-em-up game, but yet Konami does because they released an iOS game that was basically that, and they released an arcade game that's basically that.
2147156	2149398	So they apparently do see it as a shoot-em-up.
2149518	2151420	Well, but not like shoot other people.
2151480	2153462	You're shooting the creatures of Silent Hill or whatever.
2153502	2155244	I don't see where the multiplayer element comes on.
2155264	2155724	That's my point.
2156044	2161930	But then there's a part of me that also pictures a very Left 4 Dead kind of game that actually could be kind of awesome.
2162370	2174336	Like and maybe it's like don't take Left 4 Dead literally, but maybe some type of like cooperative survival game where maybe everybody helps each other in a certain way to survive the town of Silent Hill.
2174917	2176257	That might be kind of cool.
2176398	2176798	I don't know.
2176958	2177278	That would be.
2177318	2179640	I really hope it isn't Blue Pyramid Head vs. Red Pyramid Head.
2179660	2180961	That would be ridiculous and dumb.
2180981	2181821	It's like Spy vs. Spy with Pyramid Head.
2181841	2182782	Yes, that would be hideous.
2182822	2184764	So either it's got to be a co-op survival or it's got to be...
2207720	2212402	One versus everybody, which now the more I kind of say that out loud, I think that's kind of dumb too.
2212682	2214802	So I really hope it's more like the co-op survival.
2214822	2216003	That could be kind of rad actually.
2216343	2218843	Can you imagine like having to figure out puzzles with multiple people?
2219184	2219784	That'd be kind of fun.
2219804	2220504	Nothing would get done.
2220744	2223505	I can think of something that's like, oh crap, pyramid head's coming.
2225385	2226506	Push someone in his path.
2227646	2228186	Exactly.
2228506	2229747	Sacrifice Dark Sakura.
2230387	2230587	Hey.
2230987	2232808	Be like, bitch, please smack.
2233108	2234288	All right.
2235911	2238393	Anyhow, we'll see what develops with that.
2238993	2246139	I would imagine if this is true, if, big if, remember this is a rumor, because it's coming from an Italian magazine from the art director.
2246599	2257248	I'm not saying that's small time stuff, but again, it does sound a little bit like I have this cousin who's a cameraman on the new Superman movie.
2257608	2258809	Art directors are pretty big.
2259679	2260719	Yeah, I know, but still.
2261499	2262840	Dude, it has director in the title.
2262860	2263700	All right, anyhow.
2263960	2264240	Hey.
2264720	2265740	Just take it with a grain of salt.
2265760	2266181	That's all I'm saying.
2266201	2267921	Don't be disappointed if this game doesn't happen.
2268021	2269741	I would love to be an art director of a magazine.
2269761	2270662	Or if it isn't good.
2271542	2272962	I would love to be an art director.
2273442	2273682	Anyway.
2273922	2278984	Well, maybe you should, when this guy gets fired for leaking all the details about the game, you should apply for his job.
2280084	2281044	I don't want to move to Italy.
2281784	2282144	All right.
2282945	2284425	Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2285129	2302366	Well, apparently the Zynga people, by the way, Zynga sucks, I'm sorry, his name is Brian Reynolds, and he said that Xbox Live is too small for them to bother with for Farmville.
2303468	2305790	That means my mother won't be getting an Xbox anytime soon.
2307503	2307964	Thanks for watching!
2318746	2319666	He's an idiot.
2321487	2323588	I actually kind of get what he's saying.
2323608	2324308	Yeah, I do too.
2324529	2327650	There are way more people on Facebook than there are on Xbox Live.
2328050	2328390	Fact.
2328610	2331352	But let's look at hard, cold numbers, okay?
2331392	2336414	First of all, there are 23 million members on Xbox Live as of February 2010.
2337514	2345798	In January, Facebook had 600 million users and Farmville had 62 million active since September of last year.
2347253	2349274	So basically what he's saying is he doesn't like money.
2350996	2353257	I don't see how it would be that difficult.
2354198	2354838	I mean, really.
2356079	2359381	But he's like, no, it's not going to be worth our time for just these people.
2359761	2361563	Like, okay, if you don't want more addicts, fine.
2361783	2362143	Exactly.
2362503	2368928	He's basically saying, well, why would we put it on Xbox Live or on the PlayStation Network or something like that?
2369208	2370849	They have less people than they have on Facebook.
2371349	2374051	Duh, it's called expanding your demographic.
2374572	2376433	You already have it on Facebook.
2376453	2378014	You already have it on smartphones.
2378295	2381057	That's why you would put it on a console because you don't have it there yet.
2381958	2383339	Here's what he said.
2384820	2387902	Basically, the worry is the social experience.
2388863	2394427	Basically, the social experience is going to be a very small number so that the amount of social capital that is there will not be very high.
2394948	2397690	So basically, you're not going to have people doing the microtransactions.
2397870	2399231	I hate that word.
2399291	2400292	I hate that word.
2422167	2435797	to some level yes you can enhance certain Xbox Live Arcade games with extra things but you're always putting some money down up front to play the games and I would question sure you might have hundreds of millions of people playing Farmville on Facebook but how many of them are actually paying for it
2436477	2443381	And it's probably a pretty damn scary number when a lot of us kind of sit here and don't understand Farmville.
2443801	2453246	But again, I think the types of games that you have come to know on Facebook and mobile phones are not necessarily the same types of games that are on Xbox Live Arcade.
2453746	2454567	It's just kind of like...
2455737	2456878	I don't know.
2456958	2458778	By the way, you know what the percentage is?
2459419	2461660	I'm just going to use those numbers as a basis.
2462200	2465081	The percentage of people on Facebook that play FarmVille?
2467322	2465081	4%.
2468343	2468883	Tiny.
2469883	2470764	Tiny, tiny.
2472064	2472305	So...
2473485	2477407	I mean, if I were this guy, I'd be looking to find ways to get more revenue in.
2477747	2481829	I'd be adjusting the business model, do like XBLA version of FarmVille.
2482169	2485210	Or, my thought, why does it have to be FarmVille?
2485551	2488012	If your games are so damn addicting...
2488852	2494919	Rise to the challenge and create a game that you could get away with charging $15 for.
2495719	2500064	I can't believe I'm about to say this, but there are some things you can appreciate about Farmville.
2500084	2505710	That's like saying there's some things you can appreciate about Hitler.
2510186	2511847	I am not going to go there, period.
2513708	2515128	Other than Volkswagen and the Autobahn.
2515468	2516109	All right, look.
2517369	2522611	My thing is that, like, the thing about... God, now I'm just totally lost.
2522631	2525052	That actually, I feel sick.
2525533	2526333	I feel a little sick now.
2526433	2535937	The thing about Farmville is that it kind of gets your friends, even though it might not be us, the people that are the quote-unquote hardcore gamers...
2536818	2564084	it gets our moms and our relatives and people that don't usually play video games to be playing a multiplayer game together very easily and maybe there's a way they could bring that multiplayer effort to the Xbox Live place which in turn could maybe enhance Xbox Live but I don't think that necessarily has to be just fucking Farmville there's plenty of other games they could rip off right?
2564784	2567307	I'm just still kind of feeling ill from...
2572744	2598137	Orange Lounge Radio Making people throw up in their mouths daily Making my stomach flip flop And I just ate, I feel ill Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com Spazinator told me to bite my tongue Blackwolf says That would require that they actually make something original Defective Candy says Every time we sell one of those Facebook game cards where I work I die a little on the inside Oh
2598988	2599308	All right.
2600369	2601409	You're just feeding the beast.
2603109	2603890	Let's move on.
2603990	2607151	Loki, take us to some completely different news, please.
2607231	2608351	This is completely different.
2608391	2618635	They're actually working on a Transformers MMO, and it's being developed by the people behind the browser-based MMO RuneScape.
2619315	2626338	And I guess they've worked out a deal with Hasbro, and the game is set to be released in North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand sometime in 2012.
2628498	2645963	and they said that the title will be a dynamic and action-packed game no word on which Transformers universe it will be based on but that is interesting let's hope it's not the Michael Bay Transformers universe although you know that would be action-packed
2647278	2648119	Explosions!
2664319	2664919	Be popular.
2665240	2666200	People like Transformers.
2666740	2667041	I don't know.
2667061	2669322	The MMO space is a little bit crowded right now.
2669422	2672864	I don't know if it'll be able to kind of get its way in there.
2673125	2674605	If it was free to play, that'd be pretty cool.
2674666	2677227	Hopefully they don't have the expectation bar very high.
2677287	2678148	That's all I'm saying.
2678408	2682010	I just think the MMO space is a very tough nut to crack right now.
2682931	2687234	And if it's not free to play, it has to triple be that much better.
2687514	2692477	And judging from the Transformer games that have been on the consoles... The last one was all right.
2695307	2721256	and the next one's supposed to be okay because it's from the same people the last one so hopefully I'll try to keep an open mind but I mean we all know that third movie is gonna be terrible I mean I realize they're all now admitting wow the second movie was really bad but you know the third movie's gonna be even worse that last movie if I'm wrong then I'm wrong hooray but I'm just not getting my hopes up that's all
2722176	2726519	Hey, let's talk about music games and Ubisoft is going to be putting out a new game.
2726559	2727859	It's called Rocksmith.
2728300	2731001	It's a rhythm game that uses real guitars.
2731622	2732022	Wait a minute.
2732222	2733243	That worked before.
2733563	2736084	Isn't that a train that left the station quite some time ago?
2737345	2738326	All righty, well, whatever.
2738386	2740387	It's called Rocksmith is the game.
2740927	2747952	Some of the artists that will be in the game, David Bowie, Interpol, The Rolling Stones, pretty solid song list right there so far.
2748772	2752715	You can use any electric guitar that you might just happen to have.
2753175	2755897	So we're not talking about buying a cheap plastic peripheral.
2756037	2758398	It's using an existing electric guitar.
2758479	2760420	So that's neat, I guess.
2761080	2761160	Okay.
2762561	2776251	I'm not sure exactly how this all works just yet as to how it's going to identify from any guitar but I would imagine some type of audio pitch sensing peripheral kind of similar to how it detects when you're singing what pitch you're singing at.
2776271	2779773	It would probably plug into like you'd plug it into an amp.
2780654	2783275	So there is a trailer out there right now.
2783315	2790180	It's supposed to be coming out the second half of the year so I imagine that we'll be hearing more about this at E3.
2790240	2791521	I was going to try and play it
2792141	2812106	and this was originally damn it I wanted to play the trailer but a stupid commercial for those goddamn bears that talk about toilet paper and it was originally we had actually talked about this before it was actually a game in development called Guitar Rising oh yeah but you know that never really came out and then Ubisoft bought it yeah it shows a guitar plugged into the Xbox
2813715	2816076	There's got to be some little adapter thingy or something.
2816497	2818458	It looks like an amp plugged to USB.
2819038	2823961	Yeah, it's similar to what you use with the karaoke mics.
2824141	2825662	I'm sure it's got to be something just like that.
2830774	2831014	DarkSakura
2849634	2852635	Well, it's been 22 years in the making.
2854196	2856817	There will be a sequel to River City Ransom.
2857257	2858158	Yay.
2858578	2860979	Or as it was known in Europe, Street Gangs.
2861419	2862099	Yay.
2862459	2867081	Or, I really like the Japanese name, Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.
2867582	2867802	Nice.
2868602	2870424	It's so hot.
2871284	2878009	The Japanese developer Miracle Kids is trying to... Actually got a bunch of the original development team back together.
2878850	2883814	And they are going to be doing a console version in the summer with the PC release in 2012.
2886095	2887576	So the console version is this summer.
2888337	2889678	The PC one will be out next year.
2891920	2892981	And they're also...
2895171	2905838	I got Downtown Smash Dodgeball, which for us was Super Dodgeball, which is on Xbox Live Indie Games, and they're working on a WiiWare port.
2906959	2908060	So, yay!
2908861	2912683	If you still want to play the old school one, get it on Virtual Console.
2912723	2913203	It's 500 points.
2914184	2916706	And to this day, my favorite version is still the PC Engine one.
2917128	2918468	The second one apparently wasn't that great.
2940276	2943778	A lot of the stuff that's retro, too, is sometimes better left in the past.
2943879	2944619	That's all I'm saying.
2946680	2951703	We'll see as soon as we start to see some screenshots and some actual gameplay, but I guess it's kind of cool that that's coming back.
2951723	2952924	I mean, that was a game I really liked.
2953244	2953584	Quite.
2955105	2956966	Hopefully it kind of comes back as an arcade title.
2957447	2960088	I don't know if I'd want to pay $60 for a new River City Ransom game.
2960688	2965591	I would suspect it's going to be something for Xbox Live Arcade.
2965611	2968053	Remember when they remade Final Fight?
2968073	2968293	Yeah.
2969788	2971229	Did they?
2971430	2977355	Yeah, it was Final Fight for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.
2977895	2978776	Oh, it was awful.
2978796	2979597	Crap.
2980117	2980918	I do not have that.
2981098	2981839	Oh, yeah.
2981959	2983280	Oh, God, I do remember that.
2983320	2984121	That was terrible.
2984241	2985982	The last great one was Final Fight Guy.
2988524	2989665	Actually, Final Fight CD.
2990926	2991607	That was a good version.
2991627	2992808	What was the Final Fight CD on?
2992848	2993389	Is that Sega?
2993589	2994109	Sega CD?

3292757	3295119	Alice comes out this week on the Sony PSP.
3295979	3300922	Is that based in the Brady Bunch universe?
3301082	3302903	No, it is not based in the Brady Bunch universe.
3303303	3312125	Actually, it looks very much like a, I don't know how to explain this, like a very like old time, think of like that Castlevania sort of flair.
3312145	3318766	I mean, it's not like vampires, but definitely the costumes kind of remind me of that sort of story.
3318866	3323226	It's an adventure game on the PSP.
3324647	3326207	I don't know if that's something that's coming out over here.
3326287	3326987	I don't think so.
3327007	3330088	I don't know if it's like based on the anime or what the deal is, but yep.

3405131	3405751	That's on the 30th.
3405771	3406112	Never mind.
3406132	3406752	Okay, done.
3409850	3411693	So excited to be finished with those release dates.
3411713	3413275	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.
3413295	3418904	Then we got the classic game of the week, A Trip Down Memory Lane, with a classic video game coming up in just a little bit.
3418924	3420406	But first, two more stories for you guys.
3420540	3427103	Yeah, we got some news about the NGP or what's, you know, codenamed the NGP from Sony.
3427383	3431866	They're saying that the games will be downloadable day and date with the retail releases.
3432406	3439009	So you'll be able to either buy, you know, the cartridge that these are going to be on or download them from the PlayStation Network store.
3439549	3441130	All of them or just the Sony ones?
3441710	3442891	Well, they're saying all of them.
3443952	3463207	but here's kind of an interesting thing though if you think about it because that sounds good in theory until you realize one thing there's no onboard storage on the NGP so where the hell am I supposed to put these games that you're having me download oh I have to buy your proprietary memory unit there'll have to be something yeah
3464082	3467463	Oh, how wonderful I have to buy a fucking memory card to do that.
3467863	3468243	How about this?
3468263	3469523	I'll just buy the retail game.
3470243	3471504	Man, that sounds good.
3472124	3473484	You know what I could do with that retail game?
3473744	3476525	When I don't want to play it anymore, I can sell it back.
3477825	3481086	Because I'm sure you're not going to have any sort of price break or anything like that on there.
3482206	3491608	So, you know, unless they come out cheaper, because I'm not buying all the packaged goods that go along with the game, I'm not interested.
3491628	3491728	Sorry.
3493468	3497031	And then on top of that, there's a rumor regarding the price of the system.
3497911	3501814	Apparently, Sony Europe put out a survey.
3502194	3505436	I guess this is tying in with Ubisoft.
3505576	3513302	It was some survey conducted by a research firm and sponsored by Ubisoft.
3513582	3517484	They're saying that the retail price of the Sony NGP is expected to be around $350.
3517645	3518465	How likely would you be purchasing...
3522768	3528154	How likely would you be to purchase the NGP now that you know the retail price?
3528675	3531157	And they're saying that that's the premium model with 3G.
3531358	3536023	So the next question is, how about the one without 3G, which will be considerably lower at $250?
3539749	3540289	Thanks for watching!
3564710	3565451	250 should be the topic.
3565591	3569115	I don't even think that these prices that we're hearing about mean anything.
3569135	3571198	I don't even think Sony knows what they're charging for this thing yet.
3571298	3571798	I really don't.
3572840	3576344	I mean, a week before E3, I'd believe this rumor.
3576404	3578346	Right now, doesn't mean squat.
3579748	3580149	We'll see.
3582145	3584366	I wouldn't be surprised if they go and try to charge $350.
3584406	3585846	But here's the thing.
3586026	3593688	It'll be $350 retail, but because these are going to have 3G, they're going to be tied in with some sort of data plan.
3593708	3598329	You're going to get it for a lot cheaper than that because you're going to be signing a contract or to your contract or something like that.
3598849	3602190	So that's where it's going to make sense for people to pick up the 3G.
3602210	3603090	Not necessarily, though.
3603110	3605971	You don't have to sign a contract for an iPad.
3607211	3608772	An iPhone, yes, but an iPad, no.
3609333	3610394	You don't sign a contract for those.
3610554	3611575	Well, then how do you get the 3G?
3612115	3614858	You buy it with a 3G enabled, and then you buy a separate data plan.
3615118	3617320	But they don't subsidize the cost of those machines at all.
3618701	3625907	Because I believe the data can be through either, and correct me if I'm wrong, Chatters, but I'm pretty sure it's either to AT&T or Verizon.
3626267	3635755	And now we have this big, huge news today that AT&T has gobbled up T-Mobile, or at least will be over the next 12 months, assuming the government approves of the acquisition and what have you.
3636275	3640676	So that's just going to be even more, you know, that's one less carrier out of the sea.
3641656	3642997	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
3643417	3643617	Yeah.
3643977	3646478	A lot of people on my Twitter are not happy about that acquisition, by the way.
3646618	3650219	Apparently a lot more T-Mobile customers than I realized out there who don't want to switch.
3650719	3652239	Well, they have some pretty good budget plans.
3652739	3653139	That's okay.
3653159	3653980	I'm already with AT&T.
3654480	3654640	I know.
3654660	3657080	I've never had a problem with AT&T, but some people really hate them.
3657341	3658841	But then again, I don't live in a huge city.
3659244	3659885	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3670510	3691945	we'll see alright anyhow more stuff and this is on a completely different kind of note you know obviously last week we spent a little time talking about how you guys can help what's going on in Japan and the really unfortunate tragedy that's happened over there and a lot of the gaming world now coming on board to do some really cool things for the disaster relief over in Japan I don't even have time to name it
3692285	3694687	All, but here's some of the ones that caught my eye.
3695368	3698130	Squeenix is just flat out donating money.
3698470	3707417	There's no buy this game for whatever cost or donate through the... No, they are just straight out giving 100 million yen to the relief effort.
3707738	3719367	They are also collecting donations from employees throughout the world and they are also going to be getting donations through select Squeenix online services and the amusement facilities that Taito operates in Japan.
3719887	3721629	Square Enix, Squenix
3736748	3737209	and DarkSakura.com
3766010	3767832	Bungie is currently selling a little band game
3784747	3785388	DarkSakura.com
3808050	3810173	Very similar to what they got going on in iTunes right now.
3810274	3815461	So you can just donate the funds that are in the PlayStation wallet or just donate through the PlayStation.
3815601	3819868	So if you don't know how else to donate, that's one way you can do it.
3820549	3821089	And there you go.
3823132	3823453	Awesome.
3823513	3825154	And that's not even all of them.
3825174	3829539	There's lots of other great things going on out there in the gaming world of people donating money.
3830080	3843494	And as I said last week, please, anybody, if you listen to this show, I really think in lieu of giving us money, which we don't ever ask you for, really would hope you would donate what you can to the relief efforts going on in Japan.
3844074	3850637	and even if you're like, I don't have any money, I've got zero cents, donate time would even be helpful at this point.
3850697	3855519	The Red Cross can use help all over during this very unfortunate time.
3856240	3863043	Alright, let's take a minute to switch gears here and take a trip down memory lane in a segment we do here on the show every week.
3863063	3863163	Music
3864230	3864830	DarkSakura.com
3888957	3896723	or known as Japan as Strider Here You Too which is the official sequel to the first Strider game.
3898044	3899385	And I'm bringing up YouTube right now.
3899405	3900545	Sorry I'm a little delayed here.
3900705	3901186	That's okay.
3902307	3902747	Here you go.
3902847	3906349	Here's a little bit of the gameplay.
3906369	3907410	Let's have some of the music too.
3911173	3912994	Yeah.
3915396	3917898	Actually I really like the first level music first.
3920499	3926164	Anyway, it really is not a sequel to the NES one.
3926184	3930288	I'm just saying because the NES one is actually a retelling of the manga.
3930708	3931589	The Strider manga.
3933377	3939198	So this one is basically set 2,000 years after the events of the original game.
3940099	3944880	And the Grandmaster has returned to life, and so has Strider Hero.
3945580	3949461	So he's going through different levels.
3949701	3952741	It's actually 2D sprites over 3D backgrounds.
3953361	3955082	But it's the same as the original.
3955202	3956142	It pretty much plays the same.
3956742	3959123	You've got three action buttons.
3959243	3959803	He has...
3960863	3964644	All of his old moves like walking, jumping, crouching, sliding, climbing walls and ceilings.
3965945	3970526	And he's got a dash now by pressing left or right twice.
3971106	3973387	And a double jump, basically you press jump in midair.
3973427	3975407	And a backwards somersault done while sliding.
3976248	3980309	And then he can do a thrust jump off of a wall if he's holding onto a wall.
3981977	4005103	and he's got like extra slash moves and all kinds of different moves he's got like a boost if he's got a boost item so he can shoot plasma out of his cipher so it's pretty cool and this one actually has a few throwbacks as far as health replenishments you can extend your life bar you have a cipher extension other boosts
4005783	4009485	And then you can get different things in the game.
4009505	4013366	You can get the Yashji and the Sakji symbol from Vulgus.
4013847	4015847	And the Zeny Coins from Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds.
4015867	4016428	I love that game.
4016448	4017728	Forgotten Worlds is pretty cool.
4017788	4020950	Anyway, so you've got five stages.
4021150	4024991	Each of them gives you a little breakdown beforehand.
4025712	4029213	We have an appearance of Tanpu in here because she was so cool.
4030494	4030654	And...
4032834	4034755	It was pretty awesome.
4034775	4039676	You've got the first three on Earth, Hong Kong, Germany, and Antarctica.
4040296	4043537	And that was Hong Kong, of course, the one that Tom Poo was in.
4043997	4045737	And then the last two are in space.
4045757	4053019	You have the flying battleship Balrog and Third Moon, which were both locations in the original game.
4053739	4061261	The home version did come out in 2000 on the PlayStation, and I've got both versions, I believe, the Japanese and the US one.
4062841	4065121	It actually comes with two discs.
4065762	4070002	On the first disc is Strider 2, and the second disc is the original coin-op version of Strider.
4070803	4071563	So that's pretty neat.
4072403	4077604	But a labeling error on the American one has both discs labeled as Strider, so we used to have to guess.
4078559	4085262	So if you finish the games and do all the achievements on the same memory card, you get a secret level called Strider 2 Mission Zero.
4085782	4086822	It's a waterfall stage.
4087542	4094025	And then if you complete all of the missions, you get Strider Hien as a playable character.
4094713	4097477	He has two ciphers, and it's pretty hardcore and awesome.
4098219	4106331	And that's actually my favorite person to play through the damn game with is Hien, because it's just like, I've got two of these suckers and I'm bad!
4107053	4110057	And he like, I think can throw one like a boomerang, if I'm right?
4111038	4114041	Anyway, so yeah, really, really hot.
4114221	4117544	This was, I mean, the game is really cool.
4117624	4129495	It's kind of, if you're, I guess, a veteran of it, then it might seem like it's a little short and a little, but there was so much coolness in it that it's just a fun game.
4129555	4132197	I mean, I could sit down and play through it in a couple hours.
4132377	4133458	It's just a fun game.
4134319	4137282	So that is my game of the week in Strider 2.
4140243	4141125	Alright, good times.
4141205	4142266	Strider 2.
4144169	4146352	The arcade game, also on the PlayStation 1.
4147794	4149016	Classic video game of the week.
4150478	4151219	Hardcore.
4153269	4156470	Okay, chat room, why are you bothering with Deadpool?
4157630	4160071	There's 50 million Deadpool titles out.
4161832	4162732	Deadpool's jumped the shark.
4162872	4163272	I'm sorry.
4163332	4164733	He's only good in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
4165453	4165913	Really?
4166653	4167693	Not a fan anymore, huh?
4167713	4169394	No, okay, I love the character.
4170394	4173535	And I think he was fine in Cable and Deadpool.
4173775	4175736	Great series, and then they ended it.
4176036	4179137	But now Deadpool's in like eight titles?
4179497	4180157	Seriously?
4180858	4181758	I think it's eight.
4182538	4184218	And it's like, dude, too much Deadpool.
4184958	4187659	Too much of a funny thing is annoying.
4188299	4188559	Sorry.
4189299	4190619	Strider 2, awesome game.
4190779	4191200	Go play it.
4191480	4192440	And underappreciated.
4193020	4194120	Highly underappreciated.
4194760	4195080	All right.
4195500	4196781	Well, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
4196921	4198721	We'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
4198761	4200541	We have some rapid-fire news tonight.
4200641	4201701	Of course, Twitter topics.
4201721	4204082	This is your last chance to get those in at twitter.com.
4204982	4207042	Get those in right now so we can read them in a little bit.
4207382	4210363	We're going to talk a little more about the censorship of Mortal Kombat in Australia.
4210743	4215146	We'll talk about some legal battles and a possible sequel to the King of Kong movie.
4215826	4216167	Maybe.
4216587	4217828	Yeah, it might be happening.
4218108	4222831	So we'll talk about that when we come back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4228717	4231118	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4231158	4238080	We are live on this Sunday evening, March the 20th of 2011 with the 406th episode of our show.
4238400	4248263	We're about to get into the Twitter topics, but first some rapid fire news, but not until we plug the side projects that we have or whatever you want to call them.
4248283	4250744	DarkSakura, you have another little podcast you do.
4251278	4255923	Yes, and if anyone listened to my rant at the end of Part A, this is a rant you'll hear all the time on the show.
4257204	4258465	Do Comic Insanity.
4259366	4264511	You can download the podcast at infamous, N-F-A-M-O-U-S, .net.
4265212	4269816	And we basically, it is me and Mar and Marvel, and you have something hanging from your shoe.
4270317	4271197	Never mind, it's your shoelace.
4272198	4273300	Well, that tends to happen, yes.
4273980	4274781	It was just weird.
4274801	4277042	Anyway, and Dan Shadow.
4277702	4280323	And we basically talk comics.
4280343	4282164	We talk about what's coming out, what's on our pull list.
4282624	4284265	We have one that we read every week.
4284365	4288207	And next week we are going to have, hopefully, a special guest.
4289048	4290308	So you'll just have to tune in and listen.
4291049	4291349	All right.
4291949	4293390	But we go live every Tuesday.
4294045	4295166	Awesome.
4295326	4307119	If you enjoy the World of Warcraft, or even if you don't, you just like to hear people talk about it and tell dick and fart jokes along the way, you should definitely check out the best little Horde house in Azeroth that show that Extifer and I do all about World of Warcraft.
4307420	4312185	Brand new website just launched today, www.hordehouse.com for all the information.
4312325	4314627	H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E for all the information.
4314848	4315769	And you can download it right there.
4317310	4318710	All right, there you go.
4318770	4325133	So let's get into some rapid-fire news, quick news stories about what is going on in the gaming world that we just don't have a lot of time for otherwise.
4325213	4325453	Loki.
4325613	4325773	Yep.
4326294	4332856	If you're in the UK, you'll be treated to some LittleBigPlanet 2 download content coming in May.
4333077	4335298	This is kind of a little bit different than the normal stuff that they put out.
4335318	4338179	They're actually doing what they call a teacher pack.
4338859	4340380	It's being developed by Media Molecule.
4340500	4345602	It's to be packed with demonstrations of the national curriculum.
4346182	4350103	It's based in game levels that other teachers have made.
4350764	4357326	I guess this pack will also feature PlayStation Move functionality as well, which is pretty cool.
4357626	4372857	You know, I didn't get to play LittleBigPlanet when I was in school, or, well, all we had was... These kids today get DDR machines in their PE classrooms, and now LittleBigPlanet teaching you history.
4373678	4377861	You should grow up on NumberMunchers and Oregon Trail like we did.
4378416	4380057	Yeah.
4380357	4383598	And then, of course, this is kind of neat.
4383919	4386320	More download content coming to DJ Hero 2.
4387460	4395544	This new, I guess, pack is called the Indie Hip Hop Mix Pack and features the artists...
4396705	4397045	Well, let's see.
4397065	4397825	Here's some of the mixes here.
4398506	4407674	My World Premiere by Charisma and PeanutButterWolf mixed with The Red Instrumental, which is by Jlib.
4408554	4418803	Party Hard by The Perceptionists featuring Guru and Kamu Tao mixed with Ghost Rider by RJD2.
4419443	4423907	And then The Best Day by Atmosphere remixed by FSG.
4425248	4453430	and those are available probably right now actually for $8 or 640 Microsoft points or $300 each or yeah $300 300 Wii points each on the WiiWare store premium for those download content packs on the WiiWare and then of course some more music game download content Dance Central getting some more tracks
4454758	4461641	Not as much as I was hoping it would be put out by Harmonix, but I guess maybe it takes a little longer to get some dance routines put out.
4461921	4463321	Fatboy Slim, Weapon of Choice.
4463921	4464522	Awesome song.
4465082	4466662	Gwen Stefani with Hollaback Girl.
4468263	4470064	Carrie Hilston with Turning Me On.
4470684	4472104	And Paula Abdul with Straight Up.
4472645	4476526	Those are available for $3 per track or 240 Microsoft points.
4479887	4481808	That's a lot of download content there.
4482639	4483119	Thanks for watching!
4498188	4498868	What the hell's that?
4499309	4502250	U-Star is like karaoke for movie scenes.
4502490	4506773	You read lines and it puts you into the movie like a green screen.
4506793	4508133	That sounds horrible.
4508314	4517358	Actually, it sounds like something I've seen at Disney's California Adventure where you can like, it's set up like Ursula from the Little Mermaid.
4517378	4520560	Yeah, we did that over where Turtle Talk with Crush is.
4520860	4521661	That whole thing, yep.
4521821	4523702	You can reenact scenes from your favorite movies.
4524623	4526904	It is a terrible game.
4527585	4529347	The interface is just absolutely terrible.
4529747	4536373	Oh my god, my co-worker though was doing lines from like 300 and stuff like that.
4536953	4538915	This is Cakedown!
4539335	4557049	and just the way he was doing it though was like like Igor from you know Frankenstein or something like that and just this really weird voice he did the whole thing and it was hilarious and the game has the worst framing ever like we had the camera set up on a table
4557609	4562175	and like it would zoom in or zoom out too much depending on the scene.
4562195	4564137	So there's like one scene that you could do.
4564158	4565840	It was kind of an ad-lib thing.
4565860	4569905	It was like the moon or something like moon surface and all it had was his head.
4570646	4572348	Just his head was on the screen because...
4573493	4575835	It's a terrible game.
4575875	4578797	It sounds like something you buy for one night of LOLs and then it's over.
4578817	4580078	Seriously, wait for it to drop in price.
4580238	4582500	It is pretty funny, though, for a drunken party game.
4582860	4584001	Okay, there you go.
4584041	4585643	Some other quickfire news here.
4586523	4588985	Red Faction Battlegrounds has a release date.
4589085	4595010	It's going to be April 5th, and it will be out for $9.99 on the PlayStation.
4595050	4596711	That's also 800 Microsoft points.
4596771	4597432	But here's the thing.
4598072	4604302	If you're in the PlayStation Plus thing before March 25th, so this week, you can get the game for free!
4605003	4608168	So this is more incentive for you to sign up, I guess, for the PlayStation Plus membership.
4608228	4608929	Free stuff!
4609690	4612595	So, yeah, that's Red Faction Battlegrounds.
4614037	4615618	Also, I found this kind of interesting.
4615678	4619982	GameStop is now selling 500 gigabyte PlayStation 3s.
4620983	4623486	But they don't really make 500 gigabyte PlayStation 3s.
4623506	4624227	So how do they do it?
4624567	4626128	Well, it's a refurbished deal.
4626248	4629872	They sell refurbished PlayStation 3s and they call them premium refurbished.
4629952	4657815	Refurbished PlayStation 3 Supercharged They come with a 500GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue Hard Drive And like a bunch of peripherals and things come with it too So here's the deal, you can buy one of these for $400 It comes with a PlayStation 3 Slim with the new hard drive A special Supercharged console skin You know, that reminds you how awesome GameStop is for getting this for you A one year warranty on it And then I guess a Media Hub with a remote
4658335	4685138	uh... increasing the number of USB slots uh... also an HDMI cable so I gotta say it's an interesting little spin on the whole used game stuff uh... there's some people that really like to shop around for used only things to get a deal on it and uh... even though I don't necessarily know if you're getting a deal with this you are getting a lot of extra stuff that a lot of people kind of have to buy anyway like the HDMI cable and so forth um...
4686474	4687074	I don't know, guys.
4687194	4690876	I have an 80 gig hard drive on my PlayStation 3 and I still haven't hit the limit yet.
4691036	4691576	Knock on wood.
4692437	4693937	But I also don't download a lot of movies.
4694057	4695038	I'm not Spazinator.
4695238	4698279	Spazinator calls in every week talking about some video he's downloaded.
4698419	4699700	I don't have that many movies.
4700000	4701580	I have a 500 gig hard drive in mine.
4701800	4702261	Do you really?
4703541	4704702	You redid it yourself, right?
4704802	4706803	Yeah, I did it myself because I had 20 in there at one time.
4706823	4707363	Oh my gosh.
4707603	4708443	Yeah, I can see.
4709284	4709824	Mine's only 80.
4709864	4710664	I haven't filled it up yet.
4711164	4711525	Knock on wood.
4713976	4720148	Yeah, I guess if you're used to paying a lot of money for HDMI cables, it's a good deal.
4722787	4728130	It's an interesting way to make the used PlayStation 3 business kind of interesting.
4728831	4733734	It's kind of creative to just get the hard drive and put the new ones in there at the GameStop level.
4733774	4741459	Well, I think also, too, and I'm not sure if GameStop had this problem, but Sony was oh so wonderful and decided, hey, you know what?
4742260	4744341	We're having shortages on the old systems.
4745402	4748244	So you place a bunch of orders for it and they don't come in forever.
4748724	4751206	And then, oh, hey, we're going to send a bunch of them to you.
4751986	4752466	You get them.
4752846	4754427	Oh, by the way, we're releasing a new SKU.
4754967	4755827	Suckas!
4756347	4763249	And so you're left with a bunch of systems that... Oh, by the way, we didn't price protect those, so they're going to come out at the same price, and you're stuck with these old systems that nobody wants.
4763749	4764829	Haha, suckers!
4765229	4774531	So, if they did that to GameStop, which is very unlikely because they're GameStop, but let's just, for all sakes and purposes, say they did.
4775372	4777272	So what are they going to do with all these old systems?
4777352	4780893	Well, they can buy a bunch of hard drives for cheap, upgrade them, and
4781733	4783854	Sell off the old hard drives, I guess, if they want to.
4784635	4786936	And sell them for a premium.
4787456	4790838	And make money off the system and the accessories bundled with it.
4792619	4797102	And it becomes a unique item for them because there are no 500 gigabyte PS3s.
4798142	4802085	Toagak in our chatroom is commenting on the size of your hard drive saying, that's a lot of porn, Loki.
4803686	4804106	No, no, no.
4804166	4804866	I stream my porn.
4804906	4805687	That was actually for...
4808877	4837570	for rips of games but I my system's all legit now I unmodified it because I want to play Motorstorm and you know it's just it was the right thing to do whatever once again remember we got into a couple weeks ago about how there wasn't really much I wanted to play on there well Motorstorm was one of the games I wanted to play but I'm not missing much or anything
4838058	4838598	Wipeout Connect Game
4864735	4867556	You might remember this game was already released on the Wii and the DS.
4868296	4869797	I'm sure it was pretty terrible.
4870157	4878220	Now, they talk about how there are infamous big balls, and I assume they're not talking about genitalia, but these actual giant balls that people bounce.
4878260	4879300	I've never watched this show.
4879360	4883022	It just looks idiotic to me, but I guess a lot of people really like it.
4883442	4886643	But people bounce on giant balls like it's a pinball machine or something.
4887423	4890506	So this game, Wipeout, will have more than 30 obstacles.
4890926	4894049	You will run, duck, dodge, and of course, wipe out.
4895370	4900894	And they go on this quote about everyone who watches the show wishes they could try the obstacle course, and now this is their chance.
4901735	4902235	No one wishes that.
4902255	4903096	Is it like Takeshi's Castle?
4903756	4907218	It's sort of like Takashi's Castle, but really dumbed down.
4907278	4912660	Kind of what I get from looking at it, yeah, but I've never... And I'm a reality TV whore, okay?
4912720	4918103	I watch a lot of crap that I deservingly deserve to be made fun of for watching.
4918883	4920064	Like Big Brother, come on.
4920364	4922425	But I don't watch Wipeout.
4922545	4923825	I'm not going to stoop that low.
4924025	4927547	Well, remember how they... It's basically, it took all these Japanese game shows and just...
4927915	4929456	Gutted the soul out of them.
4929676	4934338	I mean, like that show, Hole in the Wall, the one that was the funny Japanese game show.
4934419	4937600	That was a segment on Ellen, and that's where it should have stayed.
4937700	4939641	Like, it's funny for two minutes, and that's it.
4939841	4944244	No, it was actually, well, it may have been a segment, but it was originally a Japanese game show.
4944904	4948986	And, you know, that's funny because they're just playing it for fun.
4949026	4950147	They're not doing it for prizes.
4950227	4954669	But, you know, of course, us Americans don't want to watch anything that's for fun.
4954770	4957271	It's got to be for money, because who cares about fun?
4957591	4959172	I don't hate that.
4985490	5001069	I think he would be just as over the top as Chairman Kaga Exactly, he would be just as over the top but this like fictional cousin or something like that is retarded Now he's on a hideous TV sitcom on CBS based off a Twitter account
5002611	5002851	What?
5004653	5008396	He's been on a show for like a year called Shit My Dad Says.
5008696	5009557	Oh yeah, that one.
5010117	5014841	You know, I've actually thought about starting a Twitter account for Shit My Wife Asked Me About.
5015621	5016862	It might be kind of long.
5017963	5019364	It's just weird.
5020285	5021286	There's some funny stuff.
5021306	5022467	What was it the other day?
5022547	5026770	I'm trying to remember one of the questions because it was just like, really?
5027331	5028092	That's so weird.
5028112	5028152	Um,
5030826	5033047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5058318	5060819	And what if you need to spell Deseret because you're a Mormon?
5061079	5062860	That's Deseret.
5063140	5067101	I'm like, listen, that's the way I learned how to spell dessert.
5067541	5072183	So if you don't like it, you can shut the hell up or you can go to hell.
5074584	5076304	And so she wrote that on Facebook.
5077285	5077885	Good times.
5078265	5084147	But she asked me weird shit all the time, like all these random questions about things.
5084187	5086888	It's the job of a wife to ask her husband really bizarre things.
5087509	5089050	What are some of the bizarre things you ask Dan?
5089410	5089870	Dan!
5091670	5093371	What's the bizarre stuff I ask you?
5096712	5097533	He says he doesn't know.
5097833	5100694	She keeps asking me questions about mythological creatures and stuff.
5100714	5102954	She's like, you know, what's this look like?
5102974	5103975	I'm like, I don't know.
5104235	5104935	Stupid thingy!
5107576	5108877	It's just something that happens.
5109177	5111658	Is that something that happens like when you get married?
5111838	5115399	Because like, you know, Alan doesn't really ask me stupid shit.
5115659	5115779	Like,
5117699	5130651	It's like, if you've got someone who's got a really kind of wandering mind, every so often the weirdest questions will pop up, and when you hit that comfort level, they'll just ask you.
5131671	5138037	And typically it tends to be, I've noticed the wife, or the girlfriend, or...
5140723	5168871	I guess and every so often just the most random questions but because I feel so comfortable around my husband I'll just blurt them on out like you know I don't know it just occurs to me when this whole thing was funnier in your guys' head like it seems like a big in joke or something but I'm just thank god I'm not a lesbian I wonder how it would be amongst lesbians if they would both annoy the crap out of each other with annoying questions
5170553	5170813	DarkSakura
5190271	5193132	But it's the Billy Joel Piano Challenge.
5194632	5203174	It has I Go To Extremes, Miami 2017, Seeing the Lights Go On on Broadway, My Life, which was the theme from Bosom Buddies.
5204354	5206095	I used to watch that show.
5206195	5210436	Prelude, Angry Young Man, and scenes from Italian Restaurant, and She's Always a Woman.
5211016	5216657	And there are also, for some of these, pro guitar bass expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.
5217097	5221298	The entire pack will be 800 Microsoft points or 1,000 Wii points or 10 bucks.
5223539	5224019	You know what?
5224159	5224579	I'm good.
5224679	5227060	I don't really... I do not like Billy Joel.
5227080	5227380	I don't know.
5227400	5230401	Billy Joel was like kind of one of those things that was better left.
5230421	5234422	I mean, why don't they... If it's a piano pack, why don't they freaking put Piano Man in it?
5235583	5235803	Okay?
5235823	5236023	Wait, wait.
5236063	5237603	I think it might... That might already be out.
5237623	5237723	Maybe.
5237743	5238984	Because I think there was a Billy Joel pack already.
5239004	5239584	Okay, well then fine.
5240004	5240284	All right.
5240324	5241544	Piano Man was in there already.
5241704	5244385	Yeah, this might be like... That's how much I like Billy Joel.
5244425	5245005	I didn't look.
5245165	5246526	That's like the only song he does that I like.
5249304	5251771	I like the song Philadelphia even though the movie is really sad
5256112	5256652	Next story.
5286719	5287199	You know what?
5287980	5290962	I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told our friend Melody.
5291122	5291362	Yeah.
5292183	5294184	Do not buy that song on iTunes.
5295185	5296626	Too late.
5296906	5298407	I really wanted her to reach number one.
5298688	5300229	I've lost all respect.
5303292	5304253	This is the reason why.
5305393	5311916	Because no talent rich kids do not need the dollar that is better spent on Jolly Rangers.
5314157	5314477	The end.
5314537	5315177	I'm on a diet.
5317218	5317578	Yeah.
5319199	5320040	You want a Girl Scout cookie?
5320240	5320721	You know what?
5321041	5322762	I've got some.
5322782	5323403	I don't want to get it.
5323883	5325705	Don't blame a little girl with a dream.
5326085	5327586	Blame the music production company.
5327706	5333972	It's the same thing I said when the future could have been a dollar closer to getting that music production company to make you a song.
5334472	5334872	I know.
5336013	5337574	I'm just jealous because I don't have a song.
5337594	5341037	She's way auto-tuned, and you can tell she can't sing.
5343378	5347181	They interviewed her on Good Morning America, and they made her sing a few bars of America the Beautiful.
5347641	5348842	Was she the best singer I've ever heard?
5348982	5349162	No.
5349622	5351183	But was she talented?
5351383	5352644	She's 13!
5353345	5354645	Anyway, why are we arguing about this?
5354786	5356567	I'm not talented, and I can't sing.
5356607	5357848	Why is this guy famous?
5359809	5362711	Would you pay this guy a dollar to play this song on a rock band?
5364253	5365293	Because this one's funny.
5366414	5367754	Well, Friday's funny.
5367994	5369655	Friday's just sad.
5369815	5372275	It's only funny with the video, with the girl with the braces.
5372615	5380418	I would pay a dollar to play Nightman from It's Always Sunny.
5384499	5384999	Alright, anyhow.
5386343	5388424	About a man coming in and raping somebody.
5388924	5389845	Is that it or is there another one?
5389865	5390625	No, there's another one.
5391405	5404792	Marvel vs. Capcom 3's Shuma Gorath and Jill download content are... Shuma Gorath downloadable content is delayed.
5405712	5408834	It was going to be 400 Microsoft points, which is five bucks each.
5409734	5411936	How does one delay something that's already on the disc?
5411956	5413157	That's a very good question, actually.
5431454	5433916	I forgot where the key was to unlock this.
5435117	5436858	The keys fell on the couch.
5436978	5438119	I gotta go find those keys.
5438159	5439160	Down the drain.
5439260	5442062	I'm gonna have to get a string and a magnet.
5447520	5450901	I don't know why that's really funny, but I'm just imagining Capcom putting out this press release.
5451261	5455303	Sorry guys, we had to delay the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 downloads content.
5455843	5460244	We're trying to find a string and a magnet right now to find the unlock key.
5460304	5463245	So please bear with us, and thank you for your patience.
5463325	5464846	We appreciate our fans.
5465966	5466586	Love, Capcom.
5468567	5473468	Yes, we appreciate you enough for you to pay for our download content.
5473568	5475309	I mean, pay to unlock content.
5475632	5476773	Twitter topics!
5477013	5477413	Yay!
5477453	5479895	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5479955	5482657	Going to a tweet coming up first from Defective Candy.
5482677	5486199	Oops, let me turn down the little song there in the background.
5486980	5492523	Defective Candy was sending us a tweet about augmented reality makes the 3DS bigger than Gigantor.
5493484	5493804	What is this?
5493824	5503170	This is a link from Japanator sending us this story here about the 3DS had launched some time ago and
5505732	5509154	Let's see, it's about, you have to remember, I'm reading these for the first time thanks to Twitter.
5510194	5512035	I guess it has to do with the AR tech.
5512756	5513276	Oh, I see.
5513716	5524221	Some folks have made a supersized version of the 3DS pack-in augmented reality card, all for the sake of giving Kobe's lonely life-size Tetsujin 28-go statue some company.
5524641	5528123	And as you see in the video below, he does need a friend, it may well be a me.
5528163	5529484	I gotta see this video, what is going on?
5529884	5531825	Oh, I see, they have this big statue that they did.
5534489	5535049	Oh, I see.
5535129	5544073	So what they did, instead of having the guy stand on the mat to take the picture, they got this gigantic version of it to put the statue on.
5544153	5544833	I see what they did.
5545953	5555757	They took the little pack-in augmented reality thing, put it under the statue dude, and now he's in the 3DS augmented reality game.
5559872	5560872	It's kind of funny, I like that.
5562373	5564574	Sorry, that probably made for terrible radio, but hey, you tweeted it.
5564654	5574738	Alright, moving on to another Twitter from Silversonic1534 sending us another really good story about helping the folks out in Japan for the disaster relief.
5575218	5580821	A rare Nintendo DS, it was signed by a bunch of Nintendo veterans and it was auctioned off this week.
5580861	5581241	Let's see.
5582602	5598515	Uh, it was a Mario Kart DS promo system and it was signed by Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, uh, the Zelda chief Eiji Onomura, uh, Charles Martinet, Martin Lung, who does the pianist for video game or does the piano stuff for video games live.
5599155	5604179	Uh, all of that was, uh, autographed by all those people and they sold it.
5604339	5606741	I'm not sure exactly how much they went for.
5606781	5608183	Let me look, let me see on eBay real quick.
5609133	5610394	Ooh, it hasn't sold yet.
5610674	5613835	It's got 16 hours left.
5613855	5615256	$2,500, or sorry, $2,550.
5615576	5619598	$2,550 is what it's at right now.
5620298	5621599	So if you want to check that out.
5623180	5625161	More tweets coming to us from Tiger Claw.
5626481	5628943	PSP-based augmented reality game.
5628983	5631484	What is it with all the augmented reality games tonight?
5631504	5632044	It's popular.
5632124	5632725	That's right, yeah.
5632905	5636967	This is turning school into an adventure worth writing about.
5637947	5643589	that actually sounds kind of awesome I'd like to see something like that on an even bigger scale I don't know like Amazing Race but for real
5665858	5679789	Anyhow Amazingly real race The amazingly real race on PSP Apparently the program went over very well Very enthusiastic response to that The kids were well behaved and cooperated when they took part Kind of neat I like that idea
5683574	5694899	Remember when you were in grade school and you'd go on a tour of a historical building and you'd have to put on those big headphones and as you walked under certain places you would hear the stuff in the headphones.
5694999	5696140	It was all based off radios.
5697401	5706965	Imagine now if you could use these augmented reality devices to scan into certain codes at places and you would read a little bit about what it is you're at or what the importance of the location is.
5707025	5707305	I don't know.
5707325	5709086	That's what this reminds me of to some extent.
5709266	5709746	I can see that.
5710107	5710447	Kind of neat.
5711147	5714108	Anyhow, one other tweet here from TigerClaw.
5715129	5722592	AMD has made a statement that DirectX is holding back the graphics performance on the PC.
5722652	5725454	Links us to a story from Gamasutra here via our Twitter.
5727755	5728975	A quote here from AMDGP...
5731136	5734538	GPU Division Worldwide Developer Relations Manager Richard Huddy.
5735139	5745845	Quote, it's funny, we often have at least 10 times as much horsepower as an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 in a high-end graphics card, yet it's very clear that the games don't look 10 times as good.
5746366	5752730	To a significant extent, that's because, one way or another, for good reasons and bad, mostly good, DirectX is getting in the way.
5754171	5755892	So, mostly good, but...
5756348	5758670	Yeah, but I guess maybe that's because, you know.
5758690	5759751	I'm going to bitch about something.
5759811	5764475	It's mostly for the good of the game, but we can't do it.
5764675	5767117	Isn't the Xbox 360 all based off a version of that?
5767157	5769739	I mean, wasn't the original name of the Xbox the DirectXbox?
5770600	5770960	No.
5771640	5772561	I thought that's what it was.
5773062	5774162	I thought that's where this whole thing came from.
5774463	5783350	No, it's basically like the Xbox 360 is running on a modified version of DirectX 9 that has some of the features of DirectX 10 in it.
5786127	5811543	but it's basically DirectX 9 alright and one more tweet here from GamerGirl saying which do you think is better Torchlight PC version or Torchlight Xbox Live version and what do you find fun about the game as a whole I would say the PC version is much better and the reason for that is that they tried to cram too much into the Xbox Live one and unfortunately it suffers from some frame rate issues and just a really awkward interface I mean
5811923	5834288	for a dungeon crawler collect a bunch of items games it doesn't work too well on Xbox I mean if for whatever reason you hate gaming on the PC then the Xbox is an okay substitute I've played far worse games on Xbox Live but I just think between the two the PC version is superior what do I like about the game well did you ever play Diablo 2 because if you like that that's why I like Torchlight because it's like a newer version of that
5834656	5837398	Dungeons are always randomly generated Exploring and collecting Level 3 is always different
5860538	5863900	It's random for each person that plays it and I think that's part of the charm of it.
5864440	5876387	Alright, I'm letting in one more tweet here from SSJ100Matt saying Someone took My Little Pony and mixed it with the StarCraft 2 trailer and sends us a link to something on YouTube called PonyCraft.
5883058	5884119	I'm not sure what to do.
5884139	5886019	This is not My Little Pony.
5886039	5886719	This is like Noose.
5887219	5889800	Did they redo My Little Pony a couple years ago or something?
5890220	5890800	They might have.
5890840	5892881	This is not the one from the airs.
5893221	5896841	That's really not going to make sense to me.
5896881	5898962	Yeah, it's like a new My Little Pony.
5902423	5904523	My Little Oni.
5904883	5906504	Somebody has far too much time on their hands.
5906524	5907424	That's all I'm going to say.
5910615	5914378	Whatever, if that's the project you want to be famous for, then cool.
5914518	5915459	That's pretty hilarious.
5917000	5917760	It's interesting.
5917981	5920022	I've seen weirder things on YouTube, I guess.
5920262	5920763	Nuclear Boy?
5921503	5921663	Yeah.
5922044	5922964	I've not seen Nuclear Boy.
5923004	5924105	I love Nuclear Boy.
5924145	5927468	And what is... And it's a great way to describe it to children.
5927941	5932164	And I'm not up to date on all my astrological stuff that's going on right now.
5932224	5933265	Or astronomical, I guess.
5934085	5935286	Yeah, astronomical.
5935666	5939929	But what the fuck is the super moon that I keep seeing fucking tweets about and shit?
5939969	5943011	Something about the moon being closer in orbit, I believe.
5943571	5952334	The moon was supposed to be gigantic in the sky last night, but we wouldn't know because it's been raining for like nine fucking days straight here, so the clouds have been blocking the sky.
5952914	5954194	You missed something, but you didn't.
5954754	5956055	You would have had to drive that way.
5956075	5959095	There's a picture of it from Washington, D.C.
5959976	5960196	Yes.
5960616	5961416	The supermoon.
5961696	5962937	See, there it is big.
5963197	5964057	Oh, that's dumb.
5965083	5966004	That's not big at all.
5966144	5968146	But the moon's really big, Loki.
5968166	5969106	There's another one.
5969126	5970508	It's a super moon.
5971068	5971989	Over Los Angeles.
5972469	5978054	And since it's over Los Angeles, it's orange with a big rip across it like an Evangelion or something.
5979335	5979976	Seriously.
5980596	5981377	Now I can see that.
5983158	5984279	All right, let's move on.
5984660	5985640	Twitter topics are done.
5985660	5986541	So back into the news.
5986621	5987462	Loki, what do you got for us?
5988177	5992180	Yeah, so... Supermoon.
5993061	5996724	This has been kind of a thing that's been going on with Australia for the longest time.
5998186	6003892	Take violent game, ban it, because hey, you know what, we don't have anything that's for adults.
6004552	6005593	So, too bad.
6006635	6017786	So apparently, Mortal Kombat, they appealed the failure to rate the game, because it was not classified as R15.
6019028	6022113	and instead their appeal was rejected.
6022534	6028825	So now, unless changes are made, they cannot release it in Australia.
6030697	6031558	So that kind of sucks.
6032859	6035862	And it will ban the title from official retail distribution.
6036423	6038825	And of course, Warner Bros.
6038845	6040547	Games is extremely disappointed.
6041368	6042429	That's always the comment.
6042489	6043690	We're extremely disappointed.
6044191	6045692	I'd be like, we're fucking pissed.
6046213	6048515	That would be my fucking press statement right there.
6049116	6050197	Fuck them in their asses.
6050417	6050918	We're pissed.
6052957	6061005	and they were praising thousands of Mortal Kombat fans in Australia and around the world who have voiced their support during the appeal process.
6061929	6064211	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
6064411	6064931	Really?
6064991	6065792	Are you surprised?
6065812	6068754	I mean, they banned games with lesser crap in there.
6070855	6072817	Not to say that this will always be the case.
6072977	6086266	In fact, they're actually pressing the... I guess the Australian federal government is... They're hoping to have a consensus on the R18 game rating creation.
6086926	6090729	Which is stupid that this is all government-run anyways, but whatever.
6092930	6113818	of course the MA 15 plus that the country already has for mature games is not good enough for some of these so adding the restricted 18 plus rating will allow them to release some of these more mature games into the country
6117260	6132312	I foreshadow that if there's not consensus around this issue, the Commonwealth will certainly be considering other options because we cannot continue to have an outdated classification system that's actually, in my view, causing harm to young people.
6134258	6136760	The Saw movies aren't banned there, right?
6137120	6137600	I don't think so.
6137640	6139682	What I saw in this game was no worse than Saw.
6139982	6142864	I mean, I'm always going to use that as my defense.
6142904	6144665	Those goddamn Saw movies are terrible.
6144685	6149348	Well, I don't understand how they always rate games as, well, it's interactive, so it's more violent.
6149528	6150809	No, I don't think so.
6175842	6176643	Thanks for watching!
6190126	6195729	Then there's more serious problems with them than them playing a violent game.
6196309	6199690	I'm fine with them taking violence out of video games completely.
6199730	6204252	They could just strip every video game out there of violence as long as we could get ample nudity in its place.
6204793	6206253	That's what I'm saying.
6206333	6207354	Let's get some boobs.
6207474	6208494	Nudity is even worse.
6208814	6211836	It's like, oh my god, there's a little bit of nudity in this game.
6212016	6212636	Oh, bad.
6213156	6214177	Oh, but violence, we can...
6216698	6244957	Drill holes in this guy's head while he's still alive But as soon as you want to fuck one of those holes, up, banned Wow Well, speaking of legal troubles You might remember that Activision had filed a suit against Electronic Arts and the former heads of Infinity Ward Well, in California, it was ruled this week that the lawsuit filed by Activision against the former Infinity Ward studio heads was
6245277	6248820	Vince Sampanella and Jason West, it will be able to proceed.
6249301	6254926	EA wanted to have the case dismissed, but unfortunately the judge felt differently.
6255506	6258229	They decided there is enough evidence that the case can go on to trial.
6258709	6262672	EA's options now at this point, they can still request a summary judgment.
6263353	6266116	That way, you know, it could all be rejected.
6266416	6269559	But if that doesn't happen, then the case can go to trial in May of this year.
6270419	6271180	It's going to be interesting.
6271300	6274282	or it will get settled out of court before then because that's what always seems to happen.
6274342	6276123	Has a video game case ever gone to trial?
6276464	6277845	Don't they always get settled out of court?
6277865	6279626	I don't think I've ever seen one go to trial.
6281427	6283368	I'm talking about one between companies.
6283428	6288532	I'm not talking about some crazed asshole played an Xbox and decided to do something stupid.
6288552	6290853	That's not a true game lawsuit.
6290873	6292675	That's just an idiot doing something idiotic.
6293075	6296958	I'm talking about an actual two companies suing each other.
6297458	6298639	Does it ever not get settled?
6299565	6300146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6322415	6325157	Because I pulled up the mailbag instead of the story.
6325257	6325497	Oops.
6325777	6326598	Yeah.
6327959	6332182	So, I'm sure people remember me having spoken of the King of Kong, right?
6333123	6339967	And it was the video of Steve Weeby and Billy... Mitchell.
6340148	6340708	Mitchell, yes.
6340908	6343850	I'm sorry, he's a jerk, so I don't care.
6344050	6347052	Trying to compete for the top score on Donkey Kong.
6347473	6351796	Well, now we've got a new documentary out called...
6353417	6354137	and Dr. Kong.
6355398	6371968	And this is about Dr. Qian, who is a plastic surgeon who beat Steve Weeby's record, reset record, by hitting 1,090,400 points on Donkey Kong.
6372689	6376051	So there actually is a website about it.
6376251	6378792	You can go to drkongthemovie.com
6381113	6384054	and... Can I play the trailer here?
6384175	6384695	Play it, sure.
6384735	6386115	It's kind of interesting, actually.
6386235	6386755	I don't know why.
6386775	6387155	It's funny.
6387896	6388356	Here we go.
6388896	6391337	So we see scenes of the plastic surgery going on.
6392877	6395278	Establishing shots of, yes, this dude is a surgeon.
6395858	6397199	I'm copying this to the chatroom, by the way.
6397219	6397419	Sure.
6400342	6402143	And then you see him playing some Donkey Kong.
6403964	6405185	And he has a Donkey Kong machine.
6405285	6412090	I was killing one of the people at Twin Galaxies, and when he found out I was a plastic surgeon, he was like, shouldn't you be out getting laid?
6412130	6413531	Like, why are you playing Donkey Kong?
6415872	6417993	I'm like, I'm playing Donkey Kong so I can get laid.
6420834	6421234	Wait a minute.
6421514	6423656	He's playing Donkey Kong so he can get laid?
6423916	6424737	Like, I don't get that.
6424777	6425697	He's a plastic surgeon.
6425737	6427699	He makes girls' boobies bigger all day long.
6427959	6429740	And that's what plastic surgeons do, right?
6429940	6430961	All they do is boob jobs, right?
6432628	6435530	Well, chin jobs and lipo and... Nose jobs.
6435790	6438212	Never reconstructive surgeries after accidents, though.
6438633	6438813	No.
6438893	6439013	No.
6439994	6441235	Just boob jobs.
6441575	6442175	I don't need that.
6442215	6448560	So he works on boobies all day, but he plays Donkey Kong to get laid.
6449681	6451562	I'm not sure I see the logic there, but let's continue.
6457325	6460086	I kind of like, I don't know, fame, I guess, or glory, I don't know.
6460106	6462646	Congratulations!
6462687	6466027	Paul, this guy's the guy that beat the world, that just beat the Donkey Kong.
6468788	6471229	Now that you have the world record, you have to quit playing.
6471309	6474230	I'm like, do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?
6475270	6480511	That was the trailer.
6481051	6482772	Do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?
6484235	6486536	So is that the big question that's going to be answered in the movie?
6486576	6487397	Like, does he get laid?
6489598	6489738	No.
6490038	6490999	No, he does not get laid.
6491359	6492079	Oh, what a downer.
6493660	6497522	And to... He sounds like William.
6499203	6499723	Stop it!
6500564	6501264	Stop it!
6501404	6505486	Oh my god, Mark, you are so red in the face right now.
6505566	6509928	Because I'm mad that he dared bring that up on this program.
6510028	6510909	You're a dick.
6511349	6512810	At least he sounds more educated.
6516290	6516991	Next story!
6520775	6522638	Oh, put the 3DS down.
6522918	6525201	Loki, put the 3DS down before I shove it up your ass.
6527563	6531108	Our next story, we're going to talk a little bit about Minecraft.
6531128	6531308	Minecraft.
6532222	6533202	Yes, Minecraft.
6534743	6538564	Minecraft, they're going the route of Nintendogs.
6539184	6546707	And you're going to get your own, I guess, domesticated wolf canines.
6547167	6551369	And you'll be able to walk around with them and whatnot.
6552649	6570708	and then of course later on they're going to be adding achievements as well that's the next thing but for right now they are working on pet wolves neat I guess I don't know if they really would do much I mean can you train them to attack things
6573785	6575106	I have a friend who has pet wolves.
6576266	6576466	For real?
6576486	6577046	Like real ones?
6577106	6577346	Yes.
6577807	6578987	Just hanging out in the backyard?
6579127	6582648	Well, a couple of them are half wolves and one of them's full.
6582728	6583709	Here in Sack?
6584009	6584349	Yeah.
6585209	6586289	Wow, that's kind of random.
6586309	6587050	They're domesticated.
6587350	6588350	Kind of neat.
6588530	6592251	I don't know, they're kind of cool looking, I guess.
6592271	6594752	These Minecraft ones are far more adorable, that's all I'm saying.
6594852	6595972	They are pretty adorable.
6596633	6597613	Is he going to punch that wolf?
6598467	6599648	Oh, he's gonna beat it with a, no?
6600108	6600389	Punch?
6601229	6601770	What is that?
6602490	6603611	What is that he has in his hand?
6603992	6604872	Looks like a stub.
6605613	6606994	Maybe it's like a stick to play fetch.
6607014	6608035	Uh, maybe.
6609476	6610757	I still have yet to play Minecraft.
6610777	6612459	I feel so uncool and uneducated.
6613059	6615501	Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.
6615561	6616722	You're so kind to me tonight.
6618344	6624729	Now he's punching a, oh, he punched a cow in the ass and then the wolves are attacking the cow.
6627239	6627519	Nice.
6627860	6631805	So you can sick your wolves on other things.
6632246	6634269	So I guess you can now release the hounds.
6637032	6637673	That's neat.
6640617	6641018	All right.
6641789	6642269	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6671889	6673110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6693969	6696932	I tried, and I just honestly couldn't get into it.
6697112	6698113	It just wasn't fun to me.
6698133	6701356	But it's like the big thing in gaming right now.
6701436	6705299	It's like Minecraft and Angry Birds are the biggest games.
6705319	6714307	Yeah, and if the biggest thing in gaming was for everyone to play their Nintendo 3DS while walking towards the end of a broken bridge, guess what?
6714368	6716209	I'd be playing PSP in my house.
6717911	6720833	The Kodu Game Lab The Kodu Cup 2011
6741631	6743812	It's for students aged 9 to 17.
6744672	6746412	Oh great, the target age group of our show.
6747852	6750633	Divided into two age groups within the 9 to 17 bracket.
6751093	6753394	You will use the software to design your game.
6753634	6755194	You have to submit it by May 10th.
6755474	6768037	Prizes, $5,000 awards for both individuals and schools, a trip to New York City, laptop, Kinect bundles, and a Zune HD, which is amazing because didn't we also have a story this week that the Zune got axed?
6768457	6768637	Yeah.
6768937	6771018	Yeah, they gotta get rid of them somehow.
6771538	6777180	Maybe they'll have like 5,000 Zune HDs as runner-up prizes trying to get rid of their overstock.
6777240	6778560	So, that's too bad.
6781881	6785122	What I like about this is the screenshot I'm looking at of the Kodu Game Lab.
6785163	6788023	Somebody has designed the lost numbers as a computer chip.
6788164	6789904	The 4, 8, 15, forget it.
6791285	6797907	Anyhow, so if you are between 9 and 17 and you want to win money or a Zune because they're so popular, check that out.
6798720	6800602	Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag!
6800682	6814639	Every week, DarkSakura reads the emails that you guys send us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com So, why don't, DarkSakura, I want you to put on your surgical gloves, get ready to jump in there and do some plastic surgery on the mailbag.
6814860	6815781	Ew, it's squishy!
6817532	6818413	Like a boob.
6819514	6820414	No, not like a boob.
6820514	6823377	Like putting your finger up a butt or something.
6824057	6824337	Anyway.
6825058	6825819	Hello, OLR.
6825879	6827400	It's your friendly neighborhood spazinator.
6827500	6833144	Seeing as the OLR mailbag has been a wee bit on the light side as of late, I thought it might be...
6834706	6840453	and Gudum Idea to send an email rather than a tweet for a change of pace.
6841054	6846380	I found a little something of note that bears mentioning seeing as it relates to a subject you folks touched on last week.
6846781	6847602	Must be why I wasn't here.
6849039	6856581	with the recent events in Japan in mind, SCEA's arrangement to relay donations to the Red Cross from one's PSN wallet.
6857081	6864823	As of the time I typed this, there is a spot on the game's site at the PSN store, the first icon you see once you enter the new releases section, that allow you to make donations of $2, $5, $10, $25, and $50 in US funds.
6869304	6887462	I imagine that you could make multiple donations and mix and match amounts as well Although I can't say for sure that I don't have access to the stores in other regions I'd imagine there's similar setups in other regions' PSN stores as well In case either one of you or a fellow listener is asking, albeit to oneself
6888343	6889944	Something along the lines of, so?
6890524	6891185	Here's my point.
6891245	6897949	This makes things that much easier to donate to a cause if you feel so inclined, but may not necessarily have a PayPal or bank account, etc.
6898569	6900190	Such is the case with me, but I digress.
6901250	6909835	I'm not sure if Microsoft will be doing a similar setup in the XBL marketplace, but if I were a betting man, the odds are in favor of it.
6910296	6914278	So in short, if you would like to donate and think you can do without a rock band song, or if not more...
6915098	6930043	and you're on PSN anyways why not make a donation to the PSN stores whispers besides then you can honestly claim that gaming does actually do some good in the fact that it would just really piss off certain ex-lawyer from Florida XD colon minus P
6931411	6933752	I bet he's sitting on a tack going, oh, there's a tack.
6933792	6934632	Damn gamers.
6949157	6949978	Damn you gamers!
6950618	6951638	And you get a cute little theme.
6952899	6958201	And also to keep in mind, whenever you make a donation to charity, get a receipt of it.
6958301	6960002	You can write it off on your taxes.
6960642	6963904	If you are, of course, of tax paying age.
6964584	6965084	Just saying.
6966405	6967185	So you get kicked back.
6967706	6968066	Not bad.
6969437	6970578	Also save all your school receipts.
6970738	6970958	Okay.
6971479	6975983	I would close this email with a clever quip or something, but frankly my brain is fried due to lack of sleep.
6976984	6978626	And the word is lack of sleep.
6979066	6981809	And I can't think of anything currently, so I'll just say this.
6981869	6988195	If you happen to have a PSN account with some spare money on it, please at symbol at least consider donating.
6989075	7013051	and I just think that because everything else is so flawlessly done and the grammar is so awesome you can see the tiredness coming through I can see the tiredness so and I'm like I do that same crap when I'm tired so I was like okay but some of them made me laugh I like good'em good'em good'em I'm gonna use that word good'em don't know what it means but it's good'em all good'em mm-hmm good'em
7014326	7030509	Crunchy Crunchy Crunchums There should be a cereal called Goodum Okay, last email No Apparently the last email is from the Tasmanian Devil What?
7030729	7031789	Dying about fire
7041624	7042144	No!
7043005	7044226	I'm writing about two things.
7044566	7049390	One, Test Drive Unlimited 2 has finally patched and now does multiplayer events.
7049570	7052652	If you put it down because of the locked out bugs, you can play it again.
7053513	7057396	They served this up by installing the enticing update named Mandatory 1.
7062852	7069535	Why has the news lately been talking about how great the iOS devices play games being DS killers or the death of the consoles?
7069775	7070735	That is total bullshit.
7071455	7074617	The iOS touchscreen is only better for certain types of games.
7075017	7078178	Nintendo's 3DS is poised to sell like hotcakes and I believe it will.
7078718	7083860	As for consoles, as long as they are configuration controlled, they will always be popular.
7084500	7089262	I just believe that it's Apple, Apple's fanboys, and Sony that are trying to cast doubt on Nintendo's business.
7091763	7092243	I agree.
7092584	7092764	Yes.
7092844	7100107	I think I've said that on the show before is that the Apple stuff, just the device itself, not all games work on it.
7100407	7103549	And a lot of the ports they show being bad ports.
7103949	7105610	But some of the original stuff works out okay.
7105670	7107371	Like that re-rave game we were talking about earlier.
7107411	7109371	I mean, that was designed for a touchscreen.
7109411	7109852	It works.
7110312	7111092	And it works pretty good.
7111733	7112113	I'm sorry.
7112153	7112613	Pretty good-em.
7113733	7114014	All right.
7114414	7114774	Pretty well.
7115714	7116675	Any other emails tonight?
7116835	7117235	Pretty well.
7117415	7117715	Well-em.
7118496	7118816	Well-em.
7120437	7120977	No, that's it, Rob.
7121522	7128925	Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email to possibly maybe read on next week's show.
7129065	7129505	Maybe.
7130326	7134287	But for now, some angst in the segment we call FUs of the Week.
7136388	7136548	Um...
7153567	7156329	FU, this is sort of an FU, to jury duty.
7157210	7163814	I mean, I know it's my civic duty, and actually I kind of want to be on a case, but right now, I don't have to go in tomorrow, so I'm very happy.
7165015	7167877	You should reschedule yours for May 9th, because that's the night you find.
7168557	7168797	Okay.
7170118	7174021	Well, I actually am going to have to reschedule mine for after school, because I can't have anything...
7174954	7175655	Here's my FU.
7176195	7181019	FU to the damn light cycle that I'm having to model in Maya.
7182480	7184762	I've gotten the tail of it done, finally.
7185663	7187564	But I'm having a hell of a time with the curve.
7189726	7192848	I can't get Maya installed on my computer, so it's pissing me off.
7193929	7198893	And I don't really feel like going to hang out at the Mac Lab all day using the Mac Lab to try to get it to work.
7199693	7201535	So Maya can bite my butt.
7205370	7207872	I'm probably going to not get an A in this class.
7208772	7209713	I kind of don't care.
7209793	7210614	I just want to pass it.
7211555	7213636	Because guess who's graduating this semester?
7213997	7214837	That would be me!
7215858	7217620	Okay, I'm done.
7218220	7220802	I'm just reminded of a scene from Strangers with Candy.
7220982	7221863	I got a D!
7224125	7224585	You know what?
7224785	7225046	What?
7226187	7227428	I have not gotten a D at all.
7229549	7230210	What about an F?
7231334	7235416	The only reason I got an F is because I dropped the class and they didn't register me on the books that I dropped it.
7235897	7237318	F for fantastic work.
7238979	7239339	Loki!
7239579	7243781	F for fuck this place!
7244542	7254888	I would say probably F you to colds and having my son have a cold because he's really cranky.
7255348	7262311	And if you did tape gun and attacked my finger earlier this week, I now have multiple cuts on my finger.
7262331	7263431	Did it jump up and bite you?
7264391	7265292	Something like that.
7265312	7268233	That looks painful, my god.
7268513	7270894	It wasn't that painful, but yeah, there's like five.
7271234	7279737	Imagine if you cut yourself with, not necessarily a piece of paper, but maybe like a knife, just like a small cut.
7280157	7286880	but five of those really close together that's basically the tape gun for you and it did that in two fingers.
7287981	7290282	It hurt for a little bit but no more than a paper cut.
7290902	7292123	It bled really bad though.
7292143	7293584	That was fun.
7295265	7296766	That's it.
7296846	7301628	My FU goes to Loki for bringing up my ex on the program on live internet radio.
7301668	7302188	Thank you, Loki.
7302848	7309531	Nah, but really though, my FU goes to tacos because they are amazing and addicting and I really want one right now.
7310432	7312092	Like, just a taco sounds great.
7312713	7313093	Just saying.
7314252	7314752	You know, Rob?
7315013	7315173	What?
7315313	7316233	We had pesto chicken.
7316253	7316794	You could have some.
7317214	7317614	That's all right.
7318075	7320416	I'm craving the really fatty Jim Boy's ground beef tacos.
7320756	7322718	With Parmesan cheese on the crust.
7323598	7323958	Delicious.
7324759	7325039	All right.
7325940	7327541	Moving on with some more news.
7327581	7330263	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7330283	7330703	But not yet.
7330903	7332584	We have some more news stories real quick.
7332804	7333064	Loki.
7333425	7333625	Yes.
7334225	7338588	And, you know, I don't know, this is kind of interesting.
7339669	7344232	But, you know, this kind of ties in with announcements of announcements.
7344813	7352558	But there is a rumor right now that there's, I guess, a Hitman ARG that's going on right now.
7352958	7356801	That's leading up to the announcement of a new Hitman game at E3.
7356841	7359543	That series is still around?
7359563	7359643	Yeah.
7360183	7362784	Yes, it's apparently still around.
7364144	7372886	I guess it's... Right now, they're saying that... I'm trying to see where it's coming from.
7372986	7385749	It started with an ad from Faircount Media Group in a catalog at Sundance Film Festival depicting a box of the Hitman series brand donuts with a barcode ending in 47.
7386889	7397559	And then it says, I guess, when a Hitman forum user tracked down the agency responsible for the ad and emailed them, he received a response from an account saying, you're on the right track.
7397739	7408448	And then they gave him a new image showing a pair of black gloves that appears to be GameScript and another barcode ending in 47 and some other random numbers and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7408808	7409129	Whatever.
7409189	7412932	Okay, so it's a stupid ARG leading up to the announcement of Hitman.
7413172	7413833	Ooh, great.
7415453	7417414	So, we'll just have to wait until E3.
7418515	7419675	Oh, surprise.
7419955	7421576	I love announcements about announcements.
7422217	7423717	My favorite thing in the gaming industry.
7424538	7430441	You don't... In seven days, we will be announcing an announcement about a game coming out in 14 months.
7431001	7435083	You don't make it so damn obvious what it's going to be.
7435483	7439205	You have to, like, you know, make it completely weird and off the wall.
7439625	7444368	And then, you know, people are like, oh... There will be a trailer announcing this announcement.
7448257	7452180	One other quick story for you guys that has to do with the game Doodle Jump.
7452240	7453480	Have you ever heard of Doodle Jump?
7453660	7455362	Dan plays Doodle Jump all the time.
7455422	7461485	I have never heard of this game, but apparently it sold 10 million copies between iPhone and Android.
7461706	7463227	What is Doodle Jump then, DarkSakura?
7463407	7466368	You have that little dude on the picture.
7467089	7472052	It's like you just turn it and he jumps from platform to platform and you just have to keep him going forward.
7472212	7473713	Okay, so you don't actually doodle in the game.
7473773	7474374	I don't think so.
7474574	7474954	Interesting.
7475194	7475834	I haven't played it.
7475854	7476595	I've just seen Dan play it.
7476755	7478556	Well, they've sold 10 million copies.
7479136	7481717	I think you can make your own characters by doodling.
7481957	7492282	And funny enough, this is the perfect kind of last story for tonight to kind of go with that story that came up earlier about how Zynga's like, we don't want to do our game on Xbox because Xbox is too small.
7492562	7493582	Well, what's the announcement?
7494022	7496283	Yep, Doodle Jump is going to be coming out for Xbox 360.
7499845	7508090	Lima Sky, who is the creative person behind the game Doodle Jump, said that they reached 10 million of their milestone.
7508370	7515214	They've also said that they are going to be bringing the game to Xbox Live Arcade and the Kinect controller from Microsoft.
7515774	7519016	They also want to release a multiplayer update to the iPhone version.
7519336	7523079	They want to do an iPad version and, of course, merchandise!
7523199	7525180	T-shirts, stickers, buttons, yay!
7526738	7527198	Can't wait.
7528399	7536826	So, even though some people want to hate on Xbox 360 because it's too small, some people think it might be a good place for their game.
7537226	7539108	At least the doodle jump people think so.
7540168	7541810	So, that's it for the news tonight.
7541930	7543131	Let's go to the Skype line.
7543151	7544872	We're going to open up the phone lines right now.
7544892	7549776	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.
7550196	7553739	In the meantime, while we wait for some calls, maybe Loki has a last minute story or five.
7554763	7559947	Yeah, actually I do, and let's see, this was kind of cool, I saw this earlier today.
7561248	7565872	We talk a lot about Kinect hacks and stuff like that, but this one's a little different.
7566232	7567973	It's a Kinect hack working on a PS3.
7569094	7573858	And basically it's somebody using the Kinect to play Killzone 3.
7575179	7576219	And it's...
7576920	7578321	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7607047	7610050	This is DJ Blaziken.
7610110	7610610	Not much.
7612932	7619698	I think it was last week or something, Parasite Eve came out for PlayStation Network and I finally picked it up.
7619918	7621439	I saw it was actually pretty darn well...
7631454	7650326	It looks a little bit awkward and really blocky on my 20 inch HDTV and 1080p but looks really good though on the PSP Go and this is a little thing for all the listeners who might have the PSP Go that probably didn't know this or ever figured it out.
7650467	7660193	You can actually sync your PlayStation 3 controller to it via the Bluetooth and makes it a little bit easier to play if
7662483	7670025	If you're at a desk or something and you just don't like the whole control scheme of that, but, oh my god.
7671645	7677146	I mean, for years I just saw the trailer, and that blew my mind.
7678947	7688369	It still blows my mind now, looking at the visuals, even though now we're in the HD age, I mean, it still just goes to show, you know, Square...
7689901	7694682	with a lot of effort into just maxing out the potential of whatever system they're working on.
7694762	7698003	Everything from the original NES to now.
7699023	7700503	I think we've seen it.
7701163	7701704	It's maxed.
7701924	7705744	The thing about Parasite Eve, they did make a second game, but they never really made a third.
7706265	7709845	I do know there's third birthday, but that was years later, obviously.
7711566	7714226	Do you think it's best that some games don't get sequels?
7715166	7717547	Or do you think that really good games deserve sequels?
7718732	7728059	I think really good games, especially like this, I don't know how much notoriety it got, but it seems like a game for potential of sequels.
7729360	7735905	I remember it being a pretty big deal back in the day because it was one of the first Square games to come out after Final Fantasy VII from what I remember.
7736626	7740089	Granted, my memory's a little fuzzy because I'm really fucking old, but it's something like that.
7742050	7745793	Yeah, I saw one of those PlayStation Magazine demo discs
7746742	7775366	and oh my god even though at the time my mom wouldn't let me play very damn games back then too I just didn't have the cash to get it so and now that I'm of age and have the cash I was just like heck I'll get this that's right I'm mature now I'm gonna play all the mature rated games I want and do you know what it's I don't know what I gotta praise Square cause
7775816	7804048	they have probably the best I mean I may sound like a little bit of a square fanboy but who hasn't been ever they always just seem to come out with games with a really great story arc that connects you with the characters and makes you feel like an emotional attachment to them almost and it's just like whoa I will admit
7806378	7834032	if this has ever happened to any of you guys that a game ending ever made you cry it would have had to have been the first Kingdom Hearts ending when Kairi and Sora split apart on two different lands OMG spoilers I could never beat Kingdom Hearts it was hard it was hard but worth the grind yeah, yeah, that's true if you reach the ending it was a pretty sad ending
7835082	7836363	It just brought tears to my eyes.
7836443	7837363	I was like, no!
7837843	7839144	Come back!
7840404	7842465	It's okay, try to keep your emotions in check on the show, buddy.
7842825	7845126	Have you played through Parasite Eve yet?
7847287	7854430	I've gotten up to probably the first boss battle so far, and I'm just getting my ass hated to me.
7854770	7861373	So I'm trying to look at walks through and possible online strategy guides to figure out
7862276	7868098	What the good news is with those older games, there's a ton of them out there, so that's a good thing.
7868358	7868978	I have them all.
7868998	7869199	Sure.
7869219	7869439	Okay.
7890697	7905767	Basically, what would you think, because with the PlayStation Move controllers being so in the way of Wii remotes, if with the jailbroken PS3, someone comes out with a Wii emulator that does HD support for the PS3 with Wii games?
7906492	7912796	It would be difficult because, remember, emulators take a lot more horsepower to run than the actual consoles themselves.
7913256	7923562	So even right now, running a Nintendo 64 emulator on a PS3, while possible, that's pretty much maxing out the resources right now.
7923582	7932908	Yeah, the PlayStation 3 has to emulate the fucking PS2 first, and I'm not talking about the old-school first-generation consoles because they had the extra chip, which is why they were so expensive, but...
7933368	7943170	I find it very odd that we still have seen nothing about PlayStation 2 emulation on PlayStation 3 outside of that very, very first generation of consoles.
7944391	7955933	Yeah, and someone, I don't know where, this is from the end, you know, quote me here, but I heard rumors that somewhere like the most recent firmware update was supposed to add it.
7956313	7957114	I got that.
7957594	7962555	I'm going to try to see if one of my friends can bring down like a Tarko or something on DDR Max.
7963618	7965739	Yes, that old.
7966319	7974102	And if it does boot up, then maybe it wasn't a firmware patch that we just never really figured.
7974683	7979665	No, you would have trumpets and fanfare and confetti everywhere if that were to happen.
7979705	7983286	And honestly, I wouldn't expect it to be as easy as putting your discs in.
7983386	7986708	I think those sick bastards will make you pay for the games all over again.
7987808	7988869	But I can hope not.
7988889	7989809	I sure hope not.
7990327	7994368	I might just get a PlayStation 2 again if it doesn't work.
7995508	8006890	Just so I can have Beatmania, just most of the B-Money titles, really, because, I mean, I have the Rockman keyboard, and it's making me miss Keyboard Mania, because that was at my arcade.
8006910	8010130	You gotta have it for a rainy day.
8011111	8011911	They got rid of it.
8011931	8012711	I don't know why.
8012731	8015011	That along with Poppin' Music, they used to have that.
8016071	8019172	They had just all the B-Money games here at Family Fun Center, but
8020049	8043477	they've traded them all in for random stuff and only once we have left the linked Parapara rest in peace the arcades I remember alright Blaziken I gotta let you go so we can get more calls arcade infinity RIP that was just sad watching the video alright we're gonna go pour a 40 right now alright Blaziken I gotta let you go to get more calls have a good one buddy alright peace out bye
8046976	8052280	1877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Anything else, Loki, while we're waiting for another call?
8054682	8074836	I don't really have too much I was going to talk, there was some other developments with the whole PlayStation hacking stuff and the whole court case, everything I believe they, was it the judge okayed Sony to get the basically people that have
8076296	8091162	Donated money from California Into the Geohot thing They've gotten access to those records And then also they're trying to find A software development kit manual
8092362	8120925	on his computer because in the manual it has like if you need help supporting you're in the US territories call this number because he's basically saying that he was unaware that Sony was in California or something like that and they're trying to find a way to link it to him that he knew that they're in California to which I say who the fuck reads a manual for something like that and I don't think it's actually on his system I think he used open open source stuff to create his hacks so
8122066	8124309	It may be a stretch.
8124670	8127133	But it seems like they're really trying to grab at straws here.
8127694	8129376	Alright, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it.
8129416	8130378	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8130398	8130758	Who's this?
8131760	8132301	Hey, how's it going?
8132321	8133482	This is SSJ100 Matt.
8133662	8134464	Hello, SSJ100 Matt.
8134484	8135585	What's going on, buddy?
8136567	8137368	Hello, hello.
8138342	8138882	Doing good.
8138922	8142104	I just wanted to call and get my late PAX East report.
8142284	8143004	You're late.
8143265	8145526	PAX East was so last week.
8145886	8147527	Are you calling in to talk about PAX East 2012?
8147727	8149228	Internet time, that's like 100 years.
8150168	8150388	All right.
8150428	8150869	No, I'm kidding.
8150909	8151189	What's up?
8151789	8154531	Obviously, you're probably on the way home or something, so we'll give it a bye.
8154811	8155411	Did you have a good time?
8156632	8157572	Yeah, I definitely had a good time.
8157592	8157872	You know what?
8157932	8160434	I liked it a lot more than last year.
8160994	8162535	Oh, of course, because I wasn't there.
8163555	8164096	Yeah, well.
8165096	8166557	Hey, don't agree with that, asshole.
8168365	8168845	I'm just kidding.
8169986	8171527	So what was better about it than last year?
8171547	8173008	You know what?
8173148	8176290	It was the bigger conventions that really made a difference.
8177751	8181974	And I think a lot more people were able to work with the larger space.
8182795	8184396	Tabletop gaming was big.
8186897	8191180	I mean, the spacing of the booths were good.
8191240	8193062	People weren't hidden behind other booths.
8194242	8195643	You know, you're able to see everyone's
8197375	8198856	Everyone got plenty of traffic, I think.
8199096	8205058	And there was a lot more newer stuff there, I guess.
8206058	8207479	They got to play on the 3DS.
8207499	8210300	They got to play Duke Nukem Forever.
8210480	8216202	And one game that I really liked, Child of Eden.
8216943	8217603	Oh, yeah.
8217903	8220504	The spiritual successor of sorts to Rez, sure.
8221744	8222465	Yeah, and you know what?
8222525	8222885	I think...
8223590	8224790	You guys will certainly enjoy it.
8224930	8227791	I'm actually considering a Kinect because of that game.
8228352	8229132	How does it work?
8229272	8232893	Is it really like res but you use your hands to kind of highlight things?
8232993	8234054	Is that kind of what the deal is?
8234954	8235854	It's pretty much that way.
8235954	8240036	You know what, it's weird because there's two different ways of shooting.
8240056	8245257	You use your left hand to shoot, you know, to highlight over and then, you know, push forward to shoot, you know, the missiles.
8246658	8249939	And then you can use your right hand to shoot like the gun regularly.
8250959	8251339	Interesting.
8252280	8253060	So you switch off
8253969	8255771	during the gameplay, which is really interesting.
8256612	8261156	It's really interesting that it's able to capture that with limited problems.
8261396	8269404	The other thing that I really liked at PAX East was the classic arcade room.
8271045	8272126	They had a lot more stuff.
8272466	8278452	I'm sure you remember last year it was kind of set up like Flynn's Arcade, where you had Journey music playing and
8281584	8293109	Well, last year I remember it was just a room full of consoles and you could kind of check out whatever game you wanted to play and do it all that way, but they kind of kicked it up a notch this year with the bigger space?
8294390	8299512	Well, yeah, but I'm talking about the arcade room where they had the arcade machines all set up.
8299832	8302213	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the one that was next door to the console room.
8302253	8303073	Yes, yes, I remember.
8303133	8304174	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8306165	8309887	They had a lot more, I think they doubled the amount of arcade games there.
8310107	8310627	Oh, nice.
8310647	8315889	And they also had a couple of guys from Twin Galaxies trying to beat High Score of Life.
8316149	8316730	Nice.
8317190	8317770	Oh, man.
8318050	8319731	That was one of my favorite spots at PAX East.
8321171	8321452	Yeah.
8321732	8323873	So that was really interesting.
8324593	8326013	I had a lot of fun there.
8326033	8330095	And you know, it was kind of disappointing because not too many people went up there to play stuff.
8330155	8331976	Everyone was downstairs on the expo floor.
8332864	8336006	So, you know, I was able to play all the arcade games I wanted to.
8336266	8336606	Nice.
8338807	8339428	Very cool.
8339868	8342289	What do you hope that they bring next year to PAX?
8342329	8344671	What's an improvement they need to make for next year's PAX?
8348773	8359859	I think, you know, that as much as it was a great plan, the panels themselves weren't... I didn't really find to enjoy.
8359879	8361800	I mean, the thing was, most of the panels...
8362478	8363298	or by networking.
8363938	8365919	A lot of stuff you kind of see at GDC.
8366719	8369360	I mean, I'm not really into getting into the business.
8369420	8370880	I mean, I'm just, you know, a gamer.
8371300	8371900	I don't play.
8372581	8373741	I don't make games.
8373941	8375561	But, you know, they had a lot of panels like that.
8375601	8377662	You know, it's a great idea and I think they should keep that.
8377682	8386884	But, you know, there was, you know, very limited stuff about games, you know, gaming itself, I guess.
8386944	8389625	So maybe they need to diversify the panel lineup a little bit more.
8390777	8391738	or maybe have more rooms.
8391958	8397061	There was only one panel they went to and that was the Xbox Live Enforcement.
8397841	8399462	Oh yeah, I saw a clip of that one online.
8399502	8400703	That looked kind of interesting actually.
8401223	8404685	Where they were showing how they could ban people.
8404725	8409187	They basically just run through giant columns of names and highlight all the colors.
8409567	8410208	It was interesting.
8410628	8411368	Yeah.
8411669	8412029	Kind of neat.
8412869	8419633	Alright, well I am hoping I can go out to PAX East next year but it's a plane ticket so the cost of gas has to come down but we'll see.
8421141	8422603	And it's in April next year.
8422883	8424044	During Passover, in a way.
8424545	8425025	Oh, no.
8425806	8426206	No, no.
8426326	8426787	Get this.
8427588	8429049	It starts on my birthday this year.
8429630	8430551	Does it really?
8430931	8431171	Yep.
8431412	8431752	Interesting.
8431872	8432232	Well, no.
8432313	8432693	Passover.
8433193	8436377	Well, I was going to say, it would be funny if PAX East was around the same time next year.
8436617	8437117	No cake.
8437778	8439760	I'll eat cake on the day before.
8439900	8441001	Space it out a little more.
8441021	8442283	You should come to PAX East.
8444130	8444470	You know what?
8444550	8450634	If I could afford it or if a bunch of people wanted to get together and put the money together and send me a plane ticket.
8450895	8455578	Although Japan disaster relief is kind of important right now.
8455878	8463483	But I'm saying if you got 10 people to put 20 bucks together, that's half a plane ticket.
8463523	8464384	That's just wasted $20.
8464544	8466705	No, I'm kidding.
8467986	8473950	Hopefully things will get better next year financially and economically and we can evaluate that for next year.
8474490	8475151	Take it easy, guys.
8498091	8502815	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio while we wait for some more calls.
8502975	8503936	Loki, anything else?
8505758	8510181	Um... Not really.
8510321	8510701	I don't know.
8510722	8516526	I don't remember if we talked too much about Angry Birds and how much they've sold.
8516566	8519649	Freaking tweet!
8520209	8522011	I don't understand the Angry Birds obsession.
8522431	8522951	I don't either.
8523011	8524513	The game's alright.
8524833	8525533	It's okay.
8525573	8526154	But I mean, it's...
8527745	8529006	There's more fun games out there.
8529146	8532930	I think it's really the price point that sold so many copies of that.
8533231	8535153	I don't understand the whole movie franchising thing.
8535313	8539137	I don't understand the whole obsession with it.
8539817	8540658	People are dumb.
8541059	8551510	That's what I've really come to understand is this whole new casual gaming market out there, your moms and other relatives or whatever, they're playing these casual games.
8552190	8553872	No, they're hardcore now, according to Zynga.
8553892	8554373	Oh, I'm sorry.
8554413	8555674	They're hardcore, according to Zynga.
8555714	8556495	Zynga, you're stupid.
8558057	8559698	They're not hardcore, and I'm sorry.
8560019	8560940	I think that they're kind of...
8562298	8567842	They're not dumb necessarily, but their expectations are a lot lower compared to everybody else.
8567882	8568263	I don't know.
8569424	8569704	Whatever.
8586528	8589069	I totally, totally, totally want to go to that.
8589269	8591350	See, I don't know if there'd be enough for me there.
8591450	8595712	I mean, I would go to hang with people and that would really be it for me.
8596492	8600894	It was kind of like when I went to that anime con in Chicago, the ASEN con that I did a little panel at.
8600914	8601974	I want to go to ASEN too.
8602694	8609657	I had a good time hanging with people, but the con itself was just We need to see about getting in for fanime.
8609677	8610877	I mean, we need to talk to our people.
8611478	8611618	Yeah.
8611638	8613138	All right, we got another call coming in.
8613158	8613638	Let's take it.
8613959	8614759	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.
8614779	8615059	Who's this?
8616608	8617808	Hi, this is Spazineater.
8617888	8619029	Hey buddy, how you doing, Spazineater?
8619969	8620809	Yeah, pretty good, you?
8622310	8625631	Two quick items.
8625851	8628072	One question and one comment.
8628092	8632253	The comment first, sorry about the typos and all that in my email.
8632373	8633833	I'm just giving a hard time.
8633873	8635494	She just gives everybody shit, don't worry about it.
8635514	8637315	I give people I like a hard time.
8637435	8638895	It's called love.
8640395	8640916	Yeah, I know.
8643233	8649437	Now as far as my question, now seeing that Microsoft is basically doing away with the zone,
8651499	8657722	Are they going to ax the video marketplace as well on Xbox Live?
8657802	8658502	No.
8658702	8660803	That was around before the Zoom.
8660863	8661904	When did the Zoom come out?
8661944	8666786	The Zoom came out about a year after Xbox was out and I seem to recall that video marketplace was going pretty early.
8667226	8668006	So, no.
8668106	8670667	I mean, if they can still sell movies on there, they're going to do it.
8671808	8677550	Even though the Zoom's going away, don't forget they still have the Windows mobile phones and I think that's really kind of where they're focusing.
8677590	8678290	I mean, think about it.
8679031	8679811	A lot of the
8680231	8684997	The marketplace for the iOS is centered around the iPhone.
8685378	8689843	I mean, granted, you have your iPads and you have your iPod Touches still.
8690287	8708034	But I think the iPhone claims a pretty fair share of that market So I think the Zune fading out is more Microsoft kind of aligning itself Instead of doing a Zune phone, now they have this Windows 7 phone or whatever it is So no, you're not going to see the movie stuff go away Especially, God, how could you?
8708094	8717278	Especially with Netflix, Hulu they've announced for the end of the year And all this other stuff Yeah, it's only going to be more
8719499	8730925	You know, I was just kind of curious because now that I got a computer and I use Zune Marketplace on my computer, I'm just going to use a whole lot more now.
8731425	8737067	You'll probably see it get rebranded as like, you know, the Windows Mobile or Windows.
8737408	8738348	It'll get rebranded.
8738428	8742710	They'll probably walk away from that Zune name, but it'll still be there.
8744036	8744497	Oh, alright.
8744777	8746439	Thanks for taking my call.
8746479	8747520	I definitely appreciate it.
8747680	8748581	No problem, buddy.
8748601	8749182	You have a good one.
8750163	8751064	Alright, you have a good one.
8751144	8751445	Later.
8752586	8754929	Wow, that was a neat call because he said, hey, I got a question.
8754969	8755429	We answered it.
8755449	8757291	He's like, okay, bye.
8758012	8758513	I like that.
8758753	8761536	Alright, so since that call was so fast, we'll go ahead and do one more call.
8761576	8762477	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8762497	8762798	Who's this?
8764252	8764652	Hi, guys.
8764852	8765493	Can you guys hear me?
8765533	8765973	We can.
8766253	8766574	Who's this?
8767334	8768575	Hi, it's DDR Dollar Bill.
8768775	8769876	Hey, DDR Dollar Bill.
8769916	8770336	How you doing?
8771137	8772177	Hey, doing all right, man.
8773558	8777141	Just figured I just want to make it quick because I don't want to take too long.
8777341	8779102	I just want to give my impressions on PAX East.
8779222	8779863	Hey, you're late.
8780243	8780823	No, that's all right.
8781884	8783865	You were driving in the car with Ranma last week, right?
8784526	8785186	Yes, I was.
8785286	8787148	Okay, well, you didn't get to talk because you were probably driving.
8787168	8788689	So what did you think of PAX East?
8790636	8792097	I enjoyed it, heavily.
8794138	8798420	My favorite part was something that not many people really understood.
8799120	8802182	It wasn't really the games, it wasn't really the panels.
8803202	8807004	It was the actual fact that I actually got to interview some of the developers.
8808025	8814868	Oh, so just being close and getting to interact with people that are usually behind closed doors at trade shows.
8816048	8816709	Exactly.
8816729	8816809	Okay.
8818568	8820389	Who are some of the developers you got to talk to?
8821310	8843950	I got to talk to one guy from Microsoft who was developing the upcoming Fire Pro Wrestling release on Xbox Live Arcade I was really interested because Fire Pro Wrestling I don't know how many people know this but it's like a really old school wrestling game that was hailed heavily because I've actually got a couple of Fire Pro Wrestling games
8845444	8846204	What's that?
8846244	8849325	We've got the Dreamcast one that had the Virtua Fighter characters in it.
8850865	8854106	Oh, you mean the All Japan featuring Virtua?
8854546	8856866	That had a wolf in it, yeah.
8857767	8859127	Yeah, and the Giant Graham series.
8859387	8862328	Yeah, but I think we've got one of the Fire Pro.
8864448	8866488	I think the Dreamcast, yeah, D it's called.
8866708	8866969	Yeah.
8868249	8871930	Yeah, this one actually uses your avatars as wrestlers.
8872630	8873410	Oh, that's pretty sweet.
8873770	8873950	Fun.
8874810	8880951	Oh yeah, and from what I was told, you actually have to develop the moves from the beginning.
8880991	8886592	So you start off at level 1, and you basically keep fighting, and the more levels you get, the more moves you get.
8888593	8897395	And the moves from what I've seen so far, they seem kind of more arcade-ish, not as so much like the current wrestling games like SmackDown vs. Raw and all that.
8898975	8899215	But,
8900086	8921205	I think if it works well, I think it would actually be a nice hit, especially if you use your avatars and whatnot So you liked getting close to the developers, and it's funny because on a previous call, SJ100 Matt was talking about the panels were a little much on the side of how to get into the business Did you find that same thing to be true, or did you kind of like that?
8923096	8933808	Um, I found that to be the same thing, and to be quite honest, I actually liked it, because it actually showed me a side of gaming I've never really, you know, explored.
8934309	8939675	Like the developing side, the, um... You just discovered a whole new side of yourself you never knew was there before.
8942437	8945298	Oh yeah, I could show you how much video I was doing, yeah.
8945978	8946278	Nice.
8946939	8952080	You know, I remember when I went to PAX the first year, PAX Prime, one of the games they were showing was Warhammer, and it was pretty cool.
8952541	8956182	The Warhammer Online one, the WoW killer that didn't really end up killing WoW.
8956502	8961043	But it was cool to be able to kind of like, because one of the guys, I was playing the game, he just came up and was talking to me about it.
8961083	8961704	It was really cool.
8962984	8964265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8989622	8990963	I had two more interviews like that.
9010038	9012000	I'm going to get the name wrong, but it's called iRacing.
9012780	9017184	It was like a racing simulator type, kind of like Gran Turismo for the PC.
9018005	9023589	And you had to play against real players, not computer AI.
9025170	9029594	And I was actually sitting down there with the driving wheel, with the voice feedback and everything.
9030975	9035778	After about maybe 10 minutes of driving, and I had to stop because I wanted to do other things.
9036744	9040708	I actually felt my body going forward, like the whole inertia.
9041309	9041629	Oh, wow.
9042450	9046495	Yeah, I was like, wow.
9046555	9056405	I was like slowly walking away like... That sounds like my first time with a 3DS, but... Oh, I had to turn that 3D off.
9056445	9057086	I couldn't see.
9057106	9057467	Yeah.
9058617	9060838	I was half blind when I tried it.
9061298	9062139	It was just too much headache.
9062259	9064920	It's so interesting to hear different people's reactions to that.
9064960	9067541	I'm so curious to see what's going to happen when that thing comes out for the public.
9068921	9069301	I know.
9069581	9071042	Best Buy already has a demo unit out.
9071422	9071902	Oh, yeah.
9071922	9073483	I heard a lot of places are getting the demo units.
9073563	9075564	So they're pretty easy to get your hands on now.
9075584	9076464	I mean, they're out Sunday.
9076844	9078985	This is not something that's coming out like six months from now.
9079045	9080066	It's out like soon.
9080086	9083167	Yeah, I'll probably pick it up later.
9083587	9085788	But one last thing, though, about 3D real quick.
9086798	9113401	I also saw the Nvidia 3D cards and for some reason 3DS and most 3D TVs I can't really use the 3D because it makes me dizzy but when I was playing when I was trying out Warcraft in 3D on three screens no problems whatsoever I can only imagine what that must be like that must be insane that's too much wow did I really say that?
9113766	9114386	It's too much wow.
9115367	9115647	All right.
9115967	9116728	Oh, Rob.
9117188	9118229	It's not such a thing.
9118269	9119149	DDR dollar bill.
9119669	9121410	I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth.
9121430	9122051	That's why I said it.
9122071	9124612	Is this the same woman that I've hosted this show with for nine years?
9124632	9126133	That's why I said it, Rob.
9126633	9127133	It's crazy.
9127153	9128034	It's called irony.
9128074	9128634	It's crazy.
9130556	9131537	I just like the 3D.
9131557	9133038	It's like, wow, I can actually see it.
9133098	9138263	The first sign of the end of the world coming in 2012 was when DarkSakura admitted to liking Warcraft.
9138283	9139304	That was like the first sign.
9139344	9139564	All right.
9139944	9140204	Anyhow.
9140465	9140725	All right.
9141105	9143107	DDR Dollar Bill, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9143127	9144088	But thanks so much for your call, buddy.
9144408	9145909	And glad to hear you had fun at PAX East.
9147050	9147650	See you next year.
9147810	9147991	Later.
9169958	9176621	Well, it was like a 17-hour drive to get to Prosser, so I would imagine tack on another four to that to get to Seattle.
9176661	9182343	No, because you can get to Portland in 10, and Seattle's another three to four from Portland.
9182603	9184644	But that's just a straight shot up five.
9184744	9185364	Well, yeah.
9185384	9187145	To get to where you're going, you have to go through more hilly roads.
9187165	9188165	We went, I think, the 93.
9188545	9192347	Yeah, you gotta go through weird... No, Seattle's just a straight shot up five.
9193947	9195928	See, my ride's quite a bit longer.
9196428	9198569	And we actually didn't go through that part of Oregon.
9198609	9199889	We stopped in Bend.
9200629	9202030	You know what, DarkSakura?
9202090	9205711	I already know Loki's not going to come because of the baby, but you and I should rent a van.
9207532	9208872	We're doing it.
9209192	9209912	I can't promise you.
9209952	9210413	Money, money.
9211073	9212093	I know, I need money.
9213153	9214074	Alright, we'll see.
9214614	9216094	More to develop in the future.
9216415	9219936	Let me just do one more check with Loki on any last minute stories and then we're going to wrap up the show.
9220396	9220696	Nah.
9222509	9224454	You just want to get out of here and play more Motorstorm.
9225259	9252283	yeah I won't get to play more Motorstorm at home I could I mean it's just you know a TV and stuff alright well we're gonna go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show but first we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts Loki I guess we'll start with you tonight you have a final thought for our listeners I will be playing lots of Motorstorm at work though that's for sure it's such an awesome game and DarkSakura your final thought tonight
9254899	9258983	We have Girl Scout cookies and I am going to be wonderful and not eat one.
9260764	9263907	My final thought is I will happily eat that Girl Scout cookie on your behalf.
9264788	9266069	But what I really want is a taco.
9266429	9267630	A taco Girl Scout cookie.
9271154	9271514	Rob.
9271974	9272175	What?
9272775	9273015	Meh.
9273396	9275598	Also, I need to go on a diet.

9294026	9295926	So you can show us an American one next week?
9296166	9297087	No, it's not on Sunday.
9297107	9299247	I ordered mine from GameStop.
9299267	9299747	Yeah, I know.
9299807	9304268	But hey, knowing the game industry and how it works, they're getting the largest portion of those systems.
9305168	9307229	So I ordered a bundle off their website.
9307489	9308389	So it'll be shipped to me.
9308449	9309029	So I'll have it.
9310450	9312011	Not Sunday, but the next week.
9312291	9314933	I don't really care because I already have a 3DS, but yeah.
9314993	9319636	It'd be nice to see the American versions of stuff and the different games that are out here.
9320757	9321737	Alright, well that's going to do it.
