7000	8000	Who's the host?
8000	10000	Dark Sakura
10000	12000	Sky and Loki
14000	16000	Tonight, March 20th, 2011
16000	18000	Some big games get delayed
18000	21000	The NES classic River City Ransom will soon have a sequel
21000	25000	And could a Silent Hill game be on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?
25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	38000	It's the show where every gamer has a voice
38000	41000	And we are here live with episode number 406
41000	44000	On this March the 20th of 2011
44000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours
46000	49000	When my awesome co-hosts say hello to the one and only
49000	51000	Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers
51000	54000	I beat your butt at Pinball Effects
54000	56000	It's Pinball Effects on what? PS3?
56000	57000	Xbox
57000	59000	You were literally showing me this while the opening was going
59000	60000	So I didn't have time to process this
60000	62000	Because I just found the picture
62000	64000	Yes, I'm putting it up on our thing
64000	65000	Oh gee, thank you
65000	67000	No, it's the icons, because I think it's cute
67000	69000	Your icon's like, sad face
69000	71000	Mine's like, one!
71000	73000	Oh wait, it's not Xbox 360, the FX2 or whatever, the new one?
73000	76000	Well we don't have FX2, we just have FX
76000	78000	But it's got samples of the FX tables
78000	80000	But we'll get into that in my gaming week
80000	82000	I was going to say, at some point, I don't want to spoil the gaming week
82000	84000	But you should get the FX2, because the shell is free
84000	86000	No, I totally want, I totally want
86000	87000	Oh yeah, go for it
87000	89000	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello
89000	92000	As he does every week, to the one and only tech master, Loki!
92000	93000	Hi
93000	94000	How are you, Loki?
94000	95000	Good
95000	96000	Awesome
96000	98000	And Loki's brought some new toys to the show tonight
98000	99000	That he's been showing off
99000	100000	Yes
100000	102000	You want to tell our listeners about what you've brought to the studio?
102000	105000	I brought a 3DS from Japan
105000	108000	I'm not privy enough to get one of the US ones early
108000	111000	I am going to be getting one on time, though
111000	112000	Nice
112000	115000	With Street Fighter, because that's the bundle I picked
115000	119000	And then, Motor Store Apocalypse
119000	121000	I got review code for that because
121000	123000	Because Sony loves me so much
123000	125000	Or because I bought it off eBay
125000	127000	Nice
127000	130000	Photographic evidence now on orangerealgeradio.com
130000	133000	Yes, I noticed you've been taking pictures over and over there
133000	135000	And you've been uploading them to orangerealgeradio.com
135000	137000	I actually took a picture on the 3DS of myself
137000	139000	So I can see myself in 3D
139000	141000	Because looking in the mirror obviously isn't good enough
141000	143000	I wanted to see what I would look like on a 3DS in the picture
143000	146000	But unfortunately I can't upload that
146000	147000	You can
147000	148000	Oh, can you?
148000	152000	But it's a format that only 3D devices can read
152000	154000	It's like an ITG
154000	157000	It's some sort of weird format
157000	159000	But it's for 3D devices
159000	161000	So it wouldn't do me any good to upload it to orangerealgeradio.com
161000	163000	Because no one would see it
163000	165000	You wouldn't be able to see it unless you have
165000	169000	Like a 3DS
169000	172000	Or maybe some of those special cameras
172000	174000	Or the phones or whatever that can view 3D stuff
174000	176000	Or maybe a 3D TV
176000	178000	I don't know if you can view pictures on a 3D TV
178000	180000	I would not want to blow up that picture to the size of a 50 inch television
180000	182000	No, look at my crap
182000	184000	I noticed the resolution on the cameras
184000	186000	They're VJ cameras
186000	189000	It's really just a gimmicky thing right now
189000	191000	But like 10 year olds will have a field day with it
191000	193000	I'm having a field day with it
193000	194000	Are you really?
194000	196000	I have to admit I was nosy
196000	198000	The first thing I did before I took a picture of myself
198000	200000	Is I looked at everything you were taking pictures of
200000	202000	And it's this cat
202000	204000	Oh it's the cat
204000	206000	Oh look more pictures of the cat
206000	208000	Here's a picture of his desk at work
208000	210000	Oh and here's the cat again
210000	212000	Well she was there at the time
212000	214000	That's why I took a picture of her
214000	216000	She's so exploited
216000	218000	It works really well with stuff that has a lot of depth in it
218000	220000	Because if you just take a picture of
220000	222000	I took a picture of triple baked pizza
222000	224000	Thankfully my nose is gigantic
224000	226000	So there's a lot of depth there
226000	228000	You can actually almost
228000	230000	The photo that I took of the game while I was playing it
230000	232000	You can actually almost see the 3D in it
232000	234000	It's actually kind of neat
234000	236000	Almost
236000	238000	You can actually see the layers in the image
238000	240000	Is what you can see
240000	242000	Eventually it'll be kind of cool
242000	244000	Because maybe you can download the pictures
244000	246000	Through the web browser
246000	248000	When it comes out in May
248000	250000	That's awesome
250000	252000	Um
252000	254000	Yeah it's been pretty fun to play with
254000	256000	I've got Nintendogs
256000	258000	But I haven't played Nintendogs
258000	260000	It's mainly just the show off
260000	262000	Because no one really cares about 3D
262000	264000	Although Ridge Racer does look pretty cool in 3D
264000	266000	So I could have just stuck with that game
266000	268000	But I wanted more than one game
268000	270000	I picked Nintendogs
270000	272000	Because whatever
272000	274000	May would help justify to the wife
274000	276000	The cost of everything
276000	278000	It's like oh I'll get you Nintendogs
278000	280000	She wouldn't, no
280000	282000	She doesn't care
282000	284000	She thought Nintendogs was dumb to begin with
284000	286000	I thought Nintendogs was dumb
286000	288000	But I had to see what it looked like in 3D
288000	290000	And it looks pretty cool, very fuzzy
290000	292000	They are very fuzzy
292000	294000	And my whole row, they're just treating them like they're real dogs
294000	296000	Oh the puppies are here
296000	298000	It's our official puppies
298000	300000	Okay
300000	302000	I would play Nintendogs
302000	304000	Maybe that one won't make me feel completely
304000	306000	Violently ill to my stomach
306000	308000	I used to play it for like 15 minutes
308000	310000	I used to play it for 15 minutes
310000	312000	During my break at work
312000	314000	And then I would forget about my puppies
314000	316000	And they would run away
316000	318000	Are you gonna get one at launch?
318000	320000	I might have to wait a little bit
320000	322000	Yeah it's probably fine
322000	324000	There's only one game
324000	326000	Other than
326000	328000	Street Fighter
328000	330000	That I'm getting with the US one
330000	332000	And Street Fighter is kind of like eh
332000	334000	It was either, well the three options I had were
334000	336000	Street Fighter, Samurai Warriors
336000	338000	Which eh, don't care about Samurai Warriors
338000	340000	And uh
340000	342000	I'm trying to think of the other one
342000	344000	I don't remember
344000	346000	Madden or something like that
346000	348000	I don't want Madden
348000	350000	So I picked Street Fighter
350000	352000	And then I'll probably pick up Pilotwings
352000	354000	Because I want to play Pilotwings
354000	356000	Yeah I would play Pilotwings
356000	358000	That looks fun, otherwise I'll probably wait for the Kid at Gris game
358000	360000	But, yeah Kid at Gris looks awesome
360000	362000	But Pilotwings, I'm very disappointed
362000	364000	There's only three types of
364000	366000	Things
366000	368000	Well the Super Nintendo one was maybe four
368000	370000	I guess, wow that's kind of sad
370000	372000	Oh yeah because they keep forgetting
372000	374000	Every fifth stage was like
374000	376000	This random shoot em up that you would have
376000	378000	So it was actually like a fifth
378000	380000	Well they have that kind of stuff in there
380000	382000	Hang gliding, jet pack
382000	384000	Sky diving
384000	386000	There's another one
386000	388000	By plane
388000	390000	And then the shoot em up stages
390000	392000	But I mean come on
392000	394000	If you can pull off four on a Super Nintendo
394000	396000	I think you can maybe pull off
396000	398000	More than that, I mean come on
398000	400000	Let's be honest here
400000	402000	The geometry for the levels and stuff like that
402000	404000	You're using WooHoo Island or whatever
404000	406000	From Wii Sports Resort
406000	408000	You have the island, the 3D object created
408000	410000	I keep forgetting that WooHoo Island is like a character now
410000	412000	Oh it's dumb
412000	414000	It's a character
414000	416000	It's a character no one cares about
416000	418000	It's an island, big deal
418000	420000	You know someone can make an island
420000	422000	Especially with the level of graphics
422000	424000	That they're putting in there, I mean come on
424000	426000	This is the type of stuff that you would have seen in
426000	428000	Prop Cycle, hell Prop Cycle had
428000	430000	More detail to it than this stuff
430000	432000	But it's just
432000	434000	That, I mean, right there
434000	436000	Oh you don't have to create the island
436000	438000	Which is kind of a major part of Pilotwings
438000	440000	So you have to model the planes
440000	442000	And weather vehicles and stuff
442000	444000	And then you have to place your markers around
444000	446000	Stuff like that and code the rest of the game
446000	448000	It didn't seem to me that that would have been
448000	450000	A lot of work
450000	452000	You know what I mean?
452000	454000	Sorry I'm just checking out some gameplay video of Pilotwings
454000	456000	And remembering how freaking awesome this game was on Super Nintendo
456000	458000	When it first came out, like seriously
458000	460000	And now that I look at it I'm like
460000	462000	Gosh, the basics for this
462000	464000	I mean it's really just a very
464000	466000	Simple graphic of the island
466000	468000	With the mode 7 trick
468000	470000	But it just
470000	472000	I remember this game was the shit when it came out
472000	474000	Yeah and you know what
474000	476000	I bet you anything that they're going to re-release this
476000	478000	On the virtual console for that
478000	480000	And I will bet you anything they will code
480000	482000	A new emulator for it that everything that has
482000	484000	Goddamn mode 7 is going to be in 3D
484000	486000	And all the parallax
486000	488000	Stuff that was in there, you know, different layers
488000	490000	Sprite layers and stuff like that
490000	492000	Will be offset in certain distances
492000	494000	That's what's going to happen
494000	496000	Well they said it was going to be as simple as anything that had a Z-axis
496000	498000	Would be, you know, able to be
498000	500000	Made in 3D
500000	502000	Kind of neat
502000	504000	In the chat room, the ever present fourth guest
504000	506000	On our show chat.orangeloungeradio.com
506000	508000	Big thanks to those of you guys
508000	510000	That like to show up every week and I love this
510000	512000	Chat, these comments here
512000	514000	BlackWolf, our old pal that does the show before us here at All Games Radio
514000	516000	The Bobby BlackWolf show
516000	518000	He starts at 5 o'clock Pacific when we start at 6
518000	520000	And yes, I'm leaving the pilot wings
520000	522000	Gameplay going because I'm just, I'm being nostalgic
522000	524000	BlackWolf says, fact, Dead Island
524000	526000	Also takes place on Wuhu Island
526000	528000	If only
528000	530000	And GameGuru says
530000	532000	Wuhu Island as a fighter for
532000	534000	Super Smash Brothers 4
534000	536000	There you go
536000	538000	Anyhow
538000	540000	It'll be a stage
540000	542000	Alright, so what else did you bring to the show with you?
542000	544000	You brought a Playstation 3, right?
544000	546000	I brought a MotorStorm
546000	548000	Apocalypse
548000	550000	And it's all sorts of awesome
550000	552000	It's basically
552000	554000	You're racing through the city that's
554000	556000	Been destroyed by an earthquake
556000	558000	Among other natural disasters
558000	560000	And so now you're
560000	562000	Basically racing through that
562000	564000	And then at the same time they've got
564000	566000	A little bit of a storyline going on where there's this
566000	568000	Corporation that basically
568000	570000	Wants you and these crazy
570000	572000	Homeless people out of the city and the crazy
572000	574000	Homeless people are throwing molotovs at you during the
574000	576000	Races
576000	578000	So while you're racing in some of the later
578000	580000	Stages after they've established this
580000	582000	They're shooting at you with guns
582000	584000	So you have to dodge guns
584000	586000	You have to dodge molotovs
586000	588000	You have to dodge falling everything
588000	590000	Like there's just
590000	592000	All sorts of crazy stuff
592000	594000	All of a sudden there's a track where I was racing on a bridge
594000	596000	And this air raid
596000	598000	Siren goes off and all of a sudden
598000	600000	The bridge starts shaking and starts collapsing
600000	602000	Right as I'm racing through it
602000	604000	And that was all sorts of
604000	606000	Cool and then
606000	608000	There's another stage where I was racing on a motorcycle
608000	610000	Then all of a sudden this building just collapses
610000	612000	Right next to me
612000	614000	It was awesome
614000	616000	It was an incredibly good time
616000	618000	Seriously, probably my favorite one out of the series
618000	620000	So why did you bring the PS3 with you?
620000	622000	You want to show it off a little later during the show or something?
622000	624000	Because I'm gonna play it
624000	626000	Instead of paying attention to the show
626000	628000	Oh I'm paying attention to the show, I'm multitasking
628000	630000	When the calls start coming in
630000	632000	It's just like, I'll let Rob talk to the callers
632000	634000	And I'll sit here and play Motorstar
634000	636000	I can't help it if they're not interesting
636000	638000	Well didn't you think, I thought some of those comments
638000	640000	Was very interesting before we had a Dead Island
640000	642000	Taking place on Wuhu Island
642000	644000	As a fighter for Super Smash Bros. 4
644000	646000	And I was kind of thinking like
646000	648000	You know, there could be a trailer that's out there
652000	654000	And it's like
654000	656000	Pilot wings meets zombies
656000	658000	On Wuhu Island
658000	660000	And it's very awesome
660000	662000	Just like that trailer
662000	664000	Which by the way I hated that trailer
664000	666000	I just want to throw that out there
666000	668000	I don't think I ever talked about it on the show but I hated that trailer
668000	670000	I really hated that Dead Island trailer
670000	672000	I thought it was artsy and everything
672000	674000	But like, I just
674000	676000	I really didn't like it
676000	678000	I guess I can get into the reasons why later
678000	680000	Remind me later, I'll talk about it
680000	682000	But for now we always like to start off our show
682000	684000	With how was your gaming week
684000	686000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
686000	688000	It was eventful, I just played
688000	690000	Some Ridge Racer on the
690000	692000	3DS
692000	694000	And my eyes hurt
694000	696000	I played
696000	698000	Pinball FX, which I talked about earlier
698000	700000	And uh
700000	702000	I played a lot of Pinball FX
702000	704000	Actually, just sitting there all night and I updated
704000	706000	My avatar
706000	708000	And I played that
708000	710000	Game with the big
710000	712000	Stupid dragon
712000	714000	You know, where you click the button and they run
714000	716000	And you press, you know, the buttons
716000	718000	And they do stuff
718000	720000	And the chicks have horns, that type of thing
720000	722000	World of Warcraft
722000	724000	Oh okay, I was like, what?
724000	726000	And I like the discussion that we all
726000	728000	Got into yesterday
728000	730000	About what the Dark Stalkers characters would be
730000	732000	If they were characters in World of Warcraft
732000	734000	So we were trying to
734000	736000	Figure out if you wanted to make like
736000	738000	Victor, would he be a drawn eye
738000	740000	Or whatever, so it was kind of funny
740000	742000	That's it, I'm gonna go get some dinner now
742000	744000	Awesome, enjoy the noms
744000	746000	Uh, well, Loki
746000	748000	I know we've heard a little bit about 3DS
748000	750000	And MotorStorm, but anything else in your gaming week you wanna talk about?
750000	752000	Um, yeah, sure
752000	754000	Um, other than
754000	756000	MotorStorm and
756000	758000	Well, let's see, MotorStorm
758000	760000	You know, I already talked about how awesome it was
760000	762000	Uh, the 3DS played
762000	764000	Ridge Racer, and that's Ridge Racer
764000	766000	I mean, it's, they didn't really change anything
766000	768000	Too much
768000	770000	Um, played some of the
770000	772000	Um, games that are
772000	774000	Kind of packed in with the 3DS, like the
774000	776000	Um, what is that
776000	778000	Face Invaders game, which is kind of funny
778000	780000	I took, I took basically
780000	782000	What was the equivalent of the
782000	784000	Drunken Mario Kart picture
784000	786000	With, uh, the camera
786000	788000	So that was fun, I was shooting my face
788000	790000	And then, um, I actually tried some of the
790000	792000	Cards, and you can, there's one
792000	794000	Where you're shooting targets with a
794000	796000	Arrow, so that was kind of cool
796000	798000	And then, um, other stuff
798000	800000	I actually downloaded, um
800000	802000	On the IOS re-rave
802000	804000	So I was playing a little bit of that
804000	806000	And that's pretty cool, I dug it
806000	808000	I was pissed off for a while though, and I still
808000	810000	Kind of am a little bit pissed off about it
810000	812000	Pretty high scores, I'm like, why aren't they
812000	814000	Appearing on the high score table
814000	816000	Didn't realize I had to register for, like, a login
816000	818000	Or something like that for their thing
818000	820000	So after I did that, it reset all my high scores
820000	822000	Thanks
822000	824000	Wah, wah, wah, that's what you get for not
824000	826000	Signing up for the first place
826000	828000	Well, they didn't make it, they didn't say, in order to have
828000	830000	Your scores posted to the site, you need to register
830000	832000	It just says log in and register
832000	834000	How else is it going to know who you are?
834000	836000	Well, I thought I would just take my name
836000	838000	I'm sorry, did I throw logic into this equation?
838000	840000	Yeah, exactly
840000	842000	I'm sorry, Loki, I'll never do that again
842000	844000	So I played that
844000	846000	I dug some of the songs in there, of course
846000	848000	A lot of Kyle Worden music in there
848000	850000	So if you're a fan of In the Groove, you'll probably
850000	852000	Dig that
852000	854000	What else did I play?
854000	856000	Grand Theft Auto
856000	858000	Pretty much
858000	860000	Yeah, that was pretty much it
860000	862000	And there were some random IOS games
862000	864000	I played
864000	866000	Just going through some of my games
866000	868000	I downloaded to see, well, hey
868000	870000	I haven't played this yet, let me try this out
870000	872000	And see if it's any good or not
872000	874000	A lot of them weren't, so I just ended up deleting them
874000	876000	There was one I played
876000	878000	I think it was called Hyper Missile or something like that
878000	880000	That was pretty cool
880000	882000	Yeah, but mainly
882000	884000	Mainly Motorstorm, I've been playing a lot of that
884000	886000	Actually
886000	888000	I'm really hyped about that game
890000	892000	Awesome
892000	894000	Alright
894000	896000	Anything else or is that it?
896000	898000	That's it
898000	900000	Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week
900000	902000	Mostly a lot of the same stuff I've played in the past
902000	904000	So not a whole lot of new stuff
904000	906000	The usual wow
906000	908000	Torchlight a little bit on XBLA
908000	910000	Even though playing Torchlight
910000	912000	On Xbox Live makes me want to go back
912000	914000	And play it on the PC more
914000	916000	You can go chew on that one for a little bit
916000	918000	And some of the other stuff
918000	920000	But I did check out a few new things
920000	922000	One of them that Loki already mentioned
922000	924000	Because obviously as a music game fan
924000	926000	There's definitely the roots there
928000	930000	It's kind of a mix between
930000	932000	Elite Beat Agents meets
932000	934000	DJ Max Technica meets
934000	936000	In the Groove
936000	938000	And I wasn't sure if I was going to dig it at first
938000	940000	Because
940000	942000	Obviously this show has been on a long time
942000	944000	And way back in the day
944000	946000	We used to be exclusively about music games
946000	948000	And we would talk for three hours about
948000	950000	The DDR scene and a lot of what was going on
950000	952000	And at the time
952000	954000	One of the things that was going on in the DDR scene
954000	956000	Was the game In the Groove that came out
956000	958000	And it's no secret
958000	960000	I was never really a huge fan of the In the Groove games
960000	962000	It's funny because
962000	964000	In retrospect
964000	966000	I think I appreciate what they were trying
966000	968000	To do a lot more now
968000	970000	Than what I did then
970000	972000	Because especially coming so far
972000	974000	Now and seeing everything that's happened
974000	976000	Where I don't think Konami ever truly had faith
976000	978000	In that series
978000	980000	I can appreciate what they were trying to do
980000	982000	In retrospect, but just at the time
982000	984000	It really felt cheap to me
984000	986000	And I was really longing for more
986000	988000	DDR. Anyway, sorry for the
988000	990000	Tangent, but just to give you the mindset
990000	992000	I was coming in here. I was coming in here thinking
992000	994000	I don't know if I'm going to really dig this because I was not
994000	996000	Really ever a big fan of In the Groove
996000	998000	But I gotta say, I enjoyed
998000	1000000	ReRave. It's cool
1000000	1002000	It's $2 to download
1002000	1004000	Not a whole lot of songs come
1004000	1006000	With it for free
1006000	1008000	I right away downloaded a song pack
1008000	1010000	That was free
1010000	1012000	So I couldn't tell you exactly how many songs you get initially
1012000	1014000	It must only be like 2 or 3
1014000	1016000	It was 3
1016000	1018000	There was a song pack of about another 4 or 5 songs you get for free
1018000	1020000	And then of course
1020000	1022000	It wants to charge you more money
1022000	1024000	To get extra song packs
1024000	1026000	Song pack 1, song pack 2
1026000	1028000	With a bunch of songs that are very similar
1028000	1030000	To what you hear in the default packs
1030000	1032000	Not a lot of name recognition in those packs
1032000	1034000	You're not exactly going to get Lady Gaga
1034000	1036000	Rihanna type of stuff
1036000	1038000	There's one of them, I actually bought all the packs
1038000	1040000	Did you?
1040000	1042000	I wanted some actual songs to play
1042000	1044000	And I was in a let me buy some stuff mood
1044000	1046000	But I played
1046000	1048000	Some songs, once again I don't recognize the artist
1048000	1050000	But there's one of those songs from
1050000	1052000	One of the Geico commercials was in there
1052000	1054000	Oh geez, really?
1054000	1056000	I wouldn't recognize the artist, but that makes sense
1056000	1058000	So I mean, ok, whatever, cool
1058000	1060000	And a lot of the music games on
1060000	1062000	I'm sorry, Xbox Live
1062000	1064000	IOS are set up the same way
1064000	1066000	And DDR itself
1066000	1068000	Being one of them, there's a DDR-S game
1068000	1070000	That comes with no songs and everything you have to buy
1070000	1072000	And song packs, so
1072000	1074000	This is nothing new, the model
1074000	1076000	But as far as the 7 songs that come with it or so
1076000	1078000	I've been playing most of them, and I enjoy the songs
1078000	1080000	They're pretty good, and the gameplay is
1080000	1082000	Pretty slick, actually
1082000	1084000	I like the whole turning power
1084000	1086000	Power dials or whatever
1086000	1088000	And you hit them right at the top
1088000	1090000	And very similar to Elite Beat Angels or Technica
1090000	1092000	You tap things on the screen
1092000	1094000	In time with the song
1094000	1096000	Right when the power, imagine like a power
1096000	1098000	Symbol on your computer that slowly turns
1098000	1100000	From a 6 o'clock position to a 12 o'clock position
1100000	1102000	And you're supposed to tap it
1102000	1104000	Right when it's at the 12 o'clock position
1104000	1106000	But some of them are hold
1106000	1108000	Some of them have multi-taps
1108000	1110000	Some of them you drag around the screen
1110000	1112000	You know, different little tricks that kind of go with it
1112000	1114000	And yeah, I enjoyed it
1114000	1116000	It was really fun on the harder songs
1116000	1118000	And the harder levels
1118000	1120000	Even with Game Center
1120000	1122000	And their own little system
1122000	1124000	As Loki was talking about earlier
1124000	1126000	For saving scores
1126000	1128000	So it's pretty slick what they've done
1128000	1130000	That's kind of what I walked away from the game with
1130000	1132000	Is that this is a pretty slick IOS game
1132000	1134000	So yeah, if you're a fan of music games
1134000	1136000	You definitely want to check this out
1136000	1138000	I mean, it's 2 bucks
1138000	1140000	It's not a bad deal
1140000	1142000	It's unfortunate there's no demo or anything
1142000	1144000	So that people can see what it is first
1144000	1146000	But there's videos online
1146000	1148000	So yeah, re-rave on the IOS
1148000	1150000	The other game I checked out this week
1150000	1152000	This is a demo
1152000	1154000	I don't like to review games based off the demo
1154000	1156000	But this is one very high-profile game
1156000	1158000	I've had a lot of anticipation going for
1158000	1160000	And that's Mortal Kombat
1160000	1162000	The demo's now out on PlayStation Network for everybody
1162000	1164000	You don't have to just be a plus subscriber
1164000	1166000	Regular or a plus can now get the demo on PS3
1166000	1168000	So I spent a little time with that
1168000	1170000	Just to see if it was going to be as awesome as I was hoping
1170000	1172000	I don't want to say I didn't like it
1172000	1174000	Because I did
1174000	1176000	But I felt it was lacking
1176000	1178000	And granted, it was a demo
1178000	1180000	It's supposed to be lacking
1180000	1182000	It was only bare bones
1182000	1184000	But when you get that mode
1184000	1186000	That's you know
1186000	1188000	Fighter versus fighter
1188000	1190000	That's still kind of the core part of the game
1190000	1192000	And I don't know, it just wasn't as
1192000	1194000	Action-packed as I was hoping
1194000	1196000	And as fast-paced as I remember the Mortal Kombat games being
1196000	1198000	However, I am saying that
1198000	1200000	Very open-mindedly
1200000	1202000	Because I realize again, it's a demo
1202000	1204000	I was playing it single-player
1204000	1206000	And I think Mortal Kombat really
1206000	1208000	Best shines in multiplayer modes
1208000	1210000	So I'm totally not being fair
1210000	1212000	When I'm saying that right now
1212000	1214000	But that was my honest-to-god reaction as I walked away from it
1214000	1216000	Going, gosh
1216000	1218000	I was hoping I'd have more fun with that
1218000	1220000	But the fatalities did make me laugh a lot
1220000	1222000	Like a little girl
1222000	1224000	And the trailer that showed the upcoming ones
1224000	1226000	Like there's one where you push some guy's face into a subway train
1226000	1228000	And it hits all the windows as the subway goes by
1228000	1230000	And that made me laugh
1230000	1232000	Because Mortal Kombat is kind of dopey
1232000	1234000	Because you like people getting their faces ripped off by a subway train
1234000	1236000	It was funny because Alan called me out on it
1236000	1238000	And he's like, I don't get it
1238000	1240000	You hate the Saw movies
1240000	1242000	But you giggle at this stuff
1242000	1244000	Yeah, but there's different
1244000	1246000	There's a very clear difference
1246000	1248000	There's a difference with like, okay you must torture yourself
1248000	1250000	For my amusement
1250000	1252000	And there's a difference between like
1252000	1254000	Ha ha, your face is gonna get ripped off
1254000	1256000	Ha ha
1256000	1258000	The Saw movies are trying to be real
1258000	1260000	And teach these moral lessons
1260000	1262000	Through these really sick things
1262000	1264000	That I don't like
1264000	1266000	But Mortal Kombat is basically one step above a cartoon
1266000	1268000	It's about the nether realm
1268000	1270000	It's not real
1270000	1272000	Do you want to play a game?
1272000	1274000	You forgot to feed your cat
1274000	1276000	Now I'm gonna feed you to a tiger
1276000	1278000	Those are the Saw movies to me
1278000	1280000	Exactly
1280000	1282000	Those are the Saw movies to me
1282000	1284000	She was fine, I fed her later on
1284000	1286000	Why do I have to get eaten by a tiger?
1286000	1288000	That doesn't seem fair at all
1288000	1290000	I will say what I did like
1290000	1292000	I'm not trying to
1292000	1294000	Gosh, I'm gonna bring on the hate mail
1294000	1296000	I did like about Mortal Kombat
1296000	1298000	That I was able to pick it right up
1298000	1300000	And it just felt like playing Mortal Kombat 2
1300000	1302000	In like Street Fighter 4 style graphics
1302000	1304000	And that part was pretty awesome
1304000	1306000	Like being able to select Mileena
1306000	1308000	And just remember that Tord Tord
1308000	1310000	Low kick was the little drop
1310000	1312000	Cool things like that, really easy to get back into
1312000	1314000	So that same sort of learning curve
1314000	1316000	Where you were able to kind of slip right into
1316000	1318000	Street Fighter 4
1318000	1320000	From Street Fighter 2
1320000	1322000	I think a lot of people are gonna find with this new Mortal Kombat
1322000	1324000	So I probably will still pick up the full version of the game
1324000	1326000	Even though I walked away from the demo going
1326000	1328000	I just
1328000	1330000	I don't know, there's something
1330000	1332000	But I think online play
1332000	1334000	And multiplayer play
1334000	1336000	And a lot of the other modes when the game's fleshed out
1336000	1338000	Will make up for that
1338000	1340000	But I have to be honest
1340000	1342000	I'm not gonna lie just for the sake of hype
1342000	1344000	Anyway, so check out the demo
1344000	1346000	See if you had the same reaction
1346000	1348000	I talked to a friend of mine who felt the same way I did
1348000	1350000	Very excited about the game after playing the demo
1350000	1352000	Went, I don't know
1352000	1354000	Wasn't what I remember
1354000	1356000	But anyway
1356000	1358000	There you go, those are the games I played this week
1358000	1360000	So chat.orangelandsrated.com
1360000	1362000	If you want to join us in our chat room
1362000	1364000	Tigerclaw in our chat room says
1364000	1366000	Sky, the fatality that looks the most funny
1366000	1368000	Is the one showing Liu Kang getting hit by a taxi
1368000	1370000	Oh yeah, that was
1370000	1372000	That was pretty funny too
1372000	1374000	And I like the x-ray attack stuff
1374000	1376000	I mean that stuff was funny
1376000	1378000	I hope there's more of them in the regular game
1378000	1380000	Like not just one x-ray attack for every character
1380000	1382000	Because I think some of those might get old quick
1382000	1384000	But I cracked up at some of them
1384000	1386000	They were pretty funny
1386000	1388000	So
1388000	1390000	There you go
1390000	1392000	A lot of the same old moves coming back
1392000	1394000	Johnny Cage can punch people in the balls still
1394000	1396000	So in fact he likes to do it over and over again
1396000	1398000	I think he has an issue
1398000	1400000	Anyway, let's move on
1400000	1402000	Some housekeeping for tonight
1402000	1404000	Our Twitter, you can join us on Twitter
1404000	1406000	Twitter.com.olr, all the updates for what's going on with the show
1406000	1408000	Also our Facebook
1408000	1410000	At facebook.com.orangeloungeradio
1410000	1412000	Otherwise we have no planned shows off
1412000	1414000	Or trips were taken or anything
1414000	1416000	So every Sunday night in the near future
1416000	1418000	At All Games Radio, www.allgames.com
1418000	1420000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
1420000	1422000	Is where you can hear us live
1422000	1424000	So, yes ma'am
1424000	1426000	I have an arcade report
1426000	1428000	Disneyland
1428000	1430000	Oh yeah, that's right, you were gone last week because you were at Disneyland
1430000	1432000	Yes
1432000	1434000	Did you have fun?
1434000	1436000	I had a great time
1436000	1438000	Did you do the Toy Story Midway Mania?
1438000	1440000	We totally did
1440000	1442000	It's like a giant video game, I love it
1442000	1444000	Dan totally kicked my ass, but I kicked his butt at AstroBusters
1444000	1446000	The Starcade
1446000	1448000	Is actually now also
1448000	1450000	The home of Star Trader
1450000	1452000	Because they've closed down the Star Trader
1452000	1454000	And Star Tours for the revamp
1454000	1456000	I saw when they had shut down
1456000	1458000	Star Tours
1458000	1460000	But the Star Trader is also being redone
1460000	1462000	Right, well to get all the new merchandise I'm sure
1462000	1464000	So, well that and they sort of
1464000	1466000	Would have to go through there to take care of the hallway
1466000	1468000	If they need to redo the hallway
1468000	1470000	So, um
1470000	1472000	It's now kind of half the arcade
1472000	1474000	It used to be, literally
1474000	1476000	Interesting
1476000	1478000	That's my arcade report
1478000	1480000	You didn't play anything there
1480000	1482000	It's expensive
1482000	1484000	What? Oh, I know
1484000	1486000	Because Electronica doesn't go under the week
1486000	1488000	And they had said that it was gonna during spring break
1488000	1490000	And then they didn't
1490000	1492000	Is Captain EO back already?
1492000	1494000	Yes, it's the original 77mm film
1494000	1496000	With grain and everything
1496000	1498000	It's showing it's age
1498000	1500000	The cheeseball 3D
1500000	1502000	That was not great
1502000	1504000	Here's the summary of Captain EO
1504000	1506000	Is that
1506000	1508000	Michael Jackson flies through space with a bunch of Muppets
1508000	1510000	Lands on the Borg homeworld
1510000	1512000	And turns all the Borg
1512000	1514000	Into extras from Xanadu
1514000	1516000	Ruled by Angelica Houston
1516000	1518000	The end
1518000	1520000	And it's awesome
1520000	1522000	But am I not right?
1522000	1524000	No, that's a pretty good way of summarizing it
1524000	1526000	The end
1526000	1528000	I'm gonna be sad when they get rid of that finally
1528000	1530000	Because you know it's not
1530000	1532000	There's gonna come a time when they're finally gonna have to get rid of Captain EO again
1532000	1534000	For a new movie
1534000	1536000	It better not be Honey I Shrunk the Audience again
1536000	1538000	Because that movie was terrible
1538000	1540000	Let's actually get into some other video game news
1540000	1542000	No Captain EO game to talk about this week
1542000	1544000	But maybe some other video games
1544000	1546000	So we'll start off with Loki tonight
1546000	1548000	There's been a few games delayed from Japan
1548000	1552000	Not necessarily because of the whole tsunami earthquake thing
1552000	1554000	But you could probably attribute some of that to it
1554000	1556000	Starting off
1556000	1558000	Warriors Legends of Troy
1558000	1560000	On Xbox 360 and PS3
1560000	1562000	And Dead or Alive Dimensions
1562000	1564000	Both coming from Tecmo Koe
1564000	1566000	Those have been delayed
1566000	1568000	And won't make their scheduled release dates
1568000	1570000	Of March 24th and March 31st
1570000	1572000	Honestly not a big surprise
1572000	1574000	Dead or Alive Dimensions
1574000	1576000	Has been delayed a few times already
1576000	1578000	For the US
1578000	1580000	And Warriors Legends of Troy
1580000	1582000	Not even coming out on the 360 in the US
1582000	1584000	That's been delayed indefinitely
1584000	1586000	So I'm not surprised one bit
1586000	1588000	And that was prior to the whole earthquake thing
1588000	1590000	So
1590000	1592000	Take that for what it will
1592000	1594000	And then on top of all that
1594000	1596000	Of course this is a little bit too
1598000	1600000	Various reasons why they're delaying some of this stuff
1600000	1602000	Yakuza of the End
1602000	1604000	Motorstorm Apocalypse
1604000	1606000	And
1606000	1608000	Disaster Report 4
1608000	1610000	Well Disaster Report 4 has been cancelled
1610000	1612000	From Sega
1612000	1614000	Which
1614000	1616000	You know a game about wandering around in a
1616000	1618000	You know a city that has
1618000	1622000	Undergone some you know traumatic disaster
1622000	1624000	Might not be the most sensitive thing to put out
1624000	1626000	In a country
1626000	1628000	Unfortunately the game was a disaster
1628000	1630000	Honestly it probably was
1630000	1632000	Because Disaster Report games have not been very good
1632000	1634000	They were very budget
1634000	1636000	But Motorstorm Apocalypse obviously
1636000	1638000	The content based on that
1638000	1640000	I don't really understand
1640000	1642000	I mean I understand
1642000	1644000	You know the people might be
1644000	1646000	It's not like you're racing through Tokyo
1646000	1648000	Or something like that
1648000	1650000	Or racing through parts of Japan that are being destroyed
1650000	1652000	This is like it looks like San Francisco
1652000	1654000	So eh
1654000	1656000	Well you know people are being hyper sensitive
1656000	1658000	About it but I
1658000	1660000	I sort of get it because
1660000	1662000	When you put down multi millions of dollars
1662000	1664000	On these projects you have to release them
1664000	1666000	Just right you know
1666000	1668000	And right now you've got an entire
1668000	1670000	Country that probably doesn't want to be thinking about
1670000	1672000	The apocalypse you know what I mean
1672000	1674000	So for
1674000	1676000	It just I can see where
1676000	1678000	People would be concerned it's in bad taste
1678000	1680000	But nuclear boy Rob
1680000	1682000	That's a whole other thing though
1682000	1684000	You're talking about the little YouTube thing
1684000	1686000	He needs something to distract him from having to poop
1686000	1688000	And then
1688000	1690000	Well the other thing is
1690000	1692000	Not only did they announce it was going to be delayed in Japan
1692000	1694000	But Motorstorm Apocalypse also got delayed in Europe
1694000	1696000	And then later on in the US
1696000	1698000	I don't understand why
1698000	1700000	Because the game is done but
1700000	1702000	Eh whatever okay
1702000	1704000	You're delaying it
1704000	1706000	That's fine
1706000	1708000	But eh
1708000	1710000	Again if your game comes out the wrong week
1710000	1712000	It might get destroyed like Blur
1712000	1714000	I would say a lot of the big reason Blur
1714000	1716000	Didn't do well is it came out the wrong week
1716000	1718000	But it was coming out the perfect time
1718000	1720000	I mean granted it's coming out around the same time
1720000	1722000	As another Sony game So Com 4
1722000	1724000	But I don't really think those would compete
1724000	1726000	With each other too much
1726000	1728000	It was coming out in the month where there was essentially nothing
1728000	1730000	This time it's not the other releases
1730000	1732000	Yeah but I mean I can understand delaying it
1732000	1734000	In Japan but people in the US
1734000	1736000	You know they're not going to be like
1736000	1738000	Oh well that's just insensitive
1738000	1740000	It's not Japan for one
1740000	1742000	It's just completely
1742000	1744000	You know it looks like San Francisco
1744000	1746000	In fact I would probably
1746000	1748000	Be willing to bet it's based off
1748000	1750000	San Francisco because San Francisco
1750000	1752000	Kind of known for earthquakes so
1752000	1754000	You know that's not a stretch
1754000	1756000	And you know the
1756000	1758000	Actually I'm going
1758000	1760000	To say it is goddamn San Francisco
1760000	1762000	Because you know having played some of the
1762000	1764000	Tracks and stuff it looks like San Francisco
1764000	1766000	There is a Sony office right outside San Francisco
1766000	1768000	So it wouldn't surprise me at all
1768000	1770000	You know so I mean
1770000	1772000	I don't understand delaying it there
1772000	1774000	Or in Europe
1774000	1776000	But okay whatever you know
1776000	1778000	They want to wait and release it in May
1778000	1780000	Or something where it's packed full of
1780000	1782000	Releases and fine
1782000	1784000	I really think that they should just
1784000	1786000	Keep it with the April 12th release date
1786000	1788000	It was perfect there was nothing else coming out
1788000	1790000	It was just
1790000	1792000	You know
1792000	1794000	Well are we talking maybe it'll just be a couple weeks
1794000	1796000	Maybe, maybe a couple weeks
1796000	1798000	But really a couple weeks
1798000	1800000	That's going to put it out in a lot of
1800000	1802000	You know because let me put it this way
1802000	1804000	You've got MX vs ATV Alive coming out in about a month
1804000	1806000	After it was originally coming out
1806000	1808000	So if you wait a little bit longer
1808000	1810000	You're going to have another off-road racing game
1810000	1812000	Granted both of them are completely different from each other
1812000	1814000	But they're still both
1814000	1816000	Kind of in the same genre
1816000	1818000	I just think it's kind of a mistake to move it
1818000	1820000	It should have really come out at that time
1820000	1822000	Because it would have been perfect
1822000	1824000	There's nothing else coming out
1824000	1826000	Um
1826000	1828000	It's awesome so seriously pick it up
1828000	1830000	When it does come out
1830000	1832000	Because it's all sorts of awesome
1832000	1834000	I'm going into the chat room
1834000	1836000	At chat.orangetonstrader.com
1836000	1838000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says
1838000	1840000	Actually yes people in the US find things insensitive
1840000	1842000	They bash the event
1842000	1844000	Because it did an episode this week
1844000	1846000	About a nuclear power plant being threatened
1846000	1848000	And everyone was like how dare NBC air this
1848000	1850000	Oh god
1850000	1852000	You know what they need to just stop
1852000	1854000	Listening to those people
1854000	1856000	Because I mean
1856000	1858000	I'm going to boycott your show
1858000	1860000	I'm not going to watch it next week
1860000	1862000	But I'll catch it on DVR
1862000	1864000	Well there's been a lot of
1864000	1866000	I mean I'm just playing the devil's advocate here
1866000	1868000	I also think people are maybe blowing this out of proportion
1868000	1870000	People are dumb
1870000	1872000	On the west coast and you know this as well as I do
1872000	1874000	There's been a lot of talk
1874000	1876000	Like the news is dominated with this talk about
1876000	1878000	Could the radiation from the power plant in Japan
1878000	1880000	Get to the west coast
1880000	1882000	I need to get my tin foil hat
1882000	1884000	Because they're going to spin it any way they can
1884000	1886000	To make it sound like it's terrible
1886000	1888000	Just like you know they were saying oh my god
1888000	1890000	The plant's going to melt down
1890000	1892000	It's a matter of minutes you know
1892000	1894000	Oh actually no
1894000	1896000	Everything's back to normal again
1896000	1898000	Oh but it's going to kill us all
1898000	1900000	Nuclear rain
1900000	1902000	You know fallout
1902000	1904000	Scary
1904000	1906000	Vote Republican or this will happen
1906000	1908000	I mean seriously they just blow it way out
1908000	1910000	Because what else are they going to talk about
1910000	1912000	Charlie Sheen I mean seriously
1912000	1914000	They've got to talk about something
1914000	1916000	Get you to watch the news
1916000	1918000	Look I
1918000	1920000	We've got to be careful how we tread here
1920000	1922000	Because I think to some extent it is a very
1922000	1924000	Frightful thing
1924000	1926000	If this was all going on
1926000	1928000	Like I know they shut it down years ago
1928000	1930000	No don't get me wrong
1930000	1932000	It is a frightening thing
1932000	1934000	But what's going on
1934000	1936000	There and what the reporting is going on
1936000	1938000	There is completely different
1938000	1940000	I am honestly going to say
1940000	1942000	It's a lot like nuclear boy
1942000	1944000	I'm sorry those who haven't seen it
1944000	1946000	The worst that's going to happen is they're going to have
1946000	1948000	To evacuate Fukushima
1948000	1950000	And then
1950000	1952000	Fish are going to be
1952000	1954000	Sick you can't go fishing near there
1954000	1956000	Plants are going to be radiated
1956000	1958000	You're going to have to deal with this for probably the next
1958000	1960000	7 to 10 years
1960000	1962000	I think is what it takes for
1962000	1964000	Nuclear radiation to be cleaned out of
1964000	1966000	Land and our technology is a lot better
1966000	1968000	Than it was you know around say
1968000	1970000	Chernobyl
1970000	1972000	Think about that
1972000	1974000	Right now they're in a position
1974000	1976000	To do that and keep in mind this was
1976000	1978000	A place that was designed
1978000	1980000	To go against a 7.5
1980000	1982000	Earthquake
1982000	1984000	Which was to date
1984000	1986000	The biggest I think that Japan had seen
1986000	1988000	So
1988000	1990000	Something like this coming up and having
1990000	1992000	Everything still pretty much
1992000	1994000	Hold intact with just a few problems
1994000	1996000	That has to say something
1996000	1998000	Pretty amazing for you know
1998000	2000000	The level of
2000000	2002000	Of care and
2002000	2004000	You know thought that went into the construction
2004000	2006000	Of these places
2006000	2008000	You know and also should make everybody
2008000	2010000	In Sacramento shut up about us having
2010000	2012000	Nuclear power here
2012000	2014000	Because we don't have earthquakes
2014000	2016000	Shut up
2016000	2018000	Well I got the perfect location for a nuclear power plant
2018000	2020000	Where the old one was?
2020000	2022000	No
2022000	2024000	Where the kings normally play because they suck
2024000	2026000	So you know what
2026000	2028000	Well they're leaving anyway
2028000	2030000	And hey we can still hold count
2030000	2032000	Aren't we a video game show I think we got a little off track
2032000	2034000	Well but
2034000	2036000	I think that my point is made that everyone should watch
2036000	2038000	Nuclear Boy because it's great
2038000	2040000	You know all we have to worry about
2040000	2042000	Is just mutated dolphins
2042000	2044000	Rising up you know to enslave humanity
2044000	2046000	That's really what it comes down to
2046000	2048000	Now you're making light of a terrible situation
2048000	2050000	Knock it off alright
2050000	2052000	It's not terrible that those dolphins
2052000	2054000	Are so smart it's terrible that they're using it for
2054000	2056000	Evil ok? Let's talk about something
2056000	2058000	That's definitely
2058000	2060000	Fiction let's get away from the real world stuff and get to
2060000	2062000	A land of fiction and one of our favorite fictional places
2062000	2064000	Silent Hill
2064000	2066000	Of course Silent Hill is
2066000	2068000	At least a one time awesome video game series
2068000	2070000	That's kind of slipped into a
2070000	2072000	Ok yeah I really like
2072000	2074000	This series because I used to like it
2074000	2076000	Silent Hill we're experimenting with
2076000	2078000	New weather patterns now
2078000	2080000	So anyhow here's the deal
2080000	2082000	Apparently Silent Hill is going to have a release
2082000	2084000	On Xbox Live if rumors are to be
2084000	2086000	Believed and here's where the rumors are coming from
2086000	2088000	It's an interview with the Italian based
2088000	2090000	Xbox 360 magazine and it's from
2090000	2092000	The art director for Silent Hill
2092000	2094000	Downpour saying quote
2094000	2096000	At the moment there will be no
2096000	2098000	Multiplayer modes in Silent Hill Downpour
2098000	2100000	Konami is investigating
2100000	2102000	A separate chapter devoted entirely
2102000	2104000	To the multiplayer now
2104000	2106000	He went on in this interview to say that he doesn't
2106000	2108000	Know any details but it's supposed to be
2108000	2110000	Xbox Live Arcade and quote
2110000	2112000	That most players have to survive in the
2112000	2114000	Town of Silent Hill
2114000	2116000	Now I kind of look at this and go that's
2116000	2118000	That's silent hill cash in
2118000	2120000	Well Silent Hill was always supposed
2120000	2122000	To be a very single
2122000	2124000	Player experience like I don't see this
2124000	2126000	Turning into a shoot em up
2126000	2128000	Type of thing like I don't really see it as a
2128000	2130000	Bang bang you know kill the others
2130000	2132000	Really? It would be kind of cool
2132000	2134000	If like one person could be pyramid head
2134000	2136000	Really? And everybody else is trying to run away
2136000	2138000	You don't see it as a bonus points for you know
2138000	2140000	Manic and rape You don't see it as a bang bang
2140000	2142000	Shoot em up game but yet Konami does
2142000	2144000	Because they released an iOS game that was
2144000	2146000	Basically that and they released an arcade game
2146000	2148000	That's basically that so they
2148000	2150000	Apparently do see it as a shoot em up Well but
2150000	2152000	Not like shoot other people you're shooting
2152000	2154000	The creatures of Silent Hill or whatever I don't see
2154000	2156000	Where the multiplayer element comes on that's my point
2156000	2158000	But then there's a part of me that also pictures
2158000	2160000	Like a very Left 4 Dead kind of game
2160000	2162000	That actually could be kind of awesome
2162000	2164000	Like and maybe it's like don't take
2164000	2166000	Left 4 Dead literally but maybe some type of
2166000	2168000	Like cooperative survival
2168000	2170000	Game where maybe everybody
2170000	2172000	Helps each other in a certain way
2172000	2174000	To survive the town of Silent
2174000	2176000	Hill that might be kind of cool
2176000	2178000	I don't know That would be neat
2178000	2180000	And I think like a Left 4 Dead style game
2180000	2182000	Would be in demand like right now because Left 4 Dead
2182000	2184000	Was very popular there was the original
2184000	2186000	There was a sequel we haven't heard anything about a third
2186000	2188000	So maybe
2188000	2190000	Silent Hill could kind of release a game like that
2190000	2192000	I don't know that's I mean when you talk multiplayer
2192000	2194000	Silent Hill like I just I really hope
2194000	2196000	It isn't blue pyramid head versus red pyramid
2196000	2198000	Head that would be ridiculous and dumb
2198000	2200000	So it's It's like spy versus spy with
2200000	2202000	Pyramid head Yes that would be hideous
2202000	2204000	So either it's got to be like a
2204000	2206000	Co-op survival or it's got to
2206000	2208000	Be one versus
2208000	2210000	Everybody which now the
2210000	2212000	More I kind of say that out loud I think that's kind of dumb
2212000	2214000	Too so I really hope it's more like the
2214000	2216000	Co-op survival that could be kind of rad actually
2216000	2218000	Can you imagine like having to figure out puzzles
2218000	2220000	With multiple people that'd be kind of fun Nothing
2220000	2222000	Would get done I can think of something like
2222000	2224000	Oh crap Pyramid head's coming
2224000	2226000	Push someone in
2226000	2228000	His path Exactly
2228000	2230000	Sacrifice dark Sakura
2230000	2232000	Hey be like bitch
2232000	2234000	Please smack
2234000	2236000	Alright
2236000	2238000	Anyhow yeah we'll see what develops
2238000	2240000	With that I would imagine if this
2240000	2242000	Is true if big if remember this
2242000	2244000	Is a rumor because it's coming from an
2244000	2246000	Italian magazine from the art director
2246000	2248000	Like I'm not saying that
2248000	2250000	You know that small time stuff but you know
2250000	2252000	Again it is it does
2252000	2254000	Say it sound a little bit like I have this cousin
2254000	2256000	Who's a camera man on you know the new
2256000	2258000	Superman movie and he told me that Art directors
2258000	2260000	Are pretty big Yeah I know
2260000	2262000	But still Dude it has
2262000	2264000	Art director in the title Alright anyhow
2264000	2266000	Hey just take it with a grain of salt
2266000	2268000	That's all I'm saying don't be disappointed if this game doesn't happen
2268000	2270000	I would love to be an art director of a magazine
2270000	2272000	Or if it isn't good
2272000	2274000	I would love to be an art director Anyway
2274000	2276000	Well maybe you should when this guy gets
2276000	2278000	Fired for leaking all the details about the game
2278000	2280000	You should apply for his job
2280000	2282000	I don't want to move to Italy
2282000	2284000	Alright moving on dark Sakura
2284000	2286000	What do you have for us Well
2286000	2288000	Apparently the
2288000	2290000	Zynga people
2290000	2292000	They Zynga sucks
2292000	2294000	I'm sorry
2294000	2296000	His name is Brian Reynolds
2296000	2298000	And he said that Xbox Live
2298000	2300000	Is too small for them
2300000	2302000	To bother with
2302000	2304000	For Farmville
2304000	2306000	That means my mother won't be getting an Xbox anytime soon
2306000	2308000	They're basically saying
2308000	2310000	It's too small of a demographic
2310000	2312000	He says that most of his friends have
2312000	2314000	Smartphones and computers
2314000	2316000	But not too many of them have an Xbox 360
2316000	2318000	That's because your friends suck
2318000	2320000	He's an idiot
2320000	2322000	I actually
2322000	2324000	Kinda get what he said
2324000	2326000	There are way more people on
2326000	2328000	Facebook than there are on Xbox Live
2328000	2330000	Fact But let's look at
2330000	2332000	Hard cold numbers okay first of all
2332000	2334000	There are 23 million members
2334000	2336000	On Xbox Live as of February
2336000	2338000	2010
2338000	2340000	In January Facebook had
2340000	2342000	600 million users
2342000	2344000	And Farmville had 62 million
2344000	2346000	Active since September of last year
2346000	2348000	So basically
2348000	2350000	What he's saying is he doesn't like money
2350000	2352000	I don't see how it would be
2352000	2354000	That difficult
2354000	2356000	I mean really
2356000	2358000	But he's like no it's not gonna be worth
2358000	2360000	Our time for just these people
2360000	2362000	Okay if you don't want more addicts fine
2362000	2364000	Exactly he's basically saying
2364000	2366000	Well why would we put it on
2366000	2368000	Xbox Live or
2368000	2370000	The Playstation network or something like that
2370000	2372000	They have less people than they have on Facebook
2372000	2374000	Duh! It's called expanding your demographic
2374000	2376000	You already have it on Facebook
2376000	2378000	You already have it on smartphones
2378000	2380000	That's why you would put it on a console because you don't
2380000	2382000	Have it there yet
2382000	2384000	Here's what he said
2384000	2386000	Basically the worry
2386000	2388000	Is the social experience
2388000	2390000	Basically the social experience is going to be
2390000	2392000	A very small number so that the amount of
2392000	2394000	Social capital that is there will not be very
2394000	2396000	High so basically you're not gonna have
2396000	2398000	People doing the microtransactions
2398000	2400000	Yeah and I think that
2400000	2402000	Is more what this boils down to
2402000	2404000	I think you know
2404000	2406000	It's a little bit comparing the
2406000	2408000	Apples to oranges and what's going on with these
2408000	2410000	Comparisons yes there are zillions more
2410000	2412000	People on Facebook than Xbox Live
2412000	2414000	But you have to remember that the Zynga games thrive
2414000	2416000	On this very specific business model
2416000	2418000	Where they are free to play with the
2418000	2420000	Purchasable enhancements that's not the way
2420000	2422000	That Xbox works
2422000	2424000	To some level yes you can enhance
2424000	2426000	Certain Xbox Live arcade games with
2426000	2428000	Extra things but you're always putting some money
2428000	2430000	Down up front to play the games
2430000	2432000	I would question sure you might have hundreds of
2432000	2434000	Millions of people playing FarmVille on Facebook
2434000	2436000	But how many of them are actually paying for it
2436000	2438000	You know and it's probably
2438000	2440000	A pretty damn scary number
2440000	2442000	When you know a lot of us kind of sit here and
2442000	2444000	Don't understand FarmVille
2444000	2446000	But again I think the types
2446000	2448000	Of games that you have come to
2448000	2450000	Know on Facebook and mobile phones are not
2450000	2452000	Necessarily the same types of games that are
2452000	2454000	On Xbox Live Arcade
2454000	2456000	It's just kind of like
2456000	2458000	I don't know by the way you know
2458000	2460000	The percentage is using those
2460000	2462000	I'm just going to use those numbers as a basis
2462000	2464000	The percentage of people on Facebook
2464000	2466000	That play FarmVille
2466000	2468000	4%
2468000	2470000	Tiny
2470000	2472000	Tiny tiny
2472000	2474000	So I mean if I
2474000	2476000	Were this guy I'd be looking to find ways
2476000	2478000	To get more revenue in
2478000	2480000	I'd be adjusting the business model do like
2480000	2482000	XBLA version of FarmVille
2482000	2484000	Or my thought why does it
2484000	2486000	Have to be FarmVille or something based
2486000	2488000	Off of it. If your games are so damn addicting
2488000	2490000	Rise to the challenge
2490000	2492000	And create a game that you could get away
2492000	2494000	With charging $15 for
2494000	2496000	You know there are
2496000	2498000	I can't believe I'm about to say this
2498000	2500000	But there are some things you can appreciate about FarmVille
2500000	2502000	And
2502000	2504000	Like it keeps my mother from preaching at me
2504000	2506000	That's like saying there are some things you can appreciate about Hitler
2506000	2508000	No
2510000	2512000	I am not going to go there period
2512000	2514000	Other than
2514000	2516000	Volkswagen and the Autobahn
2516000	2518000	Alright look
2518000	2520000	My thing is that like
2520000	2522000	The thing about
2522000	2524000	Now I'm totally lost
2524000	2526000	I feel sick
2526000	2528000	I feel a little sick now
2528000	2530000	The thing about FarmVille is that
2530000	2532000	It kind of gets your friends
2532000	2534000	Even though it might not be us
2534000	2536000	The people that are the quote unquote
2536000	2538000	Hardcore gamers
2538000	2540000	It gets our moms
2540000	2542000	And our relatives and people
2542000	2544000	To be playing a
2544000	2546000	Multiplayer game together
2546000	2548000	Very easily
2548000	2550000	And maybe there's a way they could bring
2550000	2552000	That multiplayer effort
2552000	2554000	To the Xbox Live place
2554000	2556000	Which in turn could maybe enhance
2556000	2558000	Xbox Live but I don't think that necessarily
2558000	2560000	Has to be just fucking FarmVille
2560000	2562000	No. There's plenty of other games they could rip
2562000	2564000	Off
2564000	2566000	Right? I'm just still
2566000	2568000	Kind of feeling ill from
2568000	2573000	Orange Lounge
2573000	2575000	Making people throw up in their mouths
2575000	2577000	Daily
2577000	2579000	Making my stomach flip flop and I just ate
2579000	2581000	I feel ill
2581000	2585000	Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com
2585000	2587000	Spazinator told me to bite my tongue
2587000	2589000	Black Wolf says that would require that they actually
2589000	2591000	Make something original
2591000	2593000	Defective Candy says
2593000	2595000	Every time we sell one of those Facebook game cards
2595000	2597000	Where I work I die a little on the inside
2597000	2599000	Alright
2599000	2601000	You're just feeding the beast
2601000	2603000	Let's move on
2603000	2605000	Loki
2605000	2607000	Take us to some completely different news please
2607000	2609000	This is completely different
2609000	2611000	They're actually working on a
2611000	2613000	Transformers MMO
2613000	2615000	And it's being developed by the people behind
2615000	2617000	The browser based
2617000	2619000	MMO RuneScape
2619000	2621000	And I guess they've worked out a deal with Hasbro
2621000	2623000	And the game is set to be released in
2623000	2625000	North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia
2625000	2627000	And New Zealand sometime in 2012
2627000	2629000	And they said that
2629000	2631000	The title will be a dynamic
2631000	2633000	And action packed game
2633000	2635000	No word on which
2635000	2637000	Transformers universe
2637000	2639000	It will be based on
2639000	2641000	But that is interesting
2641000	2643000	Let's hope it's not the Michael Bay
2643000	2645000	Transformers universe although you know that would be
2645000	2647000	Action packed
2647000	2649000	Apparently Asia is
2649000	2651000	Also getting its own Transformers
2651000	2653000	MMO from
2653000	2655000	Net Dragon
2655000	2657000	And that's slated to roll out
2657000	2659000	I guess later this year
2661000	2663000	That's interesting
2663000	2665000	Be popular
2665000	2667000	People like Transformers
2667000	2669000	I don't know the MMO space is a little bit crowded right now
2669000	2671000	I don't know if it will be able to kind of
2671000	2673000	Get its way in there
2673000	2675000	If it was free to play that would be pretty cool
2675000	2677000	Hopefully they don't have the expectation bar very high
2677000	2679000	That's all I'm saying
2679000	2681000	The MMO space is a very tough nut
2681000	2683000	To crack right now
2683000	2685000	And if it's not free to play
2685000	2687000	It has to triple be that much better
2687000	2689000	And judging from the
2689000	2691000	Transformer games that have been on the consoles
2691000	2693000	The last one was alright
2695000	2697000	And the next one is supposed to be okay
2697000	2699000	Because it's from the same people as the last one
2699000	2701000	So hopefully
2701000	2703000	I'll try to keep an open mind
2703000	2705000	But I mean
2705000	2707000	We all know that third movie is going to be terrible
2707000	2709000	I realize they're all
2709000	2711000	Now admitting like wow the second movie
2711000	2713000	Was really bad but you know the third movie
2713000	2715000	Is going to be even worse
2715000	2717000	That last move
2717000	2719000	If I'm wrong then I'm wrong hooray
2719000	2721000	But I'm just not getting my hopes up
2721000	2723000	That's all
2723000	2725000	Hey let's talk about music games
2725000	2727000	Ubisoft is going to be putting out a new game
2727000	2729000	It's called Rocksmith
2729000	2731000	It's a rhythm game that uses real guitars
2731000	2733000	Wait a minute
2733000	2735000	That worked before
2735000	2737000	Isn't that a train that left the station quite some time ago
2737000	2739000	Alrighty well whatever
2739000	2741000	It's called Rocksmith is the game
2741000	2743000	Some of the artists that will be in the game
2743000	2745000	David Bowie, Interpol, The Rolling Stones
2745000	2747000	Pretty solid song list
2747000	2749000	Right there so far
2749000	2751000	You can use any electric guitar
2751000	2753000	That you might just happen to have
2753000	2755000	So we're not talking about buying a cheap
2755000	2757000	Plastic peripheral it's using
2757000	2759000	An existing electric guitar
2759000	2761000	So that's neat I guess
2763000	2765000	Not sure exactly how this all works
2765000	2767000	Just yet as to how it's going to identify
2767000	2769000	From any guitar but I would imagine
2769000	2771000	Some type of audio
2771000	2773000	Pitch sensing peripheral kind of similar
2773000	2775000	To how it detects when you're singing
2775000	2777000	What pitch you're singing at
2777000	2779000	It would probably plug into it like you'd plug it in
2779000	2781000	Like you'd plug it into an amp
2781000	2783000	So there is a trailer out there right now
2783000	2785000	It's supposed to be coming out the second half of the year
2785000	2787000	So I imagine that we'll be hearing
2787000	2789000	More about this at E3
2789000	2791000	Okay how are we going to use less
2791000	2793000	I was going to try and play it
2793000	2795000	Yeah but I wanted to play the trailer but a stupid commercial
2795000	2797000	For those goddamn bears
2797000	2799000	That talk about toilet paper
2799000	2801000	We had actually talked about this before
2801000	2803000	It was actually a game in development called Guitar Rising
2803000	2805000	Oh yeah
2805000	2807000	But that never really came out
2807000	2809000	And then Ubisoft bought it
2809000	2811000	Yeah it shows a guitar plugged into
2811000	2813000	The Xbox
2813000	2815000	There's got to be some little adapter
2815000	2817000	Thingy or something
2817000	2819000	It looks like an amp plugged to USB
2819000	2821000	Yeah it's similar to what you use with the
2821000	2823000	Um
2823000	2825000	Karaoke mics
2825000	2827000	I'm sure it's got to be something just like that
2827000	2829000	So
2829000	2831000	I was trying to
2831000	2833000	Look at the commercial here
2833000	2835000	Yeah somebody plugged it in there
2835000	2837000	A little electric guitar
2837000	2839000	Again it doesn't really show me anything about the game
2839000	2841000	It's just hey dude is tuning his guitar
2841000	2843000	Getting ready to jam
2843000	2845000	Man there's so many terrible commercials for games out there
2845000	2847000	Nice guitar
2847000	2849000	Alright let's move on Dark Soccer
2849000	2853000	Well it's been 22 years in the making
2853000	2855000	Da da da
2855000	2857000	There will be a sequel to River City Ransom
2857000	2859000	Yay
2859000	2861000	Or as it was known in Europe, Street Gangs
2861000	2863000	Yay
2863000	2865000	Or I really like the Japanese name
2865000	2867000	Hot Blooded Downtown Story
2867000	2869000	Nice
2869000	2871000	It's so hot
2871000	2873000	The Japanese developer Miracle Kids
2873000	2875000	Is trying to
2875000	2877000	Actually got a bunch of the original development team
2877000	2879000	Back together
2879000	2881000	And they are going to be doing a console version
2881000	2883000	In the summer with a PC release
2883000	2885000	In 2012
2885000	2887000	So the console version is this summer
2887000	2889000	The PC one will be out next year
2889000	2891000	And
2891000	2893000	They're also
2893000	2895000	Got
2895000	2897000	Downtown Smash
2897000	2899000	Dodgeball
2899000	2901000	Which for us was Super Dodgeball
2901000	2903000	Which is on Xbox Live
2903000	2905000	Indie games
2905000	2907000	So
2907000	2909000	Yay
2909000	2911000	If you still want to play the old school one
2911000	2913000	Get it on Virtual Consoles
2913000	2915000	500 points
2915000	2917000	And to this day my favorite version is still the PC Engine one
2917000	2919000	This is news I want to be excited about
2919000	2921000	But I'm just really worried
2921000	2923000	A lot of time has gone by
2923000	2925000	And this can either be a retro
2925000	2927000	Revival that's done very awesomely
2927000	2929000	Or very terribly
2929000	2931000	I always worry it's going to end up in the
2931000	2933000	Second one there
2933000	2935000	I think the man who rearmed
2935000	2937000	Did the whole 8-bit retro thing extremely well
2937000	2939000	But I don't know
2939000	2941000	The second one apparently wasn't that great
2941000	2943000	A lot of the stuff that's retro too
2943000	2945000	Is sometimes better left in the past
2945000	2947000	That's all I'm saying
2947000	2949000	We'll see as soon as we start to see
2949000	2951000	Some screenshots and some actual gameplay
2951000	2953000	But I guess it's kind of cool that that's coming back
2953000	2955000	I mean that was a game I really liked
2955000	2957000	Hopefully it kind of comes back as an arcade title
2957000	2959000	I don't know if I'd want to pay $60
2959000	2961000	For a new River City Ransom game
2961000	2963000	But I don't suspect it's going to be
2963000	2965000	Something for Xbox Live Arcade
2965000	2967000	Remember when they re-did
2967000	2969000	Final Fight
2969000	2971000	Did they?
2971000	2973000	Yeah it was
2973000	2975000	Final Fight for
2975000	2977000	It was for the Xbox and Playstation 2
2977000	2979000	Oh it was awful
2979000	2981000	I do not have that
2981000	2983000	Oh yeah I do remember that
2983000	2985000	That was terrible
2985000	2987000	The last great one was Final Fight Guy
2987000	2989000	Actually Final Fight CD
2989000	2991000	That was a good version
2991000	2993000	What was Final Fight CD on?
2993000	2995000	Is that Sega?
2995000	2997000	Guess who has it?
2997000	2999000	Well I'm sure you guys do somewhere in that vault
2999000	3001000	Crazy stuff

3199000	3201000	A game called Escatos is coming out this week
3201000	3203000	This is like an old school shooter
3203000	3205000	Type game that's been revamped basically
3205000	3207000	Or I should say it's inspired by old school shooters
3207000	3209000	And it's like you know
3209000	3211000	In like 3D
3211000	3213000	It's basically another shmup

3215000	3217000	So if you're into like old school shooters

3275000	3277000	Huge week
3277000	3279000	I almost want to import this
3279000	3281000	But I know I won't be able to read it
3281000	3283000	Final Fantasy IV The Complete Collection makes its way out on the Sony PSP
3283000	3285000	Just give it another month
3285000	3287000	I'm so excited for this
3287000	3289000	I dust off the PSP, get my charger, get ready to go
3289000	3291000	So excited for this
3291000	3293000	Also an interesting game called Are You Alice?
3293000	3295000	Comes out this week on the Sony PSP
3295000	3297000	It's set based in the
3297000	3299000	Was it the
3299000	3301000	Brady Bunch universe?
3301000	3303000	No it is not based in the Brady Bunch universe
3303000	3305000	Actually it looks very much like a
3305000	3307000	I don't know how to explain this
3307000	3309000	Like a very like old time
3309000	3311000	Think of like that Castlevania
3311000	3313000	Sort of flair
3313000	3315000	I mean it's not like vampires
3315000	3317000	But definitely the costumes kind of remind me of that
3317000	3319000	Sort of story
3319000	3321000	It's an adventure game
3321000	3323000	On the PSP
3323000	3325000	I don't know if that's something
3325000	3327000	That's coming out over here
3327000	3329000	I don't think so
3329000	3331000	I don't know if it's based on the anime or what the deal is
3331000	3333000	Are You Alice?
3333000	3335000	At least it wasn't Are You Jimmy Ray
3335000	3337000	Because I hated that song
3337000	3339000	Remember the 90s?
3339000	3341000	Alright how about the UK?
3341000	3343000	Dark Sakura
3343000	3345000	Well in the UK we have

3407000	3409000	K done
3409000	3411000	So excited to be finished with those release dates
3411000	3413000	Alright just a couple more stories for you guys
3413000	3415000	Then we got the classic game of the week
3415000	3417000	A trip down memory lane
3417000	3419000	With a classic video game coming up in just a little bit
3419000	3421000	But first, two more stories for you guys
3421000	3423000	Yeah we got some news about the NGP
3423000	3425000	Or what's codenamed the NGP
3425000	3427000	From Sony
3427000	3429000	They're saying that the
3429000	3431000	games will be downloadable day and date with the
3431000	3433000	retail releases
3433000	3435000	So you'll be able to either buy
3435000	3437000	the cartridge that these are going to be on
3437000	3439000	or download them from the Playstation Network store
3439000	3441000	All of them? Or just the Sony ones?
3441000	3443000	Well they're saying all of them
3443000	3445000	But here's kind of an
3445000	3447000	interesting thing though if you think about it
3447000	3449000	That sounds
3449000	3451000	good in theory
3451000	3453000	Until you realize one thing
3453000	3455000	There's no onboard storage on the NGP
3455000	3457000	So
3457000	3459000	Where the hell am I supposed to put these games that
3459000	3461000	you're having me download? Oh I have to buy your
3461000	3463000	proprietary memory unit
3463000	3465000	Oh how wonderful
3465000	3467000	I have to buy a fucking memory card
3467000	3469000	to do that. How about this? I'll just buy the
3469000	3471000	retail game. Man that
3471000	3473000	sounds good. Because you know what I could do with that
3473000	3475000	retail game? When I don't want to play it anymore
3475000	3477000	I can sell it back
3477000	3479000	Because I'm sure you're not going to have any sort of
3479000	3481000	price break or anything like that on there
3481000	3483000	So
3483000	3485000	Unless they come out
3485000	3487000	cheaper because I'm not buying
3487000	3489000	all the packaged goods that go along
3489000	3491000	with the game
3491000	3493000	I'm not interested, sorry
3493000	3495000	And then on top of that
3495000	3497000	there's a rumor regarding the price of the system
3497000	3499000	Apparently
3499000	3501000	Sony Europe put out
3501000	3503000	a survey. I guess this is
3503000	3505000	tying in with Ubisoft
3505000	3507000	It was
3507000	3509000	Some survey
3509000	3511000	conducted by a
3511000	3513000	research firm and sponsored by
3513000	3515000	Ubisoft. They're saying that
3515000	3517000	the retail price of the Sony NGP is expected
3517000	3519000	to be around $350
3519000	3521000	How likely
3521000	3523000	would you be
3523000	3525000	How likely would you be
3525000	3527000	to purchase the NGP now that
3527000	3529000	you know the retail price?
3529000	3531000	They're saying that's the premium model with 3G
3531000	3533000	The next question is
3533000	3535000	How about the one without 3G
3535000	3537000	which will be considerably lower at
3537000	3539000	$250?
3539000	3541000	That's fucking expensive
3541000	3543000	both ways and I know that the reason
3543000	3545000	that they're saying, oh well $350
3545000	3547000	we're competing with the iPad and those
3547000	3549000	tablet devices but
3549000	3551000	because you're a handheld
3551000	3553000	gaming console
3553000	3555000	I know you may want to think that you're a computer
3555000	3557000	or think that you're a tablet or something like that
3557000	3559000	but the truth of the matter is
3559000	3561000	you're not, you're a game console
3561000	3563000	so your price is too damn high
3563000	3565000	$250 should be the topic
3565000	3567000	I don't even think that these
3567000	3569000	prices that we're hearing about mean anything
3569000	3571000	I don't think Sony knows what they're charging for this thing yet
3571000	3573000	I really don't
3573000	3575000	I mean, a week before
3575000	3577000	E3 I believe this rumor right now
3577000	3579000	doesn't mean squat
3579000	3581000	We'll see
3581000	3583000	I wouldn't be surprised
3583000	3585000	if they go and try to charge $350
3585000	3587000	but here's the thing, it'll be $350
3587000	3589000	retail but
3589000	3591000	because these are gonna have
3591000	3593000	3G, they're gonna be tied with some sort of
3593000	3595000	data plan and get it for a lot cheaper
3595000	3597000	than that because you're gonna be signing a contract
3597000	3599000	or to your contract or something like that
3599000	3601000	so that's where it's gonna make
3601000	3603000	sense for people to pick up the 3G
3603000	3605000	Not necessarily though, you don't have to sign a contract for
3605000	3607000	an iPad
3607000	3609000	an iPhone, yes, but an iPad, no
3609000	3611000	you don't sign a contract for those
3611000	3613000	Well then how do you get the 3G?
3613000	3615000	You buy it with the 3G enabled and then you buy a separate data plan
3615000	3617000	but they don't subsidize the cost of those machines
3617000	3619000	at all
3619000	3621000	because I believe the data can be through
3621000	3623000	either, and correct me if I'm wrong chatters
3623000	3625000	but I'm pretty sure it's either to AT&T
3625000	3627000	or Verizon
3627000	3629000	and now we have this big huge news today
3629000	3631000	that AT&T has gobbled up T-Mobile
3631000	3633000	or at least will be over the next 12 months
3633000	3635000	assuming the government approves of the acquisition
3635000	3637000	or what have you, so that's just gonna be
3637000	3639000	even more, you know, that's one
3639000	3641000	less carrier out of the sea
3641000	3643000	It'll be interesting to see what happens
3643000	3645000	A lot of people on my Twitter
3645000	3647000	are not happy about that acquisition by the way
3647000	3649000	Apparently a lot more T-Mobile customers than I realized out there
3649000	3651000	who don't want to switch
3651000	3653000	Well they have some pretty good budget plans
3653000	3655000	That's okay, I'm already with AT&T
3655000	3657000	I know, I've never had a problem with AT&T, but some people really hate them
3657000	3659000	But then again, I don't live in a huge city
3659000	3661000	It seems like everybody I know that hates AT&T
3661000	3663000	lives in a huge city
3663000	3665000	I have better luck with AT&T here than anything else
3665000	3667000	and I have no trouble
3667000	3669000	when I travel, so
3669000	3671000	Well, we'll see
3671000	3673000	Alright, anyhow
3673000	3675000	More stuff, and this is on a completely different
3675000	3677000	kind of note, you know, obviously last week
3677000	3679000	we spent a little time talking about how
3679000	3681000	you guys can help, what's going on
3681000	3683000	in Japan and the really unfortunate
3683000	3685000	tragedy that's happened over there and
3685000	3687000	a lot of the gaming world now coming on board
3687000	3689000	to do some really cool things for the
3689000	3691000	disaster relief over in Japan
3691000	3693000	I don't even have time to name it all
3693000	3695000	but here's some of the ones that caught my eye
3695000	3697000	Squeenix
3697000	3699000	is just flat out donating money
3699000	3701000	There's no buy this game for whatever
3701000	3703000	cost or donate through the
3703000	3705000	Nope, they are just straight out giving
3705000	3707000	100 million yen to the relief
3707000	3709000	effort, they are also collecting
3709000	3711000	donations from employees throughout the world
3711000	3713000	and they are also going to be getting donations
3713000	3715000	through select Squeenix
3715000	3717000	online services and the amusement
3717000	3719000	facilities that Taito operates in
3719000	3721000	Japan, so very cool what
3721000	3723000	Square Enix, or as we always call them on the show
3723000	3725000	Squeenix is doing
3725000	3727000	This weekend, PopCap is donating
3727000	3729000	the sales of their IOS games
3729000	3731000	that means iPhone and iPad games
3731000	3733000	to the Red Cross, so they
3733000	3735000	donate 100% of the sales of
3735000	3737000	the games this weekend
3737000	3739000	March 19th and 20th, so those listening
3739000	3741000	live, today is the last day to do it, those that are
3741000	3743000	listening on the podcast, you missed it
3743000	3745000	but all the money will be donated to the Red Cross
3745000	3747000	and they
3747000	3749000	are saying in a statement that they
3749000	3751000	recently opened an office in Tokyo
3751000	3753000	and while the Japan based employees are safe
3753000	3755000	and uninjured, we understand countless
3755000	3757000	others in Japan need food, shelter
3757000	3759000	and medical attention, given that Plants vs.
3759000	3761000	Zombies reached number one on the iPhone and iPad
3761000	3763000	sales charts in Japan, it seemed like
3763000	3765000	the most appropriate game to feature in the
3765000	3767000	fundraising campaign, so if you don't already
3767000	3769000	own the game, now is the perfect
3769000	3771000	excuse to get it, so very cool
3771000	3773000	Also
3773000	3775000	just a lot of other things
3775000	3777000	games purchased on Direct2
3777000	3779000	Drive, the company will donate a dollar
3779000	3781000	each game to Disaster Relief
3781000	3783000	Bungie is currently selling
3783000	3785000	a little band, the little
3785000	3787000	armbands that kind of remind me of the
3787000	3789000	Livestrong, I'm sure everybody has seen those, these blue
3789000	3791000	ones, Japan Quake Relief
3791000	3793000	2011, those proceeds go
3793000	3795000	directly to the Red Cross
3795000	3797000	Also, I don't know if you guys saw this, if you
3797000	3799000	logged into the Playstation at all
3799000	3801000	there is a link right in the
3801000	3803000	Playstation store that I think also
3803000	3805000	comes up in the What's New, you can just
3805000	3807000	donate money right from your
3807000	3809000	Playstation, very similar to what they got
3809000	3811000	going on in iTunes right now, so you can just
3811000	3813000	donate right the funds that are in the Playstation
3813000	3815000	wallet, or just donate through the
3815000	3817000	Playstation, so if you
3817000	3819000	don't know how else to donate, that's
3819000	3821000	one way you can do it, and there you go
3821000	3823000	So
3823000	3825000	Awesome, and that's not even all of
3825000	3827000	them, there's lots of other great things going on out
3827000	3829000	there in the gaming world of people
3829000	3831000	donating money, and you know, as I said
3831000	3833000	last week, please, anybody
3833000	3835000	if you listen to this show
3835000	3837000	I really think in lieu of giving us
3837000	3839000	money, which we don't ever ask you for
3839000	3841000	really would hope you would donate what you
3841000	3843000	can to the relief efforts going on
3843000	3845000	in Japan, and even if you're like
3845000	3847000	I don't have any money, I've got zero cents
3847000	3849000	donate time
3849000	3851000	would even be helpful at this point, the Red
3851000	3853000	Cross can use help all over
3853000	3855000	during this very unfortunate
3855000	3857000	time. Alright
3857000	3859000	let's take a minute to switch gears
3859000	3861000	here and take a trip down memory lane
3861000	3863000	in a segment we do here on the show every week
3863000	3865000	called the Classic Game of the
3865000	3867000	Week, Dark Sakura's gonna step
3867000	3869000	into the vault and find a game that she just
3869000	3871000	loves more than anything
3871000	3873000	in the world, and say
3873000	3875000	kids, you better be playing this game this week
3875000	3877000	or I'm gonna beat you up
3877000	3879000	So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
3879000	3881000	I
3881000	3883000	well I apparently love a lot of games
3883000	3885000	then if that's the story
3885000	3887000	the game of the week is
3887000	3889000	Strider 2
3889000	3891000	or known as Strider Here U2
3891000	3893000	which is the
3893000	3895000	official sequel to
3895000	3897000	the first Strider game
3897000	3899000	and I'm bringing up a
3899000	3901000	YouTube right now, sorry I'm a little delayed here
3901000	3903000	but here you go
3903000	3905000	here's a little bit of the
3905000	3907000	gameplay
3907000	3917000	the music too, the music's pretty good
3917000	3919000	actually I really like the first level of the music
3919000	3921000	anyway
3921000	3923000	it really is
3923000	3925000	not a sequel to
3925000	3927000	the NES one, I'm just saying
3927000	3929000	because the NES one is actually a retelling
3929000	3931000	of the manga
3931000	3933000	the Strider 2 the manga
3933000	3935000	so this one
3935000	3937000	is basically set 2000 years
3937000	3939000	after the events of the original game
3939000	3941000	and
3941000	3943000	the Grand Master has returned to life
3943000	3945000	and so has Strider Here U
3945000	3947000	so
3947000	3949000	he's going through different levels
3949000	3951000	it's actually 2D sprites
3951000	3953000	over 3D backgrounds
3953000	3955000	but it's the same as the original
3955000	3957000	it pretty much plays the same
3957000	3959000	you've got three action buttons
3959000	3961000	he has all of his
3961000	3963000	old moves like walking, jumping, crouching
3963000	3965000	sliding, climbing walls and ceilings
3965000	3967000	and he's got a dash
3967000	3969000	now by pressing
3969000	3971000	left or right twice
3971000	3973000	and a double jump, basically you press jump
3973000	3975000	in midair and a backwards somersault done while sliding
3975000	3977000	and then he can
3977000	3979000	do a thrust jump off of a wall
3979000	3981000	if he's holding onto a wall
3981000	3983000	and he's got like
3983000	3985000	extra slash moves
3985000	3987000	and all kinds of different moves, he's got like a boost
3987000	3989000	if he's got a boost item
3989000	3991000	so he can shoot, you know
3991000	3993000	out of his plasma, out of his cypher
3993000	3995000	so it's pretty cool
3995000	3997000	and this one actually has a few
3997000	3999000	throwbacks as far as health
3999000	4001000	you know, replenishments
4001000	4003000	you can extend your life bar
4003000	4005000	you have a cypher extension, other boosts
4005000	4007000	and then you can get
4007000	4009000	different things
4009000	4011000	in the game, you can get the
4011000	4013000	Yasuchi and the Sakji symbol
4013000	4015000	from Vulgus and the Zenny coins from
4015000	4017000	Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds, I love that game
4017000	4019000	anyway
4019000	4021000	so you've got five stages
4021000	4023000	each of them
4023000	4025000	gives you a little breakdown beforehand
4025000	4027000	we have an appearance of
4027000	4029000	Tonpuu in here, cause she was so cool
4029000	4031000	and
4031000	4033000	it was
4033000	4035000	it was pretty awesome
4035000	4037000	you've got the first three
4037000	4039000	on Earth, Hong Kong, Germany
4039000	4041000	and Antarctica
4041000	4043000	and that was Hong Kong, of course the one that
4043000	4045000	Tonpuu is in, and then the last two
4045000	4047000	are in space, you have the flying
4047000	4049000	battleship Balrog and
4049000	4051000	Third Moon, which are both
4051000	4053000	locations in the original game
4053000	4055000	the home version did come out
4055000	4057000	in 2000 on the Playstation
4057000	4059000	and I've got both
4059000	4061000	versions, I believe, the Japanese and the US
4061000	4063000	one
4063000	4065000	it actually comes with two discs
4065000	4067000	on the first disc is Strider 2
4067000	4069000	and the second disc is the original
4069000	4071000	coin-op version of Strider
4071000	4073000	so that's pretty neat
4073000	4075000	but a labeling error on the American one has
4075000	4077000	both discs labeled as Strider
4077000	4079000	so we used to have to guess
4079000	4081000	so if you finish the games and
4081000	4083000	do all the achievements on the same memory card
4083000	4085000	you get a secret level called Strider 2
4085000	4087000	Mission Zero, it's a waterfall stage
4087000	4089000	and then if you
4089000	4091000	complete all of the missions you get
4091000	4093000	Strider Hyun as
4093000	4095000	a playable character
4095000	4097000	he has two cyphers and is pretty hardcore
4097000	4099000	and awesome
4099000	4101000	and that is actually my favorite person
4101000	4103000	to play through the damn game with is
4103000	4105000	just like, I've got two of these suckers
4105000	4107000	and I'm bad
4107000	4109000	and he like, I think he can throw one like a boomerang
4109000	4111000	if I'm right
4111000	4113000	anyway, um, so yeah
4113000	4115000	really really hot, this was
4115000	4117000	I mean, the game is
4117000	4119000	really cool, it's kind of, if you
4119000	4121000	if you're, I guess a veteran of it
4121000	4123000	then it might seem like it's
4123000	4125000	a little short and a little
4125000	4127000	huh? but there was so much
4127000	4129000	coolness in it that it's just a
4129000	4131000	fun game, I mean I could sit down and
4131000	4133000	play through it in a couple hours, it's just a
4133000	4135000	fun game, so
4135000	4137000	that is my game of the week
4137000	4139000	Strider 2
4139000	4141000	alright, good time
4141000	4143000	Strider 2
4143000	4145000	the arcade game
4145000	4147000	also on the Playstation 1
4147000	4149000	classic video game of the week
4149000	4151000	hardcore
4153000	4155000	okay chat room, why are you
4155000	4157000	bothering with Deadpool?
4157000	4159000	there's 50 million
4159000	4161000	Deadpool titles out, ugh
4161000	4163000	Deadpool's jumped the shark
4163000	4165000	I'm sorry, he's only good at Marvel vs Capcom 3
4165000	4167000	really?
4167000	4169000	not a fan anymore, huh?
4169000	4171000	no, okay, I love the character
4171000	4173000	and I think he was fine in
4173000	4175000	Cable and Deadpool
4175000	4177000	great series, and then they ended it
4177000	4179000	but now Deadpool's in like
4179000	4181000	eight titles, seriously?
4181000	4183000	I think it's eight
4183000	4185000	and it's like, dude, too much Deadpool
4185000	4187000	too much of a funny thing
4187000	4189000	is annoying, sorry

4321000	4323000	quick news stories about what is going on
4323000	4325000	in the gaming world that we just don't have a lot of time for
4325000	4327000	otherwise, Loki

4331000	4333000	download content coming in May
4333000	4335000	this is kind of a little bit different than the normal stuff
4335000	4337000	that they put out, they're actually doing
4337000	4339000	what they call a teacher pack
4339000	4341000	and it's being developed by Media Molecule
4341000	4343000	it's to be packed with demonstrations
4343000	4345000	of the national
4345000	4347000	curriculum and it's based
4347000	4349000	in game levels that other
4349000	4351000	teachers have made
4351000	4353000	and I guess this pack will also feature
4353000	4355000	Playstation Move functionality as well
4355000	4357000	which is pretty cool
4357000	4359000	you know, I didn't get to play
4359000	4361000	Little Big Planet when I was
4361000	4363000	in school, well
4363000	4365000	all we had was these kids today

4371000	4373000	Big Planet teaching a history
4373000	4375000	you should grow up on Number Munchers

4487000	4489000	I haven't gotten to play it in a long time
4489000	4491000	but I really want to go back to it
4491000	4493000	oh, that was another thing, I forgot to mention
4493000	4495000	a really late part of my game week
4495000	4497000	I played U-Star 2
4497000	4499000	what the hell's that?
4499000	4501000	U-Star is like
4501000	4503000	karaoke for movie scenes, you read
4503000	4505000	lines and it puts you
4505000	4507000	into the movie like a green screen
4507000	4509000	that sounds horrible, actually it sounds like
4509000	4511000	something I've seen at Disney's California
4511000	4513000	Adventure, where you can like
4513000	4515000	it's set up like Ursula from
4515000	4517000	the Little Mermaids
4517000	4519000	and you can reenact scenes
4519000	4521000	over where Turtle Talk with Crush is
4521000	4523000	that whole thing, yep, you can reenact scenes from
4523000	4525000	your favorite movies
4525000	4527000	it is a terrible game
4527000	4529000	the interface is just absolutely terrible
4529000	4531000	oh my god, my co-worker though
4531000	4533000	was doing lines from like
4533000	4535000	300 and stuff like that
4535000	4537000	and
4537000	4539000	THIS IS CAKETOWN
4539000	4541000	and just the way he was doing it
4541000	4543000	though, it was like
4543000	4545000	Igor from
4545000	4547000	Frankenstein or something like that
4547000	4549000	and just this really weird voice
4549000	4551000	he did the whole thing
4551000	4553000	it was hilarious, and the game has
4553000	4555000	the worst framing ever
4555000	4557000	we had the camera set up on a table
4557000	4559000	and it would zoom in or zoom
4559000	4561000	out too much
4561000	4563000	depending on the scene, so there's
4563000	4565000	one scene that you could do, it was kind of
4565000	4567000	an ad-lib thing, it was like the moon
4567000	4569000	or something, like moon surface, and all it had
4569000	4571000	was his head
4571000	4573000	his head was on the screen
4573000	4575000	it's a terrible game
4575000	4577000	it's funny, it sounds like something you'd buy
4577000	4579000	for like one night of LOLs and then it's over
4579000	4581000	I'll probably wait for it to drop in price
4581000	4583000	it is pretty funny though, for like a drunken party game
4583000	4585000	ok, there you go
4585000	4587000	some other quickfire news here
4587000	4589000	Red Faction Battlegrounds has a release date
4589000	4591000	it's going to be April 5th
4591000	4593000	and it will be out for $9.99
4593000	4595000	on the Playstation
4595000	4597000	that's also 800 Microsoft Points
4597000	4599000	but here's the thing, if you're in the Playstation Plus
4599000	4601000	thing, before March 25th
4601000	4603000	so this week
4603000	4605000	you can get the game for FREE
4605000	4607000	so this is more incentive for you to sign up
4607000	4609000	for the Playstation Plus membership, free stuff
4609000	4613000	so yeah, that's Red Faction Battlegrounds
4613000	4615000	also, I found this kind of interesting
4615000	4617000	GameStop is now selling
4617000	4620000	500GB Playstation 3s
4620000	4622000	but they don't really make
4622000	4624000	500GB Playstation 3s, so how do they do it?
4624000	4626000	well, it's a refurbished deal
4626000	4628000	they sell refurbished Playstation 3s
4628000	4630000	and they call them premium
4630000	4632000	refurbished Playstation 3s supercharged
4632000	4634000	they come with a 500GB
4634000	4636000	Western Digital Scorpio Blue
4636000	4638000	hard drive
4638000	4640000	and a bunch of peripherals and things come with it too
4640000	4642000	so here's the deal
4642000	4644000	you can buy one of these for $400
4644000	4646000	it comes with a Playstation 3 slim
4646000	4648000	with the new hard drive
4648000	4650000	a special supercharged console skin
4650000	4652000	that reminds you how awesome GameStop is
4652000	4654000	for getting this for you
4654000	4656000	a one year warranty on it
4656000	4658000	and then I guess a media hub with a remote
4658000	4660000	increasing the number of USB slots
4660000	4662000	also an HDMI cable
4662000	4664000	so
4664000	4666000	I gotta say, it's an interesting
4666000	4668000	little spin on the whole
4668000	4670000	used game stuff
4670000	4672000	there's some people that really like to shop around
4672000	4674000	for used only things to get a deal on it
4674000	4676000	and even though I don't necessarily
4676000	4678000	know if you're getting a deal with this
4678000	4680000	you are getting a lot of
4680000	4682000	extra stuff that a lot of people
4682000	4684000	kinda have to buy anyway
4684000	4686000	like the HDMI cable and so forth
4686000	4688000	I don't know guys, I have an 80GB
4688000	4690000	hard drive on my Playstation 3
4690000	4692000	and I still haven't hit the limit yet, knock on wood
4692000	4694000	but I also don't download a lot of movies
4694000	4696000	I'm not Spazinator, Spazinator calls in every week
4696000	4698000	talking about some video he's downloaded
4698000	4700000	like I don't have that many movies
4700000	4702000	I have a 500GB hard drive in mine
4702000	4704000	do you really, but you redid it yourself right?
4704000	4706000	yeah I did it myself because I had 20 in there
4706000	4708000	oh my gosh, yeah
4708000	4710000	I can see
4710000	4712000	mine's only 80, I haven't filled it up yet, knock on wood
4712000	4714000	um
4714000	4716000	yeah I guess if you're
4716000	4718000	used to paying a lot of money for
4718000	4720000	HDMI cables it's a good deal
4720000	4722000	but
4722000	4724000	it's an interesting way
4724000	4726000	to make the used Playstation 3
4726000	4728000	business kinda interesting
4728000	4730000	like it's kinda creative
4730000	4732000	to just get the hard drive and put the new ones
4732000	4734000	in there at the GameStop level
4734000	4736000	well I think also too, and I'm not sure
4736000	4738000	if GameStop have this problem, but
4738000	4740000	Sony was oh so wonderful
4740000	4742000	and decided, hey you know what
4742000	4744000	we're having shortages on the old systems
4744000	4746000	so
4746000	4748000	you place a bunch of orders for it and they don't come in forever
4748000	4750000	and then oh hey we're gonna
4750000	4752000	we're gonna send a bunch of them to you
4752000	4754000	you get them, oh by the way we're releasing
4754000	4756000	new SKU, suckas
4756000	4758000	and so you're left with a bunch of systems that
4758000	4760000	oh by the way we didn't price protect those so
4760000	4762000	they're gonna come out at the same price and you're
4762000	4764000	stuck with these old systems that nobody wants
4764000	4766000	haha suckers, so
4766000	4768000	if they did that to GameStop
4768000	4770000	which is very unlikely because they're GameStop
4770000	4772000	but let's just for all
4772000	4774000	you know sakes and purposes
4774000	4776000	say they did, and
4776000	4778000	what are they gonna do with all these old systems? Well they can buy
4778000	4780000	a bunch of hard drives for cheap, upgrade them
4780000	4782000	sell off
4782000	4784000	the old hard drives I guess if they want to
4784000	4786000	and sell them
4786000	4788000	for a premium and make money
4788000	4790000	off the system and the accessories
4790000	4792000	bundle with it
4792000	4794000	and it becomes a unique
4794000	4796000	item for them because there are no 500
4796000	4798000	gigabyte PS3s
4798000	4800000	Togak in our chat room is commenting on the size
4800000	4802000	of your hard drive saying that's a lot of porn Loki
4802000	4804000	no no no
4804000	4806000	I stream my porn, that was actually for
4808000	4810000	for rips
4810000	4812000	of games but I
4812000	4814000	my system's all legit now
4814000	4816000	I unmodified it because
4816000	4818000	I want to play MotorStorm
4818000	4820000	and
4820000	4822000	you know it's just
4822000	4824000	it was the right thing to do
4824000	4826000	whatever, once again remember we
4826000	4828000	got into it a couple weeks ago
4828000	4830000	about how there wasn't really
4830000	4832000	much I wanted to play on there, well MotorStorm was
4832000	4834000	one of the games I wanted to play but
4834000	4836000	I'm not missing much
4836000	4838000	or anything
4838000	4840000	Alright one more story I've got, we'll go over to
4840000	4842000	Jamie, this is about a Wipeout
4842000	4844000	Kinect game and you might
4844000	4846000	be kind of looking going wait a minute I thought
4846000	4848000	Wipeout was a Sony franchise, why is it coming out
4848000	4850000	on the Kinect? Because it's not that
4850000	4852000	Wipeout, no no we're talking about the
4852000	4854000	ABC reality show that
4854000	4856000	is kind of like a Japanese game
4856000	4858000	show I guess for American audiences it's
4858000	4860000	Wipeout the game show
4860000	4862000	it has a Kinect game coming out
4862000	4864000	this summer
4864000	4866000	you might remember this game was already
4866000	4868000	released on the Wii and the DS
4868000	4870000	I'm sure it was pretty terrible
4870000	4872000	now they talk about how there
4872000	4874000	are infamous big balls
4874000	4876000	and I assume they're not talking about genitalia
4876000	4878000	but these actual giant balls that people bounce
4878000	4880000	I've never watched this show it just looks
4880000	4882000	idiotic to me but I guess
4882000	4884000	a lot of people really like it but people bounce
4884000	4886000	on giant balls like it's a pinball machine
4886000	4888000	or something so this game
4888000	4890000	Wipeout will have more than 30 obstacles
4890000	4892000	you will run, duck
4892000	4894000	dodge and of course Wipeout
4894000	4896000	and they go on
4896000	4898000	this quote about everyone who watches the show
4898000	4900000	wishes they could try the obstacle course and now
4900000	4902000	this is their chance!
4902000	4904000	Is it like Takeshi's Castle?
4904000	4906000	It's sort of like Takeshi's Castle but
4906000	4908000	like really dumbed down. Kind of what I get from
4908000	4910000	looking at it yeah but I've never
4910000	4912000	and like I'm a reality TV
4912000	4914000	whore okay I watch a lot of crap
4914000	4916000	that I deservingly
4916000	4918000	deserve to be made fun of for watching
4918000	4920000	like Big Brother come on
4920000	4922000	but I don't watch Wipeout
4922000	4924000	like I'm not going to stoop that low
4924000	4926000	Well remember how they like it's basically
4926000	4928000	it took all these Japanese game shows and just
4928000	4930000	gutted the soul out of them
4930000	4932000	like that show
4932000	4934000	Hole in the Wall the one that was the funny Japanese
4934000	4936000	game show that was a segment on Ellen
4936000	4938000	and that's where it should have stayed like
4938000	4940000	it's funny for two minutes and that's it
4940000	4942000	no it was actually well it may have been a segment
4942000	4944000	but it was originally a Japanese game show
4944000	4946000	and you know
4946000	4948000	that's funny because they're just
4948000	4950000	playing it for fun they're not doing it for prizes
4950000	4952000	but you know of course us
4952000	4954000	Americans don't want to watch anything that's for
4954000	4956000	fun it's got to be for money
4956000	4958000	because who cares about fun
4960000	4962000	so they
4962000	4964000	had that and then they totally like fucked it up
4964000	4966000	they just it's like
4966000	4968000	it's just like you know American Iron Chef
4968000	4970000	you know they just
4970000	4972000	gutted all the soul of that show
4972000	4974000	out of it and then the
4974000	4976000	it's Iron Chef at least it has Alton Brown
4976000	4978000	it does have Alton Brown
4978000	4980000	and at least it wasn't as terrible as the original
4980000	4982000	American Iron Chef although William Shatner
4982000	4984000	hosting
4984000	4986000	I don't hate that I think he
4986000	4988000	would be just as over the top as Chairman Kaga
4988000	4990000	exactly he would be just as over the top
4990000	4992000	but this like fictional cousin
4992000	4994000	or something like that is retarded
4994000	4996000	now he's on a hideous
4996000	4998000	TV
4998000	5000000	sitcom on CVS
5000000	5002000	based off a Twitter account
5002000	5004000	what?
5004000	5006000	oh yeah William Shatner he's been on a show for like a year called
5006000	5008000	TJ Hooker
5008000	5010000	Shit My Dad Says
5010000	5012000	you know I've actually thought about starting
5012000	5014000	a Twitter account for Shit My
5014000	5016000	Wife Asked Me About
5016000	5018000	might be kind of long
5018000	5020000	it's just weird
5020000	5022000	there's some funny stuff like
5022000	5024000	what was it the other day she was
5024000	5026000	I'm trying to remember one of the questions because it was just like
5026000	5028000	really? that's so weird
5028000	5030000	um
5030000	5032000	oh I don't even remember now
5032000	5034000	it was so strange
5034000	5036000	it was funnier in your head wasn't it?
5036000	5038000	it was funnier in my head
5038000	5040000	no but I do say funny stuff now to her and then she
5040000	5042000	posts it on Facebook like she was asking me about
5042000	5044000	so how do you spell
5044000	5046000	how do you spell desert?
5046000	5048000	or was it dessert or something like that I'm like
5048000	5050000	well the way you remember it is
5050000	5052000	you know you want more dessert than you want desert
5052000	5054000	so you know
5054000	5056000	dessert has two S's and desert has one
5056000	5058000	so what about the desert something
5058000	5060000	I'm like and what if you need to spell
5060000	5062000	deseret because you're a Mormon
5062000	5064000	and so I'm like
5064000	5066000	listen that's the way I learned how to spell
5066000	5068000	um desert
5068000	5070000	so if you don't like it you can
5070000	5072000	shut the hell up
5072000	5074000	or you can go to hell
5074000	5076000	so she wrote that on Facebook
5076000	5078000	good times
5078000	5080000	but she asked me weird shit all the time
5080000	5082000	like all these
5082000	5084000	random questions about things
5084000	5086000	it's the job of a wife to ask her husband
5086000	5088000	really bizarre things
5088000	5090000	what are some of the bizarre things you asked Dan?
5090000	5092000	Dan!
5092000	5094000	what's the bizarre stuff I ask you?
5096000	5098000	he says he doesn't know
5098000	5100000	she keeps asking me questions about mythological creatures
5100000	5102000	and stuff she's like
5102000	5104000	you know what's this look like? I'm like I don't know
5104000	5106000	stupid thingy
5106000	5108000	it's just something
5108000	5110000	that happens
5110000	5112000	is that something that happens like when you get married
5112000	5114000	because like you know
5114000	5116000	Alan doesn't really ask me stupid shit
5116000	5118000	it's no
5118000	5120000	it's like if you've got
5120000	5122000	someone who's got a really kind of
5122000	5124000	wandering mind
5124000	5126000	every so often the weirdest questions will pop up
5126000	5128000	and when you hit that comfort level
5128000	5130000	they'll just ask you
5130000	5132000	like
5132000	5134000	and typically it tends to be
5134000	5136000	I've noticed the wife
5136000	5138000	or the girlfriend
5138000	5140000	or
5140000	5142000	I guess
5142000	5144000	and every so often
5144000	5146000	just the most random questions but because I feel
5146000	5148000	so comfortable around my husband
5148000	5150000	I'll just blurt them on out
5150000	5152000	like you know
5152000	5154000	I don't know
5154000	5156000	it just occurs to me
5156000	5158000	this whole thing was funnier in your guys'
5158000	5160000	head like it seems like a big in-joke or something
5160000	5162000	but thank god I'm not a lesbian
5162000	5164000	I wonder how it would be
5164000	5166000	amongst lesbians
5166000	5168000	if they would both annoy the crap out of each other
5168000	5170000	with annoying questions
5170000	5172000	I think it's just written into the
5172000	5174000	female chromosome
5174000	5176000	alright let's move on
5176000	5178000	speaking of the female chromosome
5178000	5180000	Dark Soccer give us a few more stories here and then we'll get to Twitter topics

5230000	5232000	that was better left in the movies
5232000	5234000	if it's a piano pack why don't they freakin put
5234000	5236000	piano man in it
5236000	5238000	okay wait I think that might already be out
5238000	5240000	maybe? okay well then fine

5244000	5246000	that's how much I like Billy Joel I didn't look
5246000	5248000	that's like the only song he does that I like
5248000	5250000	I like the song
5250000	5252000	Philadelphia even though the movie is really sad
5252000	5254000	I...

5266000	5268000	yay cause they're climbing in your video games
5268000	5270000	playing your guitars
5270000	5272000	playing your bass
5272000	5274000	and playing your keyboards
5274000	5276000	cause they're playing everyone out there
5276000	5278000	and it's the long version
5278000	5280000	god I fucking hope they put

5290000	5292000	too late
5292000	5294000	I really wanted her to reach
5294000	5296000	number one cause it would be funny
5296000	5298000	I've lost all respect
5298000	5300000	well pfft
5300000	5302000	this is the reason why?
5302000	5304000	because
5304000	5306000	no talent rich kids
5306000	5308000	do not need the dollar that is
5308000	5310000	better spent on Jolly Ranchers
5310000	5312000	the end
5312000	5314000	I'm on a diet
5314000	5316000	yeah
5316000	5318000	you want a girl scout cookie?
5318000	5320000	you know what I've got some
5320000	5322000	I don't want to get it
5322000	5324000	don't blame a little girl with a dream
5324000	5326000	blame the music production company
5326000	5328000	it's the same thing I said when the music
5328000	5330000	could have been a dollar closer to getting
5330000	5332000	that music production company to make you a song
5332000	5334000	I know
5334000	5336000	this girl
5336000	5338000	I'm just jealous cause I don't have a song
5338000	5340000	she's way auto tuned and you can tell
5340000	5342000	she can't sing
5342000	5344000	she did, they interviewed her on
5344000	5346000	Good Morning America and they made her sing a few bars
5346000	5348000	of America the Beautiful
5348000	5350000	was she the best singer I've ever heard? no
5350000	5352000	but was she talented?
5352000	5354000	she's 13!
5354000	5356000	anyway why are we arguing about this?
5356000	5358000	I'm not talented and I can't sing
5358000	5360000	why is this guy famous?
5360000	5362000	would you pay this guy a dollar to play this song
5362000	5364000	on a rock band?
5364000	5366000	cause this one's funny
5366000	5368000	well Friday's funny
5368000	5370000	Friday's just sad
5370000	5372000	it's only funny with the video, with the girl with the braces
5372000	5374000	I would pay a dollar to pay
5374000	5376000	or to play
5376000	5378000	Night Man
5378000	5380000	from It's Always Sunny
5384000	5386000	alright anyhow
5386000	5388000	got a man coming in and raping
5388000	5390000	somebody? is that it or is there another one?

5408000	5410000	which is 5 bucks each
5410000	5412000	but now they don't really know why
5412000	5414000	it was gonna be out on March 15th

5416000	5418000	I don't know when, but it's pushed back

5482000	5484000	from Defective Candy
5484000	5486000	let me turn down the little song there
5486000	5488000	in the background
5488000	5490000	Defective Candy is sending us a tweet about
5490000	5492000	Augmented Reality makes the 3DS bigger than Gigantor
5492000	5494000	what is this?
5494000	5496000	this is a link from
5496000	5498000	Candinator
5498000	5500000	sending us this story here
5500000	5502000	about the 3DS had launched some time ago
5502000	5504000	and
5504000	5506000	let's see
5506000	5508000	it's about, you have to remember
5508000	5510000	I'm reading these for the first time thanks to Twitter
5510000	5512000	I guess it has to do with the AR tech
5512000	5514000	oh I see
5514000	5516000	some folks have made a super sized version
5516000	5518000	of the 3DS pack-in Augmented Reality
5518000	5520000	card all for the sake of
5520000	5522000	giving Kobe's Lonely Lifesize
5522000	5524000	Tetsujin 28 Ghost statue some company
5524000	5526000	and as you see in the video below
5526000	5528000	he does need a friend, it may well be a me
5528000	5530000	I gotta see this video, what is going on
5530000	5532000	oh I see they have this big statue that they did
5532000	5534000	oh
5534000	5536000	I see, so what they did
5536000	5538000	instead of having the guy
5538000	5540000	stand on the mat to take the picture
5540000	5542000	they got this gigantic version
5542000	5544000	of it to put the statue on
5544000	5546000	I see what they did
5546000	5548000	they took the little pack-in Augmented Reality
5548000	5550000	thing, put it under the statue
5550000	5552000	dude
5552000	5554000	and now he's
5554000	5556000	in the 3DS Augmented Reality game
5558000	5560000	haha
5560000	5562000	it's kind of funny I like that
5562000	5564000	sorry that probably made for terrible radio
5564000	5566000	but hey you tweeted it, alright moving on
5566000	5568000	to another Twitter from SilverSonic1534
5568000	5570000	sending us another
5570000	5572000	really good story about helping
5572000	5574000	the folks out in Japan for the
5574000	5576000	disaster relief, a rare
5576000	5578000	Nintendo DS it was signed by a bunch of Nintendo
5578000	5580000	veterans and it was auctioned off
5580000	5582000	this week, let's see
5582000	5584000	it was a
5584000	5586000	Mario Kart DS promo
5586000	5588000	system and it was signed by
5588000	5590000	Miyamoto, Koji Kondo
5590000	5592000	the Zelda chief, Eiji
5592000	5594000	Onomura, Charles Martinet
5594000	5596000	Martin Lung who does the piano
5596000	5598000	stuff for Video Games
5598000	5600000	Live
5600000	5602000	all of that was autographed
5602000	5604000	by all those people and they sold
5604000	5606000	it, I'm not sure exactly how much they
5606000	5608000	went for, let me look, let me see on eBay real quick
5608000	5610000	ooh it hasn't sold
5610000	5612000	yet, it's got 16 hours left
5612000	5614000	$2,500
5614000	5616000	sorry $2,550
5616000	5618000	$2,550
5618000	5620000	is what it's at right now
5620000	5622000	so if you want to check that out
5622000	5624000	more tweets coming at us
5624000	5626000	from TigerClaw
5626000	5628000	PSP based Augmented
5628000	5630000	Reality game, what is it with all the
5630000	5632000	Augmented Reality games tonight, that's popular
5632000	5634000	that's right yeah, this is
5634000	5636000	turning school into an adventure worth
5636000	5638000	writing about
5638000	5640000	an imaginary worlds project
5640000	5642000	using the system with the AR software
5642000	5644000	you design fantasy landscapes
5644000	5646000	at school by finding art online
5646000	5648000	and matching it with scannable codes that were
5648000	5650000	hidden around the school
5650000	5652000	they then took camera equipped systems around
5652000	5654000	the school and embarked on quests
5654000	5656000	finding items to defeat monsters and writing
5656000	5658000	about the experience afterwards, that actually sounds
5658000	5660000	kind of awesome, I'd like to see something like that
5660000	5662000	on an even bigger scale
5662000	5664000	I don't know, like Amazing Race
5664000	5666000	but for real
5666000	5668000	anyhow, Amazingly Real Race
5668000	5670000	Amazingly Real Race on PSP
5670000	5672000	apparently the program went over
5672000	5674000	very well, very enthusiastic response to that
5674000	5676000	the kids were well behaved
5676000	5678000	and cooperated when they took part
5678000	5680000	kind of neat, I like that idea
5680000	5682000	remember
5682000	5684000	I don't know why, but you know what this reminds you
5684000	5686000	remember when you were in grade
5686000	5688000	school and you'd go on a tour of a
5688000	5690000	historical building, you'd have to put on those
5690000	5692000	big headphones and as you walked
5692000	5694000	under certain places you would hear the
5694000	5696000	stuff in the headphones, like it was all based off radios
5696000	5698000	well imagine now
5698000	5700000	if you could use these augmented reality devices
5700000	5702000	to scan in the certain codes at places
5702000	5704000	and you would read a little bit about what it is
5704000	5706000	you know, you're at, or what the importance
5706000	5708000	of the location is, I don't know, so this reminds
5708000	5710000	me of to some extent, I can see that
5710000	5712000	kind of neat, anyhow
5712000	5714000	one other tweet here from TigerClaw
5714000	5716000	AMD has made a statement
5716000	5718000	that DirectX is holding back the graphics
5718000	5720000	performance on the PC
5720000	5722000	links us to a story from Gamasutra here
5722000	5724000	via our Twitter
5724000	5726000	a quote here from
5726000	5728000	AMD
5728000	5730000	GPU division worldwide developer
5730000	5732000	relations manager Richard Huddy
5732000	5734000	quote, it's funny, we often have at least
5734000	5736000	ten times as much horsepower as an
5736000	5738000	Xbox 360 or a Playstation 3
5738000	5740000	in a high end graphics card
5740000	5742000	yet it's very clear that the games don't
5742000	5744000	look ten times as good
5744000	5746000	to a significant extent, that's because
5746000	5748000	one way or another, for good reasons and bad
5748000	5750000	mostly good, DirectX is getting in the way
5750000	5752000	so
5752000	5754000	so mostly good, but
5754000	5756000	yeah, but I guess maybe that's because
5756000	5758000	I'm gonna bitch about something, it's mostly
5758000	5760000	for the good of the game, but
5760000	5762000	but we can't do it
5762000	5764000	isn't the Xbox 360 all based off
5764000	5766000	a version of that? I mean wasn't the original name of the
5766000	5768000	Xbox the direct Xbox?
5768000	5770000	no, that's stupid
5770000	5772000	I thought that's where this whole thing came from
5772000	5774000	no, it's basically
5774000	5776000	the Xbox 360
5776000	5778000	like the Xbox 360
5778000	5780000	is running on a modified version of
5780000	5782000	DirectX 9 that has some of the
5782000	5784000	features of DirectX 10 in it
5784000	5786000	but
5786000	5788000	it's basically DirectX 9
5788000	5790000	alright
5790000	5792000	and one more tweet here from
5792000	5794000	gamergirl saying, which do you think is better
5794000	5796000	Torchlight PC version or Torchlight
5796000	5798000	Xbox Live version
5798000	5800000	and what do you find fun about the game as a whole?
5800000	5802000	I would say the PC version
5802000	5804000	is much better and the reason for that is
5804000	5806000	that they tried to cram too much into the Xbox
5806000	5808000	Live one and unfortunately it suffers
5808000	5810000	from some frame rate issues and just a really
5810000	5812000	awkward interface, I mean
5812000	5814000	for a dungeon crawler, collect a bunch of items
5814000	5816000	games, it doesn't work
5816000	5818000	too well on Xbox, I mean if for whatever
5818000	5820000	reason you hate gaming on the PC
5820000	5822000	then the Xbox is an okay substitute
5822000	5824000	I've played far worse games on
5824000	5826000	Xbox Live, but I just think between the two, the PC
5826000	5828000	version is superior. What do I like about the
5828000	5830000	game? Well, did you ever play Diablo
5830000	5832000	2? Because if you like that, that's why
5832000	5834000	I like Torchlight, because it's like a newer version
5834000	5836000	of that, but otherwise I like the fact
5836000	5838000	that the dungeons are always randomly generated
5838000	5840000	and there's something about that exploring
5840000	5842000	and collecting, you know, kind of like
5842000	5844000	that slow grind of improving your character
5844000	5846000	and completing quests, kind of like
5846000	5848000	a little bit like an RPG but with
5848000	5850000	much more action in it, I think that's
5850000	5852000	kind of what draws me to the game is that, you know, there's
5852000	5854000	definitely that exploration and you can't
5854000	5856000	really spoil it, like there can't be a strategy
5856000	5858000	guide for how to explore level
5858000	5860000	3, because level 3 is always different
5860000	5862000	it's random for each person that plays it
5862000	5864000	and I think that's part of the charm of it
5864000	5866000	Alright, I'm letting in one more tweet
5866000	5868000	here from SSJ100Matt saying
5868000	5870000	Someone took My Little Pony
5870000	5872000	and mixed it with the Starcraft 2
5872000	5874000	trailer and sends us a link to
5874000	5876000	something on YouTube called Ponycraft
5882000	5884000	I'm not sure what to do
5884000	5886000	This is not My Little Pony
5886000	5888000	It's like Noose. Did they redo My Little Pony
5888000	5890000	a couple of years ago or something?
5890000	5892000	They might have
5892000	5894000	This is not the one from the games
5894000	5896000	That's really not going to make
5896000	5898000	sense to me at most
5898000	5900000	Yeah, it's like a new My Little Pony
5902000	5904000	Might have a lot of vengeance
5904000	5906000	Somebody has far too much time
5906000	5908000	on their hands, that's all I'm going to say
5910000	5912000	Whatever, if that's the
5912000	5914000	project you want to be famous for, then cool
5914000	5916000	Alright, that's pretty hilarious
5916000	5918000	It's interesting
5918000	5920000	I've seen weirder things on YouTube, I guess
5920000	5922000	Nuclear Boy
5922000	5924000	I have not seen Nuclear Boy
5924000	5926000	And what is, ok
5926000	5928000	It's a great way to describe it to children
5928000	5930000	And I'm not up to date on all my
5930000	5932000	astrological stuff that's going on right now
5932000	5934000	or astronomical, I guess
5934000	5936000	Yeah, astronomical
5936000	5938000	But what the fuck is the super moon that they keep
5938000	5940000	seeing fucking tweets about and shit
5940000	5942000	Something about the moon being closer in orbit
5942000	5944000	I believe
5944000	5946000	It was supposed to be gigantic in the sky last night
5946000	5948000	but we wouldn't know because it's been raining
5948000	5950000	for like nine fucking days straight here
5950000	5952000	so the clouds have been blocking the sky
5952000	5954000	So you missed something, but you didn't
5954000	5956000	You would have had to drive that way
5956000	5958000	There's a picture of it
5958000	5960000	from Washington, DC
5960000	5962000	The super moon
5962000	5964000	See, there it is big
5964000	5966000	Oh, that's dumb
5966000	5968000	That's not big at all
5968000	5970000	But the moon's really big, Loki
5970000	5972000	It's a super moon
5972000	5974000	And since it's over Los Angeles
5974000	5976000	it's orange with a big rip across it
5976000	5978000	like an Evangelion or something
5978000	5980000	Seriously
5980000	5982000	Now I can see that
5982000	5984000	Alright, let's move on
5984000	5986000	Twitter topics are done, so back into the news
5986000	5988000	Loki, what have you got for us
5988000	5990000	Yeah, so
5990000	5992000	Super moon
5992000	5994000	This has been kind of a thing
5994000	5996000	that's been going on with Australia for the
5996000	5998000	longest time
5998000	6000000	Take violent game, ban it
6000000	6002000	because hey, you know what, we don't have anything
6002000	6004000	that's, you know, for adults
6004000	6006000	So, too bad
6006000	6008000	So apparently, Mortal Kombat
6008000	6010000	they appealed
6010000	6012000	the
6012000	6014000	failure to rate
6014000	6016000	the game
6016000	6018000	because it was not classified as
6018000	6020000	R15, and instead
6020000	6022000	their appeal was rejected
6022000	6024000	So, now
6024000	6026000	unless changes are
6026000	6028000	made, they cannot release it in
6028000	6030000	Australia
6030000	6032000	So that kind of sucks
6032000	6034000	And it will ban the title from
6034000	6036000	official retail distribution
6036000	6038000	And, of course
6038000	6040000	One of our other games is Extremely
6040000	6042000	Disappointed
6042000	6044000	That's always the comment, we're extremely disappointed
6044000	6046000	I'd be like, we're fucking pissed
6046000	6048000	That would be my fucking press statement
6048000	6050000	right there, fuck them in their asses
6050000	6052000	We're pissed
6052000	6054000	And they were
6054000	6056000	saying, praising thousands
6056000	6058000	of Mortal Kombat fans in Australia
6058000	6060000	and around the world who have voiced their support
6060000	6062000	during the appeal process
6062000	6064000	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
6064000	6066000	Really? Are you surprised?
6066000	6068000	I mean, they banned games with lesser
6068000	6070000	crap in there
6070000	6072000	Not to say that this will always
6072000	6074000	be the case, in fact, they're actually
6074000	6076000	pressing the
6076000	6078000	I guess the Australian
6078000	6080000	federal government
6080000	6082000	They're hoping to have
6082000	6084000	a consensus on the R18
6084000	6086000	game rating creation
6086000	6088000	Which is stupid
6088000	6090000	This is all government run anyways
6090000	6092000	But, whatever
6092000	6094000	Of course
6094000	6096000	The
6096000	6098000	MA-15 Plus
6098000	6100000	that the
6100000	6102000	country already has for mature games
6102000	6104000	is not good enough for
6104000	6106000	some of these, so adding the
6106000	6108000	restricted R18 Plus rating
6108000	6110000	will allow them to release some of these
6110000	6112000	more mature games
6112000	6114000	into the country
6116000	6118000	They said
6118000	6120000	I foreshadow that there is
6120000	6122000	if there's not consensus around
6122000	6124000	this issue, the Commonwealth will certainly
6124000	6126000	be considering other options because we
6126000	6128000	cannot continue to have an outdated
6128000	6130000	classification system that's actually
6130000	6132000	in my view, causing harm to young people
6134000	6136000	It just seems, I mean, the Saw movies aren't
6136000	6138000	banned there, right? I don't think so
6138000	6140000	What I saw in this game was no worse than Saw
6140000	6142000	I mean, I'm always gonna use that
6142000	6144000	as my defense. Those goddamn Saw movies
6144000	6146000	are terrible! Well, I don't understand how they always
6146000	6148000	rate games as, well, it's interactive
6148000	6150000	so it's more violent. No,
6150000	6152000	I don't think so. I think it's less
6152000	6154000	violent. If you think about it, I mean
6154000	6156000	the content in these games
6156000	6158000	like, for example
6158000	6160000	Grand Theft Auto, you can run people
6160000	6162000	over and they, you know, blood
6162000	6164000	sprays and stuff like that, you can set people on fire
6164000	6166000	all that stuff, but it's nowhere near as graphic
6166000	6168000	as you see it depicted in movies
6168000	6170000	I mean,
6170000	6172000	it's just way worse. It's cartoony
6172000	6174000	almost. And I mean
6174000	6176000	really
6176000	6178000	at what age are we gonna, like
6178000	6180000	finally let teenagers
6180000	6182000	you know, be able
6182000	6184000	to decide for themselves what's
6184000	6186000	reality and what's fantasy
6186000	6188000	because if they don't know that a game is
6188000	6190000	not real
6190000	6192000	then there's more, you know, serious
6192000	6194000	problems with them than
6194000	6196000	them playing a violent game
6196000	6198000	I'm fine with them taking violence
6198000	6200000	out of video games completely. Like, they could
6200000	6202000	just strip every video game out there of violence
6202000	6204000	as long as we could get ample nudity in its
6204000	6206000	place. That's what I'm saying.
6206000	6208000	Let's get some boobs. Nudity is even
6208000	6210000	worse. Like, it's like, oh my god, you know
6210000	6212000	there's a little bit of nudity in this game
6212000	6214000	oh, banned. Oh, but violence, we
6214000	6216000	can, you know, we can
6216000	6218000	drill holes in this guy's head
6218000	6220000	while he's, you know, still alive
6220000	6222000	but as soon as you wanna fuck one of those
6222000	6224000	holes, oh, banned.
6224000	6226000	Wow.
6226000	6228000	Well, speaking
6228000	6230000	of legal troubles
6230000	6232000	you might remember that Activision
6232000	6234000	had filed a suit against
6234000	6236000	Electronic Arts and the former
6236000	6238000	heads of Infinity Ward
6238000	6240000	well, in California, it was ruled this
6240000	6242000	week that the lawsuit filed by
6242000	6244000	Activision against the former Infinity Ward
6244000	6246000	studio heads, Vince Zampanella
6246000	6248000	and Jason West, it will be able to
6248000	6250000	proceed. EA wanted to have
6250000	6252000	the case dismissed
6252000	6254000	but unfortunately, the judge
6254000	6256000	felt differently. They decided
6256000	6258000	there is enough evidence that the case can go on to trial.
6258000	6260000	EA's options now
6260000	6262000	at this point, they can still request a summary
6262000	6264000	judgment that way
6264000	6266000	you know, it could all be rejected
6266000	6268000	but if that doesn't happen, then the case can
6268000	6270000	go to trial in May of this year.
6270000	6272000	It's gonna be interesting. Or it will get settled
6272000	6274000	out of court before then because that's what always seems to
6274000	6276000	happen. Has a video game case ever gone to trial?
6276000	6278000	Don't they always get settled out of court?
6278000	6280000	I don't think I've ever seen one go to trial.
6280000	6282000	I'm talking about one
6282000	6284000	between companies. I'm not talking about
6284000	6286000	some crazed asshole
6286000	6288000	played an Xbox and decided to do something
6288000	6290000	stupid. That's not a true
6290000	6292000	game lawsuit. That's just an idiot doing something
6292000	6294000	idiotic. I'm talking about
6294000	6296000	an actual two companies
6296000	6298000	suing each other. Does it ever not
6298000	6300000	get settled? Because they
6300000	6302000	usually end up having to pay less
6302000	6304000	by not going to court.
6304000	6306000	Or at least they have the illusion of this.
6306000	6308000	It's all just a giant game of chicken.
6308000	6310000	Chicken!
6310000	6312000	Alright.
6312000	6314000	So let's move on, DarkSakura.
6314000	6316000	Well.
6316000	6318000	Hold on.
6318000	6320000	Okay.
6320000	6322000	No, I cannot hold on any longer.
6322000	6324000	Because I pulled up the mailbag instead
6324000	6326000	of the story. Oops.
6326000	6328000	So,
6328000	6330000	I'm sure people remember me having
6330000	6332000	spoken of the King of Kong, right?
6332000	6334000	And it was the
6334000	6336000	video
6336000	6338000	of Steve Weeby and Billy
6338000	6340000	Mitchell.
6340000	6342000	Mitchell, yes. I'm sorry. He's a jerk.
6342000	6344000	Mitchell!
6344000	6346000	Trying to compete for the
6346000	6348000	top scorer on Donkey Kong. Well, now
6348000	6350000	we've got a new
6350000	6352000	documentary out called
6352000	6354000	Dr. Kong.
6354000	6356000	And this
6356000	6358000	is about
6358000	6360000	Dr. Chien, who is a
6360000	6362000	plastic surgeon, who
6362000	6364000	beat Steve Weeby's
6364000	6366000	record, reset record,
6366000	6368000	by hitting
6368000	6370000	1,090,400
6370000	6372000	points on Donkey Kong.
6372000	6374000	So,
6374000	6376000	there actually is a website about it.
6376000	6378000	You can go to
6378000	6380000	DrKongTheMovie.com
6380000	6382000	and...
6382000	6384000	Can I play the trailer here?
6384000	6386000	Play it, sure. It's kind of interesting, actually.
6386000	6388000	I don't know why. It's funny.
6388000	6390000	Here we go. So we see scenes of the
6390000	6392000	plastic surgery going on.
6392000	6394000	Establishing shots of
6394000	6396000	yes, this dude is a surgeon.
6396000	6398000	I'm copying this to the chat room, by the way. Sure.
6400000	6402000	And then you see him playing some Donkey Kong.
6404000	6406000	And he has a Donkey Kong machine.
6406000	6408000	I was feeling one of the people at Twin Galaxies
6408000	6410000	and when he found out I was a plastic surgeon, he was like
6410000	6412000	should you be out getting laid?
6412000	6414000	Like, why are you playing Donkey Kong?
6416000	6418000	I was like, I'm playing Donkey Kong so I can't get laid.
6418000	6420000	Wait a minute.
6420000	6422000	He's playing Donkey Kong
6422000	6424000	so he can't get laid?
6424000	6426000	Like, I don't get that. He's a plastic surgeon.
6426000	6428000	He makes girls' boobies bigger all day long.
6428000	6430000	That's what plastic surgeons do, right?
6430000	6432000	All they do is boob jobs, right?
6432000	6434000	Well, chin jobs
6434000	6436000	and lipo. Never
6436000	6438000	reconstructive surgeries after accidents, though.
6438000	6440000	No.
6440000	6442000	Just boob jobs. I don't need that.
6442000	6444000	So he works on boobies all day
6444000	6446000	but he plays
6446000	6448000	Donkey Kong to get laid.
6448000	6450000	I'm not sure I see the logic there
6450000	6452000	but let's continue.
6456000	6458000	I kind of like, I don't know, fame
6458000	6460000	I guess, or glory. I don't know.
6460000	6462000	Congratulations!
6462000	6464000	Paul, this guy's the guy that beat the world
6464000	6466000	that just beat the Donkey Kong.
6468000	6470000	Now that you have the world record
6470000	6472000	you have to quit playing.
6472000	6474000	Do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?
6474000	6476000	What?
6480000	6482000	That was the trailer. Do you tell Mozart
6482000	6484000	to stop composing music?
6484000	6486000	So is that the big question that's gonna be
6486000	6488000	answered in the movie? Like, does he get laid?
6488000	6490000	No.
6490000	6492000	No, he does not get laid.
6492000	6494000	Aw, what a downer.
6494000	6496000	And to...
6496000	6498000	He sounds like William.
6498000	6500000	Stop it!
6500000	6502000	Stop it!
6502000	6504000	Oh my god, Rob.
6504000	6506000	You are so red in the face right now.
6506000	6508000	Cause I'm mad that he dared bring that up
6508000	6510000	on this program.
6510000	6512000	You're a dick.
6512000	6514000	At least he sounds more educated.
6514000	6516000	He doesn't sound...
6516000	6518000	Next story!
6520000	6522000	Oh, put the 3DS down.
6522000	6524000	Loki, put the 3DS down
6524000	6526000	before I shove it up your ass.
6526000	6528000	Oh, fine.
6528000	6530000	Our next story.
6530000	6532000	Let's talk a little bit about Minecraft.
6532000	6534000	Yes, Minecraft.
6534000	6536000	Minecraft, they're going the route of
6536000	6538000	Nintendogs.
6538000	6540000	And you're gonna get
6540000	6542000	your own
6542000	6544000	I guess, domesticated wolf
6544000	6546000	Canines.
6546000	6548000	And...
6548000	6550000	You'll be able to walk around with them
6550000	6552000	and whatnot.
6552000	6554000	And then of course, later on, they're gonna be
6554000	6556000	adding achievements as well. That's the next thing.
6556000	6558000	But for right now,
6558000	6560000	they are working on
6560000	6562000	pet wolves.
6564000	6566000	Neat, I guess.
6566000	6568000	I don't know if they really
6568000	6570000	would do much. I mean, can you train them to
6570000	6572000	attack things?
6572000	6574000	I don't know.
6574000	6576000	I have a friend who has pet wolves.
6576000	6578000	Like real ones? Yes.
6578000	6580000	Just hanging out in the backyard?
6580000	6582000	A couple of them are half-wolves and one of them is full.
6582000	6584000	Here in SAC?
6584000	6586000	Yeah.
6586000	6588000	They're domesticated.
6588000	6590000	Kind of neat. I don't know.
6590000	6592000	They're kind of cool-looking.
6592000	6594000	These Minecraft ones are far more adorable.
6594000	6596000	That's all I'm saying. They are pretty adorable.
6596000	6598000	Is he gonna punch that wolf?
6598000	6600000	Oh, he's gonna beat it with a... No?
6600000	6602000	Punch? What is that?
6602000	6604000	What does that even have in his hand?
6604000	6606000	Looks like a stub.
6606000	6608000	Maybe it's like a stick to play fetch.
6608000	6610000	I still have yet to play
6610000	6612000	Minecraft. I feel so uncool and uneducated.
6612000	6614000	Yeah.
6614000	6616000	I kind of feel the same way.
6616000	6618000	You're so kind to me tonight.
6618000	6620000	Now he's punching a...
6620000	6622000	Oh, he punched a cow in the ass
6622000	6624000	and then the wolves are
6624000	6626000	attacking the cow.
6626000	6628000	Nice.
6628000	6630000	So you can stick your wolves on...
6630000	6632000	on other things.
6632000	6634000	So I guess you can now release the hounds.
6636000	6638000	That's neat.
6640000	6642000	Alright.
6642000	6644000	What happens if you punch the dog?
6644000	6646000	They probably get angry.
6646000	6648000	They bite your nuts off.
6648000	6650000	Is Minecraft like an MMO?
6650000	6652000	You can play with other people.
6652000	6654000	So you can visit other people's worlds and stuff?
6654000	6656000	That's kind of cool.
6656000	6658000	I really need to try this damn game already.
6658000	6660000	I don't know why I've been so lazy.
6660000	6662000	Oh, the dog's showing hearts.
6662000	6664000	He likes you.
6664000	6666000	He gave him a bone.
6666000	6668000	You try to hump, you're like...
6668000	6670000	The dog's on fire.
6670000	6672000	That's not good.
6672000	6674000	Cause the dog's stupid and standing over the fire.
6674000	6676000	Oh good. I've got people in chat. Defective Candy.
6676000	6678000	Don't feel bad. I've never played Minecraft either.
6678000	6680000	And SilverSonic. I've never played Minecraft either.
6680000	6682000	I will make it my mission this week to play Minecraft.
6682000	6684000	At some point. I promise.
6684000	6686000	I couldn't get into it. I didn't like it.
6686000	6688000	Really? What about it didn't you like?
6688000	6690000	It's just kind of a pain in the ass.
6690000	6692000	I think it's just you don't know where to start with it.
6692000	6694000	It's like...
6694000	6696000	I tried and I just honestly
6696000	6698000	I couldn't get into it and it just wasn't fun to me.
6698000	6700000	But it's like the big thing in gaming right now.
6700000	6702000	It's like Minecraft and Angry Birds.
6702000	6704000	Yeah, and if
6704000	6706000	you know everybody
6706000	6708000	if the biggest thing in gaming was for everyone to play
6708000	6710000	their Nintendo 3DS
6710000	6712000	while walking towards the end of a broken bridge.
6712000	6714000	Guess what?
6714000	6716000	I'll be playing PSP in my house.
6716000	6718000	Alright, moving on.
6718000	6720000	The Kodoo Game Lab.
6720000	6722000	I don't see a lot of coverage on this.
6722000	6724000	But it's out there and about.
6724000	6726000	Microsoft did release this.
6726000	6728000	It's a game creation utility.
6728000	6730000	It just came out this past week.
6730000	6732000	It's a free software suite.
6732000	6734000	And it's doing a game design
6734000	6736000	competition to sort of
6736000	6738000	kick off the whole Kodoo Game Lab.
6738000	6740000	It's called the Kodoo Cup 2011.
6740000	6742000	It's for
6742000	6744000	students aged 9 to 17.
6744000	6746000	Oh great, the target age group of our show.
6746000	6748000	Divided into
6748000	6750000	two age groups within the 9 to 17 bracket.
6750000	6752000	You will use the software
6752000	6754000	to design your game.
6754000	6756000	It's submitted by May 10th.
6756000	6758000	Prizes. $5,000 awards
6758000	6760000	for both individuals and schools.
6760000	6762000	A trip to New York City. Laptop connect
6762000	6764000	bundles. And a Zune HD.
6764000	6766000	Which is amazing because didn't we also have a story
6766000	6768000	this week that the Zune got
6768000	6770000	axed?
6770000	6772000	Gotta get rid of them somehow.
6772000	6774000	Maybe they'll have like 5,000 Zune HD's
6774000	6776000	as runner up prizes trying to get rid of
6776000	6778000	their Overstock.
6778000	6780000	That's too bad.
6780000	6782000	What I like
6782000	6784000	about this is the screenshot I'm looking at
6784000	6786000	of the Kodoo Game Lab. Somebody has designed
6786000	6788000	the lost numbers as a computer chip.
6788000	6790000	The 4, 8, 15, eh forget it.
6790000	6792000	Anyhow, so if you
6792000	6794000	are between 9 and 17 and you want to win money
6794000	6796000	or a, you know, Zune cause they're
6796000	6798000	so popular, check that out.
6798000	6800000	Meanwhile, let's go to the Mailbag.
6800000	6802000	Every week Dark Sakura reads
6802000	6804000	the emails that you guys send us at
6804000	6806000	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
6806000	6808000	So, why don't
6808000	6810000	Dark Sakura, why don't you
6810000	6812000	put on your surgical gloves, get ready
6812000	6814000	to jump in there and do some plastic surgery
6814000	6816000	on the mailbag. Ew, it's squishy.
6816000	6818000	Ok, first
6818000	6820000	Like a boob. No, not like a boob.
6820000	6822000	Like putting your finger
6822000	6824000	up a butt or something.
6824000	6826000	Anyway, hello OLR, it's your
6826000	6828000	friendly neighborhood spazzinator. Seeing as
6828000	6830000	the OLR mailbag has been a wee bit
6830000	6832000	on the light side as of late, I thought
6832000	6834000	it might be
6834000	6836000	a good'em idea
6836000	6838000	G-O-O-D-M, idea to
6838000	6840000	send an email rather than a tweet for
6840000	6842000	a change of pace. I found a little
6842000	6844000	something of note that bears mentioning seeing as it
6844000	6846000	relates to a subject you folks touched on
6846000	6848000	last week. Must be why I wasn't here.
6848000	6850000	With the recent events
6850000	6852000	in Japan in mind, SCEA's
6852000	6854000	arrangement to relay donations to the Red Cross
6854000	6856000	from one's PSN
6856000	6858000	wallet. As of the time I typed this
6858000	6860000	there's a spot on the game's side of the PSN
6860000	6862000	store, the first icon you see once you enter the new
6862000	6864000	pieces section, that allow you to make donations
6864000	6866000	of 2, 5, 10, 25, and
6866000	6868000	50 dollars
6868000	6870000	in US funds. I imagine
6870000	6872000	that you could make multiple
6872000	6874000	donations and mix and match amounts as well.
6874000	6876000	Although I can't say for sure that
6876000	6878000	I don't have access to the stores in other regions
6878000	6880000	I'd imagine there's similar setups in other regions'
6880000	6882000	PSN stores as well. In case
6882000	6884000	either of you, in case
6884000	6886000	either one of you or a fellow listener is asking
6886000	6888000	albeit to oneself,
6888000	6890000	something along the lines of, so
6890000	6892000	here's my point, this makes things that
6892000	6894000	much easier to donate to a cause if you feel
6894000	6896000	so inclined, but may not necessarily
6896000	6898000	have a PayPal or bank account, etc.
6898000	6900000	Such is the case with me, but I digress.
6900000	6902000	I'm not sure if Microsoft
6902000	6904000	will be doing a similar setup
6904000	6906000	in the Xbox, the
6906000	6908000	XBL marketplace, but if
6908000	6910000	I were betting man, the odds are in favor of it.
6910000	6912000	So in short, if you would like to donate and think
6912000	6914000	you can do without a rock band song, or if not
6914000	6916000	more, and you're on PSN
6916000	6918000	anyways, why not make a donation through the PSN stores?
6918000	6920000	Whispers, psss.
6920000	6922000	Besides, then you can honestly claim
6922000	6924000	that gaming does actually do some good
6924000	6926000	in the fact that it would just really piss off certain
6926000	6928000	ex-lawyer from Florida.
6928000	6930000	XD colon minus
6930000	6932000	P. I have not
6932000	6934000	heard about that guy in a very long time.
6934000	6936000	That certain ex-lawyer from Florida.
6936000	6938000	And that makes me happy that he
6938000	6940000	has not been in the news in a very long time.
6940000	6942000	That's one of the best things
6942000	6944000	to come out of this email, honestly. I bet he's
6944000	6946000	sitting on attack going, ow, there's attack.
6946000	6948000	Damn gamers.
6948000	6950000	Damn you gamers.
6950000	6952000	And you get a cute little theme.
6952000	6954000	And also to keep in mind
6954000	6956000	whenever you make a donation to
6956000	6958000	charity, get a receipt of it.
6958000	6960000	You can write it off on your taxes.
6960000	6962000	If you are, of course,
6962000	6964000	of tax paying age.
6964000	6966000	Just saying.
6966000	6968000	So you get a kickback. Not bad.
6968000	6970000	Also save all your school receipts.
6970000	6972000	Okay, I would close this
6972000	6974000	email with a clever quip or something, but frankly
6974000	6976000	my brain is fried due to lack of sleep.
6976000	6978000	And the word is lack of
6978000	6980000	sleep. And I can't think of
6980000	6982000	anything currently, so I'll just say this.
6982000	6984000	If you happen to have a PSN account with some
6984000	6986000	spare money on it, please
6986000	6988000	at symbol, at least consider donating.
6988000	6990000	And I just think
6990000	6992000	that because everything else is so flawlessly
6992000	6994000	done and the grammar is so awesome.
6994000	6996000	You can see the tiredness
6996000	6998000	coming through. I can see the tiredness.
6998000	7000000	And I'm like, I do that same crap when
7000000	7002000	I'm tired. So I was like,
7002000	7004000	okay, but some of them made me laugh.
7004000	7006000	I like good'em.
7006000	7008000	Good'em. Good'em. I'm gonna use that
7008000	7010000	word good'em. Don't know what it means,
7010000	7012000	but it's good'em. All good'em.
7012000	7014000	Mm-mm, good'em.
7014000	7016000	Crunchy- crunchy-um. Crunch'ems.
7016000	7018000	There should be a serial called good'em.
7018000	7020000	Okay, last email.
7020000	7022000	I'm- Nooooo.
7022000	7024000	AHHHHHHH
7024000	7026000	AHHH
7026000	7028000	Rob.
7028000	7030000	Apparently the last email was from the Tasmanian devil.
7030000	7032000	Rob. Rob. Rob what? Rob what?
7032000	7034000	Rob. Rob. What?
7034000	7036000	AHHHHHH
7036000	7038000	AHHH
7038000	7040000	Dinoboat fire.
7040000	7042000	No.
7042000	7044000	I'm writing about two things.
7044000	7046000	One, Test Drive Unlimited 2
7046000	7048000	has finally patched
7048000	7050000	and now does multiplayer events. If you put
7050000	7052000	it down because of the locked out bugs,
7052000	7054000	you can play it again. They serve
7054000	7056000	this up by installing the enticing
7056000	7058000	memory- sorry, the enticing
7058000	7060000	update named mandatory 1.
7060000	7062000	Two,
7062000	7064000	why hasn't us lately been
7064000	7066000	talking about how great the iOS devices
7066000	7068000	play games being DS killers
7068000	7070000	or the death of the consoles? That is
7070000	7072000	total bullshit. The iOS touch
7072000	7074000	screen is only better for certain types
7074000	7076000	of games. Nintendo's 3DS is
7076000	7078000	poised to sell like hotcakes and I believe it will.
7078000	7080000	As for consoles, as long as
7080000	7082000	they are configuration
7082000	7084000	controlled, they will always be popular.
7084000	7086000	I just believe that it's Apple,
7086000	7088000	Apple's fanboys, and Sony that are trying to
7088000	7090000	cast doubt on Nintendo's business.
7090000	7092000	I agree.
7092000	7094000	Yes. And I think I've said that on the show before
7094000	7096000	is that the Apple stuff,
7096000	7098000	the device itself,
7098000	7100000	not all games work on it.
7100000	7102000	And a lot of the ports, they show
7102000	7104000	being bad ports.
7104000	7106000	But some of the original stuff works out okay, like that
7106000	7108000	re-rave game we were talking about earlier. I mean, that was
7108000	7110000	designed for a touch screen. It works.
7110000	7112000	And it works pretty good. I'm sorry,
7112000	7114000	pretty good-um. Alright.
7114000	7116000	Pretty well, actually. Any other
7116000	7118000	emails tonight? Pretty well. Well-um.
7118000	7120000	Well-um.
7120000	7122000	No, that's it, Rob. Alright,
7122000	7124000	mailbag at orangelaundry.com
7124000	7126000	if you want to send us an email to possibly
7126000	7128000	maybe read on
7128000	7130000	next week's show. Maybe.
7130000	7132000	But for now, some angst
7132000	7150000	in the segment we call FUs of the Week.
7150000	7152000	Um.
7152000	7154000	FU.
7154000	7156000	This is sort of an FU to jury
7156000	7158000	duty. I mean, I know it's my civic
7158000	7160000	duty and actually I kind of want to be on a
7160000	7162000	case, but right now
7162000	7164000	I don't have to go in tomorrow, so I'm very happy.
7164000	7166000	You should reschedule yours
7166000	7168000	for May 9th, because that's the night device.
7168000	7170000	Okay.
7170000	7172000	Well, I actually am going to have to reschedule
7172000	7174000	mine for after school because I can't have anything.
7174000	7176000	And here's my FU.
7176000	7178000	FU to the damn light cycle
7178000	7180000	that I'm having to model
7180000	7182000	in Maya.
7182000	7184000	I've gotten the tail of it done
7184000	7186000	finally, but I'm
7186000	7188000	having a hell of a time with a curve.
7188000	7190000	I can't
7190000	7192000	get Maya installed on my computer, so
7192000	7194000	it's pissing me off.
7194000	7196000	And I don't really feel like going to hang
7196000	7198000	out at the Mac Lab all day using the Mac Lab
7198000	7200000	to try to get it to work.
7200000	7202000	So Maya can bite my butt.
7202000	7204000	Yeah.
7204000	7206000	I'm probably
7206000	7208000	gonna not get an A in this class.
7208000	7210000	I kind of don't care. I just
7210000	7212000	want to pass it.
7212000	7214000	Because guess who's graduating this semester.
7214000	7216000	That would be me!
7216000	7218000	Okay, I'm done.
7218000	7220000	I'm just reminded of a scene with some
7220000	7222000	strangers with candy. I got a D!
7222000	7224000	You know what?
7224000	7226000	What?
7226000	7228000	I have not gotten a D at all.
7228000	7230000	What about an F?
7230000	7232000	The only reason I got an F
7232000	7234000	is because I dropped the class and they didn't
7234000	7236000	register me on the books that I dropped it.
7236000	7238000	F for fantastic work.
7238000	7240000	F for
7240000	7242000	fuck this place!
7242000	7244000	Um...
7244000	7246000	I would say probably F you to
7246000	7248000	um...
7248000	7250000	a few colds
7250000	7252000	and having
7252000	7254000	my son have a cold
7254000	7256000	because he's really cranky. And F you
7256000	7258000	the tape gun that attacked my finger
7258000	7260000	earlier this week. I now have
7260000	7262000	I have multiple cuts on my finger.
7262000	7264000	Did it jump up and bite you?
7264000	7266000	Something like that. I have
7266000	7268000	one, two, three. That looks painful. My god.
7268000	7270000	That wasn't that painful. But yeah, there's
7270000	7272000	like five. Imagine if you
7272000	7274000	cut yourself with
7274000	7276000	not necessarily a piece of paper but like
7276000	7278000	maybe like a knife
7278000	7280000	just like a small cut
7280000	7282000	but five of those
7282000	7284000	really close together. That's basically
7284000	7286000	the tape gun for you. And it did that
7286000	7288000	on two fingers.
7288000	7290000	It hurt for a little bit but no more than that paper
7290000	7292000	cut. It looked really bad though.
7292000	7294000	That was fun.
7294000	7296000	That's it.
7296000	7298000	My F you goes to Loki
7298000	7300000	for bringing up my ex on the program.
7300000	7302000	On live internet radio. Thank you Loki.
7302000	7304000	But really though
7304000	7306000	my F you goes to
7306000	7308000	tacos because they are amazing and
7308000	7310000	addicting and I really want one right now.
7310000	7312000	Like just a taco sounds great.
7312000	7314000	Just saying.
7314000	7316000	You know Rob, we had pesto chicken
7316000	7318000	you could have some. That's alright.
7318000	7320000	I'm craving the really fatty Jim Boy's ground beef
7320000	7322000	tacos. Parmesan cheese
7322000	7324000	on the crust. Delicious.
7324000	7326000	Alright.
7326000	7328000	Moving on with some more news and then
7328000	7330000	the Skype line at 1877 game OLR.
7330000	7332000	But not yet. We have some more news stories
7332000	7334000	real quick. Loki. Yes.
7334000	7336000	And you know I don't know this
7336000	7338000	is kind of
7338000	7340000	interesting.
7340000	7342000	But you know
7342000	7344000	this kind of ties in with announcements of announcements.
7344000	7346000	But there is a rumor
7346000	7348000	right now that there's I guess
7348000	7350000	an Hitman ARG
7350000	7352000	that's going on right now.
7352000	7354000	That's leading up
7354000	7356000	to the announcement of a new Hitman game
7356000	7358000	at E3.
7358000	7360000	That series is still around?
7360000	7362000	Yes it's apparently still around.
7364000	7366000	I guess it's
7366000	7368000	right now they're saying
7368000	7370000	that
7370000	7372000	I'm trying to see where it's coming from.
7372000	7374000	It started with an ad
7374000	7376000	from Faircount Media Group
7376000	7378000	in a catalog at Sundance Film Festival
7378000	7380000	depicting a box of
7380000	7382000	the
7382000	7384000	Hitman series brand donuts
7384000	7386000	with a barcode ending in 47.
7386000	7388000	And then it says I guess
7388000	7390000	when a Hitman forum user tracked down
7390000	7392000	the agency responsible for the ad
7392000	7394000	and emailed them he received a
7394000	7396000	response from an account saying
7396000	7398000	you're on the right track.
7398000	7400000	And then they gave him a new image showing a pair
7400000	7402000	of black gloves that appears
7402000	7404000	to be a game script
7404000	7406000	and another barcode ending in 47
7406000	7408000	and some other random numbers and blah blah blah blah blah.
7408000	7410000	Whatever. Okay so it's a
7410000	7412000	stupid ARG leading up to
7412000	7414000	the announcement of Hitman.
7414000	7416000	Great.
7416000	7418000	Oldest have to wait until E3.
7418000	7420000	Oh surprise.
7420000	7422000	I love announcements about announcements.
7422000	7424000	My favorite thing in the gaming industry.
7424000	7426000	In seven days
7426000	7428000	we will be announcing
7428000	7430000	an announcement about a game coming out in 14 months.
7430000	7432000	You don't
7432000	7434000	make it so damn obvious
7434000	7436000	what it's going to be.
7436000	7438000	You have to make it completely
7438000	7440000	weird and off the wall.
7440000	7442000	And then people are like oh.
7442000	7444000	There will be a trailer announcing
7444000	7446000	this announcement.
7448000	7450000	Moving on. One other quick story
7450000	7452000	for you guys. It has to do with the game
7452000	7454000	Doodle Jump. Have you ever heard of Doodle Jump?
7454000	7456000	Dan plays Doodle Jump all the time.
7456000	7458000	I have never heard of this game but apparently
7458000	7460000	it sold 10 million copies
7460000	7462000	between iPhone and Android.
7462000	7464000	What is Doodle Jump then DarkSira?
7464000	7466000	You'd have that little dude
7466000	7468000	on the picture. It's like
7468000	7470000	you just turn it and he jumps from platform
7470000	7472000	to platform and you just have to keep him going forward.
7472000	7474000	Oh okay so you don't actually doodle in the game.
7474000	7476000	I don't think so. Interesting. I haven't played it.
7476000	7478000	I've just seen Dan play it. Well they've sold 10 million
7478000	7480000	copies. I think you can
7480000	7482000	make your own characters by doodling.
7482000	7484000	And funny enough this is the perfect
7484000	7486000	kind of last story for tonight to kind of go
7486000	7488000	with that story that came up earlier about how
7488000	7490000	Zynga is like we don't want to do our game on
7490000	7492000	Xbox because Xbox is too
7492000	7494000	small. Well what's the announcement?
7494000	7496000	Yep Doodle Jump is going to be coming out for
7496000	7498000	Xbox 360.
7498000	7500000	Lima
7500000	7502000	Skye who is the creative
7502000	7504000	person behind the game
7504000	7506000	Doodle Jump said that
7506000	7508000	they reached 10 million of their milestone.
7508000	7510000	They've also said that they are going to
7510000	7512000	be bringing the game to Xbox Live
7512000	7514000	Arcade and the Kinect controller
7514000	7516000	for Microsoft. They
7516000	7518000	also want to release a multiplayer update
7518000	7520000	to the iPhone version. They want to do an
7520000	7522000	iPad version and of course
7522000	7524000	merchandise, t-shirts, stickers,
7524000	7526000	buttons, yay!
7526000	7528000	Can't wait.
7528000	7530000	So even though some people
7530000	7532000	want to hate on Xbox 360 because
7532000	7534000	it's too small, some
7534000	7536000	people think it might be a good
7536000	7538000	place for their game. At least the Doodle Jump
7538000	7540000	people think so.
7540000	7542000	So that's it for the news tonight. Let's
7542000	7544000	go to the Skype line. We're going to open up the phone
7544000	7546000	lines right now. 1-877-GAMELR
7546000	7548000	or our username on Skype is
7548000	7550000	OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.
7550000	7552000	In the meantime while we wait for some calls
7552000	7554000	maybe Loki has a last minute story or five.
7554000	7556000	Yeah, actually I do
7556000	7558000	and let's see
7558000	7560000	this was kind of cool. I saw this earlier today.
7560000	7562000	We talk a lot
7562000	7564000	about Kinect hacks and stuff like that
7564000	7566000	but this one's a little different.
7566000	7568000	It's a Kinect hack working on a PS3
7568000	7570000	and basically
7570000	7572000	it's somebody using the Kinect
7572000	7574000	to play Killzone 3
7574000	7576000	and it's
7576000	7578000	quite a workaround.
7578000	7580000	Apparently it allows
7580000	7582000	you also, I guess, to navigate the cross media bar
7582000	7584000	and
7584000	7586000	then
7586000	7588000	I'm assuming
7588000	7590000	if it's tied
7590000	7592000	in with some sort of
7592000	7594000	hack, you probably
7594000	7596000	have to have a custom firmware or something like that
7596000	7598000	in order to get it to work. In fact, yeah, it looks
7598000	7600000	like here
7600000	7602000	oh wow, there's lots of stuff here.
7602000	7604000	Hold that thought.
7604000	7606000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
7606000	7608000	This is DJ Blaziken.
7608000	7610000	DJ Blaziken.
7610000	7612000	What's on your mind, buddy?
7612000	7614000	Not much other than
7614000	7616000	I think it was last week or something
7616000	7618000	Parasite Eve came out for PlayStation Network
7618000	7620000	and I finally picked it up.
7620000	7622000	It did. I saw that on the list when I was going to get the
7622000	7624000	Mortal Kombat demo. I saw that scrolling by
7624000	7626000	and I was like, oh shit, yeah, I heard that that was
7626000	7628000	coming out. So, what'd you think?
7628000	7630000	I thought it was actually pretty
7630000	7632000	darn well. It works a little
7632000	7634000	bit awkward and really blocky
7634000	7636000	on my 20 inch
7636000	7638000	TV and 1080p, but
7638000	7640000	looks really good though on the
7640000	7642000	PSP Go.
7642000	7644000	And this is a little
7644000	7646000	thing for all the listeners who might have the
7646000	7648000	PSP Go that probably didn't know this
7648000	7650000	or ever figured it out.
7650000	7652000	You can actually sync your PlayStation
7652000	7654000	3 controller to it
7654000	7656000	via the Bluetooth
7656000	7658000	and makes it a little bit
7658000	7660000	easier to play
7660000	7662000	if
7662000	7664000	you're at a death or something
7664000	7666000	and you just don't like the
7666000	7668000	whole control scheme of that.
7668000	7670000	But, oh my god.
7670000	7672000	I mean
7672000	7674000	for years I just saw the trailer
7674000	7676000	and
7676000	7678000	that blew my mind.
7678000	7680000	It still blows my mind
7680000	7682000	now, looking at the visuals
7682000	7684000	even though now we're in the HD age
7684000	7686000	it still just goes
7686000	7688000	to show
7688000	7690000	Square
7690000	7692000	puts a lot of effort into just maxing
7692000	7694000	out the potential of whatever system
7694000	7696000	they're working on. Everything from
7696000	7698000	the original NES
7698000	7700000	now. I think we've seen it.
7700000	7702000	It's max.
7702000	7704000	The thing about Parasite Eve, they did make a second
7704000	7706000	game, but they never really made a third.
7706000	7708000	I do know there's third birthday, but
7708000	7710000	that was years later obviously.
7710000	7712000	Do you think
7712000	7714000	it's best that some games don't get
7714000	7716000	sequels? Or do you think that
7716000	7718000	really good games deserve sequels?
7718000	7720000	I think really good games
7720000	7722000	especially like this, I don't know how much
7722000	7724000	notoriety it got, but
7724000	7726000	it seems like a game
7726000	7728000	for a potential of sequels.
7728000	7730000	I remember it
7730000	7732000	being a pretty big deal back in the day because
7732000	7734000	it was one of the first Square games to come out after
7734000	7736000	Final Fantasy VII from what I remember.
7736000	7738000	Now granted my memory's a little fuzzy because
7738000	7740000	I'm really fucking old, but it's something like that.
7742000	7744000	Yeah, I saw one of those PlayStation
7744000	7746000	magazine demo discs
7746000	7748000	and, oh my
7748000	7750000	god, even though at the time
7750000	7752000	my mom wouldn't let me play rated M games back then
7752000	7754000	and two, I just didn't have
7754000	7756000	the cash to get it.
7756000	7758000	So, and now that
7758000	7760000	I am of age and
7760000	7762000	have the cash, I was just like,
7762000	7764000	heck, I'll get this.
7764000	7766000	That's right. I'm mature now.
7766000	7768000	I'm gonna play all the mature rated games I want.
7770000	7772000	And, you know what, it's
7772000	7774000	I don't know what, I
7774000	7776000	gotta praise Square because
7776000	7778000	we have probably the best
7778000	7780000	I mean, I may sound like a little bit
7780000	7782000	of a Square fanboy, but
7782000	7784000	who hasn't been
7784000	7786000	ever.
7786000	7788000	They always just seem to come out with
7788000	7790000	games with a really great story arc
7790000	7792000	that connects you with the characters
7792000	7794000	and makes you feel like
7794000	7796000	an emotional
7796000	7798000	attachment to them almost didn't.
7798000	7800000	It's just like,
7800000	7802000	whoa.
7802000	7804000	Going to our chat
7804000	7806000	I will admit,
7806000	7808000	if this has ever happened to any of you guys,
7808000	7810000	that a game ending ever made you cry,
7810000	7812000	it would've had to
7812000	7814000	been the first Kingdom Hearts
7814000	7816000	ending when
7816000	7818000	Kyrie and Source split apart
7818000	7820000	on two different lands. OMG spoilers.
7820000	7822000	I could never beat
7822000	7824000	Kingdom Hearts.
7824000	7826000	It was hard.
7826000	7828000	It was hard, but
7828000	7830000	worth the grind. Yeah, yeah, that's true.
7830000	7832000	If you reached the ending,
7832000	7834000	it was a pretty sad ending.
7834000	7836000	It just brought tears to my
7836000	7838000	eyes. I was like, no!
7838000	7840000	Go back!
7840000	7842000	It's okay, try to keep your emotions in check
7842000	7844000	on the show, buddy. Have you played
7844000	7846000	through Parasite Eve yet?
7846000	7848000	I've gotten up
7848000	7850000	to probably the first
7850000	7852000	boss battle so far,
7852000	7854000	and I'm just getting my ass
7854000	7856000	hated to be like
7856000	7858000	that, and so I'm trying to look at
7858000	7860000	walkthroughs and possible online
7860000	7862000	strategy guides to figure out
7862000	7864000	any ways to beat it.
7864000	7866000	The good news is with those older games,
7866000	7868000	there's a ton of them out there, so that's a good thing.
7868000	7870000	Yeah, which there's a lot more
7870000	7872000	help with it.
7872000	7874000	I'm just trying to figure out,
7874000	7876000	because I have the PS3 Slim right now,
7876000	7878000	basically,
7878000	7880000	would it be
7880000	7882000	worse...
7882000	7884000	I don't know if any of us remember
7884000	7886000	Blingcast for the Dreamcast.
7886000	7888000	I have them all.
7888000	7890000	Okay,
7890000	7892000	basically, what would you think,
7892000	7894000	because with the PlayStation Move controllers
7894000	7896000	being thrown in the way of Wii remotes,
7896000	7898000	if with the jailbroken
7898000	7900000	PS3, someone comes out with a Wii
7900000	7902000	emulator that does HD
7902000	7904000	support for the PS3
7904000	7906000	Wii games?
7906000	7908000	It would be difficult because
7908000	7910000	remember, emulators take a lot more horsepower
7910000	7912000	to run than the actual consoles
7912000	7914000	themselves, so even right
7914000	7916000	now running a Nintendo 64
7916000	7918000	emulator on a PS3, while
7918000	7920000	possible,
7920000	7922000	that's pretty much maxing out
7922000	7924000	the resources right now.
7924000	7926000	The PlayStation 3 has to emulate the fuckin' PS2
7926000	7928000	first, and I'm not talking about the
7928000	7930000	old school first generation consoles,
7930000	7932000	because they had the extra chip, which is why they were so
7932000	7934000	expensive, but I find it very
7934000	7936000	odd that we still have seen nothing about
7936000	7938000	PlayStation 2 emulation on PlayStation 3
7938000	7940000	outside of that very, very first
7940000	7942000	generation of consoles.
7970000	7972000	Maybe it wasn't a firmware patch
7972000	7974000	that we just never really figured
7974000	7976000	No, you would have
7976000	7978000	trumpets and fanfare and
7978000	7980000	confetti everywhere if that were to happen, and honestly,
7980000	7982000	I wouldn't expect it to be as easy
7982000	7984000	as putting your discs in. I think those sick
7984000	7986000	bastards will make you pay for the games
7986000	7988000	all over again. But I
7988000	7990000	can hope not. I sure hope not.
7990000	7992000	I might just get a PlayStation
7992000	7994000	2 again if that, if it doesn't
7994000	7996000	work. Just so
7996000	7998000	I can have BeatMania
7998000	8000000	with most of the Beemani
8000000	8002000	titles, really, because
8002000	8004000	I mean, I have the Rock Band keyboard, and it's
8004000	8006000	making me miss Keyboard Mania, because that was
8006000	8008000	at my arcade.
8008000	8010000	They traded
8010000	8012000	they got rid of it
8012000	8014000	I don't know why, that along with pop and music
8014000	8016000	they used to have that.
8016000	8018000	They had just got all the Beemani games here
8018000	8020000	at Family Fun Center, but
8020000	8022000	they traded them all in for random
8022000	8024000	stuff, and only
8024000	8026000	once we have wrapped the Link's
8026000	8028000	Para. Rest in peace
8028000	8030000	the arcades I remember. Alright, Blazekin
8030000	8032000	I gotta let you go so we can get our calls.
8032000	8034000	Arcade Infinity RIP
8034000	8036000	That was just sad watching the
8036000	8038000	video. Alright, we're gonna go Para40 right now.
8038000	8040000	Alright, Blazekin I gotta let you go to get
8040000	8042000	more calls. Have a good one buddy.
8042000	8044000	Alright, peace out. Bye.
8044000	8046000	Alright.
8046000	8048000	1877 GameOLR
8048000	8050000	username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8050000	8052000	Anything else low-key while we're waiting for
8052000	8054000	another call?
8054000	8056000	Um
8056000	8058000	I don't really have too
8058000	8060000	much. I was gonna talk, there was some
8060000	8062000	other developments with the
8062000	8064000	whole Playstation
8064000	8066000	hacking stuff
8066000	8068000	and the whole court case, everything. I believe
8068000	8070000	they, was it the
8070000	8072000	judge okayed Sony to get the
8072000	8074000	basically
8074000	8076000	people that have
8076000	8078000	donated money from California
8078000	8080000	into
8080000	8082000	the GeoHot thing. They've
8082000	8084000	gotten access to those records
8084000	8086000	and then um also
8086000	8088000	they're trying to find
8088000	8090000	a software development
8090000	8092000	kit manual
8092000	8094000	on his computer because
8094000	8096000	in the manual it has like
8096000	8098000	if you need help support and you're in the
8098000	8100000	US territories call this number because he's
8100000	8102000	basically saying that he was unaware that
8102000	8104000	Sony was in California or something like
8104000	8106000	that and they're trying to find a way to link it to him
8106000	8108000	that he knew that they're in California
8108000	8110000	to which I say, who the fuck
8110000	8112000	reads the manual for something like that
8112000	8114000	and I don't think it's
8114000	8116000	actually on his system. I think he used
8116000	8118000	open um
8118000	8120000	open source stuff to create
8120000	8122000	his hacks so
8122000	8124000	it may be a
8124000	8126000	stretch but it seems like they're really trying to
8126000	8128000	grab at straws here. Alright we got
8128000	8130000	another call coming in so let's go to it. Hi you're on
8130000	8132000	Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8132000	8134000	Hey how's it going? This is SSJ100 Matt. Hello
8134000	8136000	SSJ100 Matt. What's going on buddy?
8136000	8138000	Hello hello
8138000	8140000	Doing good. I just wanted to call
8140000	8142000	and get my late PAX East report.
8142000	8144000	You're late. PAX East was
8144000	8146000	so last week. Are you
8146000	8148000	calling in to talk about PAX East 2012?
8148000	8150000	The internet line looks like 100 years.
8150000	8152000	Alright no I'm kidding. What's up? Obviously
8152000	8154000	you're probably on the way home or something so we'll
8154000	8156000	give it a buy. Did you have a good time?
8156000	8158000	Yeah I definitely had a good time. You know what
8158000	8160000	I liked it a lot more than
8160000	8162000	last year's. Oh of course because
8162000	8164000	I wasn't there. Yeah well
8164000	8166000	Hey don't agree with that asshole.
8166000	8168000	I'm just kidding.
8168000	8170000	So what was better
8170000	8172000	about it than last year?
8172000	8174000	You know what? It was the bigger
8174000	8176000	conventions that really made a difference
8176000	8178000	and I think
8178000	8180000	a lot more people were able to work with
8180000	8182000	the larger space.
8182000	8184000	Tabletop gaming was
8184000	8186000	big.
8186000	8188000	I mean
8188000	8190000	the spacing of the
8190000	8192000	boots were good. People weren't hidden
8192000	8194000	behind other boots.
8194000	8196000	You know you're able to see everyone
8196000	8198000	so everyone got plenty
8198000	8200000	of traffic I think and
8200000	8202000	there were a lot more
8202000	8204000	there was a lot more
8204000	8206000	newer stuff there I guess.
8206000	8208000	They got to play on the 3DS. They got to play
8208000	8210000	Duke Nukem Forever
8210000	8212000	and
8212000	8214000	the one game that I really liked
8214000	8216000	Child of Eden
8216000	8218000	Oh yeah the
8218000	8220000	spiritual successor of sorts to Res
8220000	8222000	sure. Yeah and
8222000	8224000	you know what I think you guys
8224000	8226000	will certainly enjoy it. I'm actually considering
8226000	8228000	a Kinect because of that game.
8228000	8230000	How does it work? Is it really
8230000	8232000	like Res but you use your hands
8232000	8234000	to kind of highlight things? Is that kind of what the deal is?
8234000	8236000	It's pretty much that way
8236000	8238000	and you know what it's weird because
8238000	8240000	there's two different ways of shooting.
8240000	8242000	Use your left hand to shoot
8242000	8244000	to highlight over and then push forward
8244000	8246000	to shoot the missiles.
8246000	8248000	And then you can use your right hand
8248000	8250000	to shoot the gun regularly.
8250000	8252000	Interesting.
8252000	8254000	So you switch off
8254000	8256000	during the gameplay which is really interesting.
8256000	8258000	And it's really interesting that it's able to
8258000	8260000	capture that
8260000	8262000	with limited problems but
8262000	8264000	but you know the other thing I really liked
8264000	8266000	at PAX East was
8266000	8268000	the classic arcade run.
8270000	8272000	They had a lot more stuff
8272000	8274000	I'm sure you remember last year
8274000	8276000	it was kind of set up like Flynn's
8276000	8278000	arcade where you had Journey music playing
8278000	8280000	and
8280000	8282000	and
8282000	8284000	last year I remember
8284000	8286000	last year I remember it was just a room full of
8286000	8288000	consoles and you could kind of check out whatever game you wanted to
8288000	8290000	play and do it all that way
8290000	8292000	but they kind of took it, kicked it up a notch
8292000	8294000	this year with the bigger space.
8294000	8296000	Well yeah well I'll say that but I'm also
8296000	8298000	talking about the arcade room where they had
8298000	8300000	the arcade machines all set up.
8300000	8302000	Oh yeah, the one that was next door to the console room.
8302000	8304000	Yes, yes I remember.
8304000	8306000	Yeah.
8306000	8308000	You know they had a lot more
8308000	8310000	I think they doubled the amount of arcade games there.
8310000	8312000	Oh nice. And they also had a couple of
8312000	8314000	guys from
8314000	8316000	Twin Galaxies trying to beat high scores live.
8316000	8318000	Nice! Oh man
8318000	8320000	that was one of my favorite spots at PAX East.
8320000	8322000	Yeah.
8322000	8324000	So that was really interesting so
8324000	8326000	I had a lot of fun there
8326000	8328000	and you know it was kind of to the point because you know
8328000	8330000	not too many people went up there to play stuff.
8330000	8332000	Everyone was downstairs on the Xbox floor
8332000	8334000	so you know I was able to play
8334000	8336000	all the arcade games I wanted to.
8336000	8338000	Nice.
8338000	8340000	Very cool.
8340000	8342000	What do you hope that they bring next year to PAX?
8342000	8344000	What's an improvement they need to make for next
8344000	8346000	year's PAX?
8348000	8350000	I think you know
8350000	8352000	that
8352000	8354000	as much as it was a great
8354000	8356000	plan, the
8356000	8358000	panels themselves weren't, I didn't really
8358000	8360000	find to enjoy.
8360000	8362000	The thing was most of the panels
8362000	8364000	were about networking.
8364000	8366000	A lot of stuff you would kind of see at GDC.
8366000	8368000	I mean I'm not really
8368000	8370000	into getting into the business. I mean I'm just
8370000	8372000	you know a gamer. I don't play.
8372000	8374000	I don't make games.
8374000	8376000	But you know they had a lot of panels like that and you know
8376000	8378000	it's a great idea and I think they should keep that but you know
8378000	8380000	there was you know
8380000	8382000	very limited stuff that
8382000	8384000	about games
8384000	8386000	you know
8386000	8388000	gaming itself I guess. So maybe they need to
8388000	8390000	diversify the panel lineup a little bit more.
8390000	8392000	Or maybe have more rooms.
8392000	8394000	There was only one panel they went to
8394000	8396000	and that was the Xbox Live
8396000	8398000	enforcement.
8398000	8400000	Oh yeah I saw a clip of that one online. That looked kind of
8400000	8402000	interesting actually. Where they were showing
8402000	8404000	how they could ban
8404000	8406000	people. Like they basically just run through
8406000	8408000	giant columns of names and highlight
8408000	8410000	all the colors. It was interesting.
8410000	8412000	Yeah. Kind of neat.
8412000	8414000	Alright well I am hoping I
8414000	8416000	can go out to PAX East next year but
8416000	8418000	you know it's a plane ticket
8418000	8420000	so the cost of gas has to come down but we'll see.
8420000	8422000	It's in April
8422000	8424000	next year. During Passover in the west.
8424000	8426000	Oh no.
8426000	8428000	No no. Get this. It starts on
8428000	8430000	my birthday this year. Does it
8430000	8432000	really? Yep. Interesting.
8432000	8434000	Well no Passover. Well I was going to say
8434000	8436000	it would be funny if PAX East was around that same time
8436000	8438000	next year. No cake.
8438000	8440000	I'll eat cake on the day before.
8440000	8442000	Space it out a little more from like
8442000	8444000	You should come to PAX East.
8444000	8446000	You know what if I could afford it or if
8446000	8448000	a bunch of people wanted to get together and put
8448000	8450000	the money together and send me a plane
8450000	8452000	ticket. Although
8452000	8454000	Japan disaster relief is kind of
8454000	8456000	important right now. More important. I know.
8456000	8458000	But I'm saying if you got
8458000	8460000	ten people
8460000	8462000	to put twenty bucks together
8462000	8464000	that's half a plane ticket. Just saying.
8464000	8466000	That's just wasted twenty dollars. No I'm kidding.
8466000	8468000	Alright no but I
8468000	8470000	Hopefully things will get better
8470000	8472000	next year financially and economically
8472000	8474000	and we can evaluate that for next year.
8474000	8476000	I really want to go to PAX West
8476000	8478000	this year to be honest. I really want to go.
8478000	8480000	But I just don't know if I can. We'll see.
8480000	8482000	Alright. Well enough
8482000	8484000	coulda woulda shoulda wanna
8484000	8486000	hopefully talk. I'm gonna go ahead and let you go
8486000	8488000	when I'm out to get a few more calls but
8488000	8490000	thanks for the report. And Child of Eden I definitely
8490000	8492000	have my eye on that one. I want to play out when it comes out.
8492000	8494000	Absolutely. Alright. Take care
8494000	8496000	buddy. Take it easy guys. Alright later.
8496000	8499000	1877 Game OLR.
8499000	8501000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8501000	8503000	while we wait for some more calls.
8503000	8505000	Loki anything else?
8505000	8507000	Um
8509000	8511000	Not really. I don't know.
8511000	8513000	I don't remember if we talked
8513000	8515000	too much about Angry Birds and
8515000	8517000	how much they've sold.
8517000	8519000	Freaking tweet! Argh! Angry Birds.
8519000	8521000	That's my impression. I don't understand the
8521000	8523000	Angry Birds obsession. I don't either.
8523000	8525000	The game's alright.
8525000	8527000	It's okay but I mean it's
8527000	8529000	there's more fun games out there.
8529000	8531000	I think it's really the price point
8531000	8533000	that sold so many copies of that.
8533000	8535000	I don't understand the whole movie franchising thing.
8535000	8537000	I don't understand the
8537000	8539000	just the whole obsession with it.
8539000	8541000	People are dumb.
8541000	8543000	That's what I've really come to understand is
8543000	8545000	this whole new casual gaming
8545000	8547000	market out there. Your moms and
8547000	8549000	you know other
8549000	8551000	relatives or whatever they're playing these casual
8551000	8553000	games. Oh no they're hardcore now.
8553000	8555000	Oh I'm sorry. They're hardcore
8555000	8557000	according to Zynga. Zynga you're stupid.
8557000	8559000	They're not hardcore
8559000	8561000	and I'm sorry I think that they're kind of
8561000	8563000	they're not dumb
8563000	8565000	necessarily but their
8565000	8567000	expectations are a lot lower
8567000	8569000	compared to everybody else. I don't know.
8569000	8571000	Whatever.
8573000	8575000	Alright sorry I didn't mean to have
8575000	8577000	dead air there but I wanted to remind the folks in chat
8577000	8579000	because there's sometimes a bit of a delay.
8579000	8581000	Last call for Skype call is 1-877-GAMO-LR
8581000	8583000	or our username on Skype is orangeontradios
8583000	8585000	so folks in chat want us to go to DragonCon
8585000	8587000	in Atlanta. I totally
8587000	8589000	totally totally want to go to that.
8589000	8591000	See I don't know if there'd be enough for me
8591000	8593000	there. I mean I would go to hang with
8593000	8595000	people and that would really
8595000	8597000	be it for me. It was kind of like
8597000	8599000	when I went to that anime con in Chicago
8599000	8601000	the AsenCon that I did a little panel at.
8601000	8603000	I want to get an Asen too. I had a good
8603000	8605000	time hanging with people
8605000	8607000	but the con itself was
8607000	8609000	just kind of like woop over my head. We need to see about getting in for
8609000	8611000	Fanime. I mean we need to talk to our people.
8611000	8613000	Yeah. Alright we got another call coming
8613000	8615000	up so let's take it. Hi you're on Orangeontradios. Who's this?
8615000	8617000	Hi this is
8617000	8619000	Spazenator. Hey buddy how you doing Spazenator?
8619000	8621000	Pretty good you.
8621000	8623000	Two quick
8623000	8625000	items.
8625000	8627000	One question and one comment.
8627000	8629000	The comment first
8629000	8631000	sorry about the typos and all that
8631000	8633000	in my email. I'm just
8633000	8635000	giving a hard time. She just gives everybody shit
8635000	8637000	don't worry about it. I give people I like a hard time.
8637000	8639000	It's called love.
8639000	8641000	Yeah I know.
8641000	8643000	Now
8643000	8645000	as far as my question
8645000	8647000	now seeing that Microsoft
8647000	8649000	is basically doing away with the
8649000	8651000	Zune
8651000	8653000	now are they going to
8653000	8655000	ax the video marketplace
8655000	8657000	as well on Xbox Live
8657000	8659000	or is that going to stick around?
8659000	8661000	That was around before the Zune.
8661000	8663000	When did the Zune come out? The Zune came out about a year
8663000	8665000	after Xbox was out and I seem to recall that
8665000	8667000	video marketplace was going pretty early
8667000	8669000	so no I mean if they can still
8669000	8671000	sell movies on there they're going to do it.
8671000	8673000	Even though the Zune's
8673000	8675000	going away don't forget they still have the Windows
8675000	8677000	mobile phones and I think that's really kind of where they're
8677000	8679000	focusing. I mean think about it.
8679000	8681000	A lot of the marketplace
8681000	8683000	for the iOS
8683000	8685000	is centered around the iPhone.
8685000	8687000	I mean granted you have your
8687000	8689000	iPads and you have your iPod
8689000	8691000	touches still but I think the
8691000	8693000	iPhone claims a pretty fair share
8693000	8695000	of that market so I think
8695000	8697000	the Zune fading out is more
8697000	8699000	Microsoft kind of aligning itself.
8699000	8701000	Instead of doing a Zune phone
8701000	8703000	now they have this Windows 7 phone or whatever it is.
8703000	8705000	So no you're not
8705000	8707000	going to see the movie stuff go away.
8707000	8709000	God how could you? Especially with like
8709000	8711000	Netflix,
8711000	8713000	Hulu they've announced for the end of the year
8713000	8715000	and all this other stuff.
8715000	8717000	Yeah it's only going to be
8717000	8719000	more.
8719000	8721000	Yeah I was just
8721000	8723000	kind of curious because now that
8723000	8725000	I got a computer and I use
8725000	8727000	the Zune marketplace
8727000	8729000	on my computer I'm just going to use
8729000	8731000	a whole lot more now.
8731000	8733000	You'll probably see it get
8733000	8735000	rebranded as like you know
8735000	8737000	the Windows Mobile or
8737000	8739000	it'll get rebranded. They'll probably
8739000	8741000	walk away from that Zune name.
8741000	8743000	But it'll still be there.
8743000	8745000	Oh alright.
8745000	8747000	Thanks for taking my call.
8747000	8749000	Definitely appreciate it. No problem buddy.
8749000	8751000	Have a good one.
8751000	8753000	Later.
8753000	8755000	Wow that was a neat call. Hey I got a question
8755000	8757000	and he answered it and he's like okay bye.
8757000	8759000	I like that.
8759000	8761000	Alright so since that call was so fast we'll go ahead and do
8761000	8763000	one more call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8763000	8765000	Hi guys.
8765000	8767000	Can you guys hear me? We can. Who's this?
8767000	8769000	Hi it's DDR Dollar Bill.
8769000	8771000	Hey DDR Dollar Bill. How you doing?
8771000	8773000	Hey doing alright man.
8773000	8775000	Just figured I just want to make it quick
8775000	8777000	because I don't want to waste you know
8777000	8779000	take too long. Just want to give my
8779000	8781000	presence on PAX East. Hey you're late.
8781000	8783000	No that's alright. You were driving in the car
8783000	8785000	last week right? Yes I was.
8785000	8787000	Okay well you didn't get to talk because you were probably driving
8787000	8789000	so what did you think of PAX East?
8789000	8791000	I enjoyed
8791000	8793000	it heavily.
8793000	8795000	My favorite part was
8795000	8797000	not exactly was something that not many
8797000	8799000	people really understood.
8799000	8801000	It wasn't really the games. It wasn't really
8801000	8803000	the panels.
8803000	8805000	It was the actual fact that I
8805000	8807000	actually got to interview some of the developers.
8807000	8809000	Oh.
8809000	8811000	So just being close and getting
8811000	8813000	to interact with people that are usually
8813000	8815000	behind closed doors at trade shows.
8815000	8817000	Exactly.
8817000	8819000	Okay.
8819000	8821000	Who were some of the developers you got to talk to?
8821000	8823000	I got to talk with one guy from Microsoft
8823000	8825000	who was developing
8825000	8827000	the upcoming Firepaw Wrestling release
8827000	8829000	on Xbox Live Arcade.
8829000	8831000	I was
8831000	8833000	really interested because
8833000	8835000	Firepaw Wrestling, I don't know how many
8835000	8837000	people know this but it's like a really old
8837000	8839000	school wrestling game that
8839000	8841000	was hailed heavily because you know.
8841000	8843000	I've actually got a couple of the
8843000	8845000	Firepaw Wrestling games.
8845000	8847000	What's that? I've never heard of it.
8847000	8849000	We've got the Dreamcast one that had the Virtua Fighter characters
8849000	8851000	in it.
8851000	8853000	Oh. You mean the All Japan
8853000	8855000	featuring Virtua.
8855000	8857000	They had a wolf in it. Yeah.
8857000	8859000	Yeah and the Giant Gram series.
8859000	8861000	Yeah but I think we've got one of the
8861000	8863000	Firepaw.
8863000	8865000	I think the Dreamcast
8865000	8867000	yeah D it's called.
8867000	8869000	Yeah.
8869000	8871000	This one actually uses your avatars
8871000	8873000	as wrestlers.
8873000	8875000	Oh that's pretty sweet.
8875000	8877000	Oh yeah and from what I was told
8877000	8879000	you actually have to develop
8879000	8881000	the moves from the beginning.
8881000	8883000	So you start off at level 1
8883000	8885000	and you basically keep fighting and the more levels you get
8885000	8887000	the more moves you get.
8887000	8889000	And the moves
8889000	8891000	from what I've seen so far they seem kind of
8891000	8893000	more arcade-ish
8893000	8895000	not so much like the current
8895000	8897000	wrestling games like SmackDown vs. Ball
8897000	8899000	and all that.
8899000	8901000	But I think if
8901000	8903000	it works well I think it would actually be a nice hit.
8903000	8905000	Especially since it's used to your avatars
8905000	8907000	and whatnot.
8907000	8909000	So you liked
8909000	8911000	getting close to the developers and it's funny
8911000	8913000	because on a previous call SJ100Matt was talking
8913000	8915000	about the panels were a little
8915000	8917000	much on the side of how to get into the
8917000	8919000	business. Did you find
8919000	8921000	that same thing to be true or did you kind of like
8921000	8923000	that?
8923000	8925000	I found that
8925000	8927000	to be the same thing and to be quite honest
8927000	8929000	I actually liked it because
8929000	8931000	it actually showed me
8931000	8933000	a side of gaming I've never really
8933000	8935000	explored. Like the developing
8935000	8937000	side. You just discovered
8937000	8939000	a whole new side of yourself you never knew was
8939000	8941000	there before.
8941000	8943000	Oh yeah
8943000	8945000	considering how much video I was doing, yeah.
8945000	8947000	Nice.
8947000	8949000	You know I remember when I went to PAX the first year
8949000	8951000	PAX Prime one of the games they were showing was Warhammer
8951000	8953000	and it was pretty cool. The Warhammer Online
8953000	8955000	one, the WoW killer that
8955000	8957000	didn't really end up killing WoW. But it was
8957000	8959000	cool to be able to kind of like as one of the guys
8959000	8961000	I was playing the game and he just came up and was talking to me about it
8961000	8963000	it was really cool. Like I
8963000	8965000	like that when folks will just kind of walk up
8965000	8967000	and talk to you about the product. You know E3 is a lot
8967000	8969000	of that too. Unfortunately
8969000	8971000	a lot of the big boosts will kind of
8971000	8973000	turn their nose up at you but the
8973000	8975000	littler companies, man they
8975000	8977000	they'll practically drag you into their
8977000	8979000	boosts to talk about whatever it is they're putting out so
8979000	8981000	I always kind of like that, getting to talk to folks
8981000	8983000	just about what they really love
8983000	8985000	doing. A lot of people
8985000	8987000	a lot of people that are really into the game
8987000	8989000	industry really love what they're doing. It's pretty cool.
8989000	8991000	I had two more interviews like that
8991000	8993000	I had one with the one developer
8993000	8995000	from Lord of the Rings
8995000	8997000	the MMORPG
8997000	8999000	Yeah which
8999000	9001000	I'm actually going to probably take a shot at it
9001000	9003000	one day since it's free
9003000	9005000	and another one which
9005000	9007000	I actually might pay for because
9007000	9009000	it was really interesting was like
9009000	9011000	I'm going to get the name wrong
9011000	9013000	but it's called iRacing
9013000	9015000	it was like a racing simulator type
9015000	9017000	kind of like Gran Turismo for the PC
9017000	9019000	and you
9019000	9021000	had pretty much you had to play against
9021000	9023000	real players not computer
9023000	9025000	AI
9025000	9027000	and I was actually sitting down
9027000	9029000	with the driving wheel with the voice feedback
9029000	9031000	and everything
9031000	9033000	after about maybe 10 minutes of driving
9033000	9035000	and I had to stop because I wanted
9035000	9037000	to do other things
9037000	9039000	I actually felt my body going
9039000	9041000	forward like the whole inertia
9041000	9043000	Oh wow
9043000	9045000	Yeah I was like wow
9045000	9047000	I was like
9047000	9049000	slowly walking away like
9051000	9053000	That sounds like my first time with a 3DS
9053000	9055000	but
9055000	9057000	I had to turn that 3DS off I couldn't see
9057000	9059000	I was
9059000	9061000	half blind when I tried it
9061000	9063000	it was just too much headache
9063000	9065000	It was interesting to hear different people's reactions
9065000	9067000	I'm so curious to see what's going to happen when that thing comes out
9067000	9069000	for the public
9069000	9071000	I know like Best Buy already has a demo unit out
9071000	9073000	Oh yeah I heard a lot of places are getting
9073000	9075000	the demo units so they're pretty easy to
9075000	9077000	get your hands on now I mean they're out Sunday
9077000	9079000	this is not something that's coming out like 6 months from now
9079000	9081000	it's out like soon so
9081000	9083000	Yeah I'll probably pick it up later
9083000	9085000	but one last thing though about 3D
9085000	9087000	real quick
9087000	9089000	I also saw the Nvidia 3D cards
9089000	9091000	and
9091000	9093000	for some reason 3DS
9093000	9095000	and most 3D TVs
9095000	9097000	I can't really use the 3D because it makes me dizzy
9097000	9099000	Right
9099000	9101000	But when I was trying out Warcraft
9101000	9103000	in 3D
9103000	9105000	on 3 screens
9105000	9107000	no problems
9107000	9109000	whatsoever
9109000	9111000	I can only imagine what that must be like
9111000	9113000	that must be insane that's too much wow
9113000	9115000	did I really say that?
9115000	9117000	that's too much wow
9117000	9119000	Oh Rob that's not such a thing
9119000	9121000	I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth
9121000	9123000	that's why I said it
9123000	9125000	that I've hosted this show with for 9 years
9125000	9127000	that's why I said it Rob
9127000	9129000	it's crazy it's called irony
9129000	9131000	it's crazy
9131000	9133000	I just like the 3D it's like wow I can actually see it
9133000	9135000	the first sign of the end of the world coming
9135000	9137000	in 2012 was when Dark Sakura
9137000	9139000	admitted to liking Warcraft that was like the first
9139000	9141000	sign alright anyhow
9141000	9143000	DDR.com I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show
9143000	9145000	but thanks so much for your call buddy
9145000	9147000	and glad to hear you had fun at PAX East
9147000	9149000	see you next year later I hope
9149000	9151000	I hope
9151000	9153000	I really would like to do PAX West this year
9153000	9155000	I'm hoping I can save the money fast enough cause Seattle's not that far
9155000	9157000	that's the good news I could drive
9157000	9159000	to Seattle I mean
9159000	9161000	it would be a pain in the ass but I could do it
9161000	9163000	Dark Sakura's pretty much driven to Seattle
9163000	9165000	I mean granted the town she
9165000	9167000	goes to is in a different corner of Washington
9167000	9169000	but it's about the same length when all
9169000	9171000	said and done right? well it's
9171000	9173000	it was like a 17 hour drive to get to Prosser
9173000	9175000	so I would imagine tack
9175000	9177000	on another 4 to that to get to Seattle?
9177000	9179000	no because you can get to Portland in
9179000	9181000	10 and Seattle's another
9181000	9183000	3 to 4 from Portland but that's
9183000	9185000	just a straight shot up 5 so
9185000	9187000	to get to where you're going you have to go through more
9187000	9189000	we went I think in the 93 yeah
9189000	9191000	you gotta go through weird no Seattle's
9191000	9193000	just a straight shot up 5
9193000	9195000	but see my ride's
9195000	9197000	quite a bit longer and we actually
9197000	9199000	didn't go through that part of Oregon we
9199000	9201000	stopped in like Bend you know what
9201000	9203000	Dark Sakura we should rent I already
9203000	9205000	know Loki's not going to come because the baby you
9205000	9207000	and I should rent a van
9207000	9209000	we're doing it go up to Pat

9215000	9217000	develop in the future let me just do one
9217000	9219000	more check with Loki on any last minute stories
