00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 20th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Some big games get delayed

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
The NES classic River City Ransom will soon have a sequel

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And could a Silent Hill game be on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
And we are here live with episode number 406

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
On this March the 20th of 2011

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
When my awesome co-hosts say hello to the one and only

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I beat your butt at Pinball Effects

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
It's Pinball Effects on what? PS3?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Xbox

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
You were literally showing me this while the opening was going

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
So I didn't have time to process this

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Because I just found the picture

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, I'm putting it up on our thing

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh gee, thank you

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
No, it's the icons, because I think it's cute

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Your icon's like, sad face

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Mine's like, one!

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh wait, it's not Xbox 360, the FX2 or whatever, the new one?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
Well we don't have FX2, we just have FX

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
But it's got samples of the FX tables

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But we'll get into that in my gaming week

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I was going to say, at some point, I don't want to spoil the gaming week

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But you should get the FX2, because the shell is free

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
No, I totally want, I totally want

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh yeah, go for it

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
As he does every week, to the one and only tech master, Loki!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Hi

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
How are you, Loki?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Good

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Awesome

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And Loki's brought some new toys to the show tonight

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
That he's been showing off

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Yes

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
You want to tell our listeners about what you've brought to the studio?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
I brought a 3DS from Japan

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I'm not privy enough to get one of the US ones early

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I am going to be getting one on time, though

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Nice

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
With Street Fighter, because that's the bundle I picked

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
And then, Motor Store Apocalypse

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I got review code for that because

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Because Sony loves me so much

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Or because I bought it off eBay

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Nice

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Photographic evidence now on orangerealgeradio.com

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Yes, I noticed you've been taking pictures over and over there

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And you've been uploading them to orangerealgeradio.com

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I actually took a picture on the 3DS of myself

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
So I can see myself in 3D

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Because looking in the mirror obviously isn't good enough

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
I wanted to see what I would look like on a 3DS in the picture

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
But unfortunately I can't upload that

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
You can

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, can you?

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
But it's a format that only 3D devices can read

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's like an ITG

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It's some sort of weird format

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
But it's for 3D devices

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So it wouldn't do me any good to upload it to orangerealgeradio.com

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Because no one would see it

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
You wouldn't be able to see it unless you have

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Like a 3DS

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Or maybe some of those special cameras

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Or the phones or whatever that can view 3D stuff

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Or maybe a 3D TV

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I don't know if you can view pictures on a 3D TV

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I would not want to blow up that picture to the size of a 50 inch television

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
No, look at my crap

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I noticed the resolution on the cameras

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They're VJ cameras

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It's really just a gimmicky thing right now

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
But like 10 year olds will have a field day with it

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm having a field day with it

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Are you really?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I have to admit I was nosy

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
The first thing I did before I took a picture of myself

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Is I looked at everything you were taking pictures of

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And it's this cat

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Oh it's the cat

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh look more pictures of the cat

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Here's a picture of his desk at work

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh and here's the cat again

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Well she was there at the time

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
That's why I took a picture of her

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
She's so exploited

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It works really well with stuff that has a lot of depth in it

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Because if you just take a picture of

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I took a picture of triple baked pizza

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Thankfully my nose is gigantic

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So there's a lot of depth there

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You can actually almost

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
The photo that I took of the game while I was playing it

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You can actually almost see the 3D in it

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
It's actually kind of neat

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Almost

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
You can actually see the layers in the image

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Is what you can see

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Eventually it'll be kind of cool

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Because maybe you can download the pictures

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Through the web browser

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
When it comes out in May

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
That's awesome

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Um

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Yeah it's been pretty fun to play with

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I've got Nintendogs

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
But I haven't played Nintendogs

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's mainly just the show off

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Because no one really cares about 3D

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Although Ridge Racer does look pretty cool in 3D

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
So I could have just stuck with that game

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
But I wanted more than one game

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I picked Nintendogs

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Because whatever

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
May would help justify to the wife

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
The cost of everything

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
It's like oh I'll get you Nintendogs

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
She wouldn't, no

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
She doesn't care

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
She thought Nintendogs was dumb to begin with

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I thought Nintendogs was dumb

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But I had to see what it looked like in 3D

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
And it looks pretty cool, very fuzzy

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
They are very fuzzy

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And my whole row, they're just treating them like they're real dogs

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh the puppies are here

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's our official puppies

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Okay

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I would play Nintendogs

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Maybe that one won't make me feel completely

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Violently ill to my stomach

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I used to play it for like 15 minutes

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I used to play it for 15 minutes

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
During my break at work

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And then I would forget about my puppies

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And they would run away

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Are you gonna get one at launch?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I might have to wait a little bit

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah it's probably fine

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
There's only one game

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Other than

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Street Fighter

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
That I'm getting with the US one

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And Street Fighter is kind of like eh

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It was either, well the three options I had were

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Street Fighter, Samurai Warriors

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Which eh, don't care about Samurai Warriors

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And uh

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm trying to think of the other one

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't remember

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Madden or something like that

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I don't want Madden

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
So I picked Street Fighter

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
And then I'll probably pick up Pilotwings

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Because I want to play Pilotwings

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah I would play Pilotwings

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
That looks fun, otherwise I'll probably wait for the Kid at Gris game

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
But, yeah Kid at Gris looks awesome

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But Pilotwings, I'm very disappointed

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
There's only three types of

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Things

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Well the Super Nintendo one was maybe four

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I guess, wow that's kind of sad

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh yeah because they keep forgetting

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Every fifth stage was like

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
This random shoot em up that you would have

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
So it was actually like a fifth

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Well they have that kind of stuff in there

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Hang gliding, jet pack

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Sky diving

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
There's another one

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
By plane

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
And then the shoot em up stages

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But I mean come on

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
If you can pull off four on a Super Nintendo

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I think you can maybe pull off

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
More than that, I mean come on

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Let's be honest here

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
The geometry for the levels and stuff like that

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
You're using WooHoo Island or whatever

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
From Wii Sports Resort

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
You have the island, the 3D object created

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I keep forgetting that WooHoo Island is like a character now

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Oh it's dumb

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
It's a character

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It's a character no one cares about

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
It's an island, big deal

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You know someone can make an island

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Especially with the level of graphics

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
That they're putting in there, I mean come on

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
This is the type of stuff that you would have seen in

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Prop Cycle, hell Prop Cycle had

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
More detail to it than this stuff

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But it's just

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
That, I mean, right there

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Oh you don't have to create the island

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Which is kind of a major part of Pilotwings

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So you have to model the planes

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And weather vehicles and stuff

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And then you have to place your markers around

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Stuff like that and code the rest of the game

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
It didn't seem to me that that would have been

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
A lot of work

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You know what I mean?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Sorry I'm just checking out some gameplay video of Pilotwings

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
And remembering how freaking awesome this game was on Super Nintendo

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
When it first came out, like seriously

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And now that I look at it I'm like

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Gosh, the basics for this

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I mean it's really just a very

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Simple graphic of the island

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
With the mode 7 trick

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But it just

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I remember this game was the shit when it came out

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah and you know what

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I bet you anything that they're going to re-release this

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
On the virtual console for that

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And I will bet you anything they will code

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
A new emulator for it that everything that has

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Goddamn mode 7 is going to be in 3D

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
And all the parallax

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Stuff that was in there, you know, different layers

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Sprite layers and stuff like that

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Will be offset in certain distances

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That's what's going to happen

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Well they said it was going to be as simple as anything that had a Z-axis

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Would be, you know, able to be

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Made in 3D

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Kind of neat

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
In the chat room, the ever present fourth guest

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
On our show chat.orangeloungeradio.com

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Big thanks to those of you guys

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
That like to show up every week and I love this

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Chat, these comments here

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
BlackWolf, our old pal that does the show before us here at All Games Radio

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
The Bobby BlackWolf show

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
He starts at 5 o'clock Pacific when we start at 6

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And yes, I'm leaving the pilot wings

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Gameplay going because I'm just, I'm being nostalgic

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
BlackWolf says, fact, Dead Island

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Also takes place on Wuhu Island

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
If only

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And GameGuru says

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Wuhu Island as a fighter for

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Super Smash Brothers 4

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
There you go

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Anyhow

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
It'll be a stage

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Alright, so what else did you bring to the show with you?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
You brought a Playstation 3, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
I brought a MotorStorm

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Apocalypse

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And it's all sorts of awesome

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's basically

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You're racing through the city that's

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Been destroyed by an earthquake

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Among other natural disasters

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And so now you're

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Basically racing through that

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
And then at the same time they've got

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
A little bit of a storyline going on where there's this

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Corporation that basically

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Wants you and these crazy

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Homeless people out of the city and the crazy

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Homeless people are throwing molotovs at you during the

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Races

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
So while you're racing in some of the later

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Stages after they've established this

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
They're shooting at you with guns

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So you have to dodge guns

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
You have to dodge molotovs

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You have to dodge falling everything

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Like there's just

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
All sorts of crazy stuff

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
All of a sudden there's a track where I was racing on a bridge

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And this air raid

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Siren goes off and all of a sudden

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The bridge starts shaking and starts collapsing

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Right as I'm racing through it

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And that was all sorts of

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Cool and then

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
There's another stage where I was racing on a motorcycle

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Then all of a sudden this building just collapses

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Right next to me

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It was awesome

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It was an incredibly good time

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Seriously, probably my favorite one out of the series

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So why did you bring the PS3 with you?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You want to show it off a little later during the show or something?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Because I'm gonna play it

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Instead of paying attention to the show

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh I'm paying attention to the show, I'm multitasking

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
When the calls start coming in

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
It's just like, I'll let Rob talk to the callers

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And I'll sit here and play Motorstar

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I can't help it if they're not interesting

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well didn't you think, I thought some of those comments

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Was very interesting before we had a Dead Island

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Taking place on Wuhu Island

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
As a fighter for Super Smash Bros. 4

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And I was kind of thinking like

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You know, there could be a trailer that's out there

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And it's like

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Pilot wings meets zombies

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
On Wuhu Island

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
And it's very awesome

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Just like that trailer

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Which by the way I hated that trailer

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I just want to throw that out there

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I don't think I ever talked about it on the show but I hated that trailer

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I really hated that Dead Island trailer

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I thought it was artsy and everything

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
But like, I just

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I really didn't like it

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I guess I can get into the reasons why later

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Remind me later, I'll talk about it

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But for now we always like to start off our show

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
With how was your gaming week

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
It was eventful, I just played

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Some Ridge Racer on the

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
3DS

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And my eyes hurt

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I played

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Pinball FX, which I talked about earlier

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And uh

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I played a lot of Pinball FX

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Actually, just sitting there all night and I updated

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
My avatar

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And I played that

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Game with the big

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Stupid dragon

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
You know, where you click the button and they run

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And you press, you know, the buttons

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And they do stuff

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And the chicks have horns, that type of thing

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
World of Warcraft

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh okay, I was like, what?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And I like the discussion that we all

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Got into yesterday

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
About what the Dark Stalkers characters would be

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
If they were characters in World of Warcraft

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So we were trying to

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Figure out if you wanted to make like

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Victor, would he be a drawn eye

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Or whatever, so it was kind of funny

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
That's it, I'm gonna go get some dinner now

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Awesome, enjoy the noms

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Uh, well, Loki

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I know we've heard a little bit about 3DS

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And MotorStorm, but anything else in your gaming week you wanna talk about?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Um, yeah, sure

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Um, other than

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
MotorStorm and

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, let's see, MotorStorm

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
You know, I already talked about how awesome it was

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Uh, the 3DS played

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Ridge Racer, and that's Ridge Racer

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I mean, it's, they didn't really change anything

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Too much

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Um, played some of the

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Um, games that are

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Kind of packed in with the 3DS, like the

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Um, what is that

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Face Invaders game, which is kind of funny

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I took, I took basically

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
What was the equivalent of the

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Drunken Mario Kart picture

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
With, uh, the camera

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So that was fun, I was shooting my face

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And then, um, I actually tried some of the

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Cards, and you can, there's one

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Where you're shooting targets with a

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Arrow, so that was kind of cool

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And then, um, other stuff

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I actually downloaded, um

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
On the IOS re-rave

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
So I was playing a little bit of that

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And that's pretty cool, I dug it

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I was pissed off for a while though, and I still

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Kind of am a little bit pissed off about it

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Pretty high scores, I'm like, why aren't they

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Appearing on the high score table

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Didn't realize I had to register for, like, a login

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Or something like that for their thing

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So after I did that, it reset all my high scores

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Thanks

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Wah, wah, wah, that's what you get for not

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Signing up for the first place

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, they didn't make it, they didn't say, in order to have

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Your scores posted to the site, you need to register

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It just says log in and register

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
How else is it going to know who you are?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Well, I thought I would just take my name

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I'm sorry, did I throw logic into this equation?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Yeah, exactly

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm sorry, Loki, I'll never do that again

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So I played that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
I dug some of the songs in there, of course

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
A lot of Kyle Worden music in there

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So if you're a fan of In the Groove, you'll probably

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Dig that

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
What else did I play?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Grand Theft Auto

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Pretty much

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah, that was pretty much it

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
And there were some random IOS games

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I played

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Just going through some of my games

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I downloaded to see, well, hey

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I haven't played this yet, let me try this out

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And see if it's any good or not

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
A lot of them weren't, so I just ended up deleting them

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
There was one I played

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I think it was called Hyper Missile or something like that

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
That was pretty cool

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Yeah, but mainly

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Mainly Motorstorm, I've been playing a lot of that

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Actually

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I'm really hyped about that game

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Awesome

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Alright

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Anything else or is that it?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
That's it

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Mostly a lot of the same stuff I've played in the past

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
So not a whole lot of new stuff

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
The usual wow

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Torchlight a little bit on XBLA

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Even though playing Torchlight

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
On Xbox Live makes me want to go back

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
And play it on the PC more

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
You can go chew on that one for a little bit

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And some of the other stuff

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But I did check out a few new things

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
One of them that Loki already mentioned

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Because obviously as a music game fan

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
There's definitely the roots there

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's kind of a mix between

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Elite Beat Agents meets

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
DJ Max Technica meets

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
In the Groove

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And I wasn't sure if I was going to dig it at first

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Because

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Obviously this show has been on a long time

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And way back in the day

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
We used to be exclusively about music games

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
And we would talk for three hours about

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
The DDR scene and a lot of what was going on

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And at the time

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
One of the things that was going on in the DDR scene

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Was the game In the Groove that came out

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
And it's no secret

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I was never really a huge fan of the In the Groove games

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It's funny because

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
In retrospect

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I think I appreciate what they were trying

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
To do a lot more now

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Than what I did then

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Because especially coming so far

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Now and seeing everything that's happened

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Where I don't think Konami ever truly had faith

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
In that series

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I can appreciate what they were trying to do

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
In retrospect, but just at the time

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
It really felt cheap to me

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
And I was really longing for more

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
DDR. Anyway, sorry for the

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Tangent, but just to give you the mindset

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I was coming in here. I was coming in here thinking

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know if I'm going to really dig this because I was not

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Really ever a big fan of In the Groove

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But I gotta say, I enjoyed

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
ReRave. It's cool

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It's $2 to download

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Not a whole lot of songs come

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
With it for free

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I right away downloaded a song pack

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
That was free

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
So I couldn't tell you exactly how many songs you get initially

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
It must only be like 2 or 3

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
It was 3

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
There was a song pack of about another 4 or 5 songs you get for free

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And then of course

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
It wants to charge you more money

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
To get extra song packs

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Song pack 1, song pack 2

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
With a bunch of songs that are very similar

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
To what you hear in the default packs

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Not a lot of name recognition in those packs

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You're not exactly going to get Lady Gaga

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Rihanna type of stuff

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
There's one of them, I actually bought all the packs

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Did you?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I wanted some actual songs to play

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And I was in a let me buy some stuff mood

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
But I played

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Some songs, once again I don't recognize the artist

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
But there's one of those songs from

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
One of the Geico commercials was in there

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Oh geez, really?

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I wouldn't recognize the artist, but that makes sense

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So I mean, ok, whatever, cool

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
And a lot of the music games on

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm sorry, Xbox Live

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
IOS are set up the same way

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And DDR itself

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Being one of them, there's a DDR-S game

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
That comes with no songs and everything you have to buy

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And song packs, so

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
This is nothing new, the model

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
But as far as the 7 songs that come with it or so

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I've been playing most of them, and I enjoy the songs

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
They're pretty good, and the gameplay is

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Pretty slick, actually

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I like the whole turning power

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Power dials or whatever

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And you hit them right at the top

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And very similar to Elite Beat Angels or Technica

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
You tap things on the screen

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
In time with the song

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Right when the power, imagine like a power

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Symbol on your computer that slowly turns

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
From a 6 o'clock position to a 12 o'clock position

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
And you're supposed to tap it

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Right when it's at the 12 o'clock position

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
But some of them are hold

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Some of them have multi-taps

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Some of them you drag around the screen

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
You know, different little tricks that kind of go with it

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And yeah, I enjoyed it

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
It was really fun on the harder songs

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
And the harder levels

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Even with Game Center

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
And their own little system

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
As Loki was talking about earlier

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
For saving scores

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
So it's pretty slick what they've done

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's kind of what I walked away from the game with

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Is that this is a pretty slick IOS game

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So yeah, if you're a fan of music games

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You definitely want to check this out

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
I mean, it's 2 bucks

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
It's not a bad deal

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's unfortunate there's no demo or anything

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So that people can see what it is first

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
But there's videos online

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
So yeah, re-rave on the IOS

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
The other game I checked out this week

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
This is a demo

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't like to review games based off the demo

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But this is one very high-profile game

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I've had a lot of anticipation going for

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And that's Mortal Kombat

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
The demo's now out on PlayStation Network for everybody

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You don't have to just be a plus subscriber

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Regular or a plus can now get the demo on PS3

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
So I spent a little time with that

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Just to see if it was going to be as awesome as I was hoping

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I don't want to say I didn't like it

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Because I did

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
But I felt it was lacking

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And granted, it was a demo

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's supposed to be lacking

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It was only bare bones

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
But when you get that mode

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
That's you know

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Fighter versus fighter

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
That's still kind of the core part of the game

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And I don't know, it just wasn't as

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Action-packed as I was hoping

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And as fast-paced as I remember the Mortal Kombat games being

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
However, I am saying that

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Very open-mindedly

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Because I realize again, it's a demo

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I was playing it single-player

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And I think Mortal Kombat really

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Best shines in multiplayer modes

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
So I'm totally not being fair

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
When I'm saying that right now

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But that was my honest-to-god reaction as I walked away from it

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Going, gosh

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I was hoping I'd have more fun with that

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
But the fatalities did make me laugh a lot

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Like a little girl

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And the trailer that showed the upcoming ones

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Like there's one where you push some guy's face into a subway train

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And it hits all the windows as the subway goes by

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
And that made me laugh

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Because Mortal Kombat is kind of dopey

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Because you like people getting their faces ripped off by a subway train

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
It was funny because Alan called me out on it

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
And he's like, I don't get it

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You hate the Saw movies

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
But you giggle at this stuff

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, but there's different

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
There's a very clear difference

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
There's a difference with like, okay you must torture yourself

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
For my amusement

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And there's a difference between like

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Ha ha, your face is gonna get ripped off

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Ha ha

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
The Saw movies are trying to be real

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And teach these moral lessons

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Through these really sick things

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
That I don't like

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
But Mortal Kombat is basically one step above a cartoon

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's about the nether realm

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It's not real

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Do you want to play a game?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
You forgot to feed your cat

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Now I'm gonna feed you to a tiger

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Those are the Saw movies to me

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Exactly

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Those are the Saw movies to me

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
She was fine, I fed her later on

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Why do I have to get eaten by a tiger?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
That doesn't seem fair at all

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
I will say what I did like

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I'm not trying to

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Gosh, I'm gonna bring on the hate mail

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I did like about Mortal Kombat

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That I was able to pick it right up

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
And it just felt like playing Mortal Kombat 2

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
In like Street Fighter 4 style graphics

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
And that part was pretty awesome

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Like being able to select Mileena

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And just remember that Tord Tord

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Low kick was the little drop

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Cool things like that, really easy to get back into

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
So that same sort of learning curve

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Where you were able to kind of slip right into

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Street Fighter 4

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
From Street Fighter 2

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I think a lot of people are gonna find with this new Mortal Kombat

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
So I probably will still pick up the full version of the game

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Even though I walked away from the demo going

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I just

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I don't know, there's something

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But I think online play

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And multiplayer play

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
And a lot of the other modes when the game's fleshed out

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Will make up for that

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
But I have to be honest

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I'm not gonna lie just for the sake of hype

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Anyway, so check out the demo

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
See if you had the same reaction

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I talked to a friend of mine who felt the same way I did

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Very excited about the game after playing the demo

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Went, I don't know

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Wasn't what I remember

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
But anyway

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
There you go, those are the games I played this week

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
So chat.orangelandsrated.com

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
If you want to join us in our chat room

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Tigerclaw in our chat room says

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Sky, the fatality that looks the most funny

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Is the one showing Liu Kang getting hit by a taxi

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Oh yeah, that was

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That was pretty funny too

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And I like the x-ray attack stuff

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I mean that stuff was funny

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I hope there's more of them in the regular game

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Like not just one x-ray attack for every character

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Because I think some of those might get old quick

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
But I cracked up at some of them

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
They were pretty funny

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
There you go

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
A lot of the same old moves coming back

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Johnny Cage can punch people in the balls still

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
So in fact he likes to do it over and over again

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
I think he has an issue

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Anyway, let's move on

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
Some housekeeping for tonight

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Our Twitter, you can join us on Twitter

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Twitter.com.olr, all the updates for what's going on with the show

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Also our Facebook

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
At facebook.com.orangeloungeradio

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Otherwise we have no planned shows off

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Or trips were taken or anything

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So every Sunday night in the near future

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
At All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Is where you can hear us live

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So, yes ma'am

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I have an arcade report

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Disneyland

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Oh yeah, that's right, you were gone last week because you were at Disneyland

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Yes

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Did you have fun?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
I had a great time

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Did you do the Toy Story Midway Mania?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
We totally did

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
It's like a giant video game, I love it

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Dan totally kicked my ass, but I kicked his butt at AstroBusters

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
The Starcade

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Is actually now also

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
The home of Star Trader

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Because they've closed down the Star Trader

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And Star Tours for the revamp

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I saw when they had shut down

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Star Tours

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
But the Star Trader is also being redone

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Right, well to get all the new merchandise I'm sure

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So, well that and they sort of

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Would have to go through there to take care of the hallway

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
If they need to redo the hallway

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
So, um

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It's now kind of half the arcade

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
It used to be, literally

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Interesting

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That's my arcade report

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
You didn't play anything there

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
It's expensive

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
What? Oh, I know

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Because Electronica doesn't go under the week

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
And they had said that it was gonna during spring break

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And then they didn't

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Is Captain EO back already?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Yes, it's the original 77mm film

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
With grain and everything

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It's showing it's age

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
The cheeseball 3D

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That was not great

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Here's the summary of Captain EO

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Is that

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Michael Jackson flies through space with a bunch of Muppets

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Lands on the Borg homeworld

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
And turns all the Borg

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Into extras from Xanadu

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Ruled by Angelica Houston

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The end

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
And it's awesome

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
But am I not right?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
No, that's a pretty good way of summarizing it

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
The end

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I'm gonna be sad when they get rid of that finally

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Because you know it's not

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
There's gonna come a time when they're finally gonna have to get rid of Captain EO again

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
For a new movie

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
It better not be Honey I Shrunk the Audience again

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Because that movie was terrible

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Let's actually get into some other video game news

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
No Captain EO game to talk about this week

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
But maybe some other video games

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
So we'll start off with Loki tonight

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
There's been a few games delayed from Japan

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
Not necessarily because of the whole tsunami earthquake thing

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
But you could probably attribute some of that to it

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Starting off

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Warriors Legends of Troy

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
On Xbox 360 and PS3

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And Dead or Alive Dimensions

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Both coming from Tecmo Koe

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Those have been delayed

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And won't make their scheduled release dates

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Of March 24th and March 31st

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Honestly not a big surprise

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Has been delayed a few times already

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
For the US

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And Warriors Legends of Troy

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Not even coming out on the 360 in the US

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
That's been delayed indefinitely

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
So I'm not surprised one bit

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
And that was prior to the whole earthquake thing

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Take that for what it will

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And then on top of all that

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Of course this is a little bit too

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Various reasons why they're delaying some of this stuff

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Yakuza of the End

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Motorstorm Apocalypse

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Disaster Report 4

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Well Disaster Report 4 has been cancelled

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
From Sega

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Which

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You know a game about wandering around in a

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You know a city that has

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Undergone some you know traumatic disaster

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Might not be the most sensitive thing to put out

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
In a country

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Unfortunately the game was a disaster

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Honestly it probably was

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Because Disaster Report games have not been very good

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
They were very budget

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
But Motorstorm Apocalypse obviously

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
The content based on that

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I don't really understand

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I mean I understand

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
You know the people might be

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
It's not like you're racing through Tokyo

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Or something like that

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Or racing through parts of Japan that are being destroyed

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
This is like it looks like San Francisco

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
So eh

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Well you know people are being hyper sensitive

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
About it but I

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I sort of get it because

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
When you put down multi millions of dollars

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
On these projects you have to release them

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Just right you know

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And right now you've got an entire

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Country that probably doesn't want to be thinking about

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
The apocalypse you know what I mean

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So for

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
It just I can see where

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
People would be concerned it's in bad taste

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
But nuclear boy Rob

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
That's a whole other thing though

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You're talking about the little YouTube thing

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
He needs something to distract him from having to poop

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And then

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Well the other thing is

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Not only did they announce it was going to be delayed in Japan

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But Motorstorm Apocalypse also got delayed in Europe

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And then later on in the US

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I don't understand why

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Because the game is done but

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Eh whatever okay

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You're delaying it

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
That's fine

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
But eh

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Again if your game comes out the wrong week

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
It might get destroyed like Blur

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I would say a lot of the big reason Blur

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Didn't do well is it came out the wrong week

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
But it was coming out the perfect time

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I mean granted it's coming out around the same time

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
As another Sony game So Com 4

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But I don't really think those would compete

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
With each other too much

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It was coming out in the month where there was essentially nothing

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
This time it's not the other releases

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah but I mean I can understand delaying it

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
In Japan but people in the US

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
You know they're not going to be like

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Oh well that's just insensitive

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's not Japan for one

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's just completely

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
You know it looks like San Francisco

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
In fact I would probably

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Be willing to bet it's based off

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
San Francisco because San Francisco

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Kind of known for earthquakes so

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
You know that's not a stretch

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
And you know the

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Actually I'm going

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
To say it is goddamn San Francisco

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Because you know having played some of the

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Tracks and stuff it looks like San Francisco

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
There is a Sony office right outside San Francisco

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
So it wouldn't surprise me at all

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
You know so I mean

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
I don't understand delaying it there

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Or in Europe

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
But okay whatever you know

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
They want to wait and release it in May

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Or something where it's packed full of

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Releases and fine

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I really think that they should just

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Keep it with the April 12th release date

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
It was perfect there was nothing else coming out

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It was just

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You know

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Well are we talking maybe it'll just be a couple weeks

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Maybe, maybe a couple weeks

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
But really a couple weeks

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
That's going to put it out in a lot of

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
You know because let me put it this way

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You've got MX vs ATV Alive coming out in about a month

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
After it was originally coming out

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So if you wait a little bit longer

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
You're going to have another off-road racing game

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Granted both of them are completely different from each other

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But they're still both

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Kind of in the same genre

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I just think it's kind of a mistake to move it

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
It should have really come out at that time

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Because it would have been perfect

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
There's nothing else coming out

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Um

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
It's awesome so seriously pick it up

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
When it does come out

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Because it's all sorts of awesome

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm going into the chat room

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
At chat.orangetonstrader.com

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Actually yes people in the US find things insensitive

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
They bash the event

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Because it did an episode this week

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
About a nuclear power plant being threatened

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And everyone was like how dare NBC air this

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Oh god

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You know what they need to just stop

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Listening to those people

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Because I mean

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I'm going to boycott your show

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm not going to watch it next week

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
But I'll catch it on DVR

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Well there's been a lot of

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I mean I'm just playing the devil's advocate here

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I also think people are maybe blowing this out of proportion

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
People are dumb

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
On the west coast and you know this as well as I do

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
There's been a lot of talk

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Like the news is dominated with this talk about

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Could the radiation from the power plant in Japan

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Get to the west coast

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I need to get my tin foil hat

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Because they're going to spin it any way they can

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
To make it sound like it's terrible

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Just like you know they were saying oh my god

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
The plant's going to melt down

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It's a matter of minutes you know

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Oh actually no

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Everything's back to normal again

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Oh but it's going to kill us all

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Nuclear rain

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You know fallout

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Scary

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Vote Republican or this will happen

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I mean seriously they just blow it way out

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Because what else are they going to talk about

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Charlie Sheen I mean seriously

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
They've got to talk about something

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Get you to watch the news

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Look I

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
We've got to be careful how we tread here

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Because I think to some extent it is a very

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Frightful thing

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
If this was all going on

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Like I know they shut it down years ago

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
No don't get me wrong

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It is a frightening thing

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
But what's going on

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
There and what the reporting is going on

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
There is completely different

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I am honestly going to say

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It's a lot like nuclear boy

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I'm sorry those who haven't seen it

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
The worst that's going to happen is they're going to have

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
To evacuate Fukushima

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And then

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Fish are going to be

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Sick you can't go fishing near there

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Plants are going to be radiated

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
You're going to have to deal with this for probably the next

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
7 to 10 years

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I think is what it takes for

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Nuclear radiation to be cleaned out of

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Land and our technology is a lot better

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Than it was you know around say

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Chernobyl

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Think about that

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Right now they're in a position

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
To do that and keep in mind this was

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
A place that was designed

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
To go against a 7.5

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Earthquake

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Which was to date

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
The biggest I think that Japan had seen

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
So

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Something like this coming up and having

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Everything still pretty much

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Hold intact with just a few problems

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
That has to say something

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Pretty amazing for you know

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
The level of

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Of care and

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
You know thought that went into the construction

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Of these places

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
You know and also should make everybody

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
In Sacramento shut up about us having

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Nuclear power here

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Because we don't have earthquakes

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Shut up

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Well I got the perfect location for a nuclear power plant

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Where the old one was?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
No

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Where the kings normally play because they suck

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So you know what

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Well they're leaving anyway

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And hey we can still hold count

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Aren't we a video game show I think we got a little off track

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Well but

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I think that my point is made that everyone should watch

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Nuclear Boy because it's great

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
You know all we have to worry about

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Is just mutated dolphins

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Rising up you know to enslave humanity

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That's really what it comes down to

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Now you're making light of a terrible situation

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Knock it off alright

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
It's not terrible that those dolphins

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Are so smart it's terrible that they're using it for

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Evil ok? Let's talk about something

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That's definitely

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Fiction let's get away from the real world stuff and get to

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
A land of fiction and one of our favorite fictional places

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Silent Hill

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Of course Silent Hill is

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
At least a one time awesome video game series

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
That's kind of slipped into a

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Ok yeah I really like

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
This series because I used to like it

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Silent Hill we're experimenting with

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
New weather patterns now

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
So anyhow here's the deal

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Apparently Silent Hill is going to have a release

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
On Xbox Live if rumors are to be

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Believed and here's where the rumors are coming from

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
It's an interview with the Italian based

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Xbox 360 magazine and it's from

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
The art director for Silent Hill

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Downpour saying quote

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
At the moment there will be no

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Multiplayer modes in Silent Hill Downpour

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Konami is investigating

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
A separate chapter devoted entirely

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
To the multiplayer now

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
He went on in this interview to say that he doesn't

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Know any details but it's supposed to be

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Xbox Live Arcade and quote

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
That most players have to survive in the

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Town of Silent Hill

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Now I kind of look at this and go that's

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
That's silent hill cash in

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Well Silent Hill was always supposed

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
To be a very single

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Player experience like I don't see this

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Turning into a shoot em up

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Type of thing like I don't really see it as a

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Bang bang you know kill the others

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Really? It would be kind of cool

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
If like one person could be pyramid head

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Really? And everybody else is trying to run away

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
You don't see it as a bonus points for you know

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Manic and rape You don't see it as a bang bang

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Shoot em up game but yet Konami does

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Because they released an iOS game that was

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Basically that and they released an arcade game

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
That's basically that so they

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Apparently do see it as a shoot em up Well but

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Not like shoot other people you're shooting

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The creatures of Silent Hill or whatever I don't see

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Where the multiplayer element comes on that's my point

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
But then there's a part of me that also pictures

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Like a very Left 4 Dead kind of game

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
That actually could be kind of awesome

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Like and maybe it's like don't take

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Left 4 Dead literally but maybe some type of

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Like cooperative survival

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Game where maybe everybody

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Helps each other in a certain way

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
To survive the town of Silent

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Hill that might be kind of cool

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I don't know That would be neat

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
And I think like a Left 4 Dead style game

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Would be in demand like right now because Left 4 Dead

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Was very popular there was the original

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
There was a sequel we haven't heard anything about a third

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
So maybe

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Silent Hill could kind of release a game like that

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I don't know that's I mean when you talk multiplayer

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Silent Hill like I just I really hope

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
It isn't blue pyramid head versus red pyramid

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Head that would be ridiculous and dumb

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
So it's It's like spy versus spy with

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Pyramid head Yes that would be hideous

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
So either it's got to be like a

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Co-op survival or it's got to

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Be one versus

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Everybody which now the

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
More I kind of say that out loud I think that's kind of dumb

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Too so I really hope it's more like the

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Co-op survival that could be kind of rad actually

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Can you imagine like having to figure out puzzles

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
With multiple people that'd be kind of fun Nothing

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Would get done I can think of something like

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Oh crap Pyramid head's coming

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Push someone in

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
His path Exactly

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Sacrifice dark Sakura

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Hey be like bitch

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Please smack

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Alright

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Anyhow yeah we'll see what develops

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
With that I would imagine if this

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Is true if big if remember this

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Is a rumor because it's coming from an

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Italian magazine from the art director

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Like I'm not saying that

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
You know that small time stuff but you know

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Again it is it does

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Say it sound a little bit like I have this cousin

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Who's a camera man on you know the new

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Superman movie and he told me that Art directors

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Are pretty big Yeah I know

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
But still Dude it has

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Art director in the title Alright anyhow

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Hey just take it with a grain of salt

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
That's all I'm saying don't be disappointed if this game doesn't happen

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I would love to be an art director of a magazine

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Or if it isn't good

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I would love to be an art director Anyway

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Well maybe you should when this guy gets

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Fired for leaking all the details about the game

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
You should apply for his job

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I don't want to move to Italy

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Alright moving on dark Sakura

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
What do you have for us Well

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Apparently the

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Zynga people

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
They Zynga sucks

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm sorry

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
His name is Brian Reynolds

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And he said that Xbox Live

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Is too small for them

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
To bother with

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
For Farmville

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
That means my mother won't be getting an Xbox anytime soon

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
They're basically saying

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It's too small of a demographic

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
He says that most of his friends have

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Smartphones and computers

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
But not too many of them have an Xbox 360

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
That's because your friends suck

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
He's an idiot

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I actually

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Kinda get what he said

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
There are way more people on

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Facebook than there are on Xbox Live

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Fact But let's look at

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Hard cold numbers okay first of all

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
There are 23 million members

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
On Xbox Live as of February

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
2010

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
In January Facebook had

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
600 million users

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And Farmville had 62 million

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Active since September of last year

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
So basically

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
What he's saying is he doesn't like money

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I don't see how it would be

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
That difficult

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I mean really

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
But he's like no it's not gonna be worth

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Our time for just these people

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Okay if you don't want more addicts fine

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Exactly he's basically saying

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Well why would we put it on

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Xbox Live or

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
The Playstation network or something like that

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
They have less people than they have on Facebook

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Duh! It's called expanding your demographic

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
You already have it on Facebook

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
You already have it on smartphones

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
That's why you would put it on a console because you don't

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Have it there yet

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Here's what he said

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Basically the worry

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Is the social experience

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Basically the social experience is going to be

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
A very small number so that the amount of

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Social capital that is there will not be very

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
High so basically you're not gonna have

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
People doing the microtransactions

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Yeah and I think that

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Is more what this boils down to

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I think you know

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It's a little bit comparing the

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Apples to oranges and what's going on with these

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Comparisons yes there are zillions more

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
People on Facebook than Xbox Live

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
But you have to remember that the Zynga games thrive

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
On this very specific business model

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Where they are free to play with the

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Purchasable enhancements that's not the way

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That Xbox works

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
To some level yes you can enhance

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Certain Xbox Live arcade games with

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Extra things but you're always putting some money

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Down up front to play the games

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I would question sure you might have hundreds of

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Millions of people playing FarmVille on Facebook

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
But how many of them are actually paying for it

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
You know and it's probably

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
A pretty damn scary number

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
When you know a lot of us kind of sit here and

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Don't understand FarmVille

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
But again I think the types

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Of games that you have come to

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Know on Facebook and mobile phones are not

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Necessarily the same types of games that are

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
On Xbox Live Arcade

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
It's just kind of like

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I don't know by the way you know

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
The percentage is using those

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm just going to use those numbers as a basis

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
The percentage of people on Facebook

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
That play FarmVille

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
4%

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Tiny

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Tiny tiny

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
So I mean if I

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Were this guy I'd be looking to find ways

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
To get more revenue in

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I'd be adjusting the business model do like

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
XBLA version of FarmVille

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Or my thought why does it

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Have to be FarmVille or something based

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Off of it. If your games are so damn addicting

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Rise to the challenge

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And create a game that you could get away

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
With charging $15 for

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
You know there are

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
I can't believe I'm about to say this

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
But there are some things you can appreciate about FarmVille

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
And

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Like it keeps my mother from preaching at me

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
That's like saying there are some things you can appreciate about Hitler

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
No

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I am not going to go there period

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Other than

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Volkswagen and the Autobahn

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Alright look

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
My thing is that like

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
The thing about

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Now I'm totally lost

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I feel sick

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
I feel a little sick now

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The thing about FarmVille is that

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
It kind of gets your friends

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Even though it might not be us

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
The people that are the quote unquote

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Hardcore gamers

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It gets our moms

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And our relatives and people

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
To be playing a

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Multiplayer game together

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Very easily

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
And maybe there's a way they could bring

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
That multiplayer effort

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
To the Xbox Live place

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Which in turn could maybe enhance

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Xbox Live but I don't think that necessarily

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Has to be just fucking FarmVille

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
No. There's plenty of other games they could rip

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Off

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Right? I'm just still

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Kind of feeling ill from

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
Orange Lounge

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Making people throw up in their mouths

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Daily

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Making my stomach flip flop and I just ate

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
I feel ill

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Spazinator told me to bite my tongue

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Black Wolf says that would require that they actually

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Make something original

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Defective Candy says

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Every time we sell one of those Facebook game cards

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Where I work I die a little on the inside

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Alright

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
You're just feeding the beast

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Let's move on

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Loki

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Take us to some completely different news please

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
This is completely different

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
They're actually working on a

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Transformers MMO

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
And it's being developed by the people behind

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
The browser based

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
MMO RuneScape

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And I guess they've worked out a deal with Hasbro

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
And the game is set to be released in

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And New Zealand sometime in 2012

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
And they said that

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
The title will be a dynamic

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And action packed game

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
No word on which

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Transformers universe

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
It will be based on

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
But that is interesting

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Let's hope it's not the Michael Bay

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Transformers universe although you know that would be

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Action packed

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Apparently Asia is

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Also getting its own Transformers

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
MMO from

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Net Dragon

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
And that's slated to roll out

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I guess later this year

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's interesting

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Be popular

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
People like Transformers

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I don't know the MMO space is a little bit crowded right now

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I don't know if it will be able to kind of

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Get its way in there

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
If it was free to play that would be pretty cool

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Hopefully they don't have the expectation bar very high

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
That's all I'm saying

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
The MMO space is a very tough nut

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
To crack right now

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
And if it's not free to play

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
It has to triple be that much better

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
And judging from the

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Transformer games that have been on the consoles

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
The last one was alright

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
And the next one is supposed to be okay

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Because it's from the same people as the last one

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
So hopefully

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I'll try to keep an open mind

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
But I mean

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
We all know that third movie is going to be terrible

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
I realize they're all

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Now admitting like wow the second movie

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Was really bad but you know the third movie

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Is going to be even worse

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
That last move

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
If I'm wrong then I'm wrong hooray

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
But I'm just not getting my hopes up

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
That's all

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Hey let's talk about music games

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Ubisoft is going to be putting out a new game

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
It's called Rocksmith

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
It's a rhythm game that uses real guitars

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Wait a minute

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
That worked before

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Isn't that a train that left the station quite some time ago

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Alrighty well whatever

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
It's called Rocksmith is the game

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Some of the artists that will be in the game

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
David Bowie, Interpol, The Rolling Stones

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Pretty solid song list

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Right there so far

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
You can use any electric guitar

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That you might just happen to have

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
So we're not talking about buying a cheap

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Plastic peripheral it's using

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
An existing electric guitar

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
So that's neat I guess

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Not sure exactly how this all works

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Just yet as to how it's going to identify

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
From any guitar but I would imagine

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Some type of audio

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Pitch sensing peripheral kind of similar

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
To how it detects when you're singing

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
What pitch you're singing at

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
It would probably plug into it like you'd plug it in

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Like you'd plug it into an amp

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
So there is a trailer out there right now

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
It's supposed to be coming out the second half of the year

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
So I imagine that we'll be hearing

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
More about this at E3

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Okay how are we going to use less

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I was going to try and play it

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah but I wanted to play the trailer but a stupid commercial

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
For those goddamn bears

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
That talk about toilet paper

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
We had actually talked about this before

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
It was actually a game in development called Guitar Rising

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Oh yeah

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
But that never really came out

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
And then Ubisoft bought it

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Yeah it shows a guitar plugged into

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
The Xbox

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
There's got to be some little adapter

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Thingy or something

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
It looks like an amp plugged to USB

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Yeah it's similar to what you use with the

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Um

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Karaoke mics

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
I'm sure it's got to be something just like that

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I was trying to

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Look at the commercial here

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah somebody plugged it in there

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
A little electric guitar

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Again it doesn't really show me anything about the game

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
It's just hey dude is tuning his guitar

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Getting ready to jam

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Man there's so many terrible commercials for games out there

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Nice guitar

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Alright let's move on Dark Soccer

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
Well it's been 22 years in the making

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Da da da

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
There will be a sequel to River City Ransom

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Yay

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Or as it was known in Europe, Street Gangs

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Yay

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Or I really like the Japanese name

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Hot Blooded Downtown Story

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Nice

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's so hot

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
The Japanese developer Miracle Kids

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Is trying to

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Actually got a bunch of the original development team

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Back together

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
And they are going to be doing a console version

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
In the summer with a PC release

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
In 2012

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
So the console version is this summer

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
The PC one will be out next year

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
And

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
They're also

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Got

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Downtown Smash

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Dodgeball

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Which for us was Super Dodgeball

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Which is on Xbox Live

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Indie games

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
So

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Yay

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
If you still want to play the old school one

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Get it on Virtual Consoles

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
500 points

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And to this day my favorite version is still the PC Engine one

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
This is news I want to be excited about

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
But I'm just really worried

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
A lot of time has gone by

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And this can either be a retro

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Revival that's done very awesomely

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Or very terribly

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I always worry it's going to end up in the

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Second one there

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I think the man who rearmed

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Did the whole 8-bit retro thing extremely well

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
But I don't know

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
The second one apparently wasn't that great

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
A lot of the stuff that's retro too

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Is sometimes better left in the past

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
That's all I'm saying

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
We'll see as soon as we start to see

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Some screenshots and some actual gameplay

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
But I guess it's kind of cool that that's coming back

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I mean that was a game I really liked

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Hopefully it kind of comes back as an arcade title

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I don't know if I'd want to pay $60

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
For a new River City Ransom game

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
But I don't suspect it's going to be

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Something for Xbox Live Arcade

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Remember when they re-did

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Final Fight

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Did they?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Yeah it was

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Final Fight for

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It was for the Xbox and Playstation 2

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh it was awful

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I do not have that

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Oh yeah I do remember that

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
That was terrible

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
The last great one was Final Fight Guy

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Actually Final Fight CD

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
That was a good version

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
What was Final Fight CD on?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Is that Sega?

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Guess who has it?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Well I'm sure you guys do somewhere in that vault

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Crazy stuff

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Alright let's move on with some release dates

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
We're going to travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
For your favorite console, Loki

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Lots of stuff this week

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Some re-releases and stuff

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Raven Rabbids Party Collection

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It's a collection of Raven Rabbids

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
1 and 2 and TV Party

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Mayhem 3D on Playstation 3

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And on Xbox 360

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
It's a demolition derby type game

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
TrackMania Build to Race

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
on the Wii

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Awesome racing games

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Check it out

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Tomb Raider Trilogy

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Re-release or HD versions

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Of the last three

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Tomb Raider games

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And of course the last one was really on PS3

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So it's a re-release event

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Crysis 2 on PC

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Chikandia

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
The Timeless Land

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
This is a sequel

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I guess spiritual successor to

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
32nd Hero

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
That's on PSP

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
PlayStation Move Heroes

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Coming out on PS3

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Disidea

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Duidisium

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Or Duidisium

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I went for that the first time

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
That is a game

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
That is coming out on PSP this week

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
So if you want a little bit of a

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Sequel to the

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Disidea

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That's on PSP

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And of course

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
This is going to be a huge week

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Name of game 3DS

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
That's what they're all called

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Pretty much right?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Alright

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Let's move on to

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
A game called Escatos is coming out this week

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
This is like an old school shooter

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Type game that's been revamped basically

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Or I should say it's inspired by old school shooters

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And it's like you know

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
In like 3D

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's basically another shmup

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
But it looks like it has some more retro based modes

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
So if you're into like old school shooters

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I think they're going for you with this game

Fighters Uncaged also this week as well as

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Shooting fun games this week

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Going over to the Playstation 3

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
On the Japanese 3DS this week

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And lastly going over to the

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
PSP to look at the releases there

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Huge week

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I almost want to import this

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
But I know I won't be able to read it

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Final Fantasy IV The Complete Collection makes its way out on the Sony PSP

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Just give it another month

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I'm so excited for this

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I dust off the PSP, get my charger, get ready to go

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
So excited for this

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Also an interesting game called Are You Alice?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Comes out this week on the Sony PSP

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
It's set based in the

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Was it the

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Brady Bunch universe?

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
No it is not based in the Brady Bunch universe

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Actually it looks very much like a

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I don't know how to explain this

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Like a very like old time

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Think of like that Castlevania

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Sort of flair

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
I mean it's not like vampires

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
But definitely the costumes kind of remind me of that

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Sort of story

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
It's an adventure game

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
On the PSP

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I don't know if that's something

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
That's coming out over here

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I don't think so

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I don't know if it's based on the anime or what the deal is

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Are You Alice?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
At least it wasn't Are You Jimmy Ray

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Because I hated that song

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Remember the 90s?

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Alright how about the UK?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Dark Sakura

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Well in the UK we have

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
A crap ton of stuff

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Starting on the

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
22nd we have Swarm

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Sturmovik Cliffs of Dover

On the 25th we have Combat of Giants

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
K done

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
So excited to be finished with those release dates

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Alright just a couple more stories for you guys

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Then we got the classic game of the week

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
A trip down memory lane

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
With a classic video game coming up in just a little bit

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
But first, two more stories for you guys

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Yeah we got some news about the NGP

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Or what's codenamed the NGP

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
From Sony

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
They're saying that the

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
games will be downloadable day and date with the

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
retail releases

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
So you'll be able to either buy

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
the cartridge that these are going to be on

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
or download them from the Playstation Network store

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
All of them? Or just the Sony ones?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Well they're saying all of them

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
But here's kind of an

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
interesting thing though if you think about it

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
That sounds

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
good in theory

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Until you realize one thing

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
There's no onboard storage on the NGP

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
So

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Where the hell am I supposed to put these games that

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
you're having me download? Oh I have to buy your

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
proprietary memory unit

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Oh how wonderful

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
I have to buy a fucking memory card

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
to do that. How about this? I'll just buy the

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
retail game. Man that

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
sounds good. Because you know what I could do with that

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
retail game? When I don't want to play it anymore

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I can sell it back

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Because I'm sure you're not going to have any sort of

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
price break or anything like that on there

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
So

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Unless they come out

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
cheaper because I'm not buying

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
all the packaged goods that go along

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
with the game

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
I'm not interested, sorry

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
And then on top of that

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
there's a rumor regarding the price of the system

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Apparently

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Sony Europe put out

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
a survey. I guess this is

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
tying in with Ubisoft

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
It was

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Some survey

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
conducted by a

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
research firm and sponsored by

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Ubisoft. They're saying that

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
the retail price of the Sony NGP is expected

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
to be around $350

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
How likely

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
would you be

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
How likely would you be

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
to purchase the NGP now that

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
you know the retail price?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
They're saying that's the premium model with 3G

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
The next question is

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
How about the one without 3G

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
which will be considerably lower at

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
$250?

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
That's fucking expensive

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
both ways and I know that the reason

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
that they're saying, oh well $350

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
we're competing with the iPad and those

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
tablet devices but

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
because you're a handheld

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
gaming console

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I know you may want to think that you're a computer

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
or think that you're a tablet or something like that

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
but the truth of the matter is

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
you're not, you're a game console

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
so your price is too damn high

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
$250 should be the topic

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I don't even think that these

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
prices that we're hearing about mean anything

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I don't think Sony knows what they're charging for this thing yet

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I really don't

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I mean, a week before

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
E3 I believe this rumor right now

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
doesn't mean squat

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
We'll see

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I wouldn't be surprised

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
if they go and try to charge $350

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
but here's the thing, it'll be $350

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
retail but

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
because these are gonna have

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
3G, they're gonna be tied with some sort of

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
data plan and get it for a lot cheaper

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
than that because you're gonna be signing a contract

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
or to your contract or something like that

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
so that's where it's gonna make

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
sense for people to pick up the 3G

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Not necessarily though, you don't have to sign a contract for

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
an iPad

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
an iPhone, yes, but an iPad, no

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
you don't sign a contract for those

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Well then how do you get the 3G?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
You buy it with the 3G enabled and then you buy a separate data plan

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
but they don't subsidize the cost of those machines

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
at all

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
because I believe the data can be through

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
either, and correct me if I'm wrong chatters

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
but I'm pretty sure it's either to AT&T

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
or Verizon

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
and now we have this big huge news today

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
that AT&T has gobbled up T-Mobile

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
or at least will be over the next 12 months

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
assuming the government approves of the acquisition

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
or what have you, so that's just gonna be

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
even more, you know, that's one

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
less carrier out of the sea

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
It'll be interesting to see what happens

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
A lot of people on my Twitter

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
are not happy about that acquisition by the way

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Apparently a lot more T-Mobile customers than I realized out there

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
who don't want to switch

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Well they have some pretty good budget plans

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
That's okay, I'm already with AT&T

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I know, I've never had a problem with AT&T, but some people really hate them

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But then again, I don't live in a huge city

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
It seems like everybody I know that hates AT&T

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
lives in a huge city

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I have better luck with AT&T here than anything else

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and I have no trouble

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
when I travel, so

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Well, we'll see

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Alright, anyhow

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
More stuff, and this is on a completely different

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
kind of note, you know, obviously last week

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
we spent a little time talking about how

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
you guys can help, what's going on

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
in Japan and the really unfortunate

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
tragedy that's happened over there and

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
a lot of the gaming world now coming on board

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
to do some really cool things for the

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
disaster relief over in Japan

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I don't even have time to name it all

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
but here's some of the ones that caught my eye

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Squeenix

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
is just flat out donating money

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
There's no buy this game for whatever

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
cost or donate through the

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Nope, they are just straight out giving

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
100 million yen to the relief

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
effort, they are also collecting

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
donations from employees throughout the world

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and they are also going to be getting donations

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
through select Squeenix

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
online services and the amusement

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
facilities that Taito operates in

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Japan, so very cool what

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Square Enix, or as we always call them on the show

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Squeenix is doing

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
This weekend, PopCap is donating

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
the sales of their IOS games

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
that means iPhone and iPad games

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
to the Red Cross, so they

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
donate 100% of the sales of

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
the games this weekend

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
March 19th and 20th, so those listening

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
live, today is the last day to do it, those that are

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
listening on the podcast, you missed it

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
but all the money will be donated to the Red Cross

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
and they

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
are saying in a statement that they

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
recently opened an office in Tokyo

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and while the Japan based employees are safe

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and uninjured, we understand countless

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
others in Japan need food, shelter

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
and medical attention, given that Plants vs.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Zombies reached number one on the iPhone and iPad

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
sales charts in Japan, it seemed like

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
the most appropriate game to feature in the

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
fundraising campaign, so if you don't already

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
own the game, now is the perfect

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
excuse to get it, so very cool

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Also

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
just a lot of other things

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
games purchased on Direct2

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Drive, the company will donate a dollar

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
each game to Disaster Relief

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Bungie is currently selling

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
a little band, the little

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
armbands that kind of remind me of the

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Livestrong, I'm sure everybody has seen those, these blue

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
ones, Japan Quake Relief

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
2011, those proceeds go

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
directly to the Red Cross

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Also, I don't know if you guys saw this, if you

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
logged into the Playstation at all

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
there is a link right in the

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Playstation store that I think also

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
comes up in the What's New, you can just

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
donate money right from your

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Playstation, very similar to what they got

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
going on in iTunes right now, so you can just

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
donate right the funds that are in the Playstation

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
wallet, or just donate through the

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Playstation, so if you

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
don't know how else to donate, that's

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
one way you can do it, and there you go

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Awesome, and that's not even all of

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
them, there's lots of other great things going on out

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
there in the gaming world of people

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
donating money, and you know, as I said

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
last week, please, anybody

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
if you listen to this show

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I really think in lieu of giving us

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
money, which we don't ever ask you for

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
really would hope you would donate what you

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
can to the relief efforts going on

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
in Japan, and even if you're like

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
I don't have any money, I've got zero cents

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
donate time

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
would even be helpful at this point, the Red

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Cross can use help all over

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
during this very unfortunate

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
time. Alright

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
let's take a minute to switch gears

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
here and take a trip down memory lane

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
in a segment we do here on the show every week

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
called the Classic Game of the

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Week, Dark Sakura's gonna step

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
into the vault and find a game that she just

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
loves more than anything

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
in the world, and say

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
kids, you better be playing this game this week

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
or I'm gonna beat you up

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
well I apparently love a lot of games

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
then if that's the story

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
the game of the week is

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Strider 2

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
or known as Strider Here U2

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
which is the

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
official sequel to

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
the first Strider game

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
and I'm bringing up a

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
YouTube right now, sorry I'm a little delayed here

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
but here you go

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
here's a little bit of the

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
gameplay

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:17.000
the music too, the music's pretty good

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
actually I really like the first level of the music

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
anyway

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
it really is

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
not a sequel to

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
the NES one, I'm just saying

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
because the NES one is actually a retelling

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
of the manga

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
the Strider 2 the manga

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
so this one

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
is basically set 2000 years

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
after the events of the original game

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the Grand Master has returned to life

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and so has Strider Here U

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
so

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
he's going through different levels

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
it's actually 2D sprites

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
over 3D backgrounds

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
but it's the same as the original

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
it pretty much plays the same

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
you've got three action buttons

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
he has all of his

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
old moves like walking, jumping, crouching

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
sliding, climbing walls and ceilings

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
and he's got a dash

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
now by pressing

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
left or right twice

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
and a double jump, basically you press jump

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
in midair and a backwards somersault done while sliding

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
and then he can

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
do a thrust jump off of a wall

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
if he's holding onto a wall

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and he's got like

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
extra slash moves

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
and all kinds of different moves, he's got like a boost

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
if he's got a boost item

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
so he can shoot, you know

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
out of his plasma, out of his cypher

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
so it's pretty cool

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and this one actually has a few

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
throwbacks as far as health

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
you know, replenishments

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
you can extend your life bar

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
you have a cypher extension, other boosts

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
and then you can get

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
different things

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
in the game, you can get the

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Yasuchi and the Sakji symbol

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
from Vulgus and the Zenny coins from

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds, I love that game

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
anyway

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
so you've got five stages

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
each of them

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
gives you a little breakdown beforehand

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
we have an appearance of

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Tonpuu in here, cause she was so cool

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
it was

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
it was pretty awesome

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
you've got the first three

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
on Earth, Hong Kong, Germany

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
and Antarctica

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
and that was Hong Kong, of course the one that

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Tonpuu is in, and then the last two

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
are in space, you have the flying

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
battleship Balrog and

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Third Moon, which are both

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
locations in the original game

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
the home version did come out

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
in 2000 on the Playstation

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
and I've got both

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
versions, I believe, the Japanese and the US

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
one

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
it actually comes with two discs

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
on the first disc is Strider 2

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
and the second disc is the original

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
coin-op version of Strider

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
so that's pretty neat

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
but a labeling error on the American one has

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
both discs labeled as Strider

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
so we used to have to guess

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
so if you finish the games and

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
do all the achievements on the same memory card

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
you get a secret level called Strider 2

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Mission Zero, it's a waterfall stage

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
and then if you

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
complete all of the missions you get

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Strider Hyun as

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
a playable character

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
he has two cyphers and is pretty hardcore

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and awesome

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
and that is actually my favorite person

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
to play through the damn game with is

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
just like, I've got two of these suckers

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
and I'm bad

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
and he like, I think he can throw one like a boomerang

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
if I'm right

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
anyway, um, so yeah

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
really really hot, this was

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I mean, the game is

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
really cool, it's kind of, if you

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
if you're, I guess a veteran of it

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
then it might seem like it's

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
a little short and a little

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
huh? but there was so much

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
coolness in it that it's just a

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
fun game, I mean I could sit down and

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
play through it in a couple hours, it's just a

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
fun game, so

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
that is my game of the week

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Strider 2

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
alright, good time

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Strider 2

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
the arcade game

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
also on the Playstation 1

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
classic video game of the week

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
hardcore

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
okay chat room, why are you

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
bothering with Deadpool?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
there's 50 million

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Deadpool titles out, ugh

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Deadpool's jumped the shark

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I'm sorry, he's only good at Marvel vs Capcom 3

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
really?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
not a fan anymore, huh?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
no, okay, I love the character

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
and I think he was fine in

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Cable and Deadpool

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
great series, and then they ended it

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
but now Deadpool's in like

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
eight titles, seriously?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I think it's eight

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
and it's like, dude, too much Deadpool

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
too much of a funny thing

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
is annoying, sorry

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Strider 2, awesome game, go play it

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and underappreciated

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
highly underappreciated

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
alright, well we're going to take a quick break guys

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
we have some rapid fire news tonight

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
of course Twitter topics is your last chance to get those in

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
at twitter.com slash OLR

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
get those in right now so we can read them in a little bit

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
we're going to talk a little more about the censorship

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
of Mortal Kombat in Australia

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
we'll talk about some legal battles and

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
a possible sequel to the King of Kong movie

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
maybe?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
yep, it might be happening

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
so we'll talk about that when we come back in just a little bit

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
we are live on this Sunday evening

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000

with the 406th episode

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
of our show

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
we're about to get into the twitter topics

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
but first, some rapid fire news

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
until we plug the side projects

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
that we have

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
or whatever you want to call them

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
DarkSakura, you have another little podcast you do?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
yes, and if anyone listened to my rant

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
at the end of part A, this is a rant you'll hear

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
all the time on the show

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
do Comic Insanity

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
you can download the podcast

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
at Infamous

N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
and we basically, it is me

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and Mar and Marvel, and you have something

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
hanging from your shoe, nevermind it's your shoelace

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
well that has happened, yes

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
it's just a little weird

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
and Dan Shadow

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
and we basically

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
talk comics, we talk about what's coming out

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
what's on our pool list

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
we have one that we read every week

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
and next week we are going to have

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
hopefully a special guest

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
so you'll just have to tune in and listen

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
but we go live every Tuesday

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
awesome

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
if you enjoy the World of Warcraft

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
or even if you don't, you just like to hear people talk

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
about it and tell dick and fart jokes along the way

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
you should definitely check out

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, it's a show that

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Extfer and I do all about World of Warcraft

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
brand new website just launched today

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
www.hordehouse.com

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
for all the information, H-O-R-D-E

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
H-O-U-S-E, for all the information

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and you can download it right there

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
alright, there you go

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
so let's get into some rapid fire news

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
quick news stories about what is going on

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
in the gaming world that we just don't have a lot of time for

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
otherwise, Loki

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
if you're in the UK, you'll be treated

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
to some little big Planet 2

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
download content coming in May

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
this is kind of a little bit different than the normal stuff

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
that they put out, they're actually doing

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
what they call a teacher pack

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and it's being developed by Media Molecule

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
it's to be packed with demonstrations

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
of the national

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
curriculum and it's based

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
in game levels that other

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
teachers have made

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
and I guess this pack will also feature

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Playstation Move functionality as well

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
which is pretty cool

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
you know, I didn't get to play

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Little Big Planet when I was

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
in school, well

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
all we had was these kids today

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Number Munchers and

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
DDR machines in their PE classrooms

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
and now Little

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Big Planet teaching a history

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
you should grow up on Number Munchers

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
and Oregon Trail

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
like we did

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
and then of course

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
this is kind of neat

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
more download content coming

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
this new

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I guess, pack is called the

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Indie Hip Hop Mix Pack

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
and features the

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000

not as much as I was hoping, you know, be put out by

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Harmonix but I guess maybe it takes a little longer

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
to get some dance routines put out

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Fat Boy Slim Weapon of Choice

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
awesome song

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Gwen Stefani with Hollaback Girl

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Carrie Hilston

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
with Turning Me On

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
and Paula Abdul with Straight Up

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
those are available for $3 per track

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
or 240 Microsoft points

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
that's a lot of

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
download content there

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
it's good to see that game is still getting supported with

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
download content, better support than a lot of games

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I haven't gotten to play it in a long time

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
but I really want to go back to it

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
oh, that was another thing, I forgot to mention

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
a really late part of my game week

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I played U-Star 2

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
what the hell's that?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
U-Star is like

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
karaoke for movie scenes, you read

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
lines and it puts you

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
into the movie like a green screen

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
that sounds horrible, actually it sounds like

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
something I've seen at Disney's California

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Adventure, where you can like

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
it's set up like Ursula from

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
the Little Mermaids

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
and you can reenact scenes

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
over where Turtle Talk with Crush is

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
that whole thing, yep, you can reenact scenes from

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
your favorite movies

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
it is a terrible game

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
the interface is just absolutely terrible

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
oh my god, my co-worker though

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
was doing lines from like

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
300 and stuff like that

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
and

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
THIS IS CAKETOWN

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and just the way he was doing it

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
though, it was like

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Igor from

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Frankenstein or something like that

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
and just this really weird voice

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
he did the whole thing

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
it was hilarious, and the game has

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
the worst framing ever

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
we had the camera set up on a table

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
and it would zoom in or zoom

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
out too much

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
depending on the scene, so there's

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
one scene that you could do, it was kind of

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
an ad-lib thing, it was like the moon

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
or something, like moon surface, and all it had

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
was his head

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
his head was on the screen

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
it's a terrible game

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
it's funny, it sounds like something you'd buy

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
for like one night of LOLs and then it's over

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I'll probably wait for it to drop in price

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
it is pretty funny though, for like a drunken party game

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
ok, there you go

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
some other quickfire news here

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Red Faction Battlegrounds has a release date

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
it's going to be April 5th

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
and it will be out for $9.99

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
on the Playstation

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
that's also 800 Microsoft Points

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
but here's the thing, if you're in the Playstation Plus

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
thing, before March 25th

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
so this week

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
you can get the game for FREE

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
so this is more incentive for you to sign up

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
for the Playstation Plus membership, free stuff

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
so yeah, that's Red Faction Battlegrounds

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
also, I found this kind of interesting

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
GameStop is now selling

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
500GB Playstation 3s

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
but they don't really make

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
500GB Playstation 3s, so how do they do it?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
well, it's a refurbished deal

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
they sell refurbished Playstation 3s

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
and they call them premium

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
refurbished Playstation 3s supercharged

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
they come with a 500GB

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Western Digital Scorpio Blue

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
hard drive

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
and a bunch of peripherals and things come with it too

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
so here's the deal

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
you can buy one of these for $400

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
it comes with a Playstation 3 slim

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
with the new hard drive

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
a special supercharged console skin

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
that reminds you how awesome GameStop is

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
for getting this for you

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
a one year warranty on it

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
and then I guess a media hub with a remote

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
increasing the number of USB slots

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
also an HDMI cable

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
so

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
I gotta say, it's an interesting

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
little spin on the whole

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
used game stuff

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
there's some people that really like to shop around

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
for used only things to get a deal on it

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and even though I don't necessarily

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
know if you're getting a deal with this

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
you are getting a lot of

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
extra stuff that a lot of people

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
kinda have to buy anyway

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
like the HDMI cable and so forth

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I don't know guys, I have an 80GB

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
hard drive on my Playstation 3

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
and I still haven't hit the limit yet, knock on wood

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
but I also don't download a lot of movies

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I'm not Spazinator, Spazinator calls in every week

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
talking about some video he's downloaded

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
like I don't have that many movies

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I have a 500GB hard drive in mine

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
do you really, but you redid it yourself right?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
yeah I did it myself because I had 20 in there

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
oh my gosh, yeah

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I can see

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
mine's only 80, I haven't filled it up yet, knock on wood

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
um

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
yeah I guess if you're

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
used to paying a lot of money for

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
HDMI cables it's a good deal

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
but

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
it's an interesting way

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
to make the used Playstation 3

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
business kinda interesting

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
like it's kinda creative

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
to just get the hard drive and put the new ones

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
in there at the GameStop level

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
well I think also too, and I'm not sure

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
if GameStop have this problem, but

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Sony was oh so wonderful

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
and decided, hey you know what

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
we're having shortages on the old systems

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
so

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
you place a bunch of orders for it and they don't come in forever

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
and then oh hey we're gonna

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
we're gonna send a bunch of them to you

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
you get them, oh by the way we're releasing

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
new SKU, suckas

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and so you're left with a bunch of systems that

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
oh by the way we didn't price protect those so

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
they're gonna come out at the same price and you're

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
stuck with these old systems that nobody wants

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
haha suckers, so

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
if they did that to GameStop

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
which is very unlikely because they're GameStop

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
but let's just for all

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
you know sakes and purposes

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
say they did, and

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
what are they gonna do with all these old systems? Well they can buy

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
a bunch of hard drives for cheap, upgrade them

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
sell off

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
the old hard drives I guess if they want to

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
and sell them

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
for a premium and make money

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
off the system and the accessories

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
bundle with it

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and it becomes a unique

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
item for them because there are no 500

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
gigabyte PS3s

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Togak in our chat room is commenting on the size

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
of your hard drive saying that's a lot of porn Loki

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
no no no

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I stream my porn, that was actually for

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
for rips

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
of games but I

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
my system's all legit now

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I unmodified it because

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
I want to play MotorStorm

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
and

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
you know it's just

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
it was the right thing to do

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
whatever, once again remember we

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
got into it a couple weeks ago

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
about how there wasn't really

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
much I wanted to play on there, well MotorStorm was

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
one of the games I wanted to play but

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
I'm not missing much

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
or anything

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Alright one more story I've got, we'll go over to

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Jamie, this is about a Wipeout

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Kinect game and you might

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
be kind of looking going wait a minute I thought

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Wipeout was a Sony franchise, why is it coming out

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
on the Kinect? Because it's not that

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Wipeout, no no we're talking about the

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
ABC reality show that

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
is kind of like a Japanese game

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
show I guess for American audiences it's

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Wipeout the game show

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
it has a Kinect game coming out

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
this summer

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you might remember this game was already

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
released on the Wii and the DS

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I'm sure it was pretty terrible

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
now they talk about how there

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
are infamous big balls

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
and I assume they're not talking about genitalia

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
but these actual giant balls that people bounce

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I've never watched this show it just looks

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
idiotic to me but I guess

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
a lot of people really like it but people bounce

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
on giant balls like it's a pinball machine

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
or something so this game

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Wipeout will have more than 30 obstacles

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
you will run, duck

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
dodge and of course Wipeout

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
and they go on

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
this quote about everyone who watches the show

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
wishes they could try the obstacle course and now

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
this is their chance!

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Is it like Takeshi's Castle?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
It's sort of like Takeshi's Castle but

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
like really dumbed down. Kind of what I get from

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
looking at it yeah but I've never

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
and like I'm a reality TV

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
whore okay I watch a lot of crap

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
that I deservingly

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
deserve to be made fun of for watching

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
like Big Brother come on

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
but I don't watch Wipeout

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
like I'm not going to stoop that low

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Well remember how they like it's basically

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
it took all these Japanese game shows and just

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
gutted the soul out of them

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
like that show

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Hole in the Wall the one that was the funny Japanese

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
game show that was a segment on Ellen

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
and that's where it should have stayed like

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
it's funny for two minutes and that's it

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
no it was actually well it may have been a segment

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
but it was originally a Japanese game show

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
and you know

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that's funny because they're just

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
playing it for fun they're not doing it for prizes

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
but you know of course us

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Americans don't want to watch anything that's for

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
fun it's got to be for money

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
because who cares about fun

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
so they

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
had that and then they totally like fucked it up

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
they just it's like

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
it's just like you know American Iron Chef

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
you know they just

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
gutted all the soul of that show

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
out of it and then the

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
it's Iron Chef at least it has Alton Brown

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
it does have Alton Brown

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
and at least it wasn't as terrible as the original

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
American Iron Chef although William Shatner

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
hosting

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I don't hate that I think he

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
would be just as over the top as Chairman Kaga

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
exactly he would be just as over the top

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
but this like fictional cousin

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
or something like that is retarded

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
now he's on a hideous

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
TV

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
sitcom on CVS

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
based off a Twitter account

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
what?

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
oh yeah William Shatner he's been on a show for like a year called

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
TJ Hooker

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Shit My Dad Says

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
you know I've actually thought about starting

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
a Twitter account for Shit My

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Wife Asked Me About

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
might be kind of long

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
it's just weird

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
there's some funny stuff like

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
what was it the other day she was

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I'm trying to remember one of the questions because it was just like

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
really? that's so weird

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
um

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
oh I don't even remember now

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
it was so strange

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
it was funnier in your head wasn't it?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
it was funnier in my head

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
no but I do say funny stuff now to her and then she

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
posts it on Facebook like she was asking me about

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
so how do you spell

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
how do you spell desert?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
or was it dessert or something like that I'm like

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
well the way you remember it is

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
you know you want more dessert than you want desert

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
so you know

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
dessert has two S's and desert has one

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
so what about the desert something

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I'm like and what if you need to spell

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
deseret because you're a Mormon

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
and so I'm like

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
listen that's the way I learned how to spell

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
um desert

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
so if you don't like it you can

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
shut the hell up

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
or you can go to hell

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
so she wrote that on Facebook

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
good times

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
but she asked me weird shit all the time

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
like all these

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
random questions about things

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
it's the job of a wife to ask her husband

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
really bizarre things

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
what are some of the bizarre things you asked Dan?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Dan!

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
what's the bizarre stuff I ask you?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
he says he doesn't know

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
she keeps asking me questions about mythological creatures

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
and stuff she's like

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
you know what's this look like? I'm like I don't know

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
stupid thingy

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
it's just something

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
that happens

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
is that something that happens like when you get married

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
because like you know

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Alan doesn't really ask me stupid shit

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
it's no

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
it's like if you've got

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
someone who's got a really kind of

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
wandering mind

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
every so often the weirdest questions will pop up

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
and when you hit that comfort level

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
they'll just ask you

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
like

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
and typically it tends to be

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I've noticed the wife

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
or the girlfriend

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
or

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I guess

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and every so often

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
just the most random questions but because I feel

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
so comfortable around my husband

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I'll just blurt them on out

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
like you know

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
I don't know

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
it just occurs to me

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
this whole thing was funnier in your guys'

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
head like it seems like a big in-joke or something

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
but thank god I'm not a lesbian

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I wonder how it would be

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
amongst lesbians

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
if they would both annoy the crap out of each other

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
with annoying questions

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I think it's just written into the

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
female chromosome

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
alright let's move on

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
speaking of the female chromosome

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Dark Soccer give us a few more stories here and then we'll get to Twitter topics

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
okay well

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
here you go

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Rock Band! And this should make

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
my very good friend happy because she

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
likes Billy Joel and I do not

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
but it's the Billy Joel

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
piano challenge

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
it has I go to extremes

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Miami 2017

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
seeing the lights go on on Broadway

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
my life

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
which was the theme from Booze and Buddies

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I used to watch that show

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
prelude angry young man

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
and scenes from Italian restaurant and she's always

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
a woman and there are also

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
for some of these pro guitar

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
bass expansions available for another 80

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Microsoft points the entire pack will be

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
800 Microsoft points or 1000 Wii points

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
or 10 bucks

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
you know what

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I'm good I don't really

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
do not like Billy Joel

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I don't know Billy Joel was like kind of one of those things

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
that was better left in the movies

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
if it's a piano pack why don't they freakin put

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
piano man in it

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
okay wait I think that might already be out

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
maybe? okay well then fine

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
that piano man was in there already

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
yeah this might be like a second time

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
that's how much I like Billy Joel I didn't look

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
that's like the only song he does that I like

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I like the song

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Philadelphia even though the movie is really sad

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I...

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
next story

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
okay more rock band stuff

guess what song's gonna be in it

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
the bed and shooter song

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
yay cause they're climbing in your video games

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
playing your guitars

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
playing your bass

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and playing your keyboards

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
cause they're playing everyone out there

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
and it's the long version

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
god I fucking hope they put

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Friday out next

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
you know what

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
our friend Melody

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
do not buy that song on iTunes

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
too late

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I really wanted her to reach

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
number one cause it would be funny

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I've lost all respect

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
well pfft

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
this is the reason why?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
because

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
no talent rich kids

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
do not need the dollar that is

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
better spent on Jolly Ranchers

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
the end

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I'm on a diet

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
yeah

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
you want a girl scout cookie?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
you know what I've got some

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I don't want to get it

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
don't blame a little girl with a dream

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
blame the music production company

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
it's the same thing I said when the music

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
could have been a dollar closer to getting

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
that music production company to make you a song

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I know

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
this girl

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I'm just jealous cause I don't have a song

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
she's way auto tuned and you can tell

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
she can't sing

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
she did, they interviewed her on

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Good Morning America and they made her sing a few bars

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
of America the Beautiful

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
was she the best singer I've ever heard? no

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
but was she talented?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
she's 13!

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
anyway why are we arguing about this?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'm not talented and I can't sing

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
why is this guy famous?

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
would you pay this guy a dollar to play this song

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
on a rock band?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
cause this one's funny

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
well Friday's funny

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Friday's just sad

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
it's only funny with the video, with the girl with the braces

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I would pay a dollar to pay

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
or to play

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Night Man

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
from It's Always Sunny

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
alright anyhow

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
got a man coming in and raping

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
somebody? is that it or is there another one?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
no there's another one

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Marvel Vs. Capcom 3

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Shuma Gorath

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
and Jill Download Content

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
are...

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Shuma Gorath

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
downloadable content

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
is delayed

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
it was gonna be 400 Microsoft points

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
which is 5 bucks each

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
but now they don't really know why

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
it was gonna be out on March 15th

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
but it's been pushed back

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I don't know when, but it's pushed back

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
which is no great loss because it's crap Jill

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and not fun Jill

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
how does one delay something that's already on the disk?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
yeah, I don't know

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
that's a very good question actually

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
I forgot where the key was

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
to unlock this

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
ah crap

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
the keys fell on the couch

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
ah down the drain

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
got to get a string and a magnet

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
I don't know why that's really funny

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
but I'm just imagining Capcom

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
putting out this press release

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
sorry guys we had to delay the Capcom

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 downloads content

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
we're trying to find a string and a magnet right now

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
to find the unlock key

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
so please bear with us

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
and thank you for your patience

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
we appreciate our fans

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
love Capcom

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
yes we appreciate you enough

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
for you to

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
pay for our download content

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I mean, pay the unlock content

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Twitter Topics!

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
twitter.com slash o-l-r

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
going to a tweet coming up first

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
from Defective Candy

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
let me turn down the little song there

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
in the background

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Defective Candy is sending us a tweet about

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Augmented Reality makes the 3DS bigger than Gigantor

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
what is this?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
this is a link from

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Candinator

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
sending us this story here

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
about the 3DS had launched some time ago

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
and

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
let's see

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
it's about, you have to remember

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I'm reading these for the first time thanks to Twitter

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I guess it has to do with the AR tech

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
oh I see

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
some folks have made a super sized version

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
of the 3DS pack-in Augmented Reality

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
card all for the sake of

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
giving Kobe's Lonely Lifesize

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Tetsujin 28 Ghost statue some company

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
and as you see in the video below

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
he does need a friend, it may well be a me

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I gotta see this video, what is going on

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
oh I see they have this big statue that they did

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
oh

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I see, so what they did

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
instead of having the guy

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
stand on the mat to take the picture

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
they got this gigantic version

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
of it to put the statue on

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I see what they did

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
they took the little pack-in Augmented Reality

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
thing, put it under the statue

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
dude

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
and now he's

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
in the 3DS Augmented Reality game

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
haha

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
it's kind of funny I like that

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
sorry that probably made for terrible radio

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
but hey you tweeted it, alright moving on

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
to another Twitter from SilverSonic1534

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
sending us another

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
really good story about helping

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
the folks out in Japan for the

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
disaster relief, a rare

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Nintendo DS it was signed by a bunch of Nintendo

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
veterans and it was auctioned off

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
this week, let's see

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
it was a

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Mario Kart DS promo

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
system and it was signed by

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Miyamoto, Koji Kondo

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
the Zelda chief, Eiji

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Onomura, Charles Martinet

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Martin Lung who does the piano

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
stuff for Video Games

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Live

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
all of that was autographed

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
by all those people and they sold

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
it, I'm not sure exactly how much they

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
went for, let me look, let me see on eBay real quick

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
ooh it hasn't sold

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
yet, it's got 16 hours left

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
$2,500

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
sorry $2,550

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
$2,550

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
is what it's at right now

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
so if you want to check that out

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
more tweets coming at us

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
from TigerClaw

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
PSP based Augmented

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Reality game, what is it with all the

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Augmented Reality games tonight, that's popular

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
that's right yeah, this is

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
turning school into an adventure worth

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
writing about

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
an imaginary worlds project

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
using the system with the AR software

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
you design fantasy landscapes

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
at school by finding art online

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
and matching it with scannable codes that were

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
hidden around the school

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
they then took camera equipped systems around

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
the school and embarked on quests

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
finding items to defeat monsters and writing

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
about the experience afterwards, that actually sounds

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
kind of awesome, I'd like to see something like that

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
on an even bigger scale

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I don't know, like Amazing Race

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
but for real

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
anyhow, Amazingly Real Race

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Amazingly Real Race on PSP

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
apparently the program went over

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
very well, very enthusiastic response to that

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
the kids were well behaved

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and cooperated when they took part

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
kind of neat, I like that idea

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
remember

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I don't know why, but you know what this reminds you

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
remember when you were in grade

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
school and you'd go on a tour of a

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
historical building, you'd have to put on those

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
big headphones and as you walked

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
under certain places you would hear the

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
stuff in the headphones, like it was all based off radios

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
well imagine now

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
if you could use these augmented reality devices

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
to scan in the certain codes at places

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
and you would read a little bit about what it is

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
you know, you're at, or what the importance

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
of the location is, I don't know, so this reminds

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
me of to some extent, I can see that

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
kind of neat, anyhow

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
one other tweet here from TigerClaw

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
AMD has made a statement

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
that DirectX is holding back the graphics

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
performance on the PC

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
links us to a story from Gamasutra here

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
via our Twitter

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
a quote here from

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
AMD

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
GPU division worldwide developer

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
relations manager Richard Huddy

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
quote, it's funny, we often have at least

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
ten times as much horsepower as an

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Xbox 360 or a Playstation 3

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
in a high end graphics card

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
yet it's very clear that the games don't

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
look ten times as good

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
to a significant extent, that's because

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
one way or another, for good reasons and bad

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
mostly good, DirectX is getting in the way

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
so

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
so mostly good, but

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
yeah, but I guess maybe that's because

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I'm gonna bitch about something, it's mostly

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
for the good of the game, but

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
but we can't do it

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
isn't the Xbox 360 all based off

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
a version of that? I mean wasn't the original name of the

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Xbox the direct Xbox?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
no, that's stupid

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I thought that's where this whole thing came from

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
no, it's basically

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
the Xbox 360

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
like the Xbox 360

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
is running on a modified version of

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
DirectX 9 that has some of the

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
features of DirectX 10 in it

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
but

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
it's basically DirectX 9

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
alright

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and one more tweet here from

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
gamergirl saying, which do you think is better

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Torchlight PC version or Torchlight

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Xbox Live version

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
and what do you find fun about the game as a whole?

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I would say the PC version

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
is much better and the reason for that is

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
that they tried to cram too much into the Xbox

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Live one and unfortunately it suffers

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
from some frame rate issues and just a really

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
awkward interface, I mean

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
for a dungeon crawler, collect a bunch of items

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
games, it doesn't work

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
too well on Xbox, I mean if for whatever

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
reason you hate gaming on the PC

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
then the Xbox is an okay substitute

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I've played far worse games on

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Xbox Live, but I just think between the two, the PC

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
version is superior. What do I like about the

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
game? Well, did you ever play Diablo

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
2? Because if you like that, that's why

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I like Torchlight, because it's like a newer version

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
of that, but otherwise I like the fact

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
that the dungeons are always randomly generated

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
and there's something about that exploring

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and collecting, you know, kind of like

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
that slow grind of improving your character

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and completing quests, kind of like

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
a little bit like an RPG but with

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
much more action in it, I think that's

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
kind of what draws me to the game is that, you know, there's

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
definitely that exploration and you can't

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
really spoil it, like there can't be a strategy

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
guide for how to explore level

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
3, because level 3 is always different

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
it's random for each person that plays it

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and I think that's part of the charm of it

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Alright, I'm letting in one more tweet

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
here from SSJ100Matt saying

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Someone took My Little Pony

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
and mixed it with the Starcraft 2

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
trailer and sends us a link to

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
something on YouTube called Ponycraft

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
I'm not sure what to do

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
This is not My Little Pony

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It's like Noose. Did they redo My Little Pony

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
a couple of years ago or something?

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
They might have

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
This is not the one from the games

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
That's really not going to make

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
sense to me at most

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Yeah, it's like a new My Little Pony

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Might have a lot of vengeance

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Somebody has far too much time

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
on their hands, that's all I'm going to say

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Whatever, if that's the

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
project you want to be famous for, then cool

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Alright, that's pretty hilarious

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
It's interesting

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I've seen weirder things on YouTube, I guess

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Nuclear Boy

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I have not seen Nuclear Boy

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And what is, ok

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It's a great way to describe it to children

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And I'm not up to date on all my

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
astrological stuff that's going on right now

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
or astronomical, I guess

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Yeah, astronomical

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
But what the fuck is the super moon that they keep

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
seeing fucking tweets about and shit

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Something about the moon being closer in orbit

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I believe

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
It was supposed to be gigantic in the sky last night

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
but we wouldn't know because it's been raining

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
for like nine fucking days straight here

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
so the clouds have been blocking the sky

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
So you missed something, but you didn't

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You would have had to drive that way

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
There's a picture of it

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
from Washington, DC

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
The super moon

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
See, there it is big

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Oh, that's dumb

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
That's not big at all

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
But the moon's really big, Loki

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It's a super moon

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And since it's over Los Angeles

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
it's orange with a big rip across it

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
like an Evangelion or something

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Seriously

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Now I can see that

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Alright, let's move on

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Twitter topics are done, so back into the news

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Loki, what have you got for us

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Yeah, so

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Super moon

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
This has been kind of a thing

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
that's been going on with Australia for the

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
longest time

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Take violent game, ban it

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
because hey, you know what, we don't have anything

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
that's, you know, for adults

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So, too bad

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So apparently, Mortal Kombat

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
they appealed

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
the

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
failure to rate

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
the game

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
because it was not classified as

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
R15, and instead

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
their appeal was rejected

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So, now

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
unless changes are

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
made, they cannot release it in

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Australia

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
So that kind of sucks

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And it will ban the title from

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
official retail distribution

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And, of course

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
One of our other games is Extremely

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Disappointed

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
That's always the comment, we're extremely disappointed

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I'd be like, we're fucking pissed

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
That would be my fucking press statement

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
right there, fuck them in their asses

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
We're pissed

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And they were

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
saying, praising thousands

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
of Mortal Kombat fans in Australia

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
and around the world who have voiced their support

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
during the appeal process

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Really? Are you surprised?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I mean, they banned games with lesser

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
crap in there

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Not to say that this will always

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
be the case, in fact, they're actually

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
pressing the

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I guess the Australian

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
federal government

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
They're hoping to have

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
a consensus on the R18

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
game rating creation

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Which is stupid

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
This is all government run anyways

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But, whatever

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Of course

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
The

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
MA-15 Plus

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
that the

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
country already has for mature games

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
is not good enough for

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
some of these, so adding the

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
restricted R18 Plus rating

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
will allow them to release some of these

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
more mature games

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
into the country

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
They said

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I foreshadow that there is

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
if there's not consensus around

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
this issue, the Commonwealth will certainly

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
be considering other options because we

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
cannot continue to have an outdated

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
classification system that's actually

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
in my view, causing harm to young people

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
It just seems, I mean, the Saw movies aren't

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
banned there, right? I don't think so

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
What I saw in this game was no worse than Saw

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I mean, I'm always gonna use that

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
as my defense. Those goddamn Saw movies

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
are terrible! Well, I don't understand how they always

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
rate games as, well, it's interactive

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
so it's more violent. No,

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I don't think so. I think it's less

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
violent. If you think about it, I mean

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
the content in these games

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
like, for example

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Grand Theft Auto, you can run people

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
over and they, you know, blood

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
sprays and stuff like that, you can set people on fire

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
all that stuff, but it's nowhere near as graphic

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
as you see it depicted in movies

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I mean,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
it's just way worse. It's cartoony

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
almost. And I mean

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
really

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
at what age are we gonna, like

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
finally let teenagers

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
you know, be able

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
to decide for themselves what's

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
reality and what's fantasy

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
because if they don't know that a game is

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
not real

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
then there's more, you know, serious

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
problems with them than

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
them playing a violent game

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I'm fine with them taking violence

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
out of video games completely. Like, they could

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
just strip every video game out there of violence

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
as long as we could get ample nudity in its

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
place. That's what I'm saying.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Let's get some boobs. Nudity is even

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
worse. Like, it's like, oh my god, you know

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
there's a little bit of nudity in this game

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
oh, banned. Oh, but violence, we

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
can, you know, we can

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
drill holes in this guy's head

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
while he's, you know, still alive

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
but as soon as you wanna fuck one of those

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
holes, oh, banned.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Wow.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Well, speaking

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
of legal troubles

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
you might remember that Activision

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
had filed a suit against

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Electronic Arts and the former

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
heads of Infinity Ward

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
well, in California, it was ruled this

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
week that the lawsuit filed by

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Activision against the former Infinity Ward

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
studio heads, Vince Zampanella

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
and Jason West, it will be able to

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
proceed. EA wanted to have

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
the case dismissed

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
but unfortunately, the judge

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
felt differently. They decided

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
there is enough evidence that the case can go on to trial.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
EA's options now

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
at this point, they can still request a summary

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
judgment that way

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
you know, it could all be rejected

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
but if that doesn't happen, then the case can

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
go to trial in May of this year.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
It's gonna be interesting. Or it will get settled

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
out of court before then because that's what always seems to

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
happen. Has a video game case ever gone to trial?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Don't they always get settled out of court?

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I don't think I've ever seen one go to trial.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm talking about one

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
between companies. I'm not talking about

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
some crazed asshole

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
played an Xbox and decided to do something

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
stupid. That's not a true

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
game lawsuit. That's just an idiot doing something

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
idiotic. I'm talking about

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
an actual two companies

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
suing each other. Does it ever not

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
get settled? Because they

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
usually end up having to pay less

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
by not going to court.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Or at least they have the illusion of this.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
It's all just a giant game of chicken.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Chicken!

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Alright.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
So let's move on, DarkSakura.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Well.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Hold on.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Okay.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
No, I cannot hold on any longer.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Because I pulled up the mailbag instead

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
of the story. Oops.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
So,

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
I'm sure people remember me having

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
spoken of the King of Kong, right?

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
And it was the

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
video

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
of Steve Weeby and Billy

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Mitchell.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Mitchell, yes. I'm sorry. He's a jerk.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Mitchell!

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Trying to compete for the

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
top scorer on Donkey Kong. Well, now

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
we've got a new

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
documentary out called

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Dr. Kong.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
And this

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
is about

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Dr. Chien, who is a

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
plastic surgeon, who

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
beat Steve Weeby's

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
record, reset record,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
by hitting

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
1,090,400

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
points on Donkey Kong.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
So,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
there actually is a website about it.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
You can go to

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
DrKongTheMovie.com

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and...

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Can I play the trailer here?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Play it, sure. It's kind of interesting, actually.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I don't know why. It's funny.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Here we go. So we see scenes of the

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
plastic surgery going on.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Establishing shots of

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
yes, this dude is a surgeon.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I'm copying this to the chat room, by the way. Sure.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
And then you see him playing some Donkey Kong.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
And he has a Donkey Kong machine.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I was feeling one of the people at Twin Galaxies

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
and when he found out I was a plastic surgeon, he was like

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
should you be out getting laid?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Like, why are you playing Donkey Kong?

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I was like, I'm playing Donkey Kong so I can't get laid.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Wait a minute.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
He's playing Donkey Kong

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
so he can't get laid?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Like, I don't get that. He's a plastic surgeon.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
He makes girls' boobies bigger all day long.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
That's what plastic surgeons do, right?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
All they do is boob jobs, right?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Well, chin jobs

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
and lipo. Never

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
reconstructive surgeries after accidents, though.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
No.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Just boob jobs. I don't need that.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So he works on boobies all day

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
but he plays

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Donkey Kong to get laid.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I'm not sure I see the logic there

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
but let's continue.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I kind of like, I don't know, fame

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I guess, or glory. I don't know.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Congratulations!

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Paul, this guy's the guy that beat the world

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
that just beat the Donkey Kong.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Now that you have the world record

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
you have to quit playing.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
What?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
That was the trailer. Do you tell Mozart

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
to stop composing music?

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
So is that the big question that's gonna be

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
answered in the movie? Like, does he get laid?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
No.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
No, he does not get laid.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Aw, what a downer.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
And to...

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
He sounds like William.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Stop it!

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Stop it!

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Oh my god, Rob.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
You are so red in the face right now.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Cause I'm mad that he dared bring that up

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
on this program.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
You're a dick.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
At least he sounds more educated.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
He doesn't sound...

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Next story!

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Oh, put the 3DS down.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Loki, put the 3DS down

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
before I shove it up your ass.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Oh, fine.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Our next story.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Let's talk a little bit about Minecraft.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Yes, Minecraft.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Minecraft, they're going the route of

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Nintendogs.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
And you're gonna get

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
your own

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I guess, domesticated wolf

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Canines.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And...

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
You'll be able to walk around with them

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
and whatnot.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
And then of course, later on, they're gonna be

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
adding achievements as well. That's the next thing.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
But for right now,

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
they are working on

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
pet wolves.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Neat, I guess.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I don't know if they really

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
would do much. I mean, can you train them to

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
attack things?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
I don't know.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I have a friend who has pet wolves.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Like real ones? Yes.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Just hanging out in the backyard?

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
A couple of them are half-wolves and one of them is full.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Here in SAC?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Yeah.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
They're domesticated.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Kind of neat. I don't know.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
They're kind of cool-looking.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
These Minecraft ones are far more adorable.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
That's all I'm saying. They are pretty adorable.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Is he gonna punch that wolf?

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Oh, he's gonna beat it with a... No?

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Punch? What is that?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
What does that even have in his hand?

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Looks like a stub.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Maybe it's like a stick to play fetch.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I still have yet to play

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Minecraft. I feel so uncool and uneducated.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Yeah.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I kind of feel the same way.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
You're so kind to me tonight.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Now he's punching a...

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Oh, he punched a cow in the ass

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
and then the wolves are

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
attacking the cow.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Nice.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
So you can stick your wolves on...

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
on other things.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So I guess you can now release the hounds.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
That's neat.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Alright.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
What happens if you punch the dog?

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
They probably get angry.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
They bite your nuts off.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Is Minecraft like an MMO?

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
You can play with other people.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
So you can visit other people's worlds and stuff?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
That's kind of cool.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I really need to try this damn game already.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I don't know why I've been so lazy.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Oh, the dog's showing hearts.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
He likes you.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
He gave him a bone.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
You try to hump, you're like...

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
The dog's on fire.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
That's not good.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Cause the dog's stupid and standing over the fire.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Oh good. I've got people in chat. Defective Candy.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Don't feel bad. I've never played Minecraft either.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And SilverSonic. I've never played Minecraft either.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I will make it my mission this week to play Minecraft.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
At some point. I promise.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I couldn't get into it. I didn't like it.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Really? What about it didn't you like?

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
It's just kind of a pain in the ass.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I think it's just you don't know where to start with it.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
It's like...

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I tried and I just honestly

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I couldn't get into it and it just wasn't fun to me.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
But it's like the big thing in gaming right now.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
It's like Minecraft and Angry Birds.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Yeah, and if

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
you know everybody

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
if the biggest thing in gaming was for everyone to play

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
their Nintendo 3DS

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
while walking towards the end of a broken bridge.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Guess what?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I'll be playing PSP in my house.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Alright, moving on.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
The Kodoo Game Lab.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I don't see a lot of coverage on this.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
But it's out there and about.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Microsoft did release this.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It's a game creation utility.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
It just came out this past week.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
It's a free software suite.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
And it's doing a game design

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
competition to sort of

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
kick off the whole Kodoo Game Lab.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
It's called the Kodoo Cup 2011.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
It's for

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
students aged 9 to 17.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Oh great, the target age group of our show.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Divided into

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
two age groups within the 9 to 17 bracket.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
You will use the software

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
to design your game.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's submitted by May 10th.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Prizes. $5,000 awards

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
for both individuals and schools.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
A trip to New York City. Laptop connect

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
bundles. And a Zune HD.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Which is amazing because didn't we also have a story

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
this week that the Zune got

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
axed?

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Gotta get rid of them somehow.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Maybe they'll have like 5,000 Zune HD's

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
as runner up prizes trying to get rid of

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
their Overstock.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
That's too bad.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
What I like

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
about this is the screenshot I'm looking at

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
of the Kodoo Game Lab. Somebody has designed

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
the lost numbers as a computer chip.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The 4, 8, 15, eh forget it.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Anyhow, so if you

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
are between 9 and 17 and you want to win money

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
or a, you know, Zune cause they're

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
so popular, check that out.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Meanwhile, let's go to the Mailbag.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Every week Dark Sakura reads

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
the emails that you guys send us at

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So, why don't

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Dark Sakura, why don't you

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
put on your surgical gloves, get ready

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
to jump in there and do some plastic surgery

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
on the mailbag. Ew, it's squishy.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Ok, first

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Like a boob. No, not like a boob.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Like putting your finger

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
up a butt or something.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Anyway, hello OLR, it's your

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
friendly neighborhood spazzinator. Seeing as

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
the OLR mailbag has been a wee bit

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
on the light side as of late, I thought

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
it might be

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
a good'em idea

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
G-O-O-D-M, idea to

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
send an email rather than a tweet for

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
a change of pace. I found a little

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
something of note that bears mentioning seeing as it

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
relates to a subject you folks touched on

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
last week. Must be why I wasn't here.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
With the recent events

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
in Japan in mind, SCEA's

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
arrangement to relay donations to the Red Cross

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
from one's PSN

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
wallet. As of the time I typed this

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
there's a spot on the game's side of the PSN

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
store, the first icon you see once you enter the new

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
pieces section, that allow you to make donations

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
of 2, 5, 10, 25, and

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
50 dollars

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
in US funds. I imagine

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
that you could make multiple

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
donations and mix and match amounts as well.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Although I can't say for sure that

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I don't have access to the stores in other regions

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I'd imagine there's similar setups in other regions'

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
PSN stores as well. In case

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
either of you, in case

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
either one of you or a fellow listener is asking

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
albeit to oneself,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
something along the lines of, so

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
here's my point, this makes things that

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
much easier to donate to a cause if you feel

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
so inclined, but may not necessarily

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
have a PayPal or bank account, etc.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Such is the case with me, but I digress.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I'm not sure if Microsoft

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
will be doing a similar setup

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
in the Xbox, the

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
XBL marketplace, but if

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I were betting man, the odds are in favor of it.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
So in short, if you would like to donate and think

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
you can do without a rock band song, or if not

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
more, and you're on PSN

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
anyways, why not make a donation through the PSN stores?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Whispers, psss.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Besides, then you can honestly claim

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
that gaming does actually do some good

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
in the fact that it would just really piss off certain

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
ex-lawyer from Florida.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
XD colon minus

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
P. I have not

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
heard about that guy in a very long time.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
That certain ex-lawyer from Florida.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And that makes me happy that he

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
has not been in the news in a very long time.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
That's one of the best things

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
to come out of this email, honestly. I bet he's

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
sitting on attack going, ow, there's attack.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Damn gamers.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Damn you gamers.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
And you get a cute little theme.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And also to keep in mind

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
whenever you make a donation to

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
charity, get a receipt of it.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
You can write it off on your taxes.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
If you are, of course,

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
of tax paying age.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Just saying.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So you get a kickback. Not bad.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Also save all your school receipts.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Okay, I would close this

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
email with a clever quip or something, but frankly

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
my brain is fried due to lack of sleep.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And the word is lack of

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
sleep. And I can't think of

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
anything currently, so I'll just say this.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
If you happen to have a PSN account with some

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
spare money on it, please

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
at symbol, at least consider donating.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
And I just think

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
that because everything else is so flawlessly

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
done and the grammar is so awesome.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
You can see the tiredness

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
coming through. I can see the tiredness.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
And I'm like, I do that same crap when

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I'm tired. So I was like,

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
okay, but some of them made me laugh.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I like good'em.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Good'em. Good'em. I'm gonna use that

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
word good'em. Don't know what it means,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
but it's good'em. All good'em.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Mm-mm, good'em.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Crunchy- crunchy-um. Crunch'ems.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
There should be a serial called good'em.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Okay, last email.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I'm- Nooooo.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
AHHHHHHH

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
AHHH

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Rob.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Apparently the last email was from the Tasmanian devil.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Rob. Rob. Rob what? Rob what?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Rob. Rob. What?

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
AHHHHHH

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
AHHH

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Dinoboat fire.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
No.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I'm writing about two things.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
One, Test Drive Unlimited 2

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
has finally patched

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
and now does multiplayer events. If you put

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
it down because of the locked out bugs,

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
you can play it again. They serve

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
this up by installing the enticing

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
memory- sorry, the enticing

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
update named mandatory 1.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Two,

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
why hasn't us lately been

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
talking about how great the iOS devices

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
play games being DS killers

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
or the death of the consoles? That is

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
total bullshit. The iOS touch

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
screen is only better for certain types

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
of games. Nintendo's 3DS is

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
poised to sell like hotcakes and I believe it will.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
As for consoles, as long as

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
they are configuration

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
controlled, they will always be popular.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
I just believe that it's Apple,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Apple's fanboys, and Sony that are trying to

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
cast doubt on Nintendo's business.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I agree.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Yes. And I think I've said that on the show before

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
is that the Apple stuff,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
the device itself,

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
not all games work on it.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
And a lot of the ports, they show

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
being bad ports.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
But some of the original stuff works out okay, like that

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
re-rave game we were talking about earlier. I mean, that was

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
designed for a touch screen. It works.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And it works pretty good. I'm sorry,

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
pretty good-um. Alright.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Pretty well, actually. Any other

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
emails tonight? Pretty well. Well-um.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Well-um.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
No, that's it, Rob. Alright,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
mailbag at orangelaundry.com

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
if you want to send us an email to possibly

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
maybe read on

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
next week's show. Maybe.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
But for now, some angst

01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:10.000
in the segment we call FUs of the Week.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Um.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
FU.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
This is sort of an FU to jury

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
duty. I mean, I know it's my civic

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
duty and actually I kind of want to be on a

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
case, but right now

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
I don't have to go in tomorrow, so I'm very happy.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
You should reschedule yours

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
for May 9th, because that's the night device.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Okay.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Well, I actually am going to have to reschedule

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
mine for after school because I can't have anything.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
And here's my FU.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
FU to the damn light cycle

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
that I'm having to model

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
in Maya.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I've gotten the tail of it done

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
finally, but I'm

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
having a hell of a time with a curve.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I can't

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
get Maya installed on my computer, so

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
it's pissing me off.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
And I don't really feel like going to hang

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
out at the Mac Lab all day using the Mac Lab

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
to try to get it to work.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
So Maya can bite my butt.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Yeah.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I'm probably

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
gonna not get an A in this class.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
I kind of don't care. I just

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
want to pass it.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Because guess who's graduating this semester.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
That would be me!

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Okay, I'm done.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I'm just reminded of a scene with some

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
strangers with candy. I got a D!

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
You know what?

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
What?

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I have not gotten a D at all.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
What about an F?

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
The only reason I got an F

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
is because I dropped the class and they didn't

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
register me on the books that I dropped it.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
F for fantastic work.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
F for

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
fuck this place!

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Um...

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I would say probably F you to

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
um...

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
a few colds

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
and having

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
my son have a cold

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
because he's really cranky. And F you

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
the tape gun that attacked my finger

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
earlier this week. I now have

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I have multiple cuts on my finger.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Did it jump up and bite you?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Something like that. I have

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
one, two, three. That looks painful. My god.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
That wasn't that painful. But yeah, there's

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
like five. Imagine if you

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
cut yourself with

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
not necessarily a piece of paper but like

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
maybe like a knife

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
just like a small cut

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
but five of those

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
really close together. That's basically

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
the tape gun for you. And it did that

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
on two fingers.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
It hurt for a little bit but no more than that paper

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
cut. It looked really bad though.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
That was fun.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
That's it.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
My F you goes to Loki

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
for bringing up my ex on the program.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
On live internet radio. Thank you Loki.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
But really though

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
my F you goes to

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
tacos because they are amazing and

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
addicting and I really want one right now.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Like just a taco sounds great.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Just saying.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
You know Rob, we had pesto chicken

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
you could have some. That's alright.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
I'm craving the really fatty Jim Boy's ground beef

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
tacos. Parmesan cheese

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
on the crust. Delicious.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Alright.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Moving on with some more news and then

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
the Skype line at 1877 game OLR.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
But not yet. We have some more news stories

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
real quick. Loki. Yes.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
And you know I don't know this

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
is kind of

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
interesting.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
But you know

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
this kind of ties in with announcements of announcements.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
But there is a rumor

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
right now that there's I guess

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
an Hitman ARG

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
that's going on right now.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That's leading up

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
to the announcement of a new Hitman game

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
at E3.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
That series is still around?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Yes it's apparently still around.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
I guess it's

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
right now they're saying

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
that

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I'm trying to see where it's coming from.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
It started with an ad

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
from Faircount Media Group

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
in a catalog at Sundance Film Festival

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
depicting a box of

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
the

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Hitman series brand donuts

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
with a barcode ending in 47.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And then it says I guess

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
when a Hitman forum user tracked down

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
the agency responsible for the ad

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
and emailed them he received a

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
response from an account saying

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
you're on the right track.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And then they gave him a new image showing a pair

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
of black gloves that appears

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
to be a game script

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
and another barcode ending in 47

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
and some other random numbers and blah blah blah blah blah.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Whatever. Okay so it's a

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
stupid ARG leading up to

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
the announcement of Hitman.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Great.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Oldest have to wait until E3.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Oh surprise.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I love announcements about announcements.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
My favorite thing in the gaming industry.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
In seven days

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
we will be announcing

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
an announcement about a game coming out in 14 months.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
You don't

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
make it so damn obvious

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
what it's going to be.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
You have to make it completely

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
weird and off the wall.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And then people are like oh.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
There will be a trailer announcing

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
this announcement.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Moving on. One other quick story

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
for you guys. It has to do with the game

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Doodle Jump. Have you ever heard of Doodle Jump?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Dan plays Doodle Jump all the time.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
I have never heard of this game but apparently

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
it sold 10 million copies

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
between iPhone and Android.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
What is Doodle Jump then DarkSira?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
You'd have that little dude

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
on the picture. It's like

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
you just turn it and he jumps from platform

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
to platform and you just have to keep him going forward.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Oh okay so you don't actually doodle in the game.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
I don't think so. Interesting. I haven't played it.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I've just seen Dan play it. Well they've sold 10 million

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
copies. I think you can

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
make your own characters by doodling.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
And funny enough this is the perfect

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
kind of last story for tonight to kind of go

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
with that story that came up earlier about how

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Zynga is like we don't want to do our game on

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Xbox because Xbox is too

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
small. Well what's the announcement?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Yep Doodle Jump is going to be coming out for

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Xbox 360.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Lima

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Skye who is the creative

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
person behind the game

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Doodle Jump said that

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
they reached 10 million of their milestone.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
They've also said that they are going to

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
be bringing the game to Xbox Live

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Arcade and the Kinect controller

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
for Microsoft. They

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
also want to release a multiplayer update

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
to the iPhone version. They want to do an

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
iPad version and of course

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
merchandise, t-shirts, stickers,

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
buttons, yay!

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Can't wait.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
So even though some people

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
want to hate on Xbox 360 because

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
it's too small, some

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
people think it might be a good

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
place for their game. At least the Doodle Jump

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
people think so.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So that's it for the news tonight. Let's

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
go to the Skype line. We're going to open up the phone

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
lines right now. 1-877-GAMELR

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
or our username on Skype is

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
In the meantime while we wait for some calls

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
maybe Loki has a last minute story or five.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Yeah, actually I do

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
and let's see

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
this was kind of cool. I saw this earlier today.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We talk a lot

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
about Kinect hacks and stuff like that

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
but this one's a little different.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
It's a Kinect hack working on a PS3

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
and basically

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
it's somebody using the Kinect

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
to play Killzone 3

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and it's

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
quite a workaround.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Apparently it allows

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
you also, I guess, to navigate the cross media bar

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
and

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
then

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I'm assuming

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
if it's tied

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
in with some sort of

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
hack, you probably

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
have to have a custom firmware or something like that

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
in order to get it to work. In fact, yeah, it looks

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
like here

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
oh wow, there's lots of stuff here.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Hold that thought.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
This is DJ Blaziken.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
DJ Blaziken.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Not much other than

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I think it was last week or something

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Parasite Eve came out for PlayStation Network

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
and I finally picked it up.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
It did. I saw that on the list when I was going to get the

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Mortal Kombat demo. I saw that scrolling by

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
and I was like, oh shit, yeah, I heard that that was

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
coming out. So, what'd you think?

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I thought it was actually pretty

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
darn well. It works a little

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
bit awkward and really blocky

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
on my 20 inch

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
TV and 1080p, but

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
looks really good though on the

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
PSP Go.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And this is a little

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
thing for all the listeners who might have the

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
PSP Go that probably didn't know this

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
or ever figured it out.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
You can actually sync your PlayStation

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
3 controller to it

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
via the Bluetooth

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
and makes it a little bit

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
easier to play

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
if

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
you're at a death or something

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
and you just don't like the

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
whole control scheme of that.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
But, oh my god.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I mean

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
for years I just saw the trailer

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
and

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
that blew my mind.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
It still blows my mind

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
now, looking at the visuals

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
even though now we're in the HD age

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
it still just goes

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
to show

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Square

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
puts a lot of effort into just maxing

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
out the potential of whatever system

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
they're working on. Everything from

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
the original NES

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
now. I think we've seen it.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
It's max.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
The thing about Parasite Eve, they did make a second

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
game, but they never really made a third.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
I do know there's third birthday, but

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
that was years later obviously.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Do you think

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
it's best that some games don't get

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
sequels? Or do you think that

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
really good games deserve sequels?

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I think really good games

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
especially like this, I don't know how much

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
notoriety it got, but

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
it seems like a game

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
for a potential of sequels.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
I remember it

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
being a pretty big deal back in the day because

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
it was one of the first Square games to come out after

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Final Fantasy VII from what I remember.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Now granted my memory's a little fuzzy because

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I'm really fucking old, but it's something like that.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Yeah, I saw one of those PlayStation

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
magazine demo discs

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
and, oh my

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
god, even though at the time

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
my mom wouldn't let me play rated M games back then

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
and two, I just didn't have

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
the cash to get it.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So, and now that

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I am of age and

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
have the cash, I was just like,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
heck, I'll get this.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
That's right. I'm mature now.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I'm gonna play all the mature rated games I want.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
And, you know what, it's

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I don't know what, I

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
gotta praise Square because

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
we have probably the best

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I mean, I may sound like a little bit

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
of a Square fanboy, but

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
who hasn't been

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
ever.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
They always just seem to come out with

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
games with a really great story arc

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
that connects you with the characters

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
and makes you feel like

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
an emotional

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
attachment to them almost didn't.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
It's just like,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
whoa.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Going to our chat

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I will admit,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
if this has ever happened to any of you guys,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
that a game ending ever made you cry,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
it would've had to

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
been the first Kingdom Hearts

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
ending when

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Kyrie and Source split apart

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
on two different lands. OMG spoilers.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I could never beat

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Kingdom Hearts.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
It was hard.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
It was hard, but

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
worth the grind. Yeah, yeah, that's true.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
If you reached the ending,

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
it was a pretty sad ending.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
It just brought tears to my

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
eyes. I was like, no!

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Go back!

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
It's okay, try to keep your emotions in check

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
on the show, buddy. Have you played

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
through Parasite Eve yet?

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I've gotten up

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
to probably the first

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
boss battle so far,

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
and I'm just getting my ass

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
hated to be like

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
that, and so I'm trying to look at

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
walkthroughs and possible online

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
strategy guides to figure out

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
any ways to beat it.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
The good news is with those older games,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
there's a ton of them out there, so that's a good thing.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Yeah, which there's a lot more

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
help with it.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I'm just trying to figure out,

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
because I have the PS3 Slim right now,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
basically,

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
would it be

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
worse...

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I don't know if any of us remember

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Blingcast for the Dreamcast.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I have them all.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Okay,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
basically, what would you think,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
because with the PlayStation Move controllers

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
being thrown in the way of Wii remotes,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
if with the jailbroken

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
PS3, someone comes out with a Wii

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
emulator that does HD

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
support for the PS3

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Wii games?

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
It would be difficult because

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
remember, emulators take a lot more horsepower

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
to run than the actual consoles

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
themselves, so even right

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
now running a Nintendo 64

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
emulator on a PS3, while

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
possible,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
that's pretty much maxing out

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
the resources right now.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
The PlayStation 3 has to emulate the fuckin' PS2

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
first, and I'm not talking about the

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
old school first generation consoles,

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
because they had the extra chip, which is why they were so

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
expensive, but I find it very

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
odd that we still have seen nothing about

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
PlayStation 2 emulation on PlayStation 3

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
outside of that very, very first

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
generation of consoles.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Maybe it wasn't a firmware patch

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
that we just never really figured

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
No, you would have

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
trumpets and fanfare and

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
confetti everywhere if that were to happen, and honestly,

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
I wouldn't expect it to be as easy

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
as putting your discs in. I think those sick

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
bastards will make you pay for the games

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
all over again. But I

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
can hope not. I sure hope not.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I might just get a PlayStation

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
2 again if that, if it doesn't

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
work. Just so

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I can have BeatMania

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
with most of the Beemani

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
titles, really, because

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I mean, I have the Rock Band keyboard, and it's

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
making me miss Keyboard Mania, because that was

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
at my arcade.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
They traded

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
they got rid of it

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I don't know why, that along with pop and music

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
they used to have that.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
They had just got all the Beemani games here

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
at Family Fun Center, but

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
they traded them all in for random

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
stuff, and only

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
once we have wrapped the Link's

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Para. Rest in peace

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
the arcades I remember. Alright, Blazekin

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I gotta let you go so we can get our calls.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Arcade Infinity RIP

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
That was just sad watching the

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
video. Alright, we're gonna go Para40 right now.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Alright, Blazekin I gotta let you go to get

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
more calls. Have a good one buddy.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Alright, peace out. Bye.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Alright.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
1877 GameOLR

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Anything else low-key while we're waiting for

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
another call?

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Um

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I don't really have too

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
much. I was gonna talk, there was some

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
other developments with the

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
whole Playstation

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
hacking stuff

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
and the whole court case, everything. I believe

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
they, was it the

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
judge okayed Sony to get the

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
basically

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
people that have

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
donated money from California

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
into

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
the GeoHot thing. They've

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
gotten access to those records

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
and then um also

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
they're trying to find

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
a software development

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
kit manual

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
on his computer because

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
in the manual it has like

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
if you need help support and you're in the

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
US territories call this number because he's

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
basically saying that he was unaware that

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Sony was in California or something like

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
that and they're trying to find a way to link it to him

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
that he knew that they're in California

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
to which I say, who the fuck

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
reads the manual for something like that

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
and I don't think it's

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
actually on his system. I think he used

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
open um

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
open source stuff to create

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
his hacks so

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
it may be a

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
stretch but it seems like they're really trying to

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
grab at straws here. Alright we got

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
another call coming in so let's go to it. Hi you're on

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Hey how's it going? This is SSJ100 Matt. Hello

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
SSJ100 Matt. What's going on buddy?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Hello hello

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Doing good. I just wanted to call

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
and get my late PAX East report.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
You're late. PAX East was

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
so last week. Are you

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
calling in to talk about PAX East 2012?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
The internet line looks like 100 years.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Alright no I'm kidding. What's up? Obviously

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
you're probably on the way home or something so we'll

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
give it a buy. Did you have a good time?

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Yeah I definitely had a good time. You know what

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I liked it a lot more than

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
last year's. Oh of course because

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
I wasn't there. Yeah well

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Hey don't agree with that asshole.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I'm just kidding.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
So what was better

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
about it than last year?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
You know what? It was the bigger

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
conventions that really made a difference

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and I think

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
a lot more people were able to work with

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
the larger space.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Tabletop gaming was

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
big.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I mean

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
the spacing of the

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
boots were good. People weren't hidden

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
behind other boots.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
You know you're able to see everyone

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
so everyone got plenty

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
of traffic I think and

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
there were a lot more

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
there was a lot more

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
newer stuff there I guess.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
They got to play on the 3DS. They got to play

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Duke Nukem Forever

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
and

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
the one game that I really liked

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Child of Eden

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Oh yeah the

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
spiritual successor of sorts to Res

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
sure. Yeah and

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
you know what I think you guys

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
will certainly enjoy it. I'm actually considering

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
a Kinect because of that game.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
How does it work? Is it really

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
like Res but you use your hands

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
to kind of highlight things? Is that kind of what the deal is?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
It's pretty much that way

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
and you know what it's weird because

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
there's two different ways of shooting.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Use your left hand to shoot

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
to highlight over and then push forward

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
to shoot the missiles.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
And then you can use your right hand

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
to shoot the gun regularly.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Interesting.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
So you switch off

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
during the gameplay which is really interesting.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And it's really interesting that it's able to

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
capture that

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
with limited problems but

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
but you know the other thing I really liked

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
at PAX East was

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
the classic arcade run.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
They had a lot more stuff

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I'm sure you remember last year

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
it was kind of set up like Flynn's

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
arcade where you had Journey music playing

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
and

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
and

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
last year I remember

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
last year I remember it was just a room full of

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
consoles and you could kind of check out whatever game you wanted to

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
play and do it all that way

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
but they kind of took it, kicked it up a notch

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
this year with the bigger space.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Well yeah well I'll say that but I'm also

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
talking about the arcade room where they had

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
the arcade machines all set up.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Oh yeah, the one that was next door to the console room.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Yes, yes I remember.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Yeah.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
You know they had a lot more

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I think they doubled the amount of arcade games there.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Oh nice. And they also had a couple of

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
guys from

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Twin Galaxies trying to beat high scores live.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Nice! Oh man

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
that was one of my favorite spots at PAX East.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Yeah.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
So that was really interesting so

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I had a lot of fun there

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
and you know it was kind of to the point because you know

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
not too many people went up there to play stuff.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Everyone was downstairs on the Xbox floor

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
so you know I was able to play

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
all the arcade games I wanted to.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Nice.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Very cool.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
What do you hope that they bring next year to PAX?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
What's an improvement they need to make for next

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
year's PAX?

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I think you know

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
that

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
as much as it was a great

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
plan, the

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
panels themselves weren't, I didn't really

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
find to enjoy.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
The thing was most of the panels

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
were about networking.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
A lot of stuff you would kind of see at GDC.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
I mean I'm not really

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
into getting into the business. I mean I'm just

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
you know a gamer. I don't play.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I don't make games.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
But you know they had a lot of panels like that and you know

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
it's a great idea and I think they should keep that but you know

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
there was you know

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
very limited stuff that

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
about games

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
you know

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
gaming itself I guess. So maybe they need to

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
diversify the panel lineup a little bit more.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Or maybe have more rooms.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
There was only one panel they went to

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
and that was the Xbox Live

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
enforcement.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Oh yeah I saw a clip of that one online. That looked kind of

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
interesting actually. Where they were showing

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
how they could ban

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
people. Like they basically just run through

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
giant columns of names and highlight

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
all the colors. It was interesting.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Yeah. Kind of neat.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Alright well I am hoping I

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
can go out to PAX East next year but

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
you know it's a plane ticket

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
so the cost of gas has to come down but we'll see.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
It's in April

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
next year. During Passover in the west.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Oh no.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
No no. Get this. It starts on

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
my birthday this year. Does it

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
really? Yep. Interesting.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Well no Passover. Well I was going to say

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
it would be funny if PAX East was around that same time

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
next year. No cake.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I'll eat cake on the day before.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Space it out a little more from like

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
You should come to PAX East.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
You know what if I could afford it or if

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
a bunch of people wanted to get together and put

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
the money together and send me a plane

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
ticket. Although

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Japan disaster relief is kind of

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
important right now. More important. I know.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
But I'm saying if you got

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
ten people

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
to put twenty bucks together

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
that's half a plane ticket. Just saying.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
That's just wasted twenty dollars. No I'm kidding.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Alright no but I

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Hopefully things will get better

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
next year financially and economically

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
and we can evaluate that for next year.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
I really want to go to PAX West

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
this year to be honest. I really want to go.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
But I just don't know if I can. We'll see.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Alright. Well enough

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
coulda woulda shoulda wanna

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
hopefully talk. I'm gonna go ahead and let you go

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
when I'm out to get a few more calls but

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
thanks for the report. And Child of Eden I definitely

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
have my eye on that one. I want to play out when it comes out.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Absolutely. Alright. Take care

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
buddy. Take it easy guys. Alright later.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
while we wait for some more calls.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Loki anything else?

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Um

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Not really. I don't know.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I don't remember if we talked

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
too much about Angry Birds and

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
how much they've sold.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Freaking tweet! Argh! Angry Birds.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
That's my impression. I don't understand the

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Angry Birds obsession. I don't either.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
The game's alright.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
It's okay but I mean it's

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
there's more fun games out there.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I think it's really the price point

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
that sold so many copies of that.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I don't understand the whole movie franchising thing.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I don't understand the

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
just the whole obsession with it.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
People are dumb.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
That's what I've really come to understand is

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
this whole new casual gaming

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
market out there. Your moms and

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
you know other

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
relatives or whatever they're playing these casual

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
games. Oh no they're hardcore now.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Oh I'm sorry. They're hardcore

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
according to Zynga. Zynga you're stupid.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
They're not hardcore

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
and I'm sorry I think that they're kind of

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
they're not dumb

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
necessarily but their

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
expectations are a lot lower

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
compared to everybody else. I don't know.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Whatever.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Alright sorry I didn't mean to have

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
dead air there but I wanted to remind the folks in chat

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
because there's sometimes a bit of a delay.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Last call for Skype call is 1-877-GAMO-LR

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
or our username on Skype is orangeontradios

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
so folks in chat want us to go to DragonCon

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
in Atlanta. I totally

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
totally totally want to go to that.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
See I don't know if there'd be enough for me

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
there. I mean I would go to hang with

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
people and that would really

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
be it for me. It was kind of like

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
when I went to that anime con in Chicago

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
the AsenCon that I did a little panel at.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
I want to get an Asen too. I had a good

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
time hanging with people

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
but the con itself was

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
just kind of like woop over my head. We need to see about getting in for

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Fanime. I mean we need to talk to our people.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Yeah. Alright we got another call coming

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
up so let's take it. Hi you're on Orangeontradios. Who's this?

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Hi this is

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Spazenator. Hey buddy how you doing Spazenator?

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Pretty good you.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Two quick

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
items.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
One question and one comment.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
The comment first

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
sorry about the typos and all that

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
in my email. I'm just

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
giving a hard time. She just gives everybody shit

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
don't worry about it. I give people I like a hard time.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
It's called love.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Yeah I know.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Now

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
as far as my question

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
now seeing that Microsoft

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
is basically doing away with the

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Zune

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
now are they going to

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
ax the video marketplace

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
as well on Xbox Live

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
or is that going to stick around?

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
That was around before the Zune.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
When did the Zune come out? The Zune came out about a year

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
after Xbox was out and I seem to recall that

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
video marketplace was going pretty early

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
so no I mean if they can still

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
sell movies on there they're going to do it.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Even though the Zune's

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
going away don't forget they still have the Windows

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
mobile phones and I think that's really kind of where they're

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
focusing. I mean think about it.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
A lot of the marketplace

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
for the iOS

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
is centered around the iPhone.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I mean granted you have your

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
iPads and you have your iPod

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
touches still but I think the

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
iPhone claims a pretty fair share

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
of that market so I think

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
the Zune fading out is more

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Microsoft kind of aligning itself.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Instead of doing a Zune phone

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
now they have this Windows 7 phone or whatever it is.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
So no you're not

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
going to see the movie stuff go away.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
God how could you? Especially with like

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Netflix,

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Hulu they've announced for the end of the year

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
and all this other stuff.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Yeah it's only going to be

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
more.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Yeah I was just

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
kind of curious because now that

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I got a computer and I use

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
the Zune marketplace

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
on my computer I'm just going to use

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
a whole lot more now.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
You'll probably see it get

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
rebranded as like you know

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
the Windows Mobile or

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
it'll get rebranded. They'll probably

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
walk away from that Zune name.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
But it'll still be there.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Oh alright.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Thanks for taking my call.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Definitely appreciate it. No problem buddy.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Have a good one.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Later.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Wow that was a neat call. Hey I got a question

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
and he answered it and he's like okay bye.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
I like that.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Alright so since that call was so fast we'll go ahead and do

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
one more call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Hi guys.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Can you guys hear me? We can. Who's this?

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Hi it's DDR Dollar Bill.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Hey DDR Dollar Bill. How you doing?

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Hey doing alright man.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Just figured I just want to make it quick

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
because I don't want to waste you know

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
take too long. Just want to give my

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
presence on PAX East. Hey you're late.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
No that's alright. You were driving in the car

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
last week right? Yes I was.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Okay well you didn't get to talk because you were probably driving

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
so what did you think of PAX East?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
I enjoyed

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
it heavily.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
My favorite part was

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
not exactly was something that not many

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
people really understood.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
It wasn't really the games. It wasn't really

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
the panels.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
It was the actual fact that I

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
actually got to interview some of the developers.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Oh.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
So just being close and getting

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
to interact with people that are usually

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
behind closed doors at trade shows.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Exactly.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Okay.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Who were some of the developers you got to talk to?

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I got to talk with one guy from Microsoft

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
who was developing

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
the upcoming Firepaw Wrestling release

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I was

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
really interested because

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Firepaw Wrestling, I don't know how many

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
people know this but it's like a really old

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
school wrestling game that

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
was hailed heavily because you know.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I've actually got a couple of the

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Firepaw Wrestling games.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
What's that? I've never heard of it.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
We've got the Dreamcast one that had the Virtua Fighter characters

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
in it.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Oh. You mean the All Japan

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
featuring Virtua.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
They had a wolf in it. Yeah.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Yeah and the Giant Gram series.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Yeah but I think we've got one of the

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Firepaw.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I think the Dreamcast

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
yeah D it's called.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Yeah.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
This one actually uses your avatars

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
as wrestlers.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Oh that's pretty sweet.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Oh yeah and from what I was told

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
you actually have to develop

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
the moves from the beginning.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
So you start off at level 1

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
and you basically keep fighting and the more levels you get

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
the more moves you get.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
And the moves

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
from what I've seen so far they seem kind of

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
more arcade-ish

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
not so much like the current

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
wrestling games like SmackDown vs. Ball

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
and all that.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
But I think if

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
it works well I think it would actually be a nice hit.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Especially since it's used to your avatars

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
and whatnot.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
So you liked

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
getting close to the developers and it's funny

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
because on a previous call SJ100Matt was talking

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
about the panels were a little

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
much on the side of how to get into the

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
business. Did you find

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
that same thing to be true or did you kind of like

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
that?

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I found that

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
to be the same thing and to be quite honest

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I actually liked it because

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
it actually showed me

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
a side of gaming I've never really

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
explored. Like the developing

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
side. You just discovered

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
a whole new side of yourself you never knew was

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
there before.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Oh yeah

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
considering how much video I was doing, yeah.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Nice.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
You know I remember when I went to PAX the first year

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
PAX Prime one of the games they were showing was Warhammer

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
and it was pretty cool. The Warhammer Online

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
one, the WoW killer that

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
didn't really end up killing WoW. But it was

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
cool to be able to kind of like as one of the guys

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
I was playing the game and he just came up and was talking to me about it

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
it was really cool. Like I

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
like that when folks will just kind of walk up

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
and talk to you about the product. You know E3 is a lot

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
of that too. Unfortunately

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
a lot of the big boosts will kind of

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
turn their nose up at you but the

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
littler companies, man they

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
they'll practically drag you into their

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
boosts to talk about whatever it is they're putting out so

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I always kind of like that, getting to talk to folks

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
just about what they really love

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
doing. A lot of people

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
a lot of people that are really into the game

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
industry really love what they're doing. It's pretty cool.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
I had two more interviews like that

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
I had one with the one developer

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
from Lord of the Rings

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
the MMORPG

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Yeah which

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I'm actually going to probably take a shot at it

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
one day since it's free

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
and another one which

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I actually might pay for because

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
it was really interesting was like

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I'm going to get the name wrong

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
but it's called iRacing

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
it was like a racing simulator type

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
kind of like Gran Turismo for the PC

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
and you

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
had pretty much you had to play against

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
real players not computer

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
AI

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
and I was actually sitting down

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
with the driving wheel with the voice feedback

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
and everything

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
after about maybe 10 minutes of driving

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
and I had to stop because I wanted

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
to do other things

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
I actually felt my body going

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
forward like the whole inertia

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Oh wow

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Yeah I was like wow

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
I was like

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
slowly walking away like

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
That sounds like my first time with a 3DS

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
but

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
I had to turn that 3DS off I couldn't see

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I was

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
half blind when I tried it

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
it was just too much headache

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
It was interesting to hear different people's reactions

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
I'm so curious to see what's going to happen when that thing comes out

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
for the public

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I know like Best Buy already has a demo unit out

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Oh yeah I heard a lot of places are getting

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
the demo units so they're pretty easy to

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
get your hands on now I mean they're out Sunday

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
this is not something that's coming out like 6 months from now

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
it's out like soon so

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Yeah I'll probably pick it up later

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
but one last thing though about 3D

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
real quick

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I also saw the Nvidia 3D cards

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
and

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
for some reason 3DS

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
and most 3D TVs

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I can't really use the 3D because it makes me dizzy

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Right

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
But when I was trying out Warcraft

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
in 3D

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
on 3 screens

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
no problems

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
whatsoever

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I can only imagine what that must be like

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
that must be insane that's too much wow

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
did I really say that?

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
that's too much wow

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Oh Rob that's not such a thing

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
that's why I said it

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
that I've hosted this show with for 9 years

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
that's why I said it Rob

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
it's crazy it's called irony

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
it's crazy

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
I just like the 3D it's like wow I can actually see it

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
the first sign of the end of the world coming

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
in 2012 was when Dark Sakura

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
admitted to liking Warcraft that was like the first

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
sign alright anyhow

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
DDR.com I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
but thanks so much for your call buddy

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
and glad to hear you had fun at PAX East

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
see you next year later I hope

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I hope

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I really would like to do PAX West this year

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I'm hoping I can save the money fast enough cause Seattle's not that far

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
that's the good news I could drive

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
to Seattle I mean

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
it would be a pain in the ass but I could do it

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Dark Sakura's pretty much driven to Seattle

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
I mean granted the town she

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
goes to is in a different corner of Washington

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
but it's about the same length when all

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
said and done right? well it's

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
it was like a 17 hour drive to get to Prosser

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
so I would imagine tack

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
on another 4 to that to get to Seattle?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
no because you can get to Portland in

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
10 and Seattle's another

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
3 to 4 from Portland but that's

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
just a straight shot up 5 so

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
to get to where you're going you have to go through more

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
we went I think in the 93 yeah

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
you gotta go through weird no Seattle's

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
just a straight shot up 5

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
but see my ride's

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
quite a bit longer and we actually

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
didn't go through that part of Oregon we

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
stopped in like Bend you know what

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Dark Sakura we should rent I already

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
know Loki's not going to come because the baby you

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
and I should rent a van

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
we're doing it go up to Pat

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
I can't promise you money money money

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I know I need money

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
alright we'll see more to

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
develop in the future let me just do one

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
more check with Loki on any last minute stories

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
and then we're going to wrap up the show nah

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
you just want to

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
get out of here and play more Motorstorm

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
yeah I won't

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
get to play more Motorstorm at home

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
I could I mean

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
it's just you know a TV and stuff

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
yeah alright

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
well we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
but first we have to go around and get

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
everybody's final thoughts

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Loki well I guess we'll start with you tonight

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
you have a final thought for listeners I will be

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
playing lots of Motorstorm at work though that's

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
for sure it's such an awesome

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
game and

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Dark Sakura your final thought tonight

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
we

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
have Girl Scout cookies and I am going

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
to be wonderful and not eat one

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
my final

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
thought is I will happily eat that Girl Scout

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
cookie on your behalf but what

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
I really want is a taco a taco

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Girl Scout cookie
