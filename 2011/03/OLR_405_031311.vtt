Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's the host?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 13th, 2011

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Microsoft shatters sales records

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
EA bans a player from Dragon Age 2 unintentionally

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And despite what's happened to Guitar Hero, could Dance Hero be a reality?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
www.AllGames.com

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Not here tonight, sadly

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
She is out of town, don't feel too bad for her though

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
She's on her way to Disneyland

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So, you know, how can you feel sorry for her when she's going to the happiest freaking place on earth

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
And we're stuck here doing the show in her place

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh well

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Anyhow, so she might be joining us a little later for a call, we'll see

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
But joining us here, as always, say hello at least to tech master, Loki is here

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes I am

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes, how you doing, Loki?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm doing great

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Awesome, good to hear it

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Everything going well with the baby and all that good stuff?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Yes

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Good, good

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, and joining us tonight, since unfortunately Dark Sakura is not here

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
We do have a third host sitting in the studio with us

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
And he hasn't been on the show in quite some time

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
But say hello everybody to Matt2

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Well hello Rob number one

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
How are you doing Matt2?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm doing well yourself

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm pretty good, I feel like we just had this conversation

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
It seems like deja vu, but you know, we're not in the matrix or anything so it can't be

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, for the podcast listeners, this is take two of the live show because we had a little screw up

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But just pretend I didn't ask you these questions just five minutes ago

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Anyhow, Matt2 hasn't been here in about two years and five studios ago

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
No, we've had like five studios throughout all of OLR

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You were in the last one that we did

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So it's been a little while

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
But some of the folks that listen to Hoard House, my Warcraft show, might know you as Grandpa Warcraft

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, that's right, I am the Deckard Cain of your show

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yes

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Alright, so what types of video games do you play?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Just tell us, I'll ask you about your gaming weekend a little bit

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
But generally, what types of video games do you like to play? What consoles do you own?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
It's mainly MMOs for the moment and a lot of iOS games

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm playing a lot of games on the iPhone 4 and soon my iPad 2 if it ever gets here

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
But I own a 360 and I'm still debating on whether getting a Kinect

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
But my console history goes way back to Atari 5200 and every NES system

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
And then made the transition to PC games when games like Descent and Duke Nukem 3D were uber back in the day

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
So is that really where you like to game the most, just PC?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
It kind of fell into PC. I got the 360 because of Halo

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I was definitely a fan of the Halo series until recently

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
And other first-person shooters

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, you say that a little stinging like, I did not like a certain Halo game that really ruined it for me

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Is that what's going on?

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, I bought Reach and I beat it on hard, not legendary, within the first few hours

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I went, oh, this is going to be focusing on the multiplayer side, isn't it?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
And sure enough it does

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Which I'm an okay fan of

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But I do like a lot of story

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
And I was really disappointed in how quick the first person went through

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
But, you know, there's other first-person shooters out there, Call of Duty, Gears of War, things like that

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
But for the time being it's 360, debating on the Kinect

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And a lot of Warcraft on the PC and iOS 4 games

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
You do anything else on the PC besides Warcraft?

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Not as of recent, I tried Star Trek Online

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Jamie Summers convinced me to give it a try

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
As a huge, huge, huge Trekkie

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
All your WoW characters are named after Star Trek characters

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
They used to be

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I thought you had one named like, B'Elanna

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And I'm like, I know who that is

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I was the other guy that watched Voyager

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
When I first started Warcraft, all my characters were named after obscure Star Trek characters

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Not Picard and Riker, because that's just too pretentious

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
And those names are taken in five minutes

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, I'm sure they are

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I went Neelix, Kes, B'Elanna, Darmok

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
If you remember the Darmok

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Who liked Kes?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, I never leveled her up

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
She's a rogue sitting there collecting dust, obviously

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
And now they're all Latin names

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Because now I'm Alliance

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And it's much more formal on that side of the...

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Ho ho

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, exactly

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
PC games-wise, Fable, I played a lot of Fable back in the day

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Awesome

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
And stuff like that

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Alright, so it sounds like you've played quite a variety of different things

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I try to

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Do you do the iOS stuff now?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
That's where gaming seems to be going in some ways

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I do

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
At least it's casual

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I confess I downloaded Angry Birds Seasons today

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Because I figured it's appropriate

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
It's St. Patrick's Day on Thursday

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
They play Irish music in the background

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And there's shamrocks everywhere

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And pots of gold if you hit, you get bonus points

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So yeah, that's my new diction

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I did download, reluctantly, or regretfully, Mega Man 2

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
And it doesn't work when you don't have an actual tactile controller

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Don't get me started

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I know, and I listened to your podcast about it and it made sense

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
But I love Mega Man

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
It's a huge, huge favorite series of mine

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So I wanted to get it because I'm a supporter

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And I can't even get through the air stage because I can't

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
When they play the buttons, so

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
Well, they have those little things, like stickers that you can put on your iPad

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Or, you know, iPods or whatever

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
To create tactile controls for the touchpad stuff

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I might invest in that with my iPad 2

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Because little buttons like on my phone and you gotta take them off and put them back on

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I don't know

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
They actually have some pretty sweet ones

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
There's ones that were through, like, ThinkGeek or whatever

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
They had actual, looks like an arcade joystick that plugs on there

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Which is kind of cool

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And then they had some that just kind of stick to the side suction cup wise

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
But apparently they're pretty decent

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I mean, but really they just need to come out with something better

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
So yeah, when it comes to the iPhone 4

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And what my iPhone 4 and iOS games is kind of my main focus right now

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm not on WoW or the PC games

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
They're good bathroom games

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I find the, like, Cut the Rope is a great potty game, actually

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
For cutting the rope?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yes

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
For pinching the loaf?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Wow

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Out on the ice tour coming soon

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Anyhow, speaking of St. Patrick's Day, since you brought up St. Patrick's Day

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You were kind enough

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I like this, when we invite you to the show you do bribe us a little bit

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Well, yeah

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I brought this gigantic beer in a green, like, can thing

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
It is green, I didn't think of that

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's imported from Canadian

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I love Canadian

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I know, yeah, we love Canadian

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
America's hat

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
America's big, liberal, loving hat

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
It's America's suburb

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Anyhow, no, obviously I'm just giving them a hard time

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
But, so I'm gonna drink this beer

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Since you drove tonight, I can drink a beer

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
That's right

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm gonna get drunk in Jamie's house when she's not here

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yay!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
I brought her for Loki

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Then I'm gonna go pass out in the vault

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
I brought her for Loki

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, but I have to drive and I don't like beer, so, sorry

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So, anyway, let's start the celebrating a little early

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
There you go

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh, I was so hoping that would explode in your face

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Hey, that's not nice

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It would ruin his microphone

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It would ruin the microphone and the keyboard

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Now, the audience

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I have to do a third take

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
No, the audience doesn't know is it's not your average, you know, Budweiser 12 ounce can of beer

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
It's 18

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
It's a 40

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
No, it's not a 40

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
It's 18 ounces, I believe, or 20

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
And it's a Pilsner with a mild aftertaste and it's very hoppy

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
What do you think, Rob?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Not bad for beer

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, good

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
But I can drink one of these

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
You know, usually I don't screw around with beer

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You don't?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
No, I'm just like, let's fill the glass with vodka, splash of cranberry, I'm good

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
And a twist of lime

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
But after one of those, Rob, I do get a little tipsy, so I can only imagine what the drive home

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
My driving you home is gonna be like in a couple hours

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Well, look, this will be, I guess you could say in some ways, my gift to the listeners

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You know what, it's been, it's been a crazy week in the world

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
It has been a crazy week in the world and, you know, I realize some people play video games to escape

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Sometimes the crazy things that are going on in the world

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
And I like this show to kind of be like that too

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
That, you know, if we can give you a few lulls tonight to take your mind off of some of the not so lullsy things going on in the world

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Then I think mission accomplished

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Sounds like a plan

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
So

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Share some

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And the type of video games that you've been playing this week

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Since we do always start off the show that way

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
I didn't play much

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I played Grand Theft Auto at work

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
I played Naughty Bear for like a few minutes

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Which the game is really low budget

08:31.000 --> 08:39.000
But it's kind of funny because they have this like British guy who, you know, yells out these, you know, different things like

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
De-fluffication!

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
You know, it's just like, it's so weird

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
It's just a weird, weird game

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
De-fluffication sounds like something you could go to prison for

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I know

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But yeah, it's a weird, really low budget game

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
They're doing a game of the year edition that's coming out in May

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
So if you want to, you know, pick it up later on I guess you could

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
But honestly it's really low budget

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But it's kind of fun, I guess

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Because I mean the whole game feels like a really kiddie game but you're just brutally murdering these teddy bears

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
It's just not bloody enough though, that's the only downside to it

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And then mainly just working on Grand Theft Auto edits at home

09:20.000 --> 09:29.000
And I finally finished, I think, some of the stuff that I got to burn my new discs that we're going to be playing at work now

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Which is incredibly bloody now because I made the blood effects really huge

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But it serves two purposes

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Needs more blood!

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
It serves two purposes. One, people are always saying, well, you know, I swear I hit you with those, you know, the minigun or something like that

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And I'm like, no you didn't

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
Well this way you'll know if you hit somebody because the blood effect is just so huge that you'll see that bullet spray from, you know, pretty far away

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And because it looks fucking awesome

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Because you shoot somebody and it's just hilarious because it's just all this blood everywhere

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Um, I'm trying to think of one else

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Is there ever enough blood for you, Loki?

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's just fun to see what I can do with the game

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
On a completely random note since you're talking about blood and all of this stuff

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
One of these things that I saw this week that, um, I think she needs her own video game

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
You know the rap artist Lil' Kim?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
She has a new album out called Black Friday

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
And I don't know if you've seen the album cover but it's very like Kill Bill with blood splattering everywhere

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
And there's this little decapitated pink wig that's on the ground on the album cover

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
That I think is supposed to symbolize Nicki Minaj and their little feud, I don't know

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
But, um, I'm thinking she should have her own video game

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I don't know, there's something about Lil' Kim

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
No, I don't think so

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
What, you wouldn't play a Lil' Kim video game?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
No, I would not play a Lil' Kim video game

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Why is that?

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Because, I, I'm sorry, she, what, she thinks she's some sort of sexy samurai there?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm sorry, that does not happen

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
She's got big ol' boobies

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, oh, well in that case she has all the requirements to fill, you know, the samurai position

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Big tits, done

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
You're a samurai now

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
If there were a video game called Big Titted Samurai, you would check it out

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
You would at least kind of look, you would pick up the box and look at the back

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I would look at that, but, you know, I'm just saying though, it

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Only goes rated M

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It, it's just, it's stupid

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
It's stupid, it's stupid that artists have feuds

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
No one cares

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Oh no, this artist doesn't like this artist

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh no, who cares, it's just

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Westside rap and East Coast rap

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Oh god, so stupid

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
Yeah, you're all gangsters, oh my god

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, such the feud

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Alright, sorry to derail the conversation

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
But I don't know, when you were talking about Gran Todano and blood splattering everywhere

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I was thinking about that album cover I saw and I was like

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I would play her in a game

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Yes, exactly, I agree with Kitsune

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I would play a Robogatia video game

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I'd play anything from that company because

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Robogatia's really weird

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
As, you know

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And by the way

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Many of the other movies that they put out

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Since I'm very rude and the second take made me derail a little bit

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I forgot to introduce the chat room tonight

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
If you are listening live at All Games Radio on this Sunday, March the 13th

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
You should hop on over to our chat room and join us live

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
And besides, a big-tit samurai game, that's just basically, you know, the last Ninja Gaiden game

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Couldn't they just take, was Dead or Alive 4

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And all those big-titty characters and give them swords

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And they already got the basic code down for that

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That's kind of Soul Calibur

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Or Soul Calibur

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Well, they already kind of did that though

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
With the last Ninja Gaiden game, they had, you know

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Bonus characters from Dead or Alive

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
And from the other, you know, DS, Dragon Sword game

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
And that kind of stuff, but

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Once again, you know, I don't think we should really give

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
A rap star a video game

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Have we not learned from 50 Cent?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Really, I mean, Blood in the Sand was amazing

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I do give you the fact that it is so ridiculous

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
That it is awesome, but

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
I just don't think Lil' Kim has that same appeal

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, rap stars have their own game, isn't it?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Rap star, rap hero

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Which is not a bad game

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
It really isn't

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
A lot of people want to pass it off, it's like

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
Oh, I don't like rap, but if you look at it as a game

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
They invested more in, especially coming from Konami

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Or what, I'm sure somebody else did it and they published it

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
But coming from that kind of that same family

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
If you look at that next to like DDR

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Which has been recycled so many times

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Or the Karaoke Revolution games

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
It's like, wow, they're the only ones that are like

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Really doing something new and exciting as Def Jam rap stars

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
With their community features

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
That's really amazing that they have all that

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And they didn't put in anything else

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Hey, we have this cool dancing game that has camera support

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
That we, you know, people dance in front of a camera

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Could we have community support for that?

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
Nope, sorry, that would be forward thinking, of course

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Or, you know, how about

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Now's the time, seriously, Guitar Freaks, you know, Drummania

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Maybe you give it another go and not make a crappy game this time

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
No, no, let it be, let it be

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Put it out to pasture

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Moo

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Alright

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh, I bet we'll get another Guitar Hero game

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
We'll see

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
They're looking at you like

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
The money's there

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
They're just waiting for, you know

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
They've milked the cow dry

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
They just have to wait for it to melt to come back

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
So you're not saying like we're gonna have a new Guitar Hero game

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Like this year or next year

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Because, no, they announced it's done

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
This year

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
But you think there'll be that renaissance

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
In like three years' time

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
They've announced, they didn't say that they've dissolved the franchise completely

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
They said there's no Guitar Hero, no Tony Hawk game this year

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Okay, alright

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
That's very tinfoil hat of you, but we'll see

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Oh, come on

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
They think money's there

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I mean, we were talking with Bobby beforehand

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, and it's gonna be a story we're gonna be covering later on

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Talking about a trademark that they had

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
A long time ago, I remember with Drum Villain and Dance Hero

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
And everyone was like, oh no

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Here they go, copying DDR

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Well, you know what, I mean, seriously

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
They're just like, okay, what's Homarnax doing that seems profitable

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I would like to see what that whole Guitar Villain idea was all about

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
Unless that was, I always envisioned that that was just to protect someone else from doing it

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
That'd be dumb

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I mean, but anyways

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
They're basically just gonna look at whatever

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Homarnax is doing that's profitable

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Then they're gonna copy it

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I mean, that's...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
What's gonna happen? I mean, seriously

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
If Rockman 3 continues to be profitable

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
I mean, granted the game didn't sell as well as

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You know, maybe 2 did, but

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Once again, they have a lot of download content

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It's not really market

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
You can't really look at the game sales

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
And say, oh, this game, you know, the series is dead

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
It's just, I think their download content is doing really well

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
But, once again though

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
The dance games are doing really well now

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Like Just Dance and Dance Central and stuff like that

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So, of course they're gonna be like

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
We have this completely original idea that we're gonna put out

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
And you're gonna buy it because it's part of the hero franchise

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
You know, our wonderful hero franchise that we support greatly

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
No, we didn't kill off the hero franchise

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
We're bringing it back with dance hero

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
I think Matt's got some angst left over from last week

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
No, it's just...

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
It's just so retarded

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
They're so two-faced

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, the music industry, music genre's dead

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's so dead

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Oh, but here's our dance game

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
It's part of the music genre, right?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
No, it's a different music genre

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
We were talking about the other music genre

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
They'll do whatever, you know, has money behind it

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
If they can make money doing it, they're gonna do it

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Just like there's gonna be another Call of Duty game

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Because it's Call of Duty

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
It makes money

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Somewhere in there we were talking about Loki's gaming week

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And I get the feeling he's done

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
So, Matt, too, do you want to share your gaming week?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
What you've been playing?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm afraid

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
No, my gaming week

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Again, I do play Warcraft semi-regularly

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I'm in class right now

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
So that inhibits some things

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I've got different characters I work on there

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm part of a guild with some IRL friends

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
So that helps pass the time with WoW

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Gaming week, Angry Birds is really addicting

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I'm going through all of them

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Trying to get three stars and everything

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
For me, it's all about the physics

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The math behind it, I get the right angle

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And the right, I don't know

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
You know what, I feel for him

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't want to cut the rope, but I do

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
No, I'm sorry

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I understand the physics part of it

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
And that's kind of cool and stuff

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I promise I only play when I poop

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I do not play when I poop

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Sometimes I play in bed

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I tried to give

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I have played in bed, actually

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I have tried to give Angry Birds

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I gave Angry Birds a try

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
This is one of the games I bought

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Everybody likes it, so I'm going to buy it

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's 99 cents, what the hell

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I didn't play it for the longest time

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I actually played it

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It's okay, but I just

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
I don't see how everybody's so obsessed about this game

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
If it was Scorched Earth

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
There's no discussion

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And that has physics

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
And angle calculation and all that fun stuff

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And tanks

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
See, that's what Angry Birds needs

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
If you played Angry Birds

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And they released an ad

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Every time you killed a pig, it would explode bloody

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Would you then play it?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
No, I wouldn't, because it's a cheap cash-in

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Just like all these holiday add-ons are cheap cash-in

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
What if the pig exploded

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
And then bacon comes out the USB slot

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
On your phone?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Okay, really it's alright

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Keep your protein to yourself

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I forgot to mention it because it wasn't really part of my gaming week

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
But I made bacon ice cream this week

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Eww

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
It's actually breakfast ice cream

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Breakfast ice cream?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, it's because there's waffle cone in there

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
And maple syrup

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Bacon waffles

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Did you cover it in chocolate butter?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
That's something you'd order at IHOP

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Where you can get dessert for breakfast

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Seriously, that French toast that's fucking stuffed with cream cheese

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That is not breakfast

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I had chicken and waffles for breakfast today

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
That's better than bacon-flavored ice cream

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Uh, actually

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Anyways, think about getting chicken and waffles at IHOP

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Don't. It's alright

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But it's not good

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I mean, it's not like

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Mmm, that's really yummy

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm full now

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Somewhere in here was Angry Birds and IOS

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And now we're talking about frying the birds

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
You said bacon! This is all your fault

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You did say bacon

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay, so I did make bacon ice cream

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I think I put too much bacon in it

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And I know how- Nonsense!

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Exactly, nonsense

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
But it's just

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You have to really be in the mood for bacon ice cream

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Because if you're eating it

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's ice cream-y and then all of a sudden salty

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And it's just like

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Huh? Why is there salt in there?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I mean, it's a little strange

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
My wife likes it actually, though

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
She likes the bacon ice cream

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
She is a horrible Jew

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Horrible

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Horrible

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Nah, I'm just kidding. You know I love her

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Anyhow, so yeah, Angry Birds, right?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Yeah, it's a lot of

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
IOS games on my iPhone 4

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And again, as I mentioned, I'm getting an iPad 2

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Hopefully by week's end

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I don't want to wait in lines and get it

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
So I ordered it online

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Once I have that, it'll sync in and play Angry Birds

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And huge, huge, uh

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
What's that? 9.7 inch- Angry Birds HD

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
HD, well, it's not Retina display, unfortunately

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
It's HD because it's in the 9.7 inch

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Diagonal screen, whatever

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Holy crap, that's a game that's really gonna utilize HD graphics

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Hell yeah

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
You see those pigs' beady eyes winking at you

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Aside from that, I

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The pig is saying no

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
To see you know

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The last thing I'm thinking about picking up

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And hopefully you're fourth guest in the chat room at

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
chat.orangeloudradia.com

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Yeah, so you have been listening for a little while

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I think you've been slipping into this role very easily

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I've been thinking about picking up Dragon Age 2

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I had original Dragon Age, I downloaded a lot of the

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
DLC content

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I like the DLC content

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I was disappointed that it was very out of

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
chronological order

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Once you pass the game, you download some DLC

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
It pretty much says, oh, just pretend that you didn't

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
You know, end the game and

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
This is extra stuff

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
But I'm curious about Dragon Age 2

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Getting reviews, I'm hearing mostly good

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But I defer to your chat room if anyone's

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Bought it, I appreciate your opinions

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And I might be picking up that and

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Detoxing from WoW for a bit

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And then going over to my Xbox

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And of course, you know what

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
The best part about any new Dragon

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Age game coming out is of course going to be

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Gay sex scene!

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Yay! Gay sex scene in Dragon

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Age! Hooray!

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
Let's talk you more penis

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Here's what I have a problem with Bioware

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
There's such fucking teases

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
There's no nudity, and there's definitely

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
No sex scenes

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
They just kind of like, jump on the bed

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm looking for this

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
See, look at that, that's tongue right there

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
That was some tongue, some big gay kissing

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Yes, there's

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Woman on woman and man on woman

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Whatever you want, it's all there

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
If we can have boobs in God of War, why can't we have boobs

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
In, you know, Dragon Age, or Mass Effect

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Because it just wouldn't be classy

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Oh, who cares!

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I thought it was classy

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I would rather die than spend a moment

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Not here with you

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Well then fine, they need to consult with Hugh Hefner

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
To make a classy, you know

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Topless woman game, okay

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I mean, seriously

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
I don't understand why they can't do this

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And you know what, they can do full frontal for guys on there

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
They did it in Grand Theft Auto

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
In, you know, the Lost in Damned expansion

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
So, if they can do it classy there

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Then why can't they

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
But the important thing is classy

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Classy, topless women

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I'm trying to think of a classy penis

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
And I don't think there really is one

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Oh, why yes, Guinevere

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
This tea tastes rather lovely

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Yes, I'm quite enjoying

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
This little tea and crumpets that we're having today

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Oh, but I seem to have lost my bra

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Have you seen my bra?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That would be the game that Loki wants to play

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Classy, topless women

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
That sounds very boring

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
They only have swords

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
That would conclude my gaming week because we're moving on to another topic

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
That I think is probably a different podcast

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Right, then

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Moving on, my gaming week

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
A lot of the same old stuff, Warcraft

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You Don't Know Jack and a lot of those fun games

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
But I did play one new game this week that I wanted to talk about

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
And if you've been listening over the past couple of weeks

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
You know I've been very excited about Torchlight

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Torchlight

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Was kind of an indie, it's a startup

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Studio, some of the folks that used to be

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Blizzard are a part of this studio

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
They put together Torchlight

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And it was on Steam a couple of years ago

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And it's been the subject of some of their

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
$10 sales

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I think at one point you might have been able to get the game for $5

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
But in a nutshell, Torchlight

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Is very much inspired by Diablo 2

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
And obviously we've gone through a huge drought

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
There hasn't been a Diablo game in many

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Many years, the last Diablo game was

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
What, 99? 2000?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Yes, there's one coming out

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
But that doesn't help me now

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So Torchlight was really there to fill the void

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
If you like those dungeon crawling games

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Where you kind of get the items

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And socket the items, have your talent trees, all that stuff

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
The one thing it lacked

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Unfortunately, multiplayer

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Multiplayer was lacking in the game

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But it is a $10 game

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
At some point, $20 I think is the most you're going to pay for Torchlight

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I think if you buy it at retail

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Which is still pretty good value considering

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
I think they still charge $30 for Diablo 2

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
In the battle chest all these years later

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
So it's not a bad deal

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Randomly generated dungeons and all that good stuff

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Never the same game twice, woohoo

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
So finally they ported this thing to Xbox Live Arcade

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And they've had to make some changes with the game

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And that kind of had a lot of people nervous

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
Because the dungeon crawly games are usually very reliant on point and click

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
And these style of games I kind of throw all the way back to

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
I don't know if you remember this on the PC

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
A very, very old PC game called Rogue

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Did you ever play Rogue way back in the day?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Diablo's clearly inspired by this game

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
From way back in the day

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And I want to say, isn't NetHack a derivative of that too?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I think, or am I crazy?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I don't know, something I was reading about, I haven't played that one

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I just remember Rogue back in the Commodore 64

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
They're all kind of like this

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
So it was very interesting to kind of see that style of game now on the Xbox

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
Because this isn't really the type of game we see a lot on Xbox I think

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
It's not an action-y game like Tomb Raider

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
It's not an intense role-playing game like Final Fantasy

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
It's kind of somewhere in between

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So it's neat to see something like this on Xbox

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
But they had to change some things

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
There's less pointy and clicking

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
You attack with the X button

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Your menus are totally different now

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Because you don't really have the bag that you have everything in

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
It's just straight up, you have 50 slots and different tabs

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
It's really weird to navigate

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
It's a little overwhelming at first

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And I've got to be honest

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Torchlight's biggest drawback for me on the Xbox 360 is

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
What they had to do to convert it to console I think in some ways

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
The text is very small

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
So if you don't have a big TV

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You might be in a little bit of trouble

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
There's some framerate issues and it's noticeable

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
When I was going through some of the dungeons

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
There's a lot of enemies on the screen at once

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And you're trying to do some attacks

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It just seems like the framerate really drops

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And then suddenly everything's dead which is cool

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
But not the smoothness that I came to expect on the PC

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
And just the weird, having so many buttons

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
To send your pet to town you have to bring up your menu

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
With start, hit the back button to bring up the pet menu

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And then hit the Y button to send him to town

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
There's a lot to it which I understand

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
That's what they have to do to make a PC game work on the Xbox 360

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
With minimal loss

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You don't want the game to lose anything

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
And the good news is it doesn't

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
It's still got that same kind of feel to it

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
But unfortunately these few drawbacks

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Make it really hard for me to recommend on the 360

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
When I know most 360 owners own a PC

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So my point is

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
If you have this game on the PC already

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I think you're good

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Like you really only need this if you insist

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Like I've got to have something to play on the TV

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Or I really want to have this on console

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I want to go for the achievements

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Those are all really good reasons I suppose

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
But I would say if you've never played the game before

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And you're kind of trying to decide

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Do I want to play this?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Go check out the PC demo

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Not the Xbox 360 one

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Because I think the PC demo is a little bit better representative

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Of what Torchlight really is

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So that would be my recommendation

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
But it's not a bad game

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
I just feel like it lost a little something

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
When it came over from the PC

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
The PC version is

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Excuse me, really superior

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
So check that out on the PC

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
If you must, if you don't have a computer

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Good enough or something

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I guess you could always use the Xbox 360 one as a substitute

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
It's not bad

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
It's just not, again, that same level as the PC

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
So that was pretty much my gaming week

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
Not a whole lot in housekeeping I want to talk about right now

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
I want to talk about something after this first story here

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
But I will say, of course, our Twitter

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us on Twitter

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Or you can always add us on Facebook as well

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
A good way to always follow us

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
And we'll see what the latest and greatest is about our show

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Forgot to mention my gaming week

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Since I'm not really playing it yet

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
But it will be tomorrow

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I'm getting a Japanese 3DS

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
So that's coming tomorrow

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Nice, what made you decide to take the plunge and get the Japanese 3DS?

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Because I like everything early

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
Even his ice cream for breakfast

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
I have a problem with needing to have things early

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm getting a Japanese 3DS with Nintendogs

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
And then Ridge Racer

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
Only because Pilotwings wasn't out yet

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Otherwise I would have gotten Pilotwings

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
We have to bring that to the studio next week

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I got to see one a while ago

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
But I want to see what that finished product looks like

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I'm sure Jamie would love to check it out too

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
It would be fun too if they have good import games later on

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
Because sometimes Japan gets stuff before we do

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Like Smash Brothers and stuff

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And I'm still getting a US one when that comes out

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
With Street Fighter 4

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Because you have an addiction

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It's so funny too

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Because just last week you were all

29:34.000 --> 29:37.000
Last week was a really good Loki hatin' on Nintendo show

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
And now he's sitting here going

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, I'm buying 2DS, 3DS's

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
It's just really funny

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Hey, I never said I wasn't buying the 3DS

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
No, I know, I know

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
It just makes you mad that they don't reach their full potential

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Exactly

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
I don't have a problem with Nintendo as far as making hardware and stuff

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I just have a problem with them not

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, like you said, reaching their full potential

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Remaking games, come on

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
These Nintendo 64 ports to the 3DS

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
That's just some cheap shit right there

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
I'm going into our chatroom

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
At chat.oransonshady.com

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Darktoygak says

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Loki is going to make 3D porn on it, no doubt

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
No, I'm not

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Let's see

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah, what's the old adage about new hardware coming out?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Time to penis?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
Is the whole like, how long before somebody tries to put their penis on it?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
Loki bought Nintendogs, he's part of the problem

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
You are part of the problem

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
I am part of the problem

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
But, okay

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Here's why I bought Nintendogs, okay

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
And this is a completely weird reasoning for

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Cats, that's the reason I wanted

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Well, not the cats too

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I have a cat that's already annoying

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
No, the reason I bought Nintendogs plus cats

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Is because I think that shows off the 3D pretty well

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And this is something I'm really going to be kind of showing to my co-workers

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
To kind of say, hey look, check out the thing

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Oh, research purposes

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Yes

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I mean, I

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Yeah, whatever

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Alright, fair enough

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
It was, okay, it was either that or Professor Layton

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Because I can't read Japanese so that's not going to do me any good

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Or there's like some

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Cube puzzle game, no thanks

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
And then the rest of the games are coming out over here anyways

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Once again, it would have been

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
If they had pilot wings, I would have bought pilot wings

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
I will get pilot wings when it comes out in the US

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Alright

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Alright, well we'll be hearing more about the 3DS next week then for sure

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Yes, absolutely

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Awesome

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Alright, well let's get into the news tonight

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And Loki's going to start us off with some news

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And like I mentioned a minute ago

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
A lot of stuff going on in the world

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
And some of it reaching into video games for all of us

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Yeah, of course

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
You may have heard that there were some major earthquakes in Japan

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
And tsunamis and all that fun stuff

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
That caused a lot of damage

31:43.000 --> 31:49.000
And because of that, they're having issues with being able to keep the power up

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
And so they're asking companies to conserve power

31:54.000 --> 31:59.000
And bring back their services once that power has been restored fully

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
So because of that, Square Enix has decided to shut off the servers for Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XI

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
For at least one week

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
And also other companies affected by this as well

32:11.000 --> 32:17.000
Well, Konami, they're shutting off the servers for Metal Gear Online

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
Which, to be honest, until I read that, I forgot that Metal Gear Online even existed

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
So yeah, I'm sure lots of people are playing that

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
So yeah, those are the two companies so far that are included

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
Part of that, who knows what other companies will be having that

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
That's still pretty big though

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
Yeah, because you're talking about two major MMOs, for better or for worse

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I mean, I know we've given Final Fantasy XIV a hard time on the show

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
One major MMO, one major pile of crap

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
But you and I spent many years on Final Fantasy XI and it still certainly has its fans

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
So that's kind of not something we hear a lot in the gaming world

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
Where it's like an MMO literally gets put on hold because of real life

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
And it's just kind of, there's an old adage, especially in Warcraft

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
And I'm sure the other MMOs have this too, is that RL greater than wow or whatever your game of choice is

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
And I think that especially is kind of what's coming into play this week

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
And I can't see how really anyone can complain about this

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
I'm curious if they're going to shut down for that week if they're going to issue credits to all those customers for that week

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Because it's on their bad and their decision to shut it down

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
I think they're going to, I think they're going to do a free month or something like that

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
I think they will, and I think I read somewhere it is confirmed they're going to gift them the month of April

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I think that's awfully generous

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
I honestly, in a situation like this, I really don't think they would necessarily owe them anything

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
I think most people would understand but you would always have that one person

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And I'm sure all of us have probably seen the pictures and the damage that we have

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And definitely take a moment to look at that

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
But I don't, my gut tells me the extensive damage they have

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
One week, them shutting down, I think it's going to be the first of many weeks

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Or rotating weeks off

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
Yeah

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
So just maybe time to take the games offline for a little while

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Or maybe something else you could consider doing is seeing what you can do to help

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
And that was kind of the other thing I wanted to make sure I mentioned at some point tonight

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
Obviously we've all seen what's been going on in Japan

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
And it's just, there are no words

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
There are no words for what is happening and what we're seeing on the television

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
And I just, I couldn't imagine that scale of what a tsunami can do

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
So I really would challenge you, all our listeners

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
We've been doing this show for nine plus years

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Never once have we ever asked you for money

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Tonight I'm going to ask you for money

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
And I'm going to say, you need to buy one less game this month

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Or one less arcade game, Xbox Live arcade game

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Or maybe not pay for an MMO for a month

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
Take the money that you're saving on Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XIV

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
And go to redcross.org

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And please make a donation

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
Everybody should try to do at least ten dollars

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
If all the OLR listeners could donate ten dollars

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
It's still a little bit for what they're really going to need in the big picture

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
But it's a start

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
And just whatever you guys can give would be so appreciated

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
So please consider cutting back on a game this month

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
And giving money to an organization that's going to need it to help a lot of people

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
So redcross.org is where you can go to donate

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And there's many, you can do texts on your phone

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
I know a lot of people get our show on the iTunes store

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
There's a big little link there in the iTunes store

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
It says donate and you can donate and 100% of the proceeds go directly

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
But you know what, why don't you go look at the horse's mouth redcross.org

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
And see what you can do to help

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Because even if you're strapped for cash

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
There's probably a lot of other volunteer types of things you could do to help

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
And that would all go a long way as well

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
So I needed to get that out there

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I know I talked about our show being an escape

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
But there is the reality that there's people that need help

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So alright

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
And this has to do with the Microsoft Kinect

36:11.000 --> 36:16.000
A lot of big news this week about the Kinect and some of the sales figures

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
Some reports coming out there that 10 million Kinect units have been sold

36:23.000 --> 36:29.000
That is from Aaron Greenberg who is one of the executives at Xbox

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Wrote a tweet

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
And apparently this is so fast and so reaching

36:34.000 --> 36:42.000
That Guinness World Records actually went out and said that the Kinect is the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
133,000 plus units each day for the first 60 days

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
That's faster than the iPhone or the iPad

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
That's really surprising to me

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
Because I thought with all this iPad-a-balloo last year and everything

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
I would have thought for sure the iPad sold faster

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
But I guess not

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Congratulations to Microsoft for that

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
But seriously, Guinness, you need to find some different types of records to put in your book

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
Look for some tall people or people that are fat or people that can eat dog food or something like that

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't know, just not consumer electronics

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
Seriously, the gamer edition of the Guinness World Records is just retarded

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
It's just the most popular character

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
It's like ugh

37:27.000 --> 37:35.000
Well look, something else to follow that up with is that Microsoft also apparently had the biggest non-holiday month ever

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
February 2011 they sold over half a million Xbox 360s

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
535,000 to be exact

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The biggest non-holiday month ever

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
27% up over last year

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
That's pretty significant because nothing is really coming out for them

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And it's all this Kinect momentum

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
Because obviously it's these bundles with the Kinect and Kinect adventures

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
And now that people are starting to play them at friends' houses and see them on shows

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
And hear about it in school and so forth

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I think the word is really starting to spread about this

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
And I think that's what's kind of keeping it going

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
So, very interesting

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Not hearing a lot about the move

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
From what I understand though, Sony didn't have a bad month

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
I think Sony sold quite a few units too

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
They're getting closer to Nintendo

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Nintendo's about to slip into third place

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Which is really big news

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
Nintendo is not even going to slip into third place

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
They're in first place

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
I believe they sold more 360s than we used last month, didn't they?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah, last month

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But overall, they're in first place

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
They've got a lot of catching up to do before they're in third place

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
Honestly though, I think

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
With the move, it's kind of funny because

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
From a retail standpoint

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
They're treating it like there's still shortages on the move stuff

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Which makes no sense

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Because there's no demand for the move stuff

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
At all

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And yet, the stuff is hard to get

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
For some reason

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
But, yeah

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
They're doing some stuff with the move now

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
That people are actually interested in

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You'd be surprised, like the SOCOM4

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And Killzone 3 stuff

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
With their stupid move gun

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
That they have

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
People are actually interested in that

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
And it's just

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I guess it seems really stupid

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
But the actual peripherals that they've made for it

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Aren't just like

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
Shells

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Like the Zapper

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
These are actual things that do have

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Integrated buttons and triggers and stuff like that

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
That aren't just

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Ok, I pull this trigger and it

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Pulls a lever that pushes this button

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's not anything like that

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It's actual

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Some special stuff that they're adding to these

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
So it's a little bit better

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
I think to play a first person shooter that way

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But people are interested

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
So that may help

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I am so curious about

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
This year's E3 and where the Kinect goes

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
So, props to Sony though

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
For at least allowing

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
The move to be supported by

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Their big tent pole

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Titles that they're putting out

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Because the Kinect, not really having that

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
You have the Kinect games and that's it

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
You're not going to see Kinect support for Gears of War

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
At least not Gears of War 3

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Maybe some spinoff or something like that

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And Halo

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I'm sure there's going to be some sort of spinoff Halo game

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
But not real

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
We didn't see any Kinect

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Kinect support for

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't even know what the next Microsoft title is

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Because they haven't really announced anything

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Actually, that's funny

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah, there are no first priority

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Microsoft titles right now for a while

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Probably the fourth quarter

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
We're not seeing anything like

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
The question of the Fable or something like that

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
There's no Kinect support for that stuff

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
So, they haven't really

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Embraced it yet, I guess

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I mean, they have their first party Kinect games

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
That they made, but there's no

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Core games that are a part of that

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Again, E3 I think is going to

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Really be telling as to what their

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Strategic direction is for

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Phase 2 of the software

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And possibly integrating that into their core lineup

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
Especially, didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
About the whole Halo remake happening

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
That now the rumor is it could be Kinect

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Halo Kinect or whatever

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Well, I don't think, once again

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I mean, they should have it be optional

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Obviously, and then the other thing

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Is I think they should have a couple different levels

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
That you go with it where

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Not necessarily everything is motion controlled

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
But maybe head tracking, once again

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I think head tracking added to a

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
First person shooter is just no brainer

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
You should be doing this anyways

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
For having that

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Part Kinect enabled, you don't need to be running around

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
With Kinect for everything, just do that

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
It shouldn't be mass arm flailing

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
All over the place, that's what I fear

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
But it might be kind of cool, you have the controller

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Or whatever, and maybe to lob a bomb

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Or something, you would throw your hand up

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Or something, like lob a bomb

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Something very subtle

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Where you're not breaking out of that

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Controller thing, but I don't know

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I just would not want mass arm flail

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Like some Wii games are

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
I can see someone lobbing their controller by accident

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
Like a real grenade, hitting their flat screen TV

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I don't design the games

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
I'm just trying to come up with ideas

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Once again though, head tracking would be

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Head tracking is pretty cool

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You can implement that pretty easily

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
And once again

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It doesn't interfere with playing a game

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
If you don't want to move your head around

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
Fine, then don't

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Or you can just turn that off

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
That kind of support would be awesome

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
There's a ton of first person shooters coming out

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
I mean, come on

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Seriously, you should be able to do that

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
They've got to find a way to keep reinventing

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Or adding to FPS

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
At least for me, the allure

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Has kind of died away, like I mentioned earlier with Halo

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Even Medal of Honor

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And stuff like that

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
It died for me after Quake 2

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm like, they just don't make them

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Actually, I take that back, because Quake 3 I love

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
They don't make them like they used to

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
True, the last PC first person shooter

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I played was actually Jedi Knight 2

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
From what?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
The mid 90s?

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I play lightsaber, that was awesome

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
I only play a lot of first person shooters on

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
Console or PC

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Especially not PC, because I cannot stand keyboard, mouse

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
No, no thanks

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I will take an Xbox 360 controller any day

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
And yeah, I know

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
That's not really good when it comes to

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Playing multiplayer online

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
But I don't play multiplayer online, so it doesn't matter

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
But yeah, the last game I played was

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Crysis

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
With the Xbox 360 controller, it was awesome

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
So I do plan on picking up Crysis 2 when it comes out on consoles

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Screw the PC, I don't want to upgrade my PC again

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
To play fucking Crysis, I already built

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
The PC for that, that's enough

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I do need to upgrade my graphics card

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
So they're old

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
We'll be good thinking about it

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Thinking forward with Kinect

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It's an unknown game that maybe people don't remember

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
PsyOps came out for Xbox while back

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
You gain telekinesis power

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It can move things with your mind

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
It was a puzzle, first person shooter

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Third person, if you readjust the bit of things

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
I can see that having a lot of fun with Kinect

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
You move your arm to move a box out of the way

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Then you go back to your controller and shoot things

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
You could throw a box at enemies

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And knock them around

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That'd be pretty freaking amazing

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
How about an Xbox Live Arcade game that's

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Kinect enabled called Slap-a-Bitch

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And what you would do is

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
You walk around with the controller or whatever

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
And then you can just reach out and slap a bitch

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
It's other people that are on

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
The Kinect

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It's like Halo, but it's slapping

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Well they have a game like that for the Android

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
I believe, OS

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
You could just sneak up behind somebody

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Well they have something like that for the Android OS

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
And it's not as content controlled as

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
The app store for iPhone and Apple

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
It's simpler

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
It's booty smack or booty slap

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
And you actually tap the phone or you slide your finger across

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Your Android device and you

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And you slap a bitch on her ass

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
So we're getting there

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
We're getting there, but we're not there yet for the Kinect

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Once they released that development kit

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
I should say

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Once they released that development kit for the indie marketplace

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
There will be a slap a bitch

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I guarantee it

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Slap a ho, slap a bitch, slap a baby, it'll be all good

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Slap that ass

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
We're so bad

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Alright moving on, how about some more gaming news

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I'm going over to Matt too tonight

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Sure, so keeping with the whole Microsoft

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Company discussion

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
Turns out those codes

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
On the back of your Microsoft Live cards

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Actually have a pattern to them

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
So a group of smart hackers

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Decided to look at those codes

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Take some old Xbox Live points cards

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And Xbox Gold trial codes

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And they figured out an algorithm

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
That actually allows them to

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Anticipate the rest of the strings

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
By doing so they started to exploit

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Microsoft for Microsoft points

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And in doing so, and of course you post

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
These things on forums so everyone can do it

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
They bled Microsoft

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
For an estimated one million dollars worth of points

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Space bucks

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
One million space bucks

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
So of course Microsoft

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Caught on to this and pulled the codes online

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
But as I was reviewing

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Some of the news

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Tossed a question to me, the algorithm

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Is still enforced to the cards on

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Walmart and Target walls

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I'm not understanding

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Because they pull these codes that were posted online

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
But aren't they still sitting on shelves?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Correct, so my thinking

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
My thoughts were when I was reading this

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
That's great you pulled the codes

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
But the existing codes on store shelves are still

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
The same algorithm or maybe a set of algorithms

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Yeah there might be several algorithms

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
And so they must be in their

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
New batch of product for that

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
They've got to be redoing the algorithm

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I wonder if there will be a recall

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Maybe the algorithm, because I'm sure

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
These codes

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Probably not just tell

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
That it's a Microsoft code, but it probably

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Actually tells Microsoft where the card was bought

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I would imagine the GameStop chain

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Probably all has similar digits

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
In the beginning or something like that

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
But whatever algorithm was cracked

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Is probably tied to one particular retail chain

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
And beyond points

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I might sound like an idiot to the folks that did this

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Because I don't profess to know how you crack an algorithm

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
These aren't necessarily the 1600 point cards

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
These are the 160 Microsoft point cards

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
That you get with some games

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Right, the actual point value is 160

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
So we're not talking a lot

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
But they're able to refresh and then

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Regenerate the algorithm and keep going

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And even they were able to find the code

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
For bringing in props to Halo Reach and things like that

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
So instead of digital tchotchkes and SpaceBucks

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
They were able to figure out the codes

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Darktoygak has a really good question

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Don't these things have to be activated?

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Like when you buy the cards at the store

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I always thought once they scan on the barcode

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Then they're active or whatever

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
It's just a piece of cardboard

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
That has a code underneath it

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
That's what makes me wonder

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I can understand

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
They did these 160 point cards

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Those things

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
But if they started doing 1600 point cards

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
There'd be no way for them to track that

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
How would they even be able to figure out

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Which ones are sold and stuff

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm sure those codes link to some type of serial number

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Some type of, not product key

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Some type of way to

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
If Microsoft is smart

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
And we hope that they are

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
They've got to have some type of inventory tracking methodology

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
They generate so many codes

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
To so many locations

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I could swear that you have to activate them at the register

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Before they run

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Because otherwise how easy is it to steal those cards?

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Okay, well actually it wasn't from cards

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
From what I'm looking up here real quick

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
It's actually from a website that was

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Generating these codes

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Kind of like a promotion thing

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
So they figured out that you can go to this website

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Because really you're only supposed to be able to go there once

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
You can go to this website, change part of this URL

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
That's in there

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
And you can see if

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
The code's working or not

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
And then

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Basically

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
You keep

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
The code is located

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
But again the algorithm stays

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And if there are existing cards

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't know

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
I always figure there's a pattern to it

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
But someone found the exploit and they shared it with the community

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
And let them for about a million bucks

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I gotta be honest

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
This news kind of sucks for Microsoft

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
But I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen sooner

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
That's true

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Considering how long those types of cards have been around

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
I'm surprised

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I guess it wasn't the cards

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
To really rip the hole open

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
To get these points

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
But I'm really surprised it didn't happen sooner

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
And I wonder if other gaming companies

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Or consoles like this

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I wonder if they are taking stock

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
In this

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
And how they procure their point cards and stuff

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I'm really wondering what effect this might have

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
On digital distribution down the line

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
I mean granted this is just one little

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Well it's not really little

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
But it's one thing that happened

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
And maybe it wasn't the cards after all

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
But you have to think about

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
What does digital distribution mean to our company

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And you've seen the expansion happening

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Kind of a GameStop where now

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
One of their walls is no longer game

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Boxes but it's those plastic cards

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
For Playstation Network and so forth

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
So you gotta kind of be wondering

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
If people are able to exploit that system

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Is digital download

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
As smart of an idea as we all thought?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Or does it need some time to get more secure?

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Out of a little harder if they were exploiting

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Those Facebook gift cards you can buy in the store

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
For your true SpaceX

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
There's no value in that

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I'm curious if even one of those is sold yet

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
So that's been reported that Microsoft

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
This week they started renting movies on Facebook

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Oh lord

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Yeah that's true

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
That's something else for people to spend their SpaceX on

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Give credit cards over to

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Ironically enough the first movie that they started renting

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Was The Dark Knight right?

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
The Batman movie with Heath Ledger

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And all I could think of in my mind was

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
And here we go

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Maybe that was the joke

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I don't know

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So I will be avoiding that part of Facebook

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I don't want them to have my credit card information

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
That's for damn sure

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
So yeah a million bucks has been bled dry

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
From the coffers of Microsoft

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Quickly in their lesson and have to start changing

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Their strategy on how to

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Deal with codes perhaps

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Be interesting to see the ramifications

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Of this six months from now

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Well they can figure out who uses those codes

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So they're gonna punish them

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
They'll be taken out back and flogged

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Publicly

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Drop the hammer or cut the rope

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Yes they'll be

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Cutting the rope

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Let's move on

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Well as rumored the new firmware for the

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
PlayStation 3 has come out

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
With cloud saves

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
So yes now you can actually

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Save your games

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I was just about to ask, I'm like nah you have to be

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
PlayStation Plus for that right?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
So you can

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Save some games

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Or your game saves online

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
And also apparently

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
According to one of the PlayStation 3 hackers

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It has

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Resecured the PlayStation 3

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
For now

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Cause obviously the

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Keys are still in there but they've just

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Moved them to someplace else

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
And they have another key in place

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
So for now

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
It's been secured but

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It's just a matter of time

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Really you can't

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Even calling it re-secured

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
That just doomed it for failure

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Right there

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Just say nope still broken

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Nothing to see here

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Keep on moving

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
But it's hack proof Loki

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
This new firmware is hacker proof

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Nobody will hack it

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Nothing is hacker proof

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
And no one's bothering to even

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Well here's the thing though

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
The firmware right now because you can

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Spoof it anyway so you can still

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Connect to the PlayStation Network if you really want to

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
But

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Whatever

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Is cloud saving something that interests anyone in this room?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
I do think it's kind of neat

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Because you know like

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
If I go to visit friends like in the bay area

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
You know or something I could

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Connect to the cloud I guess and get my game saves

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Especially for things like

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I own this on the 360

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
So maybe it's a moot point but you don't know Jack

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Like you remember when I was reviewing the game

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I talked about you really want to make sure that save file

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Goes with you otherwise you're going to be recycling games

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Because of the dumb way

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
You have only five episodes at a time

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Able to lock or whatever

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
If you don't take that game save with you you're going to end up

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Recycling games very quickly and that

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
So the cloud save would be very useful for that

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Because I don't always think to copy my save file to a card

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
And so on

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I was going to say thumb drives are fucking cheap

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I mean why would I spend money

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
On PlayStation Plus

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I have two jump drives right here

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Both of these cost me less than ten dollars

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I mean why would I

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And those are eight gigs

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Why would I even waste my time

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I think the cap was 150

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I don't know if it's 150 saves

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Or if it's 150 megabytes

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I can't remember what it was

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
The honest thing I can say is that sometimes you just don't know

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
When you're going to need a game save file

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I have never ever

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Gone to a person's house and go damn

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I really wish I had my game save with me

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Especially not for the PS3

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Because people that now have a PS3

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
That I go to their houses

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Regularly

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I know one person

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Alright

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Well I feel the same way about cloud saving with

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
The whole rock band guitar hero things

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Because I go to one of my buddy's houses

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Who has played rock band extensively

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
And unlocked a lot of the games

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I come back to my house and I haven't

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Finished those parts of the tour to unlock the songs to play

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So cloud saving would make a lot of sense

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
When you do the all unlock

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
That would be cheating Rob

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Here's the other problem too with the cloud saving thing

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Don't you have to put your profile on their system anyways?

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I mean you can't just dump the save off the internet

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Well with Xbox

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Yeah it is profile centric

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
That's true

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Here's a better idea

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
This is great and this will cost you

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
No money so fuck Playstation Plus

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
You take that game save

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
It's not very big

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Email it to yourself

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Boom it's on the cloud

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Don't need to fucking pay them for shit

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
You want that download that save anywhere

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Download the save just go to a PC

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Download it

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
But your friends don't have a PC I don't believe you

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Because everybody has a PC nowadays

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Seriously

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Why am I going to pay

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Boom it's on the cloud

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
And he pointed up

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
In the studio he pointed up towards the cloud

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Just in case we didn't know

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Boom headshot on the cloud

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Alright

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Gameguru in our chat

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Says my USB drive is bigger than the cloud

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Hot

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Google mail

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Gmail bigger than the cloud

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
7.8 gigs right

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
And you know

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
If I remember correctly

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I believe you can download stuff

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Through the web browser on

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
The

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Playstation 3 I think

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I'm not sure what you can download if it's just

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Images and stuff like that to save to your system

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
But you may very well be able to download game

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Saves

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Now here's a point from Spaznator PC

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Can't wait to hear your response to this in our chat room

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Low key most saves can be copied

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
To jump drives external hard drives

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
But some are copy locked

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
In those occasions cloud saving comes in handy

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
And then the only person

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Or the only people you can blame

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
For that would be Sony for being dicks

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
But maybe

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
For a Playstation Plus member they'll give you the keys

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
To unlock that save

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Oh yeah how generous of them

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
I can have access to my saves

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Oh thank you great master

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
I mean it's like

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
What the hell

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Sorry no you can't have your saved data

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
But you can pay for the privilege

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
To access that data

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Last week was Nintendo this week is Sony

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I know you gotta love Loki

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
One week it'll be Apple then it's Nintendo

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Now this week it's Sony

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Angry angsty

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Man against iOS and iPad

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And iPhone stuff

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
But he still is in many ways

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
No I hate Apple

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
The only reason he has that is he got it for free through a work

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
No you have to understand I hate Apple

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Because their computers are shit

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
They're overpriced shit

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
And that's all it is

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Who thought it was a fucking genius idea to have

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
No ports whatsoever other than

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
One USB slot that's awesome

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
That's awesomely stupid

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
I mean

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
But people buy that for like two grand

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
When you can spend two grand on laptops

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
I can get two fucking nice laptops

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
For that same kind of price

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
But people go oh my god new Apple product

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
I gotta go buy it

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
That's where I have my problems

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I'm still giving props for the

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
The iPhone because it probably is the best

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Smartphone out there right now

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
And even like the iPod touch

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Because it's probably the best

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
MP3 player out there

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
It's not my really MP3 player

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
It's an iPhone without the phone

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
But

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
I'll be damned if I buy a fucking

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Apple computer

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Fuck that

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Seriously that is a waste

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
You might as well just set fire to your money

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Because you'd be doing yourself

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
A great injustice to buy

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
An Apple computer

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Oh Loki

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I think in a new segment Loki's angst

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
That's the show

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
But that's not a segment

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
That's the show

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And I still don't get the iPad

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I don't get it

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
I guess it's better than having a

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Netbook maybe

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
But

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I can't put it in my pocket what good is that for me

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I'm using mine, I'm planning a career in real estate

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
I'm using it to take pictures of listings and homes

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
And video so I'm putting it to a business use

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Ok so yeah that's fine

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
And I'll be able to watch porn on it

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Hey that's a frame device that has a screen

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
I don't play the slideshow of porn

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Versus the slideshow of listings

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
You better have a big thing of Windex to clean that iPad with

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
But um

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Anyway so

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
No no I just

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Of course everybody's now putting out tablet

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Right

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
That worked really well back in the 90's

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Because everybody wants to touch something

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
I remember when tablet PC

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Fuck I remember when my uncle worked for like

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Wacom and they were making tablet PC's

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Yeah that's old school shit

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Oh my god you have to use a stylus

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
On this

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Alright anyway let's move on

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
To some other stories going on here

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
And this is a follow up to something we were talking about

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Last week remember that scandalous game

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
We Dare

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Yes that was the one that's kind of like Truth or Dare

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I guess but it was going to be a video game on the Wii

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And the trailer video featured spanking

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Which I guess was one of the mini games

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Well guess what happened

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Thanks to the magic of the internet I guess somebody

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Realized maybe um

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
This game isn't really suitable for the

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
12 plus rating that it originally got

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
And yes Ubisoft

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Just spoke to the Daily Telegraph

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
This week saying following the public

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Reaction to the 12 plus rating of

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
We Dare Ubisoft has made the decision

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Not to sell the game in the United

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Kingdom so uh

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
This means that the game will not be sold anymore

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
In the UK they will have to import it

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
From some place where this game will be

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Sold um

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
I don't know where that's going to end up being

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Canada or Australia

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Or what?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
It's stupid that they're even doing that

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
How about download it on the internet because that's probably going to be the easiest place to get it sadly

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I don't usually advocate piracy but

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's just a

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Fucking game I mean seriously

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
First off the situation that

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
They posed in the stupid trailer made

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
No sense anyways there's first off never

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Going to be two hot girls playing a game with you

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And they're not going to go make out because they

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Started playing you know a fucking

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Wii game you know what's going to do that

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Lots of alcohol

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Lots of yeah that's really all you need

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Lots of alcohol you know and

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And uh slutty chicks

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And then they'll go and make out and stuff

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
A Wii game is not going to get them to do that

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It will not get you you know laid

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Um

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And I trust you if you bought this game

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
You'd be very bored because who the hell

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Are you going to play this with?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I mean seriously you're going to invite your friends over and play this

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Play against the computer?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Play against the computer I mean

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
You want to fucking you know

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
I'm sorry Dave I cannot let you spank me

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
So they're not they're not selling it in the UK

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Were they not selling Twister in the UK?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
They're not selling bottles in the UK because I mean

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
That's all you need too for like fucking you know

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Uh

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Was it an erotic night with your friends or something

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Like that I mean I just don't under

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
This just proves that the UK

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Is possibly more prudish than the Americans

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
No they're just as prudish because we're not selling it over here either so

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
By the way

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Just real quick uh also

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Ubisoft got a stern warning

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
From the Europeans rating board

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Peggy um not Bundy

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But P-E-G-I Peggy

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Uh asking Ubisoft to basically

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Remove the We Dare ads from the internet

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Oh yeah because once something hits the internet

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It can totally be erased you guys

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Whatever you know what I think it can

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Try to find anything

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
From uh being Bobby Brown on the internet

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
You can't

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
It just doesn't exist I have an icon of Whitney Houston

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Saying kiss my ass

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
No you do I have looked

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I have scoured the internet trying to find those episodes

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
For my wife because that would be like

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
They never released it on DVD?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
No she filed lawsuits to block that

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It never came out on DVD

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Really? Yes oh man

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
That would be worth a lot if anyone's got that on VHS

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That was an amazing fucking show

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We need to send Sam Flynn to break into the headquarters

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Of Bravo or whatever fucking network or air that show

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
And steal the master tapes because seriously

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
That was an amazing piece of television

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
It was awesome

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Anyhow speaking of Bobby

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Uh Black Wolf is in the chat room

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Saying please tell me you have in your show

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Role the guy who actually recorded himself

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Playing the game showing how tame it really is

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Of course I don't

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But I believe it

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I believe it's not as bad as that commercial makes it look

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
We saw you know the actual gameplay

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's just

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
It's just a ploy to get people

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
To buy that game because they're like oh it's so dirty

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
No it's crap

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Okay it's Ubisoft

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
This is the same company that puts out you know

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Uh the pets games

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Or the imagine games

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You know or you know all that stuff

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Imagine sex party

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I mean that's basically what this is

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Well unfortunately I couldn't find

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
The We Dare gameplay but I did find

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
A trailer for We Dare Island

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Oh he's cute

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Oh she's spinning a tie

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
In slow motion

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Or is that a bra? I can't tell from back here

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Ah yes

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So the ladies are on the couch

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Giggling at the boys and they're one pseudo stripping

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And they're dancing and they're having a gay old time

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
The question is though

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Is it going in reverse?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Oh oh now the girls spanking

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The girls are laughing I think it is going in reverse

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
God I love YouTube

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I'm gonna link that in the chat

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
That's more like XTube going on right there

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Alright

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
MrBlackWolf is giving me the appropriate link

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That we should be looking at here

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
If the game doesn't have full frontal it's not We Dare

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I mean seriously

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
We can check it out

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
There's us being all adventurous

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Ooh I want that dress

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
You do huh? Yes

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Okay

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh these guys are sassy

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
You really like this song?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Yes

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
How can you not like this song?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I guess it's okay but I'm just sick of hearing it

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I'm sick of hearing you

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Not to mention it's a cover

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I guess they're just dancing it's kind of like Just Dance

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Is that it?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Alright I'm bored of that video already

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
What is that on Farmhouse media 3000

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
It has that little YouTube clip we were just playing

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Anyhow

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Let's move on

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Matt2 what do you have for us?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Some more news so looks like that

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
If you play Dragon Age 2 and you

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Have some angst and you want to get unleashed

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
In the forums watch what you say because

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
If you call EA the devil

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You might actually get shut off

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
So a player actually posted online

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
On their forums and

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
For whatever reason reference

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
EA called them the devil you can have your opinion

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
About that and

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
EA not liking this bad PR

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Decided to temporarily

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Suspend the player's account on the

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Forums because that's not

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Unusual when you play WoW or other online

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
If you go off and say some naughty things

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
They'll do that but someone flipped the other master

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Switch and temporarily

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Suspended this guy's account for three days

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So when he loaded the game and

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Played the game could not

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Actually play it all because he called

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
The exact quote from

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
The forums was

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Quote have you sold your souls to

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
The EA devil?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Really?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
At Banfurth

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It's the Activision devil by the way

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Exactly

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But the other part of it too

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That's not so bad

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If you've seen and read other forums

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
It's like don't come into my house and then call me

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The devil

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
So here's the thing

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
We strictly enforce the community against profanity

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
There's no profane

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
El Diablo here

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
It's a bad term

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
But there really isn't anything profane about it

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It's just really kind of a nasty, spun comment

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So of course

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
EA was like oh our bad, sorry about that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And they apologized as a glitch between

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Suspending the user account for

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Forums versus suspending the full blown

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Account for the game

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
They have since apologized to the player

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And moved on after some gamer backlash

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Isn't that ironic?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
They had to come back and apologize, sorry

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
We're the devil and Banjuu

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And Rob and I have posted and read

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Some of the WoW forms and things like that

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And there's some pretty angsty 12 year olds on there

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But this is pretty bad

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I kind of wish Blizzard did this

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Like read the forum posts and was like

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Oops, sorry we banned you

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
My bad

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Be careful what you say on the...

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
We need to take that Ragnarok Online approach

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You want to talk bad about our game? We ban you

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
You can't play the game anymore

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
How do you like that?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It just proves that you better watch or see on the internet

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And this is obviously a mistake

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
This is not what happens if you were to

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Call EA the devil or go off with profane language on their website

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Just something kind of funny

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
But it just shows how much control

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Video game distributors do have

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
They can flip a switch and you're gone

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Or you're banned or you're suspended

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
That's right, so you guys think twice next time

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
About calling EA the devil

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Call them dirty come guzzlers instead

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Hot

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Let's travel the world and look at some release dates

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Let's start with the US, Loki

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
This week's not a lot of stuff coming out

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
We got a few budget games and then

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Some decent stuff

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So starting off with the budget games

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Maximum Racing Dragonstock and Maximum Racing

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
GP Classic Racing

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
These are very budget games coming out for the Wii

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Let's see

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
God's Eater Burst

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Coming out on PSP this week

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
From D3

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Looks pretty awesome

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Jakandia and the Timeless Land

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
This is a game that's very similar to

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
30 Second Hero

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
So I believe this is the one that actually lets you

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Pick how much time you have

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And then you can play the game for that long

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And then of course

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
On the Wii, Trackmania Build to Race

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Awesome game on the PC

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
So I'm sure it would be pretty good on the Wii

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Homefront

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The big game for this week

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Kind of

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
The first that we'll see

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Of the Just Dance series

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But a little bit of a spin-off

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Dance on Broadway coming into Playstation 3

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
For the move

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Also on Playstation 3

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yakuza 4

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
With less stuff changed this time

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
From the Japanese version

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Artun Liko

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Is it just me or was that kind of a fast turnaround this time?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It was a pretty fast turnaround

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Artun Liko Koga

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Nel of Arseal

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
On Playstation 3 this week as well

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Let's see

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Also

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I believe the Wii

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Top Spin 4

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Coming out this week as well

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And then

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Surprisingly enough

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The Xbox 360 version of this got cancelled

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But Warriors Legend of Troy

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
It's a

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Trojan version of Dynasty Warriors

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So check that out

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And then finally

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
We've got another Ubisoft

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Fitness game

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Fit in 6 on the Wii and Playstation 3

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Of course Playstation 3

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
With move support there

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It's kind of like their answer to the Arseal fitness

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Since that never came out on other systems

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Other than the 360

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
That's

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
That's it for this week

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yes, that's it

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Alright, I'm gonna move on to Japanese release dates

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I do realize things going on

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Could have an effect on this

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
On the Xbox 360

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Dragon Age Origins Awakening

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
That would be the expansion to the original Dragon Age

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It's gonna be out on March 17th

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Going on to the Playstation 3

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And checking out some of the releases there

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Yakuza

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'm sorry, that's a US release

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Motorstorm 3 Apocalypse

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Comes out in Japan

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
As well as the Dragon Age Origins expansion

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Ryu Ga Gotoku of the End

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Comes out in Japan as well

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I'm not sure what that

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Game is, it's from Sega

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And it's related to the Yakuza universe

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
But I think it's a bit more of the action adventure

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Type of game, so there you go

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Let's see

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Coming out on some other systems

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Want to see the Wii real quick

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
If there's anything coming out there

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I don't believe so

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
No, nothing this week because of course

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Nintendo's focused on the 3DS

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And the recent launch that happened there

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So you can check out Steel Diver this week in Japan

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Is on the 3DS this week in Japan

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
And lastly

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
On the PSP

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
We have

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Where to go

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
No, I guess

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Is there anything on the PSP this week?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Doesn't look like it

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
For some reason I'm not able to find the dates on my list

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
There we go, never mind, there it is

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
The Little Battlers is the big release

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
On the PSP this week

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Little Battlers

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Is a game from level 5

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
It's an RPG coming out over there

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Looks like you battle these

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Little kind of polygonal

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Types of things, it looks a little bit

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Valkyria profile to me

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Kind of mixed with traditional RPG mechanics

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
So that could be kind of neat

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
So there you go, that's it for Japanese releases

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
What about the UK?

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Alright, so from our friends across the pond

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Coming out on Ides of March

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Is Total War Shotgun 2

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Coming out on PC

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And then for releases on the 18th Friday

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
We have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on PC

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
We also have coming up God's Eater Burst

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
On the PSP

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I'm just intrigued by the title

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Homefront is coming out on the 360

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
PS3 and PC

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Also again on Friday the 18th

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
MotoGP coming out

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Also on Friday, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on the PS3

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Okimada and Chisaki Taio

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
See, I could do Chinese

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Japanese pretty well, huh?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I was worried about any

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I was worried about any type of Japanese releases

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I had in my read tonight

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Coming out on DS

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Also Topspin 4 for 360, PS3 and Wii

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Coming out

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And finally Yakuza 4 is mentioned before

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Coming out on the 18th for PS3

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I remember buying Topspin

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Original for 360 and was not a fan

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It made me frustrated

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I did not like the original Topspin game

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It was on 360 either

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
That's it this week for the UK

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Alright

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Just a few more news stories for you guys

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And then we're going to get to the classic game of the week

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
But first, something from Loki

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I'm sorry, I'm very distracted right now

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
What was that?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
They finally released the Grand Theft Auto 4 texture editor

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Remember the one that got ripped off for Trend to Buy?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah, someone finally released it

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
All the things I can do

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It's just so mind boggling

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Anyways, let's talk about Pokémon

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Apparently

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
There was a rumor

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And of course, you know there's always rumors for the stuff coming from Twitter

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
There was a rumor

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Back when this whole disaster

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Went down in Japan

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That the Pokémon creator died

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
That would have been tragic

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Except it's not true

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Basically

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The company tweeted back

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
They said, false

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Pokémon company and Game Freak is fine

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
No one's dead

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Some people are sick

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
That's all

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Sick

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Maybe

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
It was a very unfortunate case

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
A mistaken identity or mistranslation

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But unfortunately

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
That probably was not the case

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Sick people

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Alright, moving on

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
One other news story for you guys

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Free Realms

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I don't know if you've ever checked this game out

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
It's a casual MMO

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
The weird thing is it's free to play

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
It's coming out on the Playstation 3

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The funny thing is

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
It's coming out very soon

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
March 29th

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It was originally on the PC

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And now it's going to be a free to play casual MMO

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
On the Playstation Network

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
So it's not like DC Universe Online

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Which is kind of the other big MMO on Playstation 3 right now

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Free Realms

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Is going to be different

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
They say that they did take some things

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
From DC Universe Online, Sony Online Entertainment

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Of course in developing this

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
But basically

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
This is kind of something basically new

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
They had to port the rendering over from the

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Old engine from the PC

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
The PS3 version unfortunately

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Will be independent of the PC version

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You will not be able to play with your friends

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
On the PC version

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Being able to link the accounts unfortunately isn't possible

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So it'll be interesting to see how this

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Works on the Playstation 3

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Again it's a free to play MMO

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So I would assume that means on the PS3

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It's going to be that way as well

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Maybe it's one of those things that's only open to Playstation Plus though

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I don't know

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
No word on that yet

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
So we'll see when the game comes out in just a couple weeks

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Alright for now

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It's that time of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And look at the classic game of the week

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Every week here on the show

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault of classic gaming

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And pull out a game that she thinks you guys should be checking out this week

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Unfortunately she's not here this week

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
So we all decided to run into the vault

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And knock everything over

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And let everything kind of pile up on the floor

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
In one big pile

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
We jumped on in, pulled one game out

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And this is what we got

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
After we smashed everything with the hammer

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And locked me in the vault for 24 hours

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
No I'm kidding

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
We decided since Matt 2 was good enough to step in

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And fill in for Jamie tonight

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Why doesn't he get to pick the classic game of the week

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
What did you pick for the classic game of the week?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Well I'll never presume to take over for Jamie

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But I'm honored to do this segment here

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
So after being locked in the vault for 24 hours

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And a dog pile ensued

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I sifted through it and found

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
This little gem on Super Nintendo

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
One of my favorites

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Actraiser

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And Actraiser was produced

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And distributed back in 1990

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So 20 years ago

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Oh my god I'm so old

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Exclusive for Super Nintendo at the time

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It was put out by Enix then

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Now Squeenix as we know it

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And the whole idea of this game was

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It was two fold

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
You were a platform side scrolling

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Action as well as

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
City building almost like RTS

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And the whole premise was that

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
You were god, or a god I should say

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
And you would have to run around

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And kill stuff and defend the land

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
You then also

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Once you completed the level which was

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Again very basic side scrolling levels here

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
You would then turn into an angel

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And fly around and protect the city

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
From other monsters

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And you could see his butt

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
You could definitely see his ass

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
You fly around in an angel form

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
And help defend the city

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
You would also have to do things like

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Help crops grow by being god

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
You'd have to make it rain on the crops

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And lightning to burn bushes

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
So your city could grow and things like that

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
At the time when I was playing it

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I really enjoyed the music from the game

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
The gameplay is pretty straight forward on the platform side

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And the angel

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Side scrolling or RTS side

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
But

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
So anywho, a little bit more background about the game

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Again the idea that you were a god or a master

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
And you take the form of

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
The overseer in a cloud

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Not cloud saves, but just cloud

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And then when your citizens call upon you to help defend the land

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
You would beam on down

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
To the world and take over

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
In a humanoid form

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
The funny part is

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
There was an Actraiser 2

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Really a prequel to the game

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
But a lot of religious subtext

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Was discovered about it

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
People were concerned about the game

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Because in the Japanese text for this prequel

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
They actually called the main character god

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
And the villain of the game Satan

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
So here we are talking about the devil again tonight Rob

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
But it was a very

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
It was a very

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Engaging game because again it had two

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Parts to it, you had to again defend the city

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
And build your cities

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
If you didn't do these certain tasks

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Your citizens would die and you would lose the game

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
One of my favorites

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
It later came out for Virtual Console

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And also released on

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Mobile phone devices

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So this is out there to play

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And I don't know

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I just really enjoyed the music from this game

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So your classic video game of the week

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Is Actraiser

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
On Super Nintendo and Virtual Console and Mobile Phone

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
An excellent fucking choice

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And I remember when

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Matt too told me what game he wanted to do for the classic game of the week

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I was like no Jamie had to have picked that at some point

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Well I asked her about it. I was like go check the wiki

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Jamie picked that right

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And it hadn't been picked yet

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Well I checked the wiki just to be certain

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And then I sent her a message

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And said hey these are the three games I

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Would like to review

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And these are on the wiki that I want to run past you

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
She goes oh I totally had Actraiser on my list to do

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
So yeah go ahead and take that

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I also gave two other suggestions to Rob

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I told him one of them

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I think he was impressed on how far back

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
My video gaming experience went

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Do you remember the game I told you?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But Congo Bongo?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I totally remember that game from the Atari 5200

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
But anywho

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So Actraiser

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Is definitely a great game. Check it out

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Let's not take attention away from Actraiser

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Because this game is amazing

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It's definitely in my top 10 video games ever

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
The sequel doesn't hold a candle to it

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And it actually bankrupt the series I think

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
That's too bad

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Like Enix made so many good freaking games

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
On the Super Nintendo

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I'm not even talking about Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
That series. I'm talking about

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
The Illusion of Gaia

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And that whole series

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
That was in Soul Blazer

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I think was one of the other games

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
That whole series was awesome

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And of course they were the ones that did Busta Move

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
depending on what country you were in

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
That was all Enix

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And a lot of that has disappeared since the Square merger

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Which is unfortunate

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
One of the most graphic things about this game was

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Whenever you had to warp down to the world to defend it

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The screen would spin around

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And it was just high-tech

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And it made you feel like you were falling

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Into the earth

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So as your citizens

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Gain power-ups and learn smarter

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
They can learn how to build better

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Buildings and better crops

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And things like that

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It definitely had a SimCities

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And a platform feel to it

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Definitely check it out

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Thank you to the week for the Super Nintendo from Enix

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Actraiser

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
And for heaven's sake, at least just listen to this soundtrack

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Because it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I believe it's Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack to that

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Who's um, just

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No, no, what am I saying?

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
She sang a song

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
For like Evangelion or something

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yuzo Koshiro did the music to that

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And he did

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
He did a DDR song back in the day

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I believe he's the same guy that does Wangan Midnight

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Maximum Tune, Streets of Rage

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Lots of great stuff

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
So, very cool

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
But fear not, there's plenty more of

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
OLR to come when we get back

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Including the mailbag, your tweets

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
So get those in please, your Twitters

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Twitter.com slash OLR to get in your tweets

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And of course, more news, we're going to talk about those

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Dance Hero rumors, some games being

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Cancelled at Sony, and what's going to

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Happen to NBA Jam

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
We'll find out after this, a quick break with more

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
We are live tonight with the

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
405th episode of our show

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
On this March 13th of 2011

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
We are live at All Games Radio

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
As we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Obviously, it's been a crazy week

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And if you are just joining us

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I did make a plea in Part A

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And I'll say it again, please, please, please

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
For those folks in Japan

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
That have had to go through such a

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Crazy, horrific thing going on

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Right now, please consider donating to the

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Red Cross, you can go to

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Redcross.org, I'm really

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Encouraging all of our listeners to part with

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
$10, it's not that much

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That's like less than the cost of one month

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Of an MMO, that's an Xbox Live Arcade game

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
You can go without this week

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And put the money to where it's really, really

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Needed right now, anyhow

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Moving on, we're gonna get back into some gaming news

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And some rapid fire news, and your Twitter

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
All the tweets at twitter.com

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Slash o-l-r, we'll read those on the show here in

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Just a minute, so get those in, this is your last chance

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Also, I gotta do a plug

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
For the spin-off shows, unfortunately Dark

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Sakura's not here tonight, but she does do a

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Fun little show with Mara & Marvel

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And Dan Shadow, it's called Comic Insanity

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
But that's with no I, it's

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Comic N-sanity, and you can find

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
That on Twitter, or you can also find it at

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Infamous.net, again, just the letter

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
N, Infamous.net

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
If you like World of Warcraft, check out my

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Spin-off show with X-Defer, the best little

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Horde house in Azeroth, also known

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
As Horde House for short

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And all of that coming

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
To a new website also this week

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
That I'll be able to give out, and I'm very excited

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
So that's all on its way to being done

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
In the meantime,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Some rapid fire news, some quick stories

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
For you guys, let's start with Loki

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
According to the

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
New issue of the French gaming magazine

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Joystick, Bethesda's next

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Game in their, well, next

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Announced game is gonna be Prey 2

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
That's right, the sequel to the

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
First person shooter game that came out from

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
3D Realms and 2K games

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Wow. Of course, 3D Realms is no

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Longer around, and you know

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Bethesda was purchased by

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
ZeniMax

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Which snatched up the

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Company ID software

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
So it makes perfect sense that they're gonna be putting out

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Shooter games

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
No word exactly on when that's coming out

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But probably something that we'll be

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Hearing more about during E3 this year

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I'm kind of surprised that Prey is getting a sequel

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Because the first one didn't really do too hot

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I mean, it was a good game

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Especially for dummies

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Like, it was a first person shooter for dummies

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Because you can never die in Prey, and that's one of the things

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I really liked about it, because I suck at first person shooters

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
The story was pretty good too

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Even though it totally cut off abruptly

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Like, you play in the game and then it's over

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It was weird

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
For a sequel

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah, kind of like that

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But not really

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Without the journey

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This is kind of a neat little Easter egg

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
I guess for the Google Chrome browser

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
If you're using it

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
There's actually a piece of JavaScript

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
You can paste into the Chrome's

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Address

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
And when you do that

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
It activates a hack which reloads a page

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
And basically allows you to

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Roll around a ball

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
A katamari ball, to be exact

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And pick up all the words

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And images on the screen like you would a katamari

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Awesome

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
And you can find this piece of code

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
At kathack.com

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
That's K-A-T

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Hack.com

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And check it out

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
It's kind of a neat one

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Does it play the music too?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I don't think it does

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
But thanks to the advent of

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
The MP3

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
You would provide your own soundtrack

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
For your web page rolling up

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Adventures

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It's just not the same

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And then finally

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
There's a company out of

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
San Francisco that wants to make your life

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The RPG

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
So basically it's life

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
The RPG

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But it's you

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
It's coming from a company called

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Green Goose

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And basically what it is

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Is this package that you get

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
It's packaged with a water bottle

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Toothbrush and vitamin container

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And it says the Green Goose

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Logs how many times a week

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
That you say for example

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Pick up their toothbrush or whatever

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Awarding them points each time that they do

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
There's sensors on the bottles

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And on the toothbrush for tracking

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
As well as a credit card size

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Pedometer that communicates with the

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Base station that's attached

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
To a broadband router

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
The points that the player earns

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Will

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Not really do anything

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
But it's meant

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
To encourage a healthy

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Lifestyle I guess

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And clean teeth

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Okie dokie

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I don't know

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Neat

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
This is something I can see them selling

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
At a dentist office or something like that

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I remember all those toothbrushing

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Games and stuff that you could play on

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
With the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
That were supposed to like you know

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Teach the good habits and all that

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It would be kind of funny

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Like a life of the game or something like that

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Well they kind of have that

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Like in the 3DS where you earn points for walking

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Or shaking

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
The 3DS

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And you award the same points

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
For walking or throttling something

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Alright

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Let's move on here to some

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Other news about the Legend of

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Zelda the Ocarina of Time 3D

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
There is some

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
New things that are supposed to be in there

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's not just a direct port

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Of the 64 version

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The 3DS version is supposed to have some other

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Stuff and this is in an interview that

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Happened with Miyamoto

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Talking about the 3DS version of Ocarina

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Of Time. Apparently they've set up a new system

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Where when you use the A, B and X, Y

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Buttons there's also some special buttons in the

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Touch screen that you can use to switch

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
Between the items right away

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Between maps and menus and so forth

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Also one other

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Little teaser that's there

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
From Satoru Iwata says

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Of course the Nintendo 3DS version of

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Ocarina of Time is crammed with interesting

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Things that weren't in the Nintendo 64 version

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
But we'll wait to talk about those

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
To the release

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
By the way

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Quick follow up from SX in our chat room on the

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Katamari Damacy add-in. It does play the music

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Just so you know

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Well that's good to know. That's coming from our chat

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Some rumors about Grand Theft Auto 5

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Is the code name Rush

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
That could be what's going on

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I guess that's some casting

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Details that were done on a Google search

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Apparently there's this project called Rush

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And it has to do with Grand Theft Auto 5

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Rush is tied to Take-Two Interactive

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
They own Rockstar Games

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Apparently it's a video game

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Set in the Los Angeles area

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So maybe they've gone from New York to L.A.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Who knows but that is apparently

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Some of the rumors about the game

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Some of the casting that is in the game

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
There's a 38 year old FBI agent

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
In grape shape

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
A 25 year old young Mexican-American

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
FBI agent

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
23 year old moron

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
White trash hillbilly named Clyde

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And so on and so on

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
So lots of parts that they're casting for

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That's either going to be a Grand Theft Auto game

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Which I can only hope

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Or it's going to be a sequel to Midnight

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Club L.A.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And lastly, Valve is going to be

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Bridging Portal and Portal 2

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
With some type of surprise

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
We don't exactly know what that is

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
But that was from

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Coming out of PAX East

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Something that will tie the story

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Of the interim time between Portal and Portal 2

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Is that a comic book?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Is that an arcade game?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Is that YouTube?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Who knows?

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Apparently something will be coming to tie

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
The two worlds together in the future

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So we'll see

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Matt 2?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
This is Strong by Trapped

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
That's just half of what's in that pack

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
These are all those angsty

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Boy frat bands that you like

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Yes, this is good music, Rob

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
It sounds like men with vaginas

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
When I hear it

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I'm sure a lot of our listeners

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Are like, you're an asshole, Rob

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
You like Lady Gaga

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I heard she did a great song

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That copied Madonna's song

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Weren't you in the middle of some news?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yes sir, let me continue

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So check that out if you're into rock music

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Other stories that are coming up

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
There it goes

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Torchlight

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Rob talked about this in his gaming week

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
He's tried Torchlight, it mimics Diablo 2

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And all that's great

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
But it was cancelled in Japan

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Due to text bugs

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And due to translation delays

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
So basically Torchlight was there

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
It was set to launch in the Xbox Live Arcade

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And when it came down to it

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It was just abruptly cancelled

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Due to some various

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It's a weird reason to cancel a game

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
It's a very weird reason

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Various reasons to go back and forth

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
There must have been a dirty word

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
In mistranslation or something

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I don't know, there was a lot of debate

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Whether it was a bug or a text issue

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Everyone was pointing at each other's fingers

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
But basically it was quoted saying

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
We're not privy to the decision making process

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
But it was due to bugs in the translation

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Because the game has never been translated

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
To Japanese

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Since there was no existing Japanese version

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Of the game, the complexity of a new translation

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Combined with the randomly generated naming

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Scheme for Torchlight

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Made it beyond the scope of the project

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You would think that if they were going to release something

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
In two different countries

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And countries had different languages

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
They would include that in the scope of the project

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
It still just seems so abrupt

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Too hard, I don't want to do this

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I don't understand!

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Google Translate won't work for this game

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Rob, you made a point that the text

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
On the screen was awfully small

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Yeah, maybe you couldn't read it

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
So maybe the Japanese videography of the characters

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Didn't look right

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
So who knows

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Maybe look for that in the future if they figure out how to translate it

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Or maybe that's just wah wah wah

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
So, unfortunately no Torchlight

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
For the Xbox Live

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
For the Japanese version

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
I really don't want to have to share this news

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Because the first iteration of this was

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Just so horrible

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
There's work that a new

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Doom movie is coming out

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Yes

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
We all remember in 2005 The Rock

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Dwayne Johnson

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Did a

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Wonderful version of Doom

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
In an attempt to

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Do a movie on the first person shooter that

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Got us in the early 90s

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But there's a reboot in the works

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
That's going to completely ignore Dwayne Johnson's

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
First version, thank god

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
And of course, like everything else

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
In this frickin' time and day

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It'll be in 3D

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Oh, of course

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Will we have scenes with a gun in 3D?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Probably

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Was that in the first movie?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
It wasn't in 3D, but the perspective

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You were running around for parts

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
The scene with a gun swinging back and forth

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Like you were in the video game

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I would be okay with this if they just

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Took Doom 3D

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Sorry, I'm just looking real quick

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I'm trying to bring back some memories here

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Oh god, please don't

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
I saw this on

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
USA Network or TNT or something like that

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I think they cut out all the violence

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Oh, they did, and the swearing

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Swearing in violence would have made it better

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah, it was just bad

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Doom is waiting

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
So there's no release date, there's no nothing

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
It's just in the preliminary works and it's just

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
A new project in the early stages

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Yay, another Hollywood reboot, just what we needed

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And in 3D, can't forget it's in 3D

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
We've run out of ideas, completely

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Exactly, so

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Time to remake crap

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Look for that, hopefully, in the near future

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah, can't wait

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
There will be no hopefully looking forward to

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Much anticipation, alright

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I promised someone we'd do a quick phone call here

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
At this point in the show, so we're gonna make a phone call real quick

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And try to get this all taken care of

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I hope it's going through

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
I'm kind of relying on Skype tonight

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
And sometimes it can be a little

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
There we go, one ringy dingy

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Two ringy dingys

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Hopefully there's an answer, that might be quite embarrassing

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
What?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Hi, is this Dark Sakura?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Yes, this is

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
How are you, did you make it to Disneyland in one piece?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Well we're not at Disneyland yet

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
We're going tomorrow, but we

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
We made it to the hotel room

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
You're in that area, right?

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I can look out of the window

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And see the parking structure

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
There you go, now

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Aren't you down there because you get to hang out with the official

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
OLR lesbians this week, or at least one of them?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Well both of them on Tuesday

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
We're going to Goofy's Kitchen together

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yay, well be sure to tell them

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
We all said hi and everything

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Well, you know, I was gonna try to

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Unfortunately it didn't work out, I was gonna have you plug

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Your spin-off show, but I already did that for you

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
The whole comic insanity

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
But do you want to tell us anything about your gaming week?

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Or anything maybe you've been doing to pass the time in the car?

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Like on the iOS games?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Well, I played a little solitaire

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Mostly I was vlogging

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And just singing along with us

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And just singing along with us

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Some classic rock that happened to come on

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Awesome

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
On a CD that I made so I knew it was on there

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And played some Marvel vs Capcom 3 during the week

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Nice

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Wow

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Looking forward to the new characters to be

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Paid to unlock?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Well we're getting Shima Grass

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Jill's not worth it

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Jill's not worth it

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So I gotta say Matt 2 is doing a

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Pretty good job filling in tonight

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
His classic game of the week was very well received

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But he totally set the vault

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
On fire and I

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Just want to apologize for that in advance

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
That everything is on fire

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
You realize Dan's going to

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Castrate you before he kills you right?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
All of you

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Dan scares Matt 2

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Although I

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Did admit

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
The vault wasn't

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
On fire it was a small

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Ember burning and you

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Overreacted and luckily they had a dry

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Chem fire extinguisher under the sink and I put it out

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
He was putting his cigarette out in there

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And I'm kidding I'm totally kidding

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
We haven't even gone in there

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I know I know

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Matt 2 brought me beer tonight and not you

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Ha

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Okay

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
It wasn't true oh well for our fashion list

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
One of the hosts was slightly intoxicated

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I offered it to Loki

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
In disbelief and then said err

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And handed it to Rob so

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Alright so we're about to

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
We're about to get into Twitter topics but is there

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Anything you want to say to the listeners tonight?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I have the best husband ever

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Why is that?

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I just do

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
He's pretty cool

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
He's okay

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Because he's awesome

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And he likes

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
The pita sandwiches at the place you took me to

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
This week and that was pretty awesome alright

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
That's what we had for breakfast

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Oh no I just kicked

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Shermie on accident I'm sorry Shermie

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Did you notice what I did for you?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I washed her

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Bed so it would not stink

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
For you

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
That is a big cat

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
I washed her

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
I washed her butt for you

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Thank you that's so kind

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Because it would not stink

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Because her butt stinks

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
The great lengths you go to for

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Okay so we

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
Got to get back into video gaming news but I

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Wanted you to at least be able to say hello to the

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Listeners so anything else before I let you go?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Listeners?

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000

We said hi and Marissa too

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
If you end up seeing her and

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Marissa has a disease

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Aww how sad

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
She's in bed with cold chills

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And running fever disease

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Steam

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
That's what this looks like to me

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
It's cute

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm not sure how that's a music game

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I like it, it's like Chiptunes or something

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Is the music, I wonder if that's the whole deal

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I will have to wait and see

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
If that's the whole deal

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I will have to research more about that

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
A little later

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Moving on to some more tweets

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Reddertainment tweeting us saying

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It's good to see Square issuing refunds

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Over the Final Fantasy XI outage

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Treats their customers better than the airlines

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Would in the same situation

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Oh snap good point, very good point

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Tigerclaw wants to bring this up

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
AT&T is going to be introducing a bandwidth cap

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
For DSL and U-verse customers

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
This May

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Comcast folks have been dealing with this for some time

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
But apparently now there is going to be

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
A 150GB monthly usage cap

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
For DSL customers and 250GB

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Cap for U-verse users

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Starting on May 2

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
AT&T users from now through March 31

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Are going to start receiving notices

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Informing them of the change

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
In the company's terms of service

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
There will also be overage charges

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
If you go over

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I guess it's $10 for every 50GB

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Over the 150 or 250GB limit

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
That's actually not bad

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Because Comcast has been doing this for a few months now

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And they threaten to pull your coverage all together

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
If you go over the 250GB cap

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
It takes a lot to get over

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
It takes a lot to get over 250GB

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I was looking at my usage, I think in the month of January

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
I used 18GB

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
And I play a lot of WoW y'all

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I play a lot of WoW

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I've never gone over 250GB

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And I download a lot of

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Porn

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Not ISO's at all

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
None of that

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Never do that

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But I could see with more and more

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Streaming HD movies

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Streaming HD movies is a couple gigs

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
So if you watch a

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Streaming HD movie every day

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
You might hit this cap

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
It's a little bit unfortunate

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Unlimited does not mean unlimited

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Don't get me started on net neutrality

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Oh my god

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Can you believe if they started

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Charging an extra $10 for Netflix

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
At the top of what you already pay for Netflix

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
It's ridiculous

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
They'll just find a way around it

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Now they said

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
The whole net neutrality thing

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
They can throttle bandwidth on different things

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Because they have the right to do that now

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Cable companies are going to destroy themselves

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
With all this crap

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Just watch

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's going to make piracy worse

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
It's going to make piracy worse

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
All the net neutrality stuff

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Is going to make it worse

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I'm telling you

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Just look at the behavior

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Of the internet

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And if you don't think that charging people extra money

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
To access certain services is going to encourage people

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
To get around that gate

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Or for new services to start up to offer

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
The same stuff in less legitimate ways

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Just you wait

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Tigerclaw

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Sends us another tweet about

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Voice acting in Portal 2

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Announced at PAX

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
JK Simmons will be doing a voice

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
In Portal 2

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
That is Juno's dad

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And from Spiderman

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
J. Jonah Jameson

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
JK Simmons will be doing this

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Cave Johnson is the character

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
The president and founder of Aperture Science

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
That's a pretty big role

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
There you go

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
That'll be fun

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Was that demo at PAX East for Portal 2?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
That's pretty awesome if it was

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Probably one of those behind closed doors things

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Which is a little silly

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Apparently a pro wrestler

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Was one of the first to

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Pitch a perfect MLB 2K11 game

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Yeah here's the deal

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Did you know that they're doing this

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Contest right now for MLB 2K11

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I saw a commercial for this the other day

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
If you are the first to pitch a perfect game

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
You can win a million dollars

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
By being the first to

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Pitch a perfect in this game

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Kinda interesting

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Perfect starting April 1st

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Meaning that Mana

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Who did this Michael Mana is the

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Professional

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Wrestler known as Stevie Richards

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
He posted the video on YouTube

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
But unfortunately this doesn't start

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Until April 1st so the win doesn't actually

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Count and it's supposed to be harder than it was

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Last year because you can't

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
I think you have to actually use the

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Legitimate rosters for players that are

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Current up to that date

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
You can't just power load

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Your team or whatever

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Like they did last year so

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
It should be slightly harder

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
So it may take like

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Two days instead of one day

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
And lastly a tweet from

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Blue Swim saying Dead or Alive

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Announced for the

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
3DS that there is going to be some

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
DLC

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So yes some DLC coming to the 3DS

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And it's going to be

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Let's see the series boss characters

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Alpha 152, Alpha Kasumi

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Genra and Tengu

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I'm sorry they are not DLC they are just going to be

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
A game which is pretty cool

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
However free downloadable content

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
28 additional costumes

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Going to be free Cheerleader, Leifang

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Ninja Outfit, Ayana

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And so on and so on

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
La Mera Posa in a white cat outfit

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Indeed

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
More information available in

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Famitsu Magazine which broke the news

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
This week that's pretty awesome

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That's going to do it for tweets

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to show us your tweets

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Next time

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Let's go back into some news

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Yes

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
So

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
I don't know

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I kind of

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Ranted about this a little bit in the beginning

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Really Dance Hero

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Apparently you know there were

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Trademarks registered a while back

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I remember we were talking about like a Tar villain

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And Dance Hero and stuff like that

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Oh no they are going to do something like DVR

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Well now apparently

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
There's some more

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Info regarding it

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Apparently they are saying that

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
There are some artists

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Working with

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Activision on the franchise

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Timbaland, J Sean

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
The Prodigy and Afrojack all have

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Songs I guess that are

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Going to be in this

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
It's

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I don't know I mean I guess I could

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
See them doing something similar like this

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Like Dance Central because it's

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
You know made money

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
It's what's popular right now

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
And

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I guess

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
This is coming from I want to say

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Some sort of

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Like licensing

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Thing or something I'm trying to see here real quick

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I seem to remember some time

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Ago we saw Activision licensing

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
These things and we weren't sure what they were for

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Wasn't some of it for DJ Hero

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
But then some of it never really was explained

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Yeah

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Basically they're saying

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
The songs that are licensed so far

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
2012 by J Sean

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Featuring Nicki Minaj

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Out of Space by The Prodigy

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
The Way I Are by Timbaland

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Take Over Control by Afrojack

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yeah

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I don't know what they're going to really do with this

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I assume it's going to be something similar

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Like Just Dance or

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Dance Central

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Trying to cash in

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Thanks I hope

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I hope they ruin this

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Genre as well

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Haven't you done enough

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Bad

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Interesting comment from Game Guru in our chatroom saying

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
I don't think Activision is following Dance Central

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
They are following Just Dance

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Okay

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Those aren't that different

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Well they aren't

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
But I also kind of see the point that

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
He might be making there with the whole

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Kind of the style of the games

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
And the way they control

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Is a little bit different

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I guarantee this is probably going to be coming out in the fall

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
This year

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Because they're going to have to have something to fill

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I mean what if they really announced

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
That they're going to be putting out this year

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Call of Duty

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
My question is how is it going to be different

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Because otherwise they're just setting themselves up for the same

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Goddamn situation

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
That got Guitar Hero canned

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
If they come out at E3 and announce

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
This fucking game

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
They need to say and here's how it's different

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
You better acknowledge your competition

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
And tell us why it's better

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Otherwise, fuck off

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
For real

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Our new Guitar Hero game is different because now it has drums

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And singing

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
I don't care what it is

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
You know Harmonix is bringing Dance Central 2 to E3 this year

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
You know it

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
That's got to be their thing that they're working on now

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
You know that's going to be shown

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So if you can walk down the hall

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And see Activision in their little game

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They better be prepared to say

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
This is how our game is different

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Otherwise I do not give a fuck

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
And you better bet your ass that Ubisoft is bringing Just Dance

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
To the other consoles this year as well

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I mean that thing sold out like crazy

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
On the Wii

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Of course they're going to be bringing it to the connect and the move

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
So they've already got right there two competitors

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
For this genre

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
And whatever Konami is going to just

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Randomly show too

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Could be involved in there too

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Dance Masters exactly sold millions

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
But you never know, Konami, bless their hearts

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
They're still trying

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
They got DDR

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And props to them though for at least trying Dance Masters

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
What I consider a very Japanese game

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
You know what, you're right

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Dance Masters is very

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Different from Dance Central

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
It really is

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
You're not really looking deep

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
At the music game if you pass them both off

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
As the same game

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Because Dance Masters does function very different

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
The thing that's kind of frustrating about it

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Is the fact that it's so hard to really kind of

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Get into, you know what I mean

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It's just like

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I guess it's very much like Para where you just

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Do it

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And that's it

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
If they had a little bit more structure

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
If they had like an actual tutorial or something

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
To it, it might be better

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
But hey, you know, sequel

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
That'd be kind of cool

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Alright well Sony Europe

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Has actually cancelled some games

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Some of these were dance games

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Like maybe SingStar, I don't know

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
But unfortunately, I doubt that by the way

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I'm just trolling

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
But Sony Computer Entertainment Europe

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Has mentioned to the staffs at Studio Liverpool

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
London Studio, Evolution Studios

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
That they are going to be streamlining

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
And closing various projects

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
To move the development to other

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Higher priority first party offerings

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
So we're not talking layoffs or anything

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
We're just talking about these little games you are making

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Yeah, no, no, you need to come

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But streamlining could lead to layoffs

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Streamlines of corporate work for layoffs

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
We don't know yet

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The publisher went on to say

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Quote, with the incredibly strong list of

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Exclusive first party titles coming up both

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
This year and in the near future

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Resources should be reallocated to enhance those projects

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Closer to completion

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Maybe they're trying to rush to meet Christmas, I don't know

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Sony exclusives?

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Yeah, so who knows

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Sony didn't say what projects were affected

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
They didn't say anything about layoffs

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
They did reiterate there is no impact

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
In the role that the first party studios play

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
It's just, I guess, moving the resources around

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Maybe they didn't like that LittleBigPlanet 2

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Didn't make Christmas because maybe it impacted

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Sales, I bet it did

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
So maybe they're really stretching

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
To make Christmas this year and they're really just

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Bringing it home on some of the first party games

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
They're really going to put it all behind

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Which I could understand that

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And you know, there are some games

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
When's that Twisted Metal game supposed to come out?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Is it this holiday? So they're going to show that again

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
At E3, is it?

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
They have a lot of stuff coming out

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I mean, that's for sure

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
It's pre-packed first quarter for them

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
And second quarter's starting off pretty strong

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I mean, they've got

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
First quarter so far, they've had LittleBigPlanet 2

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
They're going to be having

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Killzone 3

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
DC Universe

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And PlayStation Move Heroes

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Will be coming out

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Possibly

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Sorcery

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
I think the Eco and Shadow of the Colossus

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Collection, although both of those

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
I think may have been delayed

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
And then second quarter so far

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
They've got SOCOM 4

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Motorstorm Apocalypse

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Infamous 2

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
I mean, I wouldn't say

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
They're definitely putting out their releases

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
So who knows

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I don't know what they're

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Uncharted 3

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
They have for the fourth quarter

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Resistance 3

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
And then

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
I guess

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Twisted Metal, possibly

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I wouldn't be surprised if that wouldn't be quarter one of next year

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Alright

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Well, let's move on with a couple more stories

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
We'll get to the mailbag here in just a moment

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But first, Matt2

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Alright, so for those who are

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
fans of NBA GM

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Your time with that game might be coming

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
to an end

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So EA Sports is kind of

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Going out here and saying there will be no more

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Roster updates or any type of post

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Release support for NBA Jam

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So it's kind of the

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Up and coming news that

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
NBA Jam is coming to

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Coming to an end

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
EA has been quoted here

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
The priority for Jam on the 360

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
PS3 was to deliver HD graphics and online

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Play to round out the

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Great gameplay that defines the franchise

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
For us to include roster and

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Title update possibilities

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Would have been a sacrifice of quality

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
In those key areas and thus made the difficult decision

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Not to include them

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
So with NBA Jam

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And their post game

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Releases as well as roster updates looks like the

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
The franchise is coming to an end

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
This franchise was so badly

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Mismanaged from the beginning and it's really

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Sad because it was this whole like

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Okay, it's only going to come out on the Wii

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
No, just kidding, it's coming on the Playstation 3

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And the 360 but we're not going to do the

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Obvious arcade thing and no, it's only

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Going to be an exclusive

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
With this sub-par basketball game

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
To try and get it to sell extra copies

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Oh fuck, this basketball game really sucks

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
It's getting cancelled, well shit, now we better

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Charge like $60 before this, I mean

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
This franchise was horribly

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Mismanaged from the start

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Shame on whoever ran this thing

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I mean, I guess they were trying to think of something outside

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
The box, but you fucked up

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Yeah, the marketing project manager on this

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Was streamlined, probably out the door

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
You know what, I hate to say it

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
But they kind of deserve it

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
This was a horribly

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Mismanaged franchise, this game should have been huge

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And it should have been on arcade

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Or it should have been a budget title

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
If this game had been $30, it would have sold

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Millions of people would have it

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
But of course, you know, classic sport games

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Like their Madden franchise will still continue to get roster updates

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
And support, because that thing is still on fire

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And it's got a huge following

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
For the Madden series, so

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
They literally had to bring this game up

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
They had to bump this from a B title

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
To an A title to fill in the gap

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Of a game that was so fucking terrible

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
They had to can it

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
This game was set up to fail

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Absolutely set up to fail

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
The time and energy spent to not release it

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Is definitely a hit in the bottom line

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
So for those fans of NBA Jam

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Looks like

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Whatever last copy you have

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
To own or to rent

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Is the last iteration you're going to have

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Sell the franchise to someone who knows what to do with it

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Seriously

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Konami? You never know

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I remember playing Double Dribble back in the day

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Which was pretty sweet

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
We did Blades of Steel, was that Konami as well?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Konami knows how to do some pretty sweet sport games

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
They're winning 11s

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I mean, unfortunately, soccer is not

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Big here in the US

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
But it's huge everywhere else

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
And that's a huge franchise

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
I just remember playing that game, Blades of Steel

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
The only time that it had

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Speech in an 8-bit NES game

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And Ten Yard Rush

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Ten Yard Dash

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Ten Yard Rush was the first Nintendo title

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That was another classic

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
But anyway, NBA Jam

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Coming to an end

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Well, we don't know if it's dead

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
They're stopping the roster

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
They're not going to support NBA Jam

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
It doesn't necessarily mean the death of it

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
But it's

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would say Outlook not good

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Yeah

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Definitely

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
My gut says it's coming to an abrupt end

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Sorry to the fans of that game

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Spaznator in our chatroom at

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
chat.orangelaundry.com says

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
If NBA Jam was either Xbox Live Arcade or PSN

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat, but no such luck

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I would have done the same thing

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Lots of people would

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Where did NBA Jam get its start?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
In the arcade

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Even if they had just buffed up

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
The old version with new rosters

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I would have been all over that

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I guess maybe the troubling part is

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Getting the rosters to match the

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Look and feel of the players

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Exploited heads and all that

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
If you download something

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
It's an awful lot of content to recreate

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Visually to someone's exploited head

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
I don't know, it's sad

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
But it's another sporting game that's kind of done

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
TigerKlon, our chatroom says

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Sell the franchise to Activision? They'll end up releasing

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
New NBA Jams every year

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
At least they'll get maintained, right?

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
We'll see

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Alright, moving on with some more news

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Um

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I don't know

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
We talked a little bit about this

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
How there was a temporary injunction

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Where

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
LG won against Sony

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
And they got some of the PlayStation 3

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Shipments held

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
In Europe

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
Sony actually won

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Overall

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
This was due to a patent dispute

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
And now

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I guess

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
They're saying that all the C's PlayStations

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Have been released

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
So um

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
That was quick, and it actually

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Only took about a day in the courts

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
To settle everything

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Well that was fast

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
After all that news about like, oh my god

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
It's gonna be a shortage of PlayStation 3

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Nope, it's done

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
And then on top of all that

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
And here we stop

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
And then on top of all that, LG had to pay legal fees

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And they got laughed out of court

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And also they're saying that for each day

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
If LG failed to comply

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
It would be fine

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
The rate of 200,000 euros

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Ouch

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Which is still a buck and a half each

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
That's a lot of money

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
That's $275,000 in

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
US dollars

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I think we might

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
We might actually have some audio from the

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Proceedings of the trial, let's see here

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Ah god dammit

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Somebody bombing on YouTube

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Never mind

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I think I did a little bit

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I was trying to find a clip here

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Let me see if I can find this

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Um

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Okay I think we have a clip here from

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
The trials proceedings here

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Let's see if we can get this out here

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
What kind of a reliable car are you gonna get

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
For $1,000?

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And I'm asking you, why didn't you

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Finish paying your brother for the car?

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Well judge, what I'm trying to say is

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
That bitch scares me

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Fucking love Judge Judy

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
She's amazing

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Did you see the episode with, um

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
She's doing her usual, you know

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Killing people with her eyes and her nose

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And someone lit up a cigarette

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
In the audience

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Not a plaintiff or defendant but an actual audience member

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Just chilling in the back

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And she's there going off in her

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Diablo fire, spewing

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
You want to smell smoke?

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I smell smoke

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
And some guy in the back

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Actually pretty well dressed, looked like in a suit

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Damn courtroom

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
So what kind of cigarette on TV on Judge Judy

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
How random is that

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
She still scares me

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I'm trying to see if I can find that in this

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
It's not on YouTube

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
It was a random episode that I just had me watching

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
When I was, you know

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
There is this one though

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
What kind of cigarettes did you buy?

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Marlboro Reds

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Marlboro Reds

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Marlboro Reds

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Marlboro Reds

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
It's my hearing or his speech

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I'm not sure

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I don't think I've ever seen the bailiff get sassy

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Did you hear that? No, it's his speech

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
The bailiff was getting a little sassy

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette before

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Going to court

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Anyhow, moving on

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
There is no overturning this ruling

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
If you want to sell your Gameboy

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Advanced craft to GameStop

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
You better do it quick

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
They're going to stop buying all of this in April

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So I think right now

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
They will buy a Gameboy Advance

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
For maybe like 20 bucks

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
But come April

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
They will not be buying them anymore

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
April 2nd supposedly is the date that's all happening

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
You can probably blame

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
The 3DS for this

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Because now everything's kind of kicked back at Generations

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
So there you go

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
There's no new Advanced games

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Being sold, this isn't really a big surprise anyway

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Although I will say

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I thought some GameStops still kind of specialized

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
In selling old shit

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Like usually in a big city there's at least one GameStop

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
That does kind of still carry the old shit

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Like the stockpile of NES games

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
I've seen regular GameBoy games for sale

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
At GameStop

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Are GameStops franchise or corporate owned?

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Corporate? Corporate

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
But it doesn't mean that you can't

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Put your GBA up on eBay

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Oh yeah

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
There's GBA and there's indie stores as well

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Which by the way the one by my house closed

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Yeah there used to be an indie store by my house

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It closed

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I know, sad

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Anyhow

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Let's go to the mailbag

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Every week you guys send us emails at

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
And we like to pick a few of our favorites

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
And read them here live on air

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
A very thin emailbag this week

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I'm very disappointed in all of you

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Because Loki doesn't look at me during the show

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So anyway, he's too into his

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Grand Theft Auto hacking thing

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Which by the way doesn't seem to be working too well

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
So we've got one email

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
This week that I'm going to read for you guys

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But it's a good one because it's from Belgium

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Ja? Ja

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
So this is an email from Belgium

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Hello good folks at OLR

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
My TV is about to die on me

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I'll have to buy a new one in the near future

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Can you give me any advice on what makes a good TV for gaming

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
And watching DVDs on a 360

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
And watching analog cable TV

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
How much milliseconds is good for gaming

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Contrast, etc.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
You already seem to know

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
What you're looking for because the delay

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Is what you're going to want for gaming

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
And the refresh rate on the screen

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I believe for PC monitors

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
You don't want to go any higher than 4

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Most monitors now are like 2

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
And I think the TVs are the same way aren't they?

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
2 millisecond refresh

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Something like that

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Here's how nerdy I am

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I use TV as my monitor from my office

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
For my PC computer

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Playing WoW on that thing is pretty fucking amazing

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
It is slightly orgasmic

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
And videos are nice on it too

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
But definitely look at refresh rates

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Definitely look at megahertz

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Refresh rate as well

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
60 or 120

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
High refresh is also preferred as well

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
And keep in mind that the

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Cheapie TVs right now

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Only go as high as 720p in HD

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
So definitely look at the pixelage

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
On the TV. Mine only goes as high as

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
1080i because I bought an HDTV

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Kind of on the cheap when HD technology

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Was still newish so they cut back

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Kind of that way

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
So double check that

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Don't forget to look

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
At the obvious because sometimes

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
They will kind of brush that over

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
To cut a couple hundred dollars. If it's cheap

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
There's probably a reason. Always remember that

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Definitely 1080p and refresh

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Rates are probably your two

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Pieces of information you want to hold up

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
People will tell you though you can't tell the difference

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Between 1080p and 1080i

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I kind of beg to differ. I think I can see it a little bit

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Especially in Blu-rays is where I can see it

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
And also HDMI cables

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Get the gold plated ones if you can

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
There's a better strength to that

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
At least I've noticed

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Spaznator PC in our chat room says

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Vizio is supposedly coming out with a

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
$300 3D HDTV this year

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
See, something's got to be wrong with it

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Although I don't know. My main TV is Vizio

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And I've been relatively happy with it

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
For the fact that it doesn't do 1080p

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Well, I have to look at

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I paid only $700 for it

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Several years ago when HDTV

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Was still kind of new-ish

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
So I can't complain too much

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
My TV monitor in my room is an

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
LG 46 inch

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I forget the model number

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
It's amazing. While on it plays very well

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
It serves well

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
For monitor use and all that

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Don't skip

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
On those two parts

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
The resolution and the refresh rate

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Well, moving on with our email from Belgium

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
There's more to it

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Also, I ripped the ligaments of my ankle a month ago

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
During a soccer game

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Yes, sports are healthy

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Because of this, I'm unable to play any game on Kinect

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
It made me think of the many disabled people

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Who cannot play movement controlled games

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Because of their condition

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
When the future of gaming really is Kinect

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Move, Wii, or whatever will be next

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I hope there will be a proper alternative

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
For them to play games

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
I think we've mentioned on the show before

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Gaming can't always 100% be

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
These technologies

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's nice to have

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
But it shouldn't always be a necessity

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I think there will always be

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Something for that core gamer

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Who just wants that controller in their hand

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
To play an RPG or a shoot-em-up

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Whatever it is

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
A good mix is a good thing

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Or maybe even games that take

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Disabilities into consideration

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Would be a great thing

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
There's many ways a person can be disabled

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
And you can't always think of everything

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
But it's always good to see game companies

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Be at least considerate

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Especially the big ones

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
Definitely

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Well, thanks again for making the show every week

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
You guys are awesome

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Greetings from Fabrice, Belgium

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Thank you very much

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Sounds like Febreze

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Not Febreze, I believe is the name

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I wonder if we can send the studio some waffles

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Chocolate

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Chocolate waffles with chicken

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
And fries, oh my god, Belgian fries

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Oh my god

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Road trip

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
No, there's a place in New York City I went to once

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And there was this restaurant in New York City

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
That just sold nothing but Belgian

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Like the French fry type thing

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
But like the Belgian big ones

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And like 20 different kinds of dips for the fries

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
That's the only damn thing this store sold

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Packed, packed, wall to wall

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
There's actually a place like that in old Sacramento

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Is there really?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
There's a lot of toppings or dips

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Why has my fat ass not been to this place?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
It sounds amazing

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Because old Sacramento is touristy and we live here and we don't go there

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I guess

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I've been to old SAC before, it's weird

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
They're like Spanish with jalapenos and nacho cheese

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
And they go to France

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
They've got like blue cheese on them and crap like that

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
The only problem I have, I can't believe this email is leading to talk about French fries

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But whatever, it's orange on the studio, deal with it

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
The thing is that those restaurants

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Usually like the fries with the dips

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Half of them are always mayo based

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Nope, those are out

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
I won't do mayo based things

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
French fries with mayonnaise, disgusting

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Anything with mayonnaise, disgusting

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
If you've known me for any length of time

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I hate, hate mayonnaise

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Good to know

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I won't be making any type of chicken salad for you for lunch

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Or put a honey mustard dip in it or something

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
That's not frickin' mayonnaise

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Anyhow

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Aw, the chat room's all, you guys are making me hungry

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Sorry

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Alright, well I guess maybe

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
The hunger might lead to a little bit of angst

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Cause I know when I don't eat, I get mad

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
So, uh, it's time for the FUs of the week

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Moji, start us off tonight

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Uh, fuck you too

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
The stupid Grant Without a Texture editor

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
It's out there

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
But it doesn't seem to do anything

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Working or whatever

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Hate that crap

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
And then, uh

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Yeah, that's basically it

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Screw that

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
I waited all this time and it doesn't open anything

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Well, I'm sure there's something wrong

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Or it's bugging or something, but I'll figure it out

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Uh, Matt2?

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Uh, I'm gonna give you

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Fuck you to midterms, I've got two of them this week

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
And, uh

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Yeah, not looking forward to finishing those

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
FU2 income taxes, I'll have to be

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Finishing those up here soon so I can

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Mail the check to Uncle Sam and

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Governor Brown, although it's really good

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
To not say Governorator anymore

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I will yield to that

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Um, and FU2Loki's

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Texture editor thing that I don't understand

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
That he seems pretty angsty about

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Um, FU to natural disasters

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Um, because

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
FU Mother Nature

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Uh, seriously, because, um, yeah, it's just

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Oh my gosh, I'm really glad that everybody I know

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Is kinda safe, but unfortunately I know like

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Thousands of people aren't safe, and that's just

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
It's just really hard to read

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Because that could really happen anywhere

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So I just, ugh, very sad

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
So anyway, um

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
There's an FU to that, and I would also say

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
FU to, um, money

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I don't have enough of it

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
I never do

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Banks have a lot of issues, kind of go in

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And ask for it nicely

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Well, if you put one of those Richard Nixon masks over your face

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Yes, and offer them a chocolate gun

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Maybe I could get some money

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
And then they'll give it to you magically

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Although the pursuing, um,

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Might go to jail for many years for that

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
The tie-in's something that Loki does often

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
If you get five stars after that bank chase

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
You're fucked

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Alright, couple more stories for you guys

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
At 1877 Game OLR

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
That's not opened yet, but it will be in a moment

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Yes, um, in case you're wondering why Activision

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Does what Activision does

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
They pull out year after year

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
It's because they're only encouraged by people

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
That buy those games

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And this isn't gonna help

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
If you're hoping for the Call of Duty franchise

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
To go away

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Call of Duty Black Ops is the

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
US's best selling game ever

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
It has beaten everything

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
In only about four months

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And, uh,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
That includes also

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
The sales of Wii Play

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Which Nintendo claims is around 13 million copies

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I thought this was a down economy

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Oh my gosh

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
13 million copies of Wii Play

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Is way too many of that freaking game

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
But even, oh my gosh

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
See, I don't really play the Call of Duty games

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I can't really hate on them

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I've seen them played

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
I understand why dudes like them

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
But not a series I personally get into

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
So this is now the best selling game of all time?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
All time

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Oh my gosh, that's crazy

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
It really is

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
It really is

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Halo

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
They sold 5.6 million units day one

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Bigger than WoW?

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I guess so

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Bigger than everything

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Well, are you counting subscription based

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Or are you counting true sales of the original and expansions?

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Well, I don't think you get to combine original and expansions

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I think you just have to count original, I suppose

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Yeah, but still

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
It's pretty hot

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Alright, one more story for you guys

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
And it has to do with rumors

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
What a freaking shock

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
That the rumors are already starting about an

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Xbox 720 and a Wii 2 announcement

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
At E3

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Well, it has to do

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
And here's where they're coming from

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
It has to do with some tech demos

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
That Epic is showing about the next gen graphics

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Because their whole Unreal

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Engine upgrade and all that

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
The Guardian in the UK

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Is reporting that there is going to be

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
A Wii 2 that will include a Blu-ray

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Drive, a quad-core

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
processor, and a built-in LED projector

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
The projector will display

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
gameplay. Isn't this

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Weren't these the early rumors of the revolution

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
That the 3D was going to be projected

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Although, funny enough

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Isn't it funny that we did end up getting

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
3D from Nintendo, it just wasn't

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
The Wii, it was the 3DS

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
The Guardian should not be a source for

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Anything when it comes to, like, consoles

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Duh, there's gonna

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Sequel to successful console?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Really? There's gonna be

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
A new console for Nintendo?

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Woah, I do not see that coming at all

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
I love this too, it's also the

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Right time because Nintendo does

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Console announcements every five years

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
The Nintendo 64 in

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
96, the GameCube

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
In 2001, and the Wii

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
In 2006, so surely

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Loki, surely the time is

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Right for Wii 2

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
You know, we didn't become the

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Super game analysts of the world

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
For nothing, so let me just tell you

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
How it's actually done, The Guardian

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
First off

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
They're trying to extend their console

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Cycles now because, well

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
It sucks making a new console

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Every few years, and honestly, you know

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Technology does get better, but I mean

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Graphics-wise, what are you gonna really push now?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
And they don't really care about graphics

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Because they're Nintendo

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
And that would make the price

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Of their console go up quite a bit

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Now, not to say that we're not gonna

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
See another Nintendo console

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
That's the Wii, you know, we may see something

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Like we were saying before, that's kind of a

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Next step, like, um, you know

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Like people are saying the Wii HD

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Or something that may be a little bit

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
More souped up, is it gonna have an

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
LCD projector in it?

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Probably not, because that's

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
That's stupid, I mean

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
That's just kind of weird

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It's just ridiculous

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Why would I need a projector on my console?

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Project things onto my naked body

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
That's a horrible, horrible thought

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
I have no words

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Mario could jump up and down on my wang

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
That's one platform-based game right there

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Oh my god, can you think about the YouTubes

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
That are gonna come from a projected Wii game

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
I mean, it's not like it's that hard

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
To hook up a console to a projector

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
I mean, you can walk into Fry's and buy a projector

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
My buddy's done it before with an Xbox original

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
He had Mario jump on his wang?

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
No, he's hooking up an L

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
He took an LCD projector

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
And respective cables and components

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And was able to project the image

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Of the game on a blank wall

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
But that's because we had to take down posters

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
So a projector is gonna need space

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Blank canvas to work on

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
It's not gonna happen

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
No, that's dumb

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I'm sorry

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
No, they're not gonna do that

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
And a quad-core processor

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Or something like that

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Really? Really?

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
A quad-core processor?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Is that what you think

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
The fastest thing is out there?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I mean, shit

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
The fucking 360 has more cores than that

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Nintendo's main release

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
I think this year is not the Wii 2

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Or the Wii Squared, it is the 3DS

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
And that's what they're gonna stick to

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
They don't need to

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
They don't need to even think about a new console

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Until their system starts becoming number one

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
The Wii is still popular

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
It's releasing decent games

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
They're still playing it

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
The 3DS is gonna continue that

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Now the thought is, of course, that they may want to try to get the jump

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
On the next generation

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Because the 360 did have that jump

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
And they did pretty well

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I don't know

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
They're just not gonna do some sort of Blu-ray

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Crazy

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
They don't need to

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
For one, Sony owns Blu-rays

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
That'd be kinda weird

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Well, I still think that the next-gen consoles

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Especially on the 360

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Or you're gonna see something that's not a DVD drive

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
They have to because of the capacity

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Yeah, because you just can't

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Did they always say

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Never to use projectors with games

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
It was always the first line in the various instruction manuals

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Yeah, because of burn-in

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
But that's just old-school projectors

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
And even still

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
You're not gonna want to do that

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Because old-school projectors

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Nowadays, there's still some latency for that

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
But no

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Why would you even have a fucking projector

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
On a console? That makes no sense

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Like I said

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
To project Mario onto my naked body

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
It's seriously some guy making a story

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
The cell tabloid

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
The guardian

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Spaznator in our chatroom says

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Sky, that's a mental picture I seriously didn't need

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Thank you

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Is it possible to bleach a mental picture out of one's mind?

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Yes, just pour the bleach into your ears

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I don't know, let me ask you here

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Hold on

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
And now I present a little bit of Mario

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Jumping on my wang

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Hold on, let's see if I can

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Project Mario here

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Jumping on my wang

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Really don't

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Ow!

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Did he jump on a ball?

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
That was like the shittiest NES rip of a game

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
It really was

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
No, but seriously

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
If they're gonna do something with their next

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Or Wii

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
The next Wii or whatever

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
It's gonna be just kind of an HD upgrade

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I don't even think it would need to be necessarily

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
On

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
You know, non-DVD

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Platform, because right now

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Fuck, they are not even really using dual layer

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
There's like two games that use dual layer DVDs

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
For the Wii

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
There's no real need to do that

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
In order for the Wii to be competitive

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Like for like, you need to

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Throw in blu-ray capacity and some type of

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Body-sensing motion device

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Because that's what the two consoles have right now

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
As Rob Giggles, like a little school girl

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
So, what is the Wii

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Squared to, whatever

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Maybe it's not a projector, maybe it's like a

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
A wang

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Well, then they're already on par with

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Their competition, they'd have to exceed

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Their competition

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Now, this is getting off of Star Trek for me

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
But if they did some type of holography or hologram

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Or something like that instead of a projection

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Then they'd have something, but again, what would you use it for?

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
No, it's The Guardian

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
They're not really newsworthy

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
It's entertaining, although if they named the Xbox

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Second iteration the 720

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Really?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
No, it's what everybody wants to call it

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
They're gonna call it something cool and hip

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Well, I'll tell you what an awesome name would be, The Bacon

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
They just call it The Xbox Bacon

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Who doesn't love bacon?

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Want to come over and play with bacon? Fuck yeah!

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I don't know if they should really call

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
The sequel of a console that had issues with heat

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Baking

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Not a good thing

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
They called a

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
The most popular console in America right now

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Is called The Wii

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
That's what little girls do when they sit on the toilet

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
They Wii

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
I remember the commercials when it came out

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Those two creepy HD guys would come up

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
We would like to play? I'm like, whoa

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
This game's for pedophiles or something like that

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
This console's a little bit weird

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
And then it was motion controlled

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
And hilarity ensued

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
What would you call the red ring of death

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
On a console called bacon?

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I don't know, there's got to be some type of

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Joke there someplace, it's not coming to me

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
There would never be a ring or red

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
On any Microsoft console

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Going forward

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
A Jewish Xbox

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
This Xbox is kosher

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
It's made by Jewish monks

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I tease because I love, come on people

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
I guess I could say something about

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
There is job postings at Microsoft

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Looking for hardware engineers

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
To quote, define and deliver next

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Generation console architectures

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Well, no shit they're making a new Xbox

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Doesn't mean it's coming out of E3 this year

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
These things are going to be like

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Four years out, you know, it'll be a while

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
So

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Do you think Apple is rumored to

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Release some type of a gaming console?

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
That's a lot of buzz in the whole Apple world

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
What I think they're going to do is

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Yes, it's called the iPad

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
The gaming console, come on people

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
That's retarded, first off

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Oh goody, I get to plug an HDMI cable

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Into my iPad and be tethered to my TV

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
No thanks

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Oh, and I'm sure that

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Cable cost you $40 to make

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Fuckers

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Oh, my mistake, $30

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Well that totally makes sense, a piece of cable

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
That's like a few

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Feet long, what, like six

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Six feet?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I remember the size, it was $29.99 for the

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
HD adapter thing to send

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
And 1080p

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
From the pad

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
To a compatible

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
TV

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
So I'm going to credit AkumaJP in our chatroom for this comment

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
But perhaps this could be the sequel to

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
The Nintendo Wii, could be this

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
She's an awfully jolly lady

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Wait, best part's coming out

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Flushing? Yep

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
You're joking right, I've never seen this before

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Here comes the punchline

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Wait for it

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Sitting on the toilet

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Yeah, FLUSH!

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
The Nintendo Flush, this year at E3.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
It's videos like that that keep me gay.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Rob, why do you do this to me? I thought we were friends.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
It was the chatters! The chatters said it!

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
But you played it!

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
It's every gamer has a voice, even that lady.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Now she's one of those challenge people that probably couldn't use the Kinect.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Yeah, the Kinect.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Because she'd be sitting on the toilet and have minimal body movement for the Kinect.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Oh lord.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I have to go home and favorite that now.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
It's pretty awesome.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Spread it around.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
You gotta admit.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:11.000
I was trying to find the 8-bit remix of that song to prove that she plays video games, but I don't know.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
I guess it's not on YouTube anymore. Whatever.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Anyhow, I guess we can open up the Skype line now and take some calls.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.000
1-877-GAMO-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Give us a call. We'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Hopefully it's gaming-related, but if you want to talk about sitting on the toilet, then more power to you.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
So the phones are open right now. Let's take some calls.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
We'd rather you didn't talk about sitting on the toilet.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
That's true. So let's go to some calls.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
This is that one, Akke Ripper from Sweden.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
What's up, Akke Ripper? I haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Yeah, well, I have been away. Oh, no, I haven't been away. I've just been sleeping like when you're on.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Unfortunately.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
No worries. What's on your mind tonight?

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:01.000
What was I going to say? Well, I could talk about Dragon Age 2, which I have already finished.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Ah, what do you think?

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
It's marvelous.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Once again, to the minor story behind it, well, I got it on Wednesday, and I got it pretty early because it locked up.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:21.000
It was unlocked at midnight to Thursday, my time.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:30.000
So what is it? At 3 o'clock Wednesday, your time, I think it is, and got unlocked.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And like 40 or 50 hours later, I beat it. It was quite nice, really. It's thumbs up.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Do you recommend it?

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
I do recommend it highly.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
How was the lovemaking?

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
How was the lovemaking?

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000
It was quite nice, I do say.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.000
It was quite nice, from what I see.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
It's a nice.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
It's quite a nice.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000
But here's the other thing though. Since really I almost, but here's the other thing.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Well, I did make love to one of the characters, but here's the other thing though.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Since really, really, really, these love scenes in both Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins and Origins 1 is awkward beyond fucking awkward.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:39.000
It's like, I don't even want to see, I close my eyes.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:50.000
No! No! Really? Really? What the hell?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Just no, no.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
This is the best video game review we've ever had on this show.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I'm glad to be here, present for this.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:09.000
But other than that, it really is a kick-ass game.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Unfortunately a bit shorter than the first Origins, but it's on par with Mass Effect 2.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And maybe even longer than Mass Effect 2 on second thought.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Well, I would say really bi. And most of the, and also, it really makes up for one of the, yeah, how the fuck will they continue this?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Even though, one of the comments that I found on Twitter is that the whole story in Dragon Age 2 is like a origin story, if that makes sense.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Overall, yeah, so thumbs up.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Also, Tactics Orger has finally been released, and that's quite funny.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Also, on side notes, as usual, I play as a girl character, because I don't, because here's the other thing though.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I don't even like playing as a male character, because, well, hello, I'm one of those trannies, whatever, that's not, that, if I even would choose.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I don't even want to be a man, and I don't want to be a girl, either.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:31.000
That doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with it though, because I like to play, like all of my characters in World of Warcraft are women,

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:36.000
and that's just because people are nicer to you, because they think you have big boobs sitting there behind the monitor.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I just, it's totally like selfish reasons, like, you know.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Yeah, well, in a way. Also, in a kind of way, there are, I should point out also, I play, as usual, I play, I was on the difficulty settings of casual,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
which means that I, in one way, breezed it through, and was all like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:13.000
But here's the other thing though, even though if you play on casual, you will actually have minor problems on two places though.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Which I did have problems on two places, but after all I did some thoughts on two things, and was like, yeah, it's not that hard, really.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:34.000
But it will be kind of hard in some places.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Well, I don't blame you for playing on the easiest level. I've been playing Torchlight on the easiest level, because I just want to, you know, jam through the game and kind of see everything that's there.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But, you know, sometimes you just want to kind of take in the story, or in some cases, get straight to the lovemaking.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Yeah, but also, since I've seen the ending to Dragon Age 2, it makes me actually want to replay origins, so my warden can make love to a certain character,

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:18.000
so to set up certain things in Origins 2.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000
You have to go back and get the right characters to fall in love so that the lovemaking can continue in 2 now.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Or the STDs.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Yeah, can you pass the STDs from one game to another? Alright, forget it.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Alright, Ate Ripper, to be quite honest, I don't ever want this call to end, but I've got people...

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Yeah, also, before I go, there has been released a new trailer for apparently two expansions on Sims games.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Ah, yes.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:29:02.000
One apparently animal expansion for the console version, and then we have, like, what is it, Sims 3 Pets or something, and then you have some Sims 3 Generations, which is apparently for the PC version.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Unfortunately, though, there has been no signs of weather effects, which is a bit sad, because I do want weather effects.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:22.000
But here's the other thing, though. It makes interesting, because, well, raising kids in Sims is quite fun, and with this expansion, it will expand that.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Do you think there will be a Sims 4 anytime soon?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Not likely. Not that it seems so.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Also, side note, they don't say any date for the Generations 1, but for the animal expansion on console, it's at November 2011.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Alright.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
So, um...

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Yeah.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Alright. Well, Ate Ripper, I gotta let you go so I can get to some of the calls, because I got people from PAX East that are just dying to get through.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Yeah, well...

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Honestly, you need to have a video game review podcast. You need to think about it.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Oh, well, well. Oh, well.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Later on! Take care, buddy!

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Yeah, later.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Bye.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Where is he from again?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Sweden.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I'm going to Sweden.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:15.000
You know, and here's the thing. He hasn't called us in quite a long time, because, you know, it's like, freaking what? Like, they're eight, nine hours ahead of us right now?

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
At least nine.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I don't know how Daylight Savings kind of plays that. So it's like four or five o'clock in the morning over there right now, so I can't blame him for not staying up every week to listen to OLR.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Word.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.000
God damn, that was worth it. Alright, that was worth the wait.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Alright, I'm going to do a rare outbound call, because I promised these guys they could get through, and it's about PAX East, so I want to do this call real quick if I can.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Sorry to those folks trying to get through right now, but I did promise this call, because I want to talk to at least one person that went to PAX East this week.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.000
We'll do some more incoming calls in a minute. Just hold on. Hold on, guys.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:58.000
By the way, a question in the chatroom if I've played Mortal Kombat. Hey, hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Hey, it's DJ Rama S and DDR Dollar Bill.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Hey, you guys. Some of our regular callers here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know you guys went to PAX East, right?

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Yeah.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.000
So fucking tell us about it. What happened? What'd you see?

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.000
It was great, but Rob, before we continue, there's one thing you need to know.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
What?

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Yeah. The anime title, FLCL, is called Fully Coolie.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Oh, my bad. I'm just, I'm not, you know, cultured enough to know these things. I'm sorry.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I knew that.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
It's okay, we forgive you.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Alright.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:46.000
I've learned something here on the show tonight. Tell me about PAX East already. I don't care about that damn anime.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Okay, Rob.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Yes.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I played the 3DS.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Yes.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
It's fucking awesome. Yes.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Even though, okay, let me ask this question now, because I've been, you know, I said ever since E3, I was like, dude, the minute you play one, it will sell you one.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Like, it almost violates that golden rule of gaming, that the system is only as good as the games that are on it, because seriously, does it even matter that the games are subpar right now?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Nope. Doesn't matter at all.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:19.000
It's the technology, right? The first time you see it, it's kind of, did you do that thing where you looked at it and then you went, whoa, whoa, this is like real.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Yeah. And the funny thing is, back where I used to live, when I used to get my monthly bus passes, they actually had a 3D effect similar to the 3DS screen, so I was automatically used to it.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Right. So what did you get to play on it?

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000
The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
And what did you think?

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:56.000
It was great. Now, here's something, I don't know if you've covered it, because the stream was dropping for us as we were traveling, but when you play with, when you grab the slingshot, you can actually move the 3DS around for targeting in the game.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Oh, see, these are some of like the new features from this entire game.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Oh, well, that's it. I have to totally buy this rehash of a 64 game, because they have motion controls now.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Oh.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
It's different.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Damn, Loki. Who put the hater in your tree today, man? Dang, oh.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:25.000
He's been hating for a couple of weeks now. It's all right. But yet, did you hear the part where he's ordered both a Japanese and an American 3DS?

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I don't blame him because of region locking, so you know.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Yeah. So, what else was there? I heard Children of Eden was there, and I hear it's like amazing. Did you guys play it?

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:41.000
I didn't, but Alpha Kanabran, he was like, it was amazing. Yeah.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
And that look was like fucking orgasm.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I want to know more about it. Well, how did the show compare to last year?

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:58.000
It was, in a way, kind of felt like last year was a little bit better, but on the same token, it was just oh so much to see, you know?

02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Yeah.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:05.000
It was like, Exo Hall was twice as large, tabletop gaming was twice as huge, you know?

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Wow.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:15.000
And it was a lot more, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, the number one horned out game at this con.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Of course.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Of course. Of course everybody's going to be playing that. Did you check out the classic gaming room while you were there?

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Yeah, I got in there for a little bit. It had all of your favorite games in there, too.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Awesome. What about panels? Did you spend any time going to a panel or anything?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:41.000
I went to the video game music panels. I went to one about OC Remix, where two of the composers did live the opening to Final Fantasy VI.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Oh, that's hot.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Yeah.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Was that as awesome as it sounds?

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Say what?

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Was that as awesome as it sounds?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Much better. I recorded it. Instead of getting a chance, I'm going to throw it up on YouTube.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Nice. Very cool. Alright, so what was the best thing about PAX East altogether?

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Oh, man. That's a lot.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:11.000
That's a lot. I mean, I went just for two things. The 3DS and Duke Nukem Forever. Got my play. It was great.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.000
What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
What was what?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:28.000
It was fucking win. I mean, you start out in a football field punching people so you get the weapon and you start blowing shit up.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Was there titties?

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Real life titties, yes. Oh, yeah.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Wait, are we talking about Duke Nukem Forever still, or are we talking about like you just saw titties in the expo hall, like randomly?

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I'm talking about the booth babes, my brother. The booth babes.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Of course, the booth babes. Nice.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Well, anything else you want to get out about PAX East before I get to more calls?

02:35:54.000 --> 02:36:04.000
It was fun. It's worth it to come because as we were hanging out Saturday night, the way it was laid out, it was like not really stressful.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:13.000
This kind of revitalizes the reason why I go to conventions and also there was no appointment per se set up for demos.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:21.000
You could email them and they will email you back if you want a time to come in to check out particular products and games.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:29.000
But even though I was pressed, you had to wait just like everybody else except on Saturday where you're allowed in an hour early.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Alright, that's cool. That's cool. I'm glad to hear it because we were getting a little worried on some of the things we heard, but I guess they were just rumors.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Last I could have heard was not exactly true. That's the problem.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Alright. Well, one other thing I want to ask. Did you guys catch, what was the last Omegathon game this year? I haven't heard yet.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:54.000
We couldn't do that because we had to drop off Misty and Alpha Kinanagram at the train station and the airports.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Aw, bummer. Alright. Well, maybe somebody in chat will yell it out. I'm sure it's going to hit the internet somewhere.

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
O-L-R invasion next year.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Next year, PAX East 2012, O-L-R-Con. It's going to be you, me, Dark Sakura, Loki, TDR Dollar Bill, Misty, Alpha Kinanagram, Zaku, the whole crew.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:22.000
We're getting a suite. We're getting some alcohol. We're bringing the 360s. We're going to jury rig the TV. We're going to get our gaming on.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.000
And boobs. Hell yeah.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Alright. Well, you guys have fun. Be safe on your drive back and thanks for letting me bug you even though you're on the show every week anyway, Rama.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Hahahaha. Love you too, man.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Later, DDR Dollar Bill. Drive safe. I said later, DDR Dollar Bill too. Drive safe, you guys. Later.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Awesome. Let's get some more calls.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? It's Zaku here. Hey, Zaku, buddy. What's on your mind?

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Yup. I, too, also went to PAX with Adam. Awesome. Also known as Rama.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I mean, yeah, sure, it was my first PAX, but at least I was able to pull off a decent trip to Boston.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Even though it was like, the way I see it is, what the fuck?

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.000
It's all good. What did you think of PAX East? What did you play?

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Yeah, I mean, I did try to partake in most of the things on the show floor, but the lines were too long.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:35.000
There was no way I was going to spend two hours waiting to see what's inside the LA Nor booth, let alone the Battlefield 3 one.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:45.000
By the way, just quickly, I know Adam for a fact that he endured whatever he did to see the 3DS, but it was almost E3-like.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Where the lines would just stretch literally around the booth.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:56.000
That's the only turn off, and I guess it's part of the fact that PAX is pretty much like a poor man's E3.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Was there just too damn many people?

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Pretty much. Compared to all the other cons I've been to, even the ones I've been to in the Javits Center in New York, this was by far one of the largest I've ever been to.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Well, the East Coast sadly doesn't get a lot, so I'm not surprised at all that everybody comes in.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:36.000
PAX does fill that void for folks that can't actually make it out to E3, so it's creating that whole experience, that experience itself, without having to go on the other side of the country.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:45.000
But more to my point, I did cosplay on Saturday, and I'm just trying to upload the picture I took personally.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:51.000
I mean, I post for several pictures, some for media, but I didn't make Kotaku's roll. But I'll upload mine.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Well, let me ask you quickly, I want to take it back to the games a little bit. Even though the lines were long, I'm assuming you got your hands on some things, right?

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Yeah, some. I wouldn't say a lot, but it's like, I was just hanging, you know, just going from some booths.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.000
What did you play that's worth talking about right now?

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Oh man, I can't even think off the top of my head. Homefront. Homefront, yeah.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
And how was that?

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Pretty much, that's definitely one thing I'm going to buy on Tuesday. Well, for PC that is, but the 360 version is just as good.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:31.000
That was what I was able to get my hands on without having to wait hours in line.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Most of the major titles there, they were, you know, it's like, you're going to spend hours just going through two or three of them, and that's going to cut into most of your day on the show floor.

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Did you get to do any other of the sights and sounds of E3 that wasn't just the...

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Yeah, I went to the harmonics panel.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Oh, how was that?

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Saturday. It was pretty good, I mean, you know, I managed that.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Did they comment on the whole sale from MTV and all that?

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:11.000
No, it was just like, well, what they did was like a reverse Q&A where they actually, you know, where the panel asked questions to, you know, the fans that lined up to speak.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:25.000
So, I was basically asked a question on, you know, how to deal with like asshole, you know, fans that complain about some of the most obvious and like unrealistic things about the game.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:32.000
And so I had to, you know, I was basically asked my opinion on those, you know, on that particular subject.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.000
What did you say?

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:42.000
So, I managed to relate it to the DDR scene, well, my local DDR scene, and I pretty much like got a pretty good ovation out of it.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Props to you, buddy.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I know, if it was recorded live, I'm pretty sure my comment was up there.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.000
You know, if the panel, you know, mentions a military zombie, that was me.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
So, are you going back to PAX next year?

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Yeah, I mean, this time I have to stay in, you know, I have to stay in the hotel right next to the con, but yeah, I'll definitely do it.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:12.000
It's just that I may have to like go, I may have to take that day off, you know, that Friday off just to get my hands on the show early.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:18.000
I'd take a whole week off to go to E3, although I'm probably not going this year, but yeah, it's a lot, so.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Alright, well, Zacko, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even if you can get your hands on all the good stuff.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Sounds like you found a few gems in there somewhere, so.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Yep, sure did.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Alright, well, hopefully, see you next year.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Definitely.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Alright, later.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Bye.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I need to make a whole to-do of it and just go out to the East Coast.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
You're a fan of New York City, right, Matt, too?

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
I know you love to go out to New York City and all that.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Absolutely.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:47.000
We have a lot of listeners out in New York City, and I've gone out there a couple times and done like meetups, and we had some nice like Dave and Buster's fun, and did some random things out in the city, it's cool.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Yeah, New York is good, and it's expensive.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
We'll go to PAX East next year, don't you want to go to Boston and play some games?

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Baston?

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Baston?

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I have never been to Baston before, to walk in the park.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Baston is fun.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I went to Baston, I went with somebody who went to college there, say did some schooling there, so he knew the area pretty well, and we had fun.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Boston's actually on one of my lists of cities to see in the East, but yeah, New York is a lot of fun.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:15.000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLawninsRadio, what the hell, we usually only do three, but I'm feeling generous tonight, let's do one more call.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:21.000
While we wait for a call, oh, call's coming in right now, I guess we'll go to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLawninsRadio, who's this?

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Hi, this is Baston here.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Hey buddy, what's on your mind?

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Just to be different this week, rather than talking about videos, I'll be touching on MMOs this time.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Alright, MMOs.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Yeah, specifically two of them, DC Universe Online and Final Fantasy XI, mainly because you guys kind of touched on them earlier.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Well, one thing that wasn't mentioned that is kind of interesting is that supposedly, at least with DC Universe Online, sometime within the near future, I think within the next month or two, there's going to be a digital download version appearing on the PSN store.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:28.000
And I had heard of that, that they're going to do a full digital download, which wouldn't be too unrealistic. I mean, Xbox 360 does something similar already with some of the games, and I believe PlayStation has a handful of games you can buy.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:32.000
I want to say one of them was day and date of Street Release.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.000
World of Warcraft's latest expansion was full digital download as well, which was awesome.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Hell, PC thrives on digital download. Hello Steam. I mean, Steam is like PC gaming right now. It's a big chunk of it, so I'm kind of not surprised all PS3 is going in that direction.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:56.000
DC Universe Online is a Sony online entertainment, so it's another branch of the same company, same family, so not surprised at all by that news, but neat.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Yeah, well, some doing that has its ups and downs depending on how you look at it. On one hand, yeah, there's the convenience factor, no doubt about that.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:29.000
At least with the beta that went on, granted, it was beta not the full retail releases, obviously there's going to be differences, but at least with the beta, that was a pretty freaking huge file.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:34.000
I mean, it was like, what, ballpark figure of 15 gigabytes?

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
It was huge.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Yeah, and even if you got a pretty hefty hard drive inside your system, there's still a good chunk of your hard drive dedicated to one game, but hopefully most PS3 owners have already, at least at $1.40, already upgraded their hard drive at least once.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.000
So what did you want to say on Final Fantasy XIV?

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Well, actually 11, not 14.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Oops, sorry, 11.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Yeah, well, you know how you were mentioning that, at least temporarily speaking, that they're going to be shutting down the servers for the game because of the recent earthquake?

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Right.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Well, just prior to that earthquake hitting, they had made an announcement that they're already going to be consolidating some of the servers.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Uh oh, that's usually the sign for the MMO that things are going downhill, but you know what though, come on, Final Fantasy XI's had a good run, and Sony did kind of probably siphon some of the players with a release of 14, kind of cannibalized 11 a little bit.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Yeah, well, I hate to mention a rival podcast, but this is where I got the information from.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:32.000
There's a podcast that's dedicated to Final Fantasy XI called Limit Break Radio, and they had a very small podcast, their most recent entry for that show on their website.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:48:01.000
The main host had mentioned that the first time they consolidate the servers, there was a need for it, then yeah, they could see what they did, but the second round of consolidation of servers, they don't see what the logic behind that was because once this new round of consolidation goes through,

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:18.000
the servers would probably actually be overpopulated, and for those trying to do the end game kind of thing, it's going to be a lot more difficult for those people because the competition for the mobs and...

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:30.000
They might be worried that they're going to hemorrhage more users because of some of the other MMOs that are out, just with Rift and DC Universe and so on, maybe they're just worried, they're kind of being proactive, I suppose.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Well, it's kind of sad to see Final Fantasy XI going this route for the reasons that you just mentioned, because it's kind of foreboding.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Granted, I haven't played the game in a year or two now because of financial reasons, but I was always hoping that eventually once I was able to, I could get back into the game because I love the game so much.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:17.000
There'll always be at least one server up, it's a Final Fantasy game, it'll never die completely. I want to ask you real quick before I let you go, since you brought up MMOs and I know you're big on Sony products and Sony fanboy and all that, and you like free things, what do you think about the announcement of Free Realms coming to PlayStation 3?

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Well, I really haven't formed an opinion as of yet, because obviously I haven't played Free Realms, either on PS3 because it hasn't come out yet for it, and I just got my computer not even two months ago and it just barely runs some games, albeit poorly.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:55.000
So, until I actually play something, I can't really form a decent opinion about it, but I'm willing to at least give it a try.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:17.000
I'll tell you what, once I give it a try, let's say for a multitude, I'll either send an email or call in and essentially give a mini review of it. That way I can be a little bit more fair and balanced about it.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Alright, we'll be looking to hear from you.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Alright, but for now we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one buddy!

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Yep, you too, take care.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Alright, later!

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight, thank you guys so much for calling, sorry to those who didn't get through, if you didn't get through tonight, you can always send us an email, our mailbag had like one email in it tonight you guys, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, type out your thoughts and we'll read them next week on the show.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:47.000
But for now, last minute stories, I forgot to ask Loki, we had some back to back calls tonight, Loki did you have any last minute stories?

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:55.000
Not too much actually, this is kind of stupid, you know, same thing with DJ Hero, I care about that, I don't really care about this.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:51:06.000
But Guitar Hero, hey look, there's more DLC coming out, now I know we said that we weren't going to put anything out because we're done with that series, but the phones asked for it so we're putting out more DLC.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Well thank you for graciously giving us DLC for your game that you've decided to discontinue, whatever.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Anyway, so those tracks coming to Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, they're from the artist Trapped, and you get modern...

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Didn't you read this earlier in the show?

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:26.000
I already did.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Sorry!

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
We were trying to design textures for GTA.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
I was the only one, Matt.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:36.000
I didn't read the story with any angst, so I was trying to do a little bit of journalistic...

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:43.000
It's still stupid though because they say, oh well we're just continuing the series, ah just kidding we're going to put it out because the fans want it.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000
Who listens to the fans?

02:51:46.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Um, there's apparently the guy that Dan Fortin from Midway, who's now a part of NetherRealm I guess, you may remember him as the Toasty guy.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.000
He's coming back in the new Mortal Kombat game.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Toasty!

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Yes.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Alright.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Well, that's going to do it, I guess if that's it for the last minute stories.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.000
I believe it is.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Another episode of Orange Launch Radio has come to a close, but not before we say goodnight to everybody.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Starting off with Matt too, thank you for being here tonight and filling in for Dark Sakura.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.000
Thanks for the invite, I appreciate it.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
You did a good job with the news tonight.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Well, thank you very much.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Alright, so we'll have to have you back again sometime.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Hopefully not to fill in for someone.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Exactly.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Maybe just to be the fourth wheel at another point.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Fifth, you've got the chat room.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.000
That's true, we do have the chat room.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Always present fourth guest on the show.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000
I'll be the spare tire.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.000
The fifth wheel.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.000
I'll be the spare tire in the back.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Excellent.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.000
I'll be the junk in your trunk.

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Well, we'll see you again, don't wait two years before coming back.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Um, Nutrisystem sucks.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Although it's working, it sucks.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:57.000
I did have dinner tonight consisting of Buffalo Wing Pretzel Bites and macaroni and cheese in a cup.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Delicious.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Yes.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Not.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
I'm going to go eat something else when I get home.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Final thoughts?

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
No, really great to be here.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Hopefully I'll be invited back on your other podcast in the future so I can be the Deckard Cain of your show and stay a while and listen.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Of course.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:15.000
But no, thank you for having me.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Look, it was a pleasure seeing you and I will work on my angst next time.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:20.000
And thanks for the beer.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Did it work?

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Maybe.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Maybe.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
I've got two more at home.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Awesome.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Alright, I want to say a final thought, headaches suck.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
Beer doesn't make headaches better either.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:34.000
It's too bad.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:35.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
I am tracking my 3DS.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.000
It's coming out of Oakland right now so I will have that tomorrow for sure.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Alright.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.000
It must get stolen first.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Unless the plane crashes or they lose it.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Or it doesn't get stolen in Oakland.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
We really appreciate it.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:58.000
You know, we don't ask for anything to do this show except tonight we do ask you to

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:03.000
donate at least $10 to the Red Cross for a game and donate to those in need this week.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:04.000
It's very important.

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:08.000
However, outside of that, the way you can help promote this show and continue what we

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.000
do here, just tell a friend.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
Tell a friend about the show.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Even if you like, I don't know who to tell about the show, leave a nice 5 star review

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.000
on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast at.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Forums.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I actually get the little emails from Google and see people talk about it on forums and

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.000
I just really appreciate you guys that say nice things about the show.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
It doesn't go unnoticed.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000
I really appreciate it.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:31.000
So, until next time, we'll be back with Dark Soccer to do it all again next week.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:35.000
I hope you all have a wonderful night and until then, bye bye.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
Be safe this week.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.000
