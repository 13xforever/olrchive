1
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, March 20th, 2011, some big games get delayed.

3
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:20,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The NES classic River City Ransom will soon have a sequel.

4
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And could a Silent Hill game be on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?

5
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:32,133
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

6
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I beat your butt at pinball effects.

7
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pinball effects on what?

8
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: PS3?

9
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:56,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox.

10
00:00:56,913 --> 00:01:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: You were literally showing me this while the opening was going so I didn't have time to process this.

11
00:01:00,314 --> 00:01:01,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just found the picture.

12
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm putting it up on our thing.

13
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:04,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gee, thank you.

14
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,236
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the icons because I think it's cute.

15
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:08,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Your icon's like, sad face.

16
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's like, one!

17
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:11,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, is that Next Monster 60?

18
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,681
[SPEAKER_05]: The FX2 or whatever?

19
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,081
[SPEAKER_05]: The new one?

20
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have FX2.

21
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:15,725
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have FX.

22
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got samples of the FX tables.

23
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:20,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll get into that in my gaming week.

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, at some point, I don't want to spoil your gaming week, but you should get the FX2 because the shell is free.

25
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:25,639
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I totally want.

26
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally want.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

28
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:32,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us tonight, say hello, as he does every week, to the one and only Tech Master, Loki!

29
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:32,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

30
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Loki?

31
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

32
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

33
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki's brought some new toys to the show tonight that he's been showing off.

34
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:39,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

35
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,305
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to tell our listeners about what you've brought to the studio?

36
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought a 3DS from Japan.

37
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not privy enough to get one of the US ones early.

38
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to be getting one on time, though.

39
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

40
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: With Street Fighter, because...

41
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,536
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bundle I picked.

42
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Motor Store Apocalypse.

43
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:03,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I got review code for that because Sony loves me so much.

44
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:05,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Or because I bought it off eBay.

45
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:06,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

46
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:15,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I noticed you've been taking pictures over and over there, and you've been uploading them to originalstudio.com.

47
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:21,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually took a picture on the 3DS of myself, so I could see myself in 3D, so that, you know, because looking in a mirror obviously isn't good enough.

48
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see what I would look like on a 3DS, the picture.

49
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't, like, unfortunately, I can't upload that.

50
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:26,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

51
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:32,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You can, but it's a format that only I think 3D devices can read.

52
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:39,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like some sort of weird format, but it's for 3D devices.

53
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't do me any good to upload it to OrangeLaunchRadio.com because no one would see it.

54
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't be able to see it unless you have a 3DS or maybe some of those special cameras or the phones or whatever that can view 3D stuff.

55
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:55,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe a 3D TV.

56
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you could view pictures on a 3D TV.

57
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:00,419
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not want to blow up that picture to the size of a 50 inch television.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed the resolution on the camera is kind of... They're VGA cameras.

59
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really just a gimmicky thing right now.

60
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:11,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But like 10-year-olds will have a field day with it.

61
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:12,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a field day with it.

62
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really?

63
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:18,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, I was nosy the first thing I did before I took a picture of myself was I looked at everything you were taking pictures of.

64
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just cat...

65
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:20,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's the cat.

66
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look, more pictures of the cat.

67
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here's a picture of his desk at work.

68
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:25,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and here's the cat again.

69
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's... She was the only... She was there at the time, so, you know, that's why I took a picture of her.

70
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,582
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's... She's so exploited.

71
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It works really well with stuff that has a lot of depth in it.

72
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:45,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because if you just take a picture of... I took a picture of triple bacon pizza, so... Well, thankfully, my nose is gigantic, so there's a lot of depth there, but that was...

73
00:03:46,112 --> 00:03:53,033
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually almost... The photo that I took of the game while I was playing it, you can actually almost see the 3D in it.

74
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:53,954
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually kind of neat.

75
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:54,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost.

76
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:55,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost.

77
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:59,475
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see the layers in the image is what you can see.

78
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:04,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually it'll be kind of cool because maybe you can download the pictures through the web browser.

79
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,697
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes out in May... That's awesome.

80
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:12,217
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

81
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:35,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it would help justify to the wife the cost of everything.

82
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:37,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, I'll get you Nintendogs.

83
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:38,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything like that?

84
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:38,509
[SPEAKER_04]: She wouldn't.

85
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:39,029
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

86
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't care.

87
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:40,469
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't care.

88
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: She thought Nintendogs was dumb to begin with.

89
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Nintendogs was dumb, but I had to see what it looked like in 3D, and it looks pretty cool.

90
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:48,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Very fuzzy.

91
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: They are very fuzzy.

92
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:53,194
[SPEAKER_04]: And my whole row, they're just treating them like they're real dogs.

93
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, oh, the puppies are here.

94
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:57,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our official puppies.

95
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay.

96
00:04:59,637 --> 00:04:59,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

97
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:01,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play Nintendogs.

98
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that one won't make me feel completely violently ill to my stomach.

99
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd play it for like 15 minutes.

100
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:11,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to play it for 15 minutes during my break at work.

101
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would forget about my puppies and they would run away.

102
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to get one at lunch?

103
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:17,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

104
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to wait a little bit just because some of the other stuff is going on.

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's probably fine.

106
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be okay.

107
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,303
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one game.

108
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, other than...

109
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Street Fighter, then I'm getting with the US one.

110
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And Street Fighter's kind of like, eh.

111
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:39,313
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either, okay, well, the three options I had were Street Fighter, Samurai Warriors, which, eh, I don't care about Samurai Warriors, and...

112
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:45,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

113
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Madden or something like that.

114
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:48,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want Madden.

115
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So I picked Street Fighter.

116
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll probably pick up Pilotwings because I want to play Pilotwings.

117
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would play Pilotwings.

118
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:56,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks fun.

119
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I'll probably wait for the Kid Icarus game.

120
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Kid Icarus looks awesome.

121
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:04,273
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pilotwings, I'm very disappointed there's only three types of...

122
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:08,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but the Super Nintendo one was maybe four.

123
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:16,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, wow, it's kind of sad that it was more than... Oh, yeah, because they keep forgetting, like, what, every fifth stage was like this random shoot-em-up that you would have.

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was actually like a fifth.

125
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have that kind of stuff in there, but it's still, it's only... Hang gliding, jetpack, skydiving...

126
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:25,643
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another one.

127
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Biplane.

128
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:27,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Biplane.

129
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:28,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the shoot-em-up stages.

130
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:29,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

131
00:06:29,926 --> 00:06:30,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

132
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:31,907
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, come on.

133
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:36,569
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can pull off four on a Super Nintendo, I think you can maybe pull off more than that.

134
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:37,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

135
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's be honest here.

136
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:44,853
[SPEAKER_04]: The geometry for the levels and stuff like that, you're using WooHoo Island or whatever from Wii Sports.

137
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:47,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the island, the 3D object created.

138
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep forgetting that WooHoo Island's like a character now.

139
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's.

140
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:52,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumb.

141
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a character no one cares about.

142
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an island.

143
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:57,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Big deal.

144
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:02,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone can make an island, especially with the level of graphics that they're putting in there.

145
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:03,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

146
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:06,888
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the type of stuff that you would have seen in Prop Cycle.

147
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, Prop Cycle had more detail to it than this stuff.

148
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

149
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that, I mean, right there.

150
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:17,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you don't have to create the island, which is kind of a major part of Pilotwings.

151
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:21,935
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to model the planes and weather vehicles and stuff.

152
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:26,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to place your markers around and stuff like that and code the rest of the game.

153
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:29,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't seem to me that that would have been a lot of work.

154
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:30,357
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

155
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:36,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm just checking out some gameplay video of Pilotwings and remembering how freaking awesome this game was on Super Nintendo when it first came out.

156
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, seriously.

157
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that I look at it, I'm like, gosh, the basics for this, I mean, it's really just a very simple graphic of the island with the Mode 7 trick.

158
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just, I remember this game was the shit when it came out.

159
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you know what?

160
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bet you anything that they're going to re-release this on the Virtual Console for that.

161
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:03,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will bet you anything they will code a new emulator for it that everything that has goddamn Mode 7 is going to be in 3D.

162
00:08:04,623 --> 00:08:11,348
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the like parallax stuff that was in there, you know, different layers, sprite layers and stuff like that will be offset in certain distances.

163
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,328
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's going to happen.

164
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:18,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they said it was going to be as simple as anything that had a z-axis would be, you know, able to be made in 3D, so...

165
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of neat.

166
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chat room, the ever-present fourth guest on our show, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

167
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:31,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Big thanks to those of you guys that like to show up every week, and I love this chat, these comments here.

168
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf, our old pal that does the show before us here at All Games Radio, the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

169
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,521
[SPEAKER_05]: He starts at 5 o'clock Pacific when we start at 6.

170
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I'm leaving the Pilotwings gameplay going because I'm being nostalgic.

171
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:46,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf says, fact, Dead Island also takes place on Woohoo Island.

172
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Phonely.

173
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,514
[SPEAKER_05]: And GameGuru says, Woohoo Island as a fighter for Super Smash Bros.

174
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:52,514
4.

175
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,236
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

176
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:56,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

177
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,601
It'll be a stage.

178
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so what else did you bring to the show with you?

179
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,585
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought a PlayStation 3, right?

180
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought a MotorStorm Apocalypse.

181
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all sorts of awesome.

182
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically...

183
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:18,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You're racing through this city that's been destroyed by an earthquake, among other natural disasters.

184
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:22,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now you're basically racing through that.

185
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:31,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at the same time, they've got a little bit of a storyline going on where there's this corporation that basically wants you and these crazy homeless people out of the city.

186
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And the crazy homeless people are throwing molotovs at you during the races.

187
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:36,245
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

188
00:09:54,974 --> 00:10:12,769
[SPEAKER_04]: and this air raid siren goes off and all of a sudden the bridge starts shaking and starts collapsing right as I'm racing through it and that was all sorts of cool and then there was another stage I was racing on a motorcycle and all of a sudden this building just collapses right next to me it was awesome

189
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:13,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

190
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It was incredibly good times.

191
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, probably my favorite one out of the series.

192
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So why did you bring the PS3 with you?

193
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to show it off a little later during the show or something?

194
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm going to play it.

195
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of paying attention to the show, you'll just be playing it.

196
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm paying attention to the show.

197
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:28,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm multitasking.

198
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:33,180
[SPEAKER_05]: When the calls start coming in, it's just like, oh, okay, I'll let Rob talk to the callers and I'll just sit here and play Motorstar.

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't help it if they're not interesting.

200
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: well didn't you think I thought some of those comments was very interesting before we had a dead island taking place on woohoo island and woohoo island is a fighter for super smash brothers 4 and I was kind of thinking like you know there could be a trailer that's out there and it's like pilot wings meets zombies on woohoo island and it's very amazing

201
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like that trailer.

202
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I hated that trailer.

203
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:05,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to throw that out there.

204
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I ever talked about it on the show, but I hated that trailer.

205
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hated that Dead Island trailer.

206
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:15,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was artsy and everything, but I really didn't like it.

207
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:18,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I can get into the reasons why later.

208
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Remind me later, I'll talk about it.

209
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, we always like to start off our show with, how was your gaming week?

210
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:24,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

211
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,120
[SPEAKER_01]: It was eventful.

212
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I just played some Ridge Racer on the 3DS and my eyes hurt.

213
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Pinball FX, which I talked about earlier.

214
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:44,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Pinball FX actually, just sitting there one night and I updated my avatar.

215
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:50,525
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played that game with the big stupid dragon.

216
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,627
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, where you click the button and they run.

217
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:56,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And you press the buttons and they do stuff.

218
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chicks have horns.

219
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,530
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of thing.

220
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:00,971
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft.

221
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

222
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what?

223
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the discussion that we all got into yesterday about what the Darkstalkers characters would be if they were characters in World of Warcraft.

224
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:18,423
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were trying to figure out if you wanted to make Victor, would he be a Draenei or whatever.

225
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:19,664
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of funny.

226
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:20,904
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

227
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:22,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go get some dinner now.

228
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:23,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

229
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:23,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy the noms.

230
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:29,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Loki, I know we've heard a little bit about the 3DS and Motorstorm, but anything else in your gaming week you want to talk about?

231
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:32,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

232
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:37,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than Motorstorm and, well, let's see.

233
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm, I already talked about how awesome it was.

234
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:43,959
[SPEAKER_04]: The 3DS played Ridge Racer, and that's Ridge Racer.

235
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:46,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they didn't really change anything too much.

236
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:58,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some of the games that are kind of packed in with the 3DS, like the Face Invaders game, which is kind of funny.

237
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:07,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I took basically what was the equivalent of the drunken Mario Kart picture with the camera, so that was fun shooting my face.

238
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:15,435
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I actually tried some of the cards and there's one where you're shooting targets with an arrow so that was kind of cool.

239
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:25,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other stuff, I actually downloaded on the iOS ReRave so I was playing a little bit of that and that's pretty cool, I dug it.

240
00:13:25,323 --> 00:13:29,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pissed off for a while though and I still kind of am a little bit pissed off about it.

241
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some pretty high scores.

242
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why aren't they appearing on the high score table?

243
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't realize I had to register for like a login or something like that for their thing.

244
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So after I did that, it reset all my high scores.

245
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:41,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

246
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:42,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Wah, wah, wah.

247
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,556
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you get for not signing up for the first place.

248
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they didn't say in order to have your scores posted to the site, you need to register for it.

249
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It just says log in and register.

250
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,660
[SPEAKER_05]: How else is it going to know who you are?

251
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought it would just take my name.

252
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:56,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

253
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:58,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I throw logic into this equation?

254
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:58,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

255
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Loki.

256
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll never do that again.

257
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:03,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played that.

258
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:05,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I dug some of the songs in there, of course.

259
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,811
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of Kyle Ward music in there.

260
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:11,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're a fan of In The Groove, you'll probably dig that.

261
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:14,435
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I play?

262
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:17,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto, pretty much.

263
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:20,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

264
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some random iOS games I played.

265
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:29,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Just going through some of my games I downloaded that see, like, well, hey, I haven't played this yet.

266
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:31,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try this out and see if it's any good or not.

267
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,918
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them weren't, so I just ended up deleting them.

268
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one I played.

269
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:37,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was called, like, Hyper Missile or something like that.

270
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:40,100
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

271
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, mainly Motorstorm.

272
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of that, actually.

273
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really hyped about that game.

274
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

275
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:52,369
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

276
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anything else or is that it?

277
00:14:55,871 --> 00:14:56,252
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

278
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:56,712
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

279
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:57,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk about my gaming week.

280
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:02,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Mostly a lot of the same stuff I've played in the past, so not a whole lot of new stuff.

281
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the usual WoW, WoW, WoW, WoW, and Torchlight a little bit on XBLA, even though playing Torchlight on Xbox Live makes me want to go back and play it on the PC more.

282
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,187
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go chew on that one for a little bit.

283
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:16,388
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of the other stuff.

284
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did check out a few new things.

285
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:26,460
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them that Loki already mentioned, I also checked out ReRave on the iOS because obviously as a music game fan, there's definitely the roots there.

286
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:35,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a mix between Elite Beat Agents meets DJ Max Technica meets In The Groove.

287
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:37,552
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

288
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:09,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because in retrospect, I think I appreciate what they were trying to do a lot more now than what I did then.

289
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:20,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Because especially coming so far now and seeing everything that's happened where I don't think Konami ever truly had faith in that series, I can appreciate what they were trying to do in retrospect.

290
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But just at the time, it really felt cheap to me.

291
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was really longing for more DDR.

292
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry for the tangent, but just to give you the mindset, I was coming in here thinking, I don't know if I'm going to really dig this because I was not really ever a big fan of In The Groove.

293
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But I gotta say, I enjoyed Rereave.

294
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:39,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.

295
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $2 to download.

296
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a whole lot of songs come with it for free.

297
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I right away downloaded a song pack that was free.

298
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I couldn't tell you exactly how many songs you get initially.

299
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:52,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It must only be like two or three.

300
00:16:52,993 --> 00:16:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a song pack of about four.

301
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:54,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It was three.

302
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was a song pack of about another four or five songs you get for free.

303
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:03,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, it wants to charge you more money to get extra song packs.

304
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Song pack one, song pack two.

305
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:09,386
[SPEAKER_05]: With a bunch of songs that are very similar to what you hear in the default packs.

306
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of name recognition in those packs.

307
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:15,409
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not exactly going to get Lady Gaga, Rihanna type of stuff.

308
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,229
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one of them.

309
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually bought all the packs.

310
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

311
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I wanted some actual songs to play.

312
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:24,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was in a let me buy some stuff mood.

313
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:26,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But I played some songs.

314
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:32,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I don't recognize the artist, but there's one of those songs from one of the Geico commercials was in there.

315
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:32,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, jeez, really?

316
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:32,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

317
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,939
[SPEAKER_05]: No, see, I wouldn't recognize the artist, but that makes sense.

318
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:35,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

319
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, okay, whatever, cool.

320
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:46,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and a lot of the music games on, I'm sorry, Xbox Live, on iOS are set up the same way, and DDR itself being one of them.

321
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like a DDR-S game that comes with like no songs and everything you have to buy in songpacks.

322
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, this is nothing new, the model.

323
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:57,936
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as like the seven songs that come with it or so, I've been playing most of them, and I enjoy the songs.

324
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,536
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty good.

325
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And the gameplay is pretty slick, actually.

326
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:02,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the whole, like,

327
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:03,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

328
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:37,212
[SPEAKER_05]: and many more.

330
00:18:56,706 --> 00:18:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Check this out.

331
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:58,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's two bucks.

332
00:18:58,229 --> 00:18:59,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a bad deal.

333
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:03,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unfortunate there's no demo or anything so that people can see what it is first.

334
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:04,701
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's videos online.

335
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:07,346
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably give you a pretty good idea what it is.

336
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:32,687
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah re-rave on the iOS the other game I checked out this week this is a demo I don't like to review games based off the demo but this is one very high profile game I've had a lot of anticipation going for and that's Mortal Kombat the demo is now out on PlayStation Network for everybody you don't have to just be a plus subscriber regular or plus can now get the demo on PS3 so I spent a little time with that just to see if it was going to be as awesome as I was hoping and

337
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:38,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say I didn't like it because I did, but I felt it was lacking.

338
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And granted, it was a demo.

339
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:41,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be lacking.

340
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only bare bones.

341
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,954
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you get that mode that's, you know, fighter versus fighter, that's still kind of the core part of the game.

342
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

343
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:56,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't as action-packed as I was hoping and as fast-paced as I remember the Mortal Kombat games being.

344
00:19:56,678 --> 00:20:02,542
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I am saying that very open-mindedly because I realize, again, it's a demo game.

345
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:17,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing it single player and I think Mortal Kombat really best shines in multiplayer modes so I'm totally not being fair when I'm saying that right now but that was my honest to god reaction as I walked away from it going gosh I was hoping I'd have more fun with that

346
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:18,909
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

347
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but there's a difference.

348
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,785
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a very clear difference.

349
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:50,535
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference with, like, okay, you must torture yourself for my amusement, and there's a difference between, like,

350
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:51,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha!

351
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:53,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Your face is going to get ripped off!

352
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha!

353
00:20:54,199 --> 00:21:02,361
[SPEAKER_05]: The Saw movies are trying to be real and trying to teach these moral lessons through these really sick things that I don't like.

354
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:06,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mortal Kombat is basically one step above a cartoon.

355
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:08,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the Netherrealm.

356
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:10,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not real.

357
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to play a game?

358
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You forgot to feed your cat.

359
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:14,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to feed you to a tiger!

360
00:21:15,124 --> 00:21:16,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see how that works.

361
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:59,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I did like about Mortal Kombat that I was able to pick it right up and like it just felt like playing Mortal Kombat 2 in like Street Fighter 4 style graphics and that part was pretty awesome like being able to select Mileena and just remember that toward toward low kick was the little drop I mean cool things like that really easy to get back into so that same sort of learning curve where you were able to kind of slip right into Street Fighter 4 from Street Fighter 2 I think a

362
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,069
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

363
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I really did walk away.

364
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:23,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So check out the demo.

365
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:24,548
[SPEAKER_05]: See if you had the same reaction.

366
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:27,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to a friend of mine who felt the same way I did.

367
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:30,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited about the game after playing the demo.

368
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:30,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

369
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It just wasn't what I remember.

370
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,771
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, there you go.

371
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the games I played this week.

372
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:41,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So chat.orangelawnsradio.com if you want to join us in our chat room.

373
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:48,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, Sky, the fatality that looks the most funny is the one showing Liu Kang getting hit by a taxi.

374
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that was pretty funny too.

375
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the x-ray attack stuff.

376
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that stuff was funny.

377
00:22:55,345 --> 00:22:57,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope there's more of them in the regular game.

378
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:01,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Like not just one x-ray attack for every character because I think some of those might get old quick.

379
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:03,473
[SPEAKER_05]: But I cracked up at some of them.

380
00:23:03,513 --> 00:23:04,975
[SPEAKER_05]: They were pretty funny.

381
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:08,499
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

382
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,543
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the same old moves coming back.

383
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny Cage can punch people in the balls still.

384
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, he likes to do it over and over again.

385
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:17,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he has an issue.

386
00:23:18,027 --> 00:23:19,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on.

387
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:21,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Some housekeeping for tonight.

388
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Twitter, you can join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, all the updates for what's going on with the show.

389
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Also our Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

390
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:41,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we have no planned shows off or trips we're taking or anything, so every Sunday night in the near future at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is where you can hear us live.

391
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes ma'am.

392
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:44,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an arcade report.

393
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:45,006
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

394
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:46,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Disneyland.

395
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:47,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's right.

396
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,527
[SPEAKER_05]: You were gone last week because you were at Disneyland.

397
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:49,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

398
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:51,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have fun?

399
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time.

400
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do the Toy Story Midway Mania?

401
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We totally did.

402
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a giant video game.

403
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:56,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

404
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:01,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan totally kicked my ass, but I kicked his butt at Astro Blasters.

405
00:24:01,631 --> 00:24:11,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Starcade is actually now also the home of Star Trader because they've closed down the Star Trader and Star Tours for the revamp.

406
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:13,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

407
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:13,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.

408
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:16,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw when they had shut down Star Tours.

409
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,766
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Star Trader is also being redone.

410
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:19,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

411
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to get all the new merchandise, I'm sure.

412
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:26,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, that and they sort of would have to go through there to take care of the hallway if they need to redo the hallway.

413
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:27,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

414
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:33,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's now kind of half the arcade it used to be, literally.

415
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:34,815
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

416
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:35,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

417
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:35,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

418
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:37,156
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

419
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:37,876
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my arcade report.

420
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:38,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't play anything there.

421
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:40,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's expensive.

422
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:41,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Lens was closed.

423
00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:42,359
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

424
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.

425
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Electronica doesn't go under the weekend.

426
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:47,564
[SPEAKER_01]: They had said that it was going to during spring break and then they didn't.

427
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:48,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Captain EO back already?

428
00:24:48,846 --> 00:24:49,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

429
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:54,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the original 77mm film with grain and everything.

430
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:56,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing its age.

431
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:56,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

432
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,696
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cheeseball 3D that was not great.

433
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:03,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the summary of Captain EO.

434
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:15,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Michael Jackson flies through space with a bunch of Muppets, lands on the Borg homeworld, and turns all the Borg into extras from Xanadu ruled by Angelica Houston.

435
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:17,128
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

436
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:17,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's awesome.

437
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:18,369
[SPEAKER_05]: All of it.

438
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:18,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's awesome.

439
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,211
[SPEAKER_05]: But am I not right?

440
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:23,132
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's a pretty good way of summarizing it.

441
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,753
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the end.

442
00:25:25,154 --> 00:25:25,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

443
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:33,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be sad when they get rid of that finally because you know there's going to come a time when they're finally going to have to get rid of Captain EO again for a new movie.

444
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It better not be Honey, I Shrunk the Audience again because that movie was terrible.

445
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:39,582
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, let's actually get into some other video game news.

446
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: No Captain EO game to talk about this week, but maybe some other video games.

447
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:43,745
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off with Loki tonight.

448
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,966
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a few games delayed from Japan.

449
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:54,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily because of the whole tsunami earthquake thing, but you could probably attribute some of that to it.

450
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:05,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off, Warriors Legends of Troy on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Dead or Alive Dimensions, both coming from Tecmo Koei.

451
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:11,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Those have been delayed and won't make their scheduled release dates of March 24th and March 31st.

452
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, not a big surprise.

453
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:19,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive Dimensions has been delayed a few times already for the U.S.

454
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And Warriors Legends of Troy, not even coming out on the 360 in the U.S.

455
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,580
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been delayed indefinitely.

456
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm not surprised one bit.

457
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was prior to the whole earthquake thing.

458
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So, take that for what you will.

459
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:39,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, on top of all that, of course, this is a little bit too...

460
00:26:42,103 --> 00:27:07,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Various reasons why they're delaying some of this stuff Yakuza of the End, Motorstorm Apocalypse, and Disaster Report 4 Well, Disaster Report 4 has been cancelled from Sega Which, you know, a game about wandering around in a city that has undergone some traumatic disaster Might not be the most sensitive thing to put out

461
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the game was a disaster.

462
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:45,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, people are being hypersensitive about it, but I sort of get it, because when you put down multi-millions of dollars on these projects, you have to release them just right.

463
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:50,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, you've got an entire country that probably doesn't want to be thinking about the apocalypse.

464
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:54,730
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

465
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:57,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see where people would be concerned it's in bad taste.

466
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:59,152
[SPEAKER_00]: But Nuclear Boy, Rob...

467
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:01,493
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole other thing, though.

468
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:03,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about the little YouTube thing.

469
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:06,256
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs something to distract him from having to poop.

470
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, well, the other thing is, not only did they announce it was going to be delayed in Japan, but Motorsome Apocalypse also got delayed in Europe and then later on in the U.S.

471
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:19,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why, because the game is done, but...

472
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:20,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

473
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:21,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

474
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You're delaying it.

475
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:24,123
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

476
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if your game comes out the wrong week, it might get destroyed.

477
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:30,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Blur.

478
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:35,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say a lot of the big reason Blur didn't do well is it came out the wrong week.

479
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:36,468
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:00,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like... It's not Japan, for one.

481
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:04,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just completely... You know, it looks like San Francisco.

482
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:08,479
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I would probably be willing to bet it's based off San Francisco.

483
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Because San Francisco, kind of known for earthquakes.

484
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's not a stretch.

485
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the...

486
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:23,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to say it is goddamn San Francisco because having played some of the tracks and stuff, it looks like San Francisco.

487
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,783
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Sony office right outside San Francisco, so it wouldn't surprise me at all.

488
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:34,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand delaying it there or in Europe, but okay, whatever.

489
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:41,017
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to wait and release it in May or something where it's packed full of releases, then fine.

490
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:46,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think they should just keep it with the April 12th release date because it was perfect.

491
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:51,326
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing else coming out.

492
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:53,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking maybe it'll just be a couple weeks?

493
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:54,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

494
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a couple weeks, but really a couple weeks...

495
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:00,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to put it out in a lot of... Let me put it this way.

496
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:05,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got MX vs. ATV Alive coming out in about a month after it was originally coming out.

497
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:09,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you wait a little bit longer, you're going to have another off-road racing game.

498
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:15,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, both of them are completely different from each other, but they're still both kind of in the same genre.

499
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:18,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's kind of a mistake to move it.

500
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It should have really come out at that time because it would have been perfect.

501
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,634
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing else coming out.

502
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:24,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

503
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:27,173
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

504
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So seriously, pick it up when it does come out.

505
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:30,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all sorts of awesome.

506
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:39,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going into the chatroom at chat.orange.com Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says, Actually, yes, people in the U.S.

507
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:40,329
[SPEAKER_05]: find things insensitive.

508
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:45,993
[SPEAKER_05]: They bashed the event because it did an episode this week about a nuclear power plant being threatened.

509
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone was like, How dare NBC air this?

510
00:30:49,236 --> 00:30:50,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

511
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:51,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

512
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to just stop listening to those people.

513
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to boycott your show.

514
00:30:57,123 --> 00:30:58,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to watch it next week.

515
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:02,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll catch it on DVR if you still want to know what happens.

516
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:04,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's been a lot of... I mean, I'm just playing the devil's advocate here.

517
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:08,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think people are maybe blowing this out of proportion, but... People are dumb.

518
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:13,636
[SPEAKER_05]: There has been... On the West Coast, and you know this as well as I do, there's been a lot of talk.

519
00:31:13,676 --> 00:31:20,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the news is dominated with this talk about, could the radiation from the power plant in Japan get to the West Coast?

520
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:21,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get my tinfoil hat.

521
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:25,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because they're going to spin it any way they can to make it sound like it's terrible.

522
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

523
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote Republican or this will happen.

524
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, they just blow it way up.

525
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what else are they going to talk about?

526
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:50,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Charlie Sheen?

527
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:52,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, they've got to talk about something.

528
00:31:52,888 --> 00:31:56,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to get you to watch the news.

529
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:03,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we've got to be careful how we tread here because I think to some extent it is a very frightful thing.

530
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:08,556
[SPEAKER_05]: If this was all going on at that Rancho Seco place, I know they shut it down years ago, but...

531
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:17,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, it is a frightening thing, but what's going on there and what the reporting is going on there is completely different.

532
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I am honestly going to say it's a lot like Nuclear Boy.

533
00:32:22,545 --> 00:32:23,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to those who haven't seen it.

534
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:29,590
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst that's going to happen is they're going to have to evacuate Fukushima and then

535
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:32,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish are gonna be sick.

536
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:33,755
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go fishing near there.

537
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are gonna be irradiated.

538
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:44,722
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to deal with this for probably the next seven to ten years, I think, is what it takes for nuclear radiation to be cleaned out of land.

539
00:32:44,822 --> 00:32:48,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And our technology is a lot better than it was, you know, around, say, Chernobyl.

540
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,276
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

541
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:24,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So something like this coming up and having everything still pretty much hold intact with just a few problems, that has to say something pretty amazing for, you know, the level of care and, you know, thought that went into the construction of these places.

542
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:30,650
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and also should make everybody in Sacramento shut up about us having nuclear power here.

543
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't have earthquakes.

544
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:34,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

545
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:36,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got the perfect location for a nuclear power plant.

546
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:37,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

547
00:33:57,071 --> 00:33:57,352
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

548
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not terrible that those dolphins are so smart.

549
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's terrible that they're using it for evil, okay?

550
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:18,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about something that's definitely fiction.

551
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:20,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get away from the real world stuff and get to a land of fiction.

552
00:34:20,694 --> 00:34:23,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of our favorite fictional places, Silent Hill.

553
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:33,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Silent Hill is, well, at least a one-time awesome video game series that's kind of slipped into a, okay, yeah, I really like this series because I used to like it.

554
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:34,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill.

555
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:37,117
[SPEAKER_05]: We're experimenting with new weather patterns now.

556
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:39,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyhow, here's the deal.

557
00:34:39,918 --> 00:35:09,465
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently Silent Hill is going to have a release on Xbox Live if rumors are to be believed and here's where the rumors are coming from it's an interview with the Italian based Xbox 360 magazine and it's from the art director for Silent Hill Downpour saying quote at the moment there will be no multiplayer modes in Silent Hill Downpour Konami is investigating a separate chapter devoted entirely to the multiplayer now he went on in this interview to say that he doesn't know any details but it's supposed to be Xbox Live Arcade and quote

558
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:12,934
[SPEAKER_05]: that most players have to survive in the town of Silent Hill.

559
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:17,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I kind of look at this and go, that's... Silent Hill cash-in.

560
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:23,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Silent Hill was always supposed to be a very single-player experience.

561
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't see this turning into a shoot-em-up type of thing.

562
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:30,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't really see it as a bang-bang, you know, kill the others.

563
00:35:30,624 --> 00:35:30,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

564
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be kind of cool if, like, one person could be Pyramid Head.

565
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

566
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody else is trying to run away from Pyramid Head.

567
00:35:36,888 --> 00:35:39,089
[SPEAKER_01]: You get bonus points for, you know, mannequin rape.

568
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:47,016
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't see it as a bang-bang shoot-em-up game, but yet Konami does because they released an iOS game that was basically that, and they released an arcade game that's basically that.

569
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:49,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So they apparently do see it as a shoot-em-up.

570
00:35:49,518 --> 00:35:51,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but not like shoot other people.

571
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You're shooting the creatures of Silent Hill or whatever.

572
00:35:53,502 --> 00:35:55,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see where the multiplayer element comes on.

573
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,724
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my point.

574
00:35:56,044 --> 00:36:01,930
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's a part of me that also pictures a very Left 4 Dead kind of game that actually could be kind of awesome.

575
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:14,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Like and maybe it's like don't take Left 4 Dead literally, but maybe some type of like cooperative survival game where maybe everybody helps each other in a certain way to survive the town of Silent Hill.

576
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,257
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be kind of cool.

577
00:36:16,398 --> 00:36:16,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

578
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,278
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be.

579
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:19,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope it isn't Blue Pyramid Head vs. Red Pyramid Head.

580
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be ridiculous and dumb.

581
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:21,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Spy vs. Spy with Pyramid Head.

582
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:22,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that would be hideous.

583
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:24,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So either it's got to be a co-op survival or it's got to be...

584
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: One versus everybody, which now the more I kind of say that out loud, I think that's kind of dumb too.

585
00:36:52,682 --> 00:36:54,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really hope it's more like the co-op survival.

586
00:36:54,822 --> 00:36:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be kind of rad actually.

587
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:58,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine like having to figure out puzzles with multiple people?

588
00:36:59,184 --> 00:36:59,784
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be kind of fun.

589
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing would get done.

590
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:03,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I can think of something that's like, oh crap, pyramid head's coming.

591
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Push someone in his path.

592
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:08,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

593
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:09,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacrifice Dark Sakura.

594
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:10,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

595
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Be like, bitch, please smack.

596
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:14,288
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

597
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:18,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we'll see what develops with that.

598
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:26,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine if this is true, if, big if, remember this is a rumor, because it's coming from an Italian magazine from the art director.

599
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:37,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that's small time stuff, but again, it does sound a little bit like I have this cousin who's a cameraman on the new Superman movie.

600
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:38,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Art directors are pretty big.

601
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, but still.

602
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it has director in the title.

603
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,700
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

604
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

605
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take it with a grain of salt.

606
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,181
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

607
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be disappointed if this game doesn't happen.

608
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:49,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to be an art director of a magazine.

609
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:50,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it isn't good.

610
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:52,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to be an art director.

611
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:53,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

612
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:58,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe you should, when this guy gets fired for leaking all the details about the game, you should apply for his job.

613
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to move to Italy.

614
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:02,144
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

615
00:38:02,945 --> 00:38:04,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

616
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:22,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently the Zynga people, by the way, Zynga sucks, I'm sorry, his name is Brian Reynolds, and he said that Xbox Live is too small for them to bother with for Farmville.

617
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,790
[SPEAKER_01]: That means my mother won't be getting an Xbox anytime soon.

618
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:27,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

619
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:39,666
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an idiot.

620
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually kind of get what he's saying.

621
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:44,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do too.

622
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,650
[SPEAKER_05]: There are way more people on Facebook than there are on Xbox Live.

623
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Fact.

624
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,352
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's look at hard, cold numbers, okay?

625
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,414
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there are 23 million members on Xbox Live as of February 2010.

626
00:38:57,514 --> 00:39:05,798
[SPEAKER_01]: In January, Facebook had 600 million users and Farmville had 62 million active since September of last year.

627
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically what he's saying is he doesn't like money.

628
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:13,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how it would be that difficult.

629
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:14,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really.

630
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,381
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's like, no, it's not going to be worth our time for just these people.

631
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay, if you don't want more addicts, fine.

632
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:22,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

633
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:28,928
[SPEAKER_04]: He's basically saying, well, why would we put it on Xbox Live or on the PlayStation Network or something like that?

634
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,849
[SPEAKER_04]: They have less people than they have on Facebook.

635
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:34,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh, it's called expanding your demographic.

636
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You already have it on Facebook.

637
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:38,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You already have it on smartphones.

638
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you would put it on a console because you don't have it there yet.

639
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what he said.

640
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the worry is the social experience.

641
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:54,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the social experience is going to be a very small number so that the amount of social capital that is there will not be very high.

642
00:39:54,948 --> 00:39:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you're not going to have people doing the microtransactions.

643
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that word.

644
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that word.

645
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:35,797
[SPEAKER_05]: to some level yes you can enhance certain Xbox Live Arcade games with extra things but you're always putting some money down up front to play the games and I would question sure you might have hundreds of millions of people playing Farmville on Facebook but how many of them are actually paying for it

646
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably a pretty damn scary number when a lot of us kind of sit here and don't understand Farmville.

647
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:53,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I think the types of games that you have come to know on Facebook and mobile phones are not necessarily the same types of games that are on Xbox Live Arcade.

648
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:54,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of like...

649
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:56,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

650
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,778
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you know what the percentage is?

651
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to use those numbers as a basis.

652
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,081
[SPEAKER_01]: The percentage of people on Facebook that play FarmVille?

653
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:05,081
4%.

654
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:08,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny.

655
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:10,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Tiny, tiny.

656
00:41:12,064 --> 00:41:12,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

657
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:17,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I were this guy, I'd be looking to find ways to get more revenue in.

658
00:41:17,747 --> 00:41:21,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be adjusting the business model, do like XBLA version of FarmVille.

659
00:41:22,169 --> 00:41:25,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, my thought, why does it have to be FarmVille?

660
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:28,012
[SPEAKER_05]: If your games are so damn addicting...

661
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:34,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Rise to the challenge and create a game that you could get away with charging $15 for.

662
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:40,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but there are some things you can appreciate about Farmville.

663
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:45,710
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like saying there's some things you can appreciate about Hitler.

664
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not going to go there, period.

665
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than Volkswagen and the Autobahn.

666
00:41:55,468 --> 00:41:56,109
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, look.

667
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: My thing is that, like, the thing about... God, now I'm just totally lost.

668
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:05,052
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually, I feel sick.

669
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:06,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel a little sick now.

670
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:15,937
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Farmville is that it kind of gets your friends, even though it might not be us, the people that are the quote-unquote hardcore gamers...

671
00:42:16,818 --> 00:42:44,084
[SPEAKER_05]: it gets our moms and our relatives and people that don't usually play video games to be playing a multiplayer game together very easily and maybe there's a way they could bring that multiplayer effort to the Xbox Live place which in turn could maybe enhance Xbox Live but I don't think that necessarily has to be just fucking Farmville there's plenty of other games they could rip off right?

672
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:47,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just still kind of feeling ill from...

673
00:42:52,744 --> 00:43:18,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Making people throw up in their mouths daily Making my stomach flip flop And I just ate, I feel ill Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com Spazinator told me to bite my tongue Blackwolf says That would require that they actually make something original Defective Candy says Every time we sell one of those Facebook game cards where I work I die a little on the inside Oh

674
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:19,308
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

675
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just feeding the beast.

676
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

677
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, take us to some completely different news, please.

678
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,351
[SPEAKER_04]: This is completely different.

679
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:38,635
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually working on a Transformers MMO, and it's being developed by the people behind the browser-based MMO RuneScape.

680
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess they've worked out a deal with Hasbro, and the game is set to be released in North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand sometime in 2012.

681
00:43:48,498 --> 00:44:05,963
[SPEAKER_04]: and they said that the title will be a dynamic and action-packed game no word on which Transformers universe it will be based on but that is interesting let's hope it's not the Michael Bay Transformers universe although you know that would be action-packed

682
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:08,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Explosions!

683
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:24,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Be popular.

684
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,200
[SPEAKER_04]: People like Transformers.

685
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

686
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:29,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The MMO space is a little bit crowded right now.

687
00:44:29,422 --> 00:44:32,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it'll be able to kind of get its way in there.

688
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,605
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was free to play, that'd be pretty cool.

689
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they don't have the expectation bar very high.

690
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

691
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:42,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the MMO space is a very tough nut to crack right now.

692
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's not free to play, it has to triple be that much better.

693
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:52,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And judging from the Transformer games that have been on the consoles... The last one was all right.

694
00:44:55,307 --> 00:45:21,256
[SPEAKER_05]: and the next one's supposed to be okay because it's from the same people the last one so hopefully I'll try to keep an open mind but I mean we all know that third movie is gonna be terrible I mean I realize they're all now admitting wow the second movie was really bad but you know the third movie's gonna be even worse that last movie if I'm wrong then I'm wrong hooray but I'm just not getting my hopes up that's all

695
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:26,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let's talk about music games and Ubisoft is going to be putting out a new game.

696
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Rocksmith.

697
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rhythm game that uses real guitars.

698
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:32,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

699
00:45:32,222 --> 00:45:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That worked before.

700
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:36,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a train that left the station quite some time ago?

701
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:38,326
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty, well, whatever.

702
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:40,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Rocksmith is the game.

703
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:47,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the artists that will be in the game, David Bowie, Interpol, The Rolling Stones, pretty solid song list right there so far.

704
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:52,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use any electric guitar that you might just happen to have.

705
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:55,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not talking about buying a cheap plastic peripheral.

706
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:58,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's using an existing electric guitar.

707
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's neat, I guess.

708
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

709
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:16,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly how this all works just yet as to how it's going to identify from any guitar but I would imagine some type of audio pitch sensing peripheral kind of similar to how it detects when you're singing what pitch you're singing at.

710
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:19,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It would probably plug into like you'd plug it into an amp.

711
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:23,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a trailer out there right now.

712
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:30,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be coming out the second half of the year so I imagine that we'll be hearing more about this at E3.

713
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to try and play it

714
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:52,106
[SPEAKER_04]: and this was originally damn it I wanted to play the trailer but a stupid commercial for those goddamn bears that talk about toilet paper and it was originally we had actually talked about this before it was actually a game in development called Guitar Rising oh yeah but you know that never really came out and then Ubisoft bought it yeah it shows a guitar plugged into the Xbox

715
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: There's got to be some little adapter thingy or something.

716
00:46:56,497 --> 00:46:58,458
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like an amp plugged to USB.

717
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:03,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's similar to what you use with the karaoke mics.

718
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:05,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's got to be something just like that.

719
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:11,014
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

720
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:32,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's been 22 years in the making.

721
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:36,817
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a sequel to River City Ransom.

722
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

723
00:47:38,578 --> 00:47:40,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Or as it was known in Europe, Street Gangs.

724
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:42,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

725
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:47,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I really like the Japanese name, Hot-Blooded Downtown Story.

726
00:47:47,582 --> 00:47:47,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

727
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:50,424
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hot.

728
00:47:51,284 --> 00:47:58,009
[SPEAKER_01]: The Japanese developer Miracle Kids is trying to... Actually got a bunch of the original development team back together.

729
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:03,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are going to be doing a console version in the summer with the PC release in 2012.

730
00:48:06,095 --> 00:48:07,576
[SPEAKER_01]: So the console version is this summer.

731
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:09,678
[SPEAKER_01]: The PC one will be out next year.

732
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also...

733
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:25,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Downtown Smash Dodgeball, which for us was Super Dodgeball, which is on Xbox Live Indie Games, and they're working on a WiiWare port.

734
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,060
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yay!

735
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:32,683
[SPEAKER_01]: If you still want to play the old school one, get it on Virtual Console.

736
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:33,203
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 500 points.

737
00:48:34,184 --> 00:48:36,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, my favorite version is still the PC Engine one.

738
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:38,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one apparently wasn't that great.

739
00:49:00,276 --> 00:49:03,778
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the stuff that's retro, too, is sometimes better left in the past.

740
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:04,619
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

741
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see as soon as we start to see some screenshots and some actual gameplay, but I guess it's kind of cool that that's coming back.

742
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:12,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was a game I really liked.

743
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:13,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite.

744
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:16,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it kind of comes back as an arcade title.

745
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:20,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'd want to pay $60 for a new River City Ransom game.

746
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:25,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I would suspect it's going to be something for Xbox Live Arcade.

747
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:28,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when they remade Final Fight?

748
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:28,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

749
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:31,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they?

750
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:37,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was Final Fight for the Xbox and PlayStation 2.

751
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:38,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was awful.

752
00:49:38,796 --> 00:49:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Crap.

753
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:40,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have that.

754
00:49:41,098 --> 00:49:41,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

755
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:43,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, I do remember that.

756
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,121
[SPEAKER_05]: That was terrible.

757
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:45,982
[SPEAKER_01]: The last great one was Final Fight Guy.

758
00:49:48,524 --> 00:49:49,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Final Fight CD.

759
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:51,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good version.

760
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:52,808
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the Final Fight CD on?

761
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:53,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Sega?

762
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:54,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega CD?

763
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess who has it?

764
00:49:56,857 --> 00:49:58,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sure you guys do somewhere in that vault.

765
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:00,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy stuff.

[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is not based in the Brady Bunch universe.

814
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:12,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it looks very much like a, I don't know how to explain this, like a very like old time, think of like that Castlevania sort of flair.

815
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:18,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not like vampires, but definitely the costumes kind of remind me of that sort of story.

[SPEAKER_05]: So excited to be finished with those release dates.

830
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:53,275
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

831
00:56:53,295 --> 00:56:58,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got the classic game of the week, A Trip Down Memory Lane, with a classic video game coming up in just a little bit.

832
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:00,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, two more stories for you guys.

833
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:07,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we got some news about the NGP or what's, you know, codenamed the NGP from Sony.

834
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:11,866
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that the games will be downloadable day and date with the retail releases.

835
00:57:12,406 --> 00:57:19,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll be able to either buy, you know, the cartridge that these are going to be on or download them from the PlayStation Network store.

836
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:21,130
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them or just the Sony ones?

837
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're saying all of them.

838
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:43,207
[SPEAKER_04]: but here's kind of an interesting thing though if you think about it because that sounds good in theory until you realize one thing there's no onboard storage on the NGP so where the hell am I supposed to put these games that you're having me download oh I have to buy your proprietary memory unit there'll have to be something yeah

839
00:57:44,082 --> 00:57:47,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how wonderful I have to buy a fucking memory card to do that.

840
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:48,243
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

841
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:49,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just buy the retail game.

842
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:51,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that sounds good.

843
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:53,484
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I could do with that retail game?

844
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:56,525
[SPEAKER_04]: When I don't want to play it anymore, I can sell it back.

845
00:57:57,825 --> 00:58:01,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sure you're not going to have any sort of price break or anything like that on there.

846
00:58:02,206 --> 00:58:11,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, unless they come out cheaper, because I'm not buying all the packaged goods that go along with the game, I'm not interested.

847
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:11,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

848
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:17,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, there's a rumor regarding the price of the system.

849
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Sony Europe put out a survey.

850
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:25,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this is tying in with Ubisoft.

851
00:58:25,576 --> 00:58:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some survey conducted by a research firm and sponsored by Ubisoft.

852
00:58:33,582 --> 00:58:37,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that the retail price of the Sony NGP is expected to be around $350.

853
00:58:37,645 --> 00:58:38,465
[SPEAKER_04]: How likely would you be purchasing...

854
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:48,154
[SPEAKER_04]: How likely would you be to purchase the NGP now that you know the retail price?

855
00:58:48,675 --> 00:58:51,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying that that's the premium model with 3G.

856
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question is, how about the one without 3G, which will be considerably lower at $250?

857
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:00,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

858
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: 250 should be the topic.

859
00:59:25,591 --> 00:59:29,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think that these prices that we're hearing about mean anything.

860
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think Sony knows what they're charging for this thing yet.

861
00:59:31,298 --> 00:59:31,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

862
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a week before E3, I'd believe this rumor.

863
00:59:36,404 --> 00:59:38,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, doesn't mean squat.

864
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

865
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised if they go and try to charge $350.

866
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,846
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

867
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:53,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be $350 retail, but because these are going to have 3G, they're going to be tied in with some sort of data plan.

868
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:58,329
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get it for a lot cheaper than that because you're going to be signing a contract or to your contract or something like that.

869
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:02,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where it's going to make sense for people to pick up the 3G.

870
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily, though.

871
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,971
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to sign a contract for an iPad.

872
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:08,772
[SPEAKER_05]: An iPhone, yes, but an iPad, no.

873
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't sign a contract for those.

874
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:11,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then how do you get the 3G?

875
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:14,858
[SPEAKER_05]: You buy it with a 3G enabled, and then you buy a separate data plan.

876
01:00:15,118 --> 01:00:17,320
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't subsidize the cost of those machines at all.

877
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:25,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I believe the data can be through either, and correct me if I'm wrong, Chatters, but I'm pretty sure it's either to AT&T or Verizon.

878
01:00:26,267 --> 01:00:35,755
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have this big, huge news today that AT&T has gobbled up T-Mobile, or at least will be over the next 12 months, assuming the government approves of the acquisition and what have you.

879
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just going to be even more, you know, that's one less carrier out of the sea.

880
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:42,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.

881
01:00:43,417 --> 01:00:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

882
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,478
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people on my Twitter are not happy about that acquisition, by the way.

883
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:50,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently a lot more T-Mobile customers than I realized out there who don't want to switch.

884
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:52,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have some pretty good budget plans.

885
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:53,139
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

886
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:53,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already with AT&T.

887
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:54,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

888
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had a problem with AT&T, but some people really hate them.

889
01:00:57,341 --> 01:00:58,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I don't live in a huge city.

890
01:00:59,244 --> 01:00:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

891
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:31,945
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll see alright anyhow more stuff and this is on a completely different kind of note you know obviously last week we spent a little time talking about how you guys can help what's going on in Japan and the really unfortunate tragedy that's happened over there and a lot of the gaming world now coming on board to do some really cool things for the disaster relief over in Japan I don't even have time to name it

892
01:01:32,285 --> 01:01:34,687
[SPEAKER_05]: All, but here's some of the ones that caught my eye.

893
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:38,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeenix is just flat out donating money.

894
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:47,417
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no buy this game for whatever cost or donate through the... No, they are just straight out giving 100 million yen to the relief effort.

895
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:59,367
[SPEAKER_05]: They are also collecting donations from employees throughout the world and they are also going to be getting donations through select Squeenix online services and the amusement facilities that Taito operates in Japan.

896
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Square Enix, Squenix

897
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:17,209
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

898
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:47,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Bungie is currently selling a little band game

899
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:05,388
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

900
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Very similar to what they got going on in iTunes right now.

901
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can just donate the funds that are in the PlayStation wallet or just donate through the PlayStation.

902
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:39,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't know how else to donate, that's one way you can do it.

903
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:41,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

904
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:43,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

905
01:03:43,513 --> 01:03:45,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not even all of them.

906
01:03:45,174 --> 01:03:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of other great things going on out there in the gaming world of people donating money.

907
01:03:50,080 --> 01:04:03,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said last week, please, anybody, if you listen to this show, I really think in lieu of giving us money, which we don't ever ask you for, really would hope you would donate what you can to the relief efforts going on in Japan.

908
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:10,637
[SPEAKER_05]: and even if you're like, I don't have any money, I've got zero cents, donate time would even be helpful at this point.

909
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:15,519
[SPEAKER_05]: The Red Cross can use help all over during this very unfortunate time.

910
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:23,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's take a minute to switch gears here and take a trip down memory lane in a segment we do here on the show every week.

911
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:23,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Music

912
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,830
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

913
01:04:48,957 --> 01:04:56,723
[SPEAKER_01]: or known as Japan as Strider Here You Too which is the official sequel to the first Strider game.

914
01:04:58,044 --> 01:04:59,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm bringing up YouTube right now.

915
01:04:59,405 --> 01:05:00,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry I'm a little delayed here.

916
01:05:00,705 --> 01:05:01,186
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

917
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

918
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:06,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a little bit of the gameplay.

919
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:07,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have some of the music too.

920
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,994
Yeah.

921
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:17,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I really like the first level music first.

922
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:26,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it really is not a sequel to the NES one.

923
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:30,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying because the NES one is actually a retelling of the manga.

924
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:31,589
[SPEAKER_01]: The Strider manga.

925
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:39,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is basically set 2,000 years after the events of the original game.

926
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:44,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Grandmaster has returned to life, and so has Strider Hero.

927
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going through different levels.

928
01:05:49,701 --> 01:05:52,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually 2D sprites over 3D backgrounds.

929
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the same as the original.

930
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty much plays the same.

931
01:05:56,742 --> 01:05:59,123
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got three action buttons.

932
01:05:59,243 --> 01:05:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: He has...

933
01:06:00,863 --> 01:06:04,644
[SPEAKER_01]: All of his old moves like walking, jumping, crouching, sliding, climbing walls and ceilings.

934
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:10,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got a dash now by pressing left or right twice.

935
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:13,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And a double jump, basically you press jump in midair.

936
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And a backwards somersault done while sliding.

937
01:06:16,248 --> 01:06:20,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he can do a thrust jump off of a wall if he's holding onto a wall.

938
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:45,103
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's got like extra slash moves and all kinds of different moves he's got like a boost if he's got a boost item so he can shoot plasma out of his cipher so it's pretty cool and this one actually has a few throwbacks as far as health replenishments you can extend your life bar you have a cipher extension other boosts

939
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:49,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can get different things in the game.

940
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:53,366
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the Yashji and the Sakji symbol from Vulgus.

941
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Zeny Coins from Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds.

942
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:56,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that game.

943
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:57,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgotten Worlds is pretty cool.

944
01:06:57,788 --> 01:07:00,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so you've got five stages.

945
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:04,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of them gives you a little breakdown beforehand.

946
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:09,213
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an appearance of Tanpu in here because she was so cool.

947
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:10,654
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

948
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:14,755
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty awesome.

949
01:07:14,775 --> 01:07:19,676
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the first three on Earth, Hong Kong, Germany, and Antarctica.

950
01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:23,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Hong Kong, of course, the one that Tom Poo was in.

951
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:25,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last two are in space.

952
01:07:25,757 --> 01:07:33,019
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the flying battleship Balrog and Third Moon, which were both locations in the original game.

953
01:07:33,739 --> 01:07:41,261
[SPEAKER_01]: The home version did come out in 2000 on the PlayStation, and I've got both versions, I believe, the Japanese and the US one.

954
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:45,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually comes with two discs.

955
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:50,002
[SPEAKER_01]: On the first disc is Strider 2, and the second disc is the original coin-op version of Strider.

956
01:07:50,803 --> 01:07:51,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty neat.

957
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:57,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But a labeling error on the American one has both discs labeled as Strider, so we used to have to guess.

958
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:05,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you finish the games and do all the achievements on the same memory card, you get a secret level called Strider 2 Mission Zero.

959
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waterfall stage.

960
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:14,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you complete all of the missions, you get Strider Hien as a playable character.

961
01:08:14,713 --> 01:08:17,477
[SPEAKER_01]: He has two ciphers, and it's pretty hardcore and awesome.

962
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:26,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually my favorite person to play through the damn game with is Hien, because it's just like, I've got two of these suckers and I'm bad!

963
01:08:27,053 --> 01:08:30,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And he like, I think can throw one like a boomerang, if I'm right?

964
01:08:31,038 --> 01:08:34,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so yeah, really, really hot.

965
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:37,544
[SPEAKER_01]: This was, I mean, the game is really cool.

966
01:08:37,624 --> 01:08:49,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, if you're, I guess, a veteran of it, then it might seem like it's a little short and a little, but there was so much coolness in it that it's just a fun game.

967
01:08:49,555 --> 01:08:52,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could sit down and play through it in a couple hours.

968
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:53,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fun game.

969
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my game of the week in Strider 2.

970
01:09:00,243 --> 01:09:01,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, good times.

971
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Strider 2.

972
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:06,352
[SPEAKER_05]: The arcade game, also on the PlayStation 1.

973
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:09,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic video game of the week.

974
01:09:10,478 --> 01:09:11,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardcore.

975
01:09:13,269 --> 01:09:16,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, chat room, why are you bothering with Deadpool?

976
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:20,071
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 50 million Deadpool titles out.

977
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:22,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Deadpool's jumped the shark.

978
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:23,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

979
01:09:23,332 --> 01:09:24,733
[SPEAKER_01]: He's only good in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

980
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:25,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

981
01:09:26,653 --> 01:09:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a fan anymore, huh?

982
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:29,394
[SPEAKER_01]: No, okay, I love the character.

983
01:09:30,394 --> 01:09:33,535
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he was fine in Cable and Deadpool.

984
01:09:33,775 --> 01:09:35,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Great series, and then they ended it.

985
01:09:36,036 --> 01:09:39,137
[SPEAKER_01]: But now Deadpool's in like eight titles?

986
01:09:39,497 --> 01:09:40,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously?

987
01:09:40,858 --> 01:09:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's eight.

988
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:44,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, dude, too much Deadpool.

989
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:47,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much of a funny thing is annoying.

990
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:48,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

991
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:50,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Strider 2, awesome game.

992
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:51,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Go play it.

993
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And underappreciated.

994
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly underappreciated.

995
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,080
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

996
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

997
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:58,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio.

998
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some rapid-fire news tonight.

999
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:01,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Twitter topics.

1000
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:04,082
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your last chance to get those in at twitter.com.

1001
01:10:04,982 --> 01:10:07,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Get those in right now so we can read them in a little bit.

1002
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:10,363
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk a little more about the censorship of Mortal Kombat in Australia.

1003
01:10:10,743 --> 01:10:15,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about some legal battles and a possible sequel to the King of Kong movie.

1004
01:10:15,826 --> 01:10:16,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1005
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it might be happening.

1006
01:10:18,108 --> 01:10:22,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll talk about that when we come back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1007
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:31,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1008
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:38,080
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live on this Sunday evening, March the 20th of 2011 with the 406th episode of our show.

1009
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:48,263
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about to get into the Twitter topics, but first some rapid fire news, but not until we plug the side projects that we have or whatever you want to call them.

1010
01:10:48,283 --> 01:10:50,744
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have another little podcast you do.

1011
01:10:51,278 --> 01:10:55,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and if anyone listened to my rant at the end of Part A, this is a rant you'll hear all the time on the show.

1012
01:10:57,204 --> 01:10:58,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Do Comic Insanity.

1013
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:04,511
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download the podcast at infamous, N-F-A-M-O-U-S, .net.

1014
01:11:05,212 --> 01:11:09,816
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically, it is me and Mar and Marvel, and you have something hanging from your shoe.

1015
01:11:10,317 --> 01:11:11,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind, it's your shoelace.

1016
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:13,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that tends to happen, yes.

1017
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just weird.

1018
01:11:14,801 --> 01:11:17,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, and Dan Shadow.

1019
01:11:17,702 --> 01:11:20,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically talk comics.

1020
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:22,164
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about what's coming out, what's on our pull list.

1021
01:11:22,624 --> 01:11:24,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one that we read every week.

1022
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:28,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And next week we are going to have, hopefully, a special guest.

1023
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:30,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll just have to tune in and listen.

1024
01:11:31,049 --> 01:11:31,349
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1025
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:33,390
[SPEAKER_01]: But we go live every Tuesday.

1026
01:11:34,045 --> 01:11:35,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1027
01:11:35,326 --> 01:11:47,119
[SPEAKER_05]: If you enjoy the World of Warcraft, or even if you don't, you just like to hear people talk about it and tell dick and fart jokes along the way, you should definitely check out the best little Horde house in Azeroth that show that Extifer and I do all about World of Warcraft.

1028
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:52,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand new website just launched today, www.hordehouse.com for all the information.

1029
01:11:52,325 --> 01:11:54,627
[SPEAKER_05]: H-O-R-D-E-H-O-U-S-E for all the information.

1030
01:11:54,848 --> 01:11:55,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can download it right there.

1031
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,710
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there you go.

1032
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:05,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get into some rapid-fire news, quick news stories about what is going on in the gaming world that we just don't have a lot of time for otherwise.

1033
01:12:05,213 --> 01:12:05,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1034
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:05,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1035
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:12,856
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the UK, you'll be treated to some LittleBigPlanet 2 download content coming in May.

1036
01:12:13,077 --> 01:12:15,298
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of a little bit different than the normal stuff that they put out.

1037
01:12:15,318 --> 01:12:18,179
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually doing what they call a teacher pack.

1038
01:12:18,859 --> 01:12:20,380
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being developed by Media Molecule.

1039
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to be packed with demonstrations of the national curriculum.

1040
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:30,103
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based in game levels that other teachers have made.

1041
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:37,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this pack will also feature PlayStation Move functionality as well, which is pretty cool.

1042
01:12:37,626 --> 01:12:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't get to play LittleBigPlanet when I was in school, or, well, all we had was... These kids today get DDR machines in their PE classrooms, and now LittleBigPlanet teaching you history.

1043
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:57,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You should grow up on NumberMunchers and Oregon Trail like we did.

1044
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1045
01:13:00,357 --> 01:13:03,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, this is kind of neat.

1046
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:06,320
[SPEAKER_04]: More download content coming to DJ Hero 2.

1047
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:15,544
[SPEAKER_04]: This new, I guess, pack is called the Indie Hip Hop Mix Pack and features the artists...

1048
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:17,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see.

1049
01:13:17,065 --> 01:13:17,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some of the mixes here.

1050
01:13:18,506 --> 01:13:27,674
[SPEAKER_04]: My World Premiere by Charisma and PeanutButterWolf mixed with The Red Instrumental, which is by Jlib.

1051
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Party Hard by The Perceptionists featuring Guru and Kamu Tao mixed with Ghost Rider by RJD2.

1052
01:13:39,443 --> 01:13:43,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And then The Best Day by Atmosphere remixed by FSG.

1053
01:13:45,248 --> 01:14:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: and those are available probably right now actually for $8 or 640 Microsoft points or $300 each or yeah $300 300 Wii points each on the WiiWare store premium for those download content packs on the WiiWare and then of course some more music game download content Dance Central getting some more tracks

1054
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:21,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as much as I was hoping it would be put out by Harmonix, but I guess maybe it takes a little longer to get some dance routines put out.

1055
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Fatboy Slim, Weapon of Choice.

1056
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome song.

1057
01:14:25,082 --> 01:14:26,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Gwen Stefani with Hollaback Girl.

1058
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Carrie Hilston with Turning Me On.

1059
01:14:30,684 --> 01:14:32,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And Paula Abdul with Straight Up.

1060
01:14:32,645 --> 01:14:36,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are available for $3 per track or 240 Microsoft points.

1061
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of download content there.

1062
01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:43,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1063
01:14:58,188 --> 01:14:58,868
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell's that?

1064
01:14:59,309 --> 01:15:02,250
[SPEAKER_04]: U-Star is like karaoke for movie scenes.

1065
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:06,773
[SPEAKER_04]: You read lines and it puts you into the movie like a green screen.

1066
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,133
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds horrible.

1067
01:15:08,314 --> 01:15:17,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it sounds like something I've seen at Disney's California Adventure where you can like, it's set up like Ursula from the Little Mermaid.

1068
01:15:17,378 --> 01:15:20,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did that over where Turtle Talk with Crush is.

1069
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:21,661
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole thing, yep.

1070
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You can reenact scenes from your favorite movies.

1071
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:26,904
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a terrible game.

1072
01:15:27,585 --> 01:15:29,347
[SPEAKER_04]: The interface is just absolutely terrible.

1073
01:15:29,747 --> 01:15:36,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, my co-worker though was doing lines from like 300 and stuff like that.

1074
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:38,915
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Cakedown!

1075
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:57,049
[SPEAKER_04]: and just the way he was doing it though was like like Igor from you know Frankenstein or something like that and just this really weird voice he did the whole thing and it was hilarious and the game has the worst framing ever like we had the camera set up on a table

1076
01:15:57,609 --> 01:16:02,175
[SPEAKER_04]: and like it would zoom in or zoom out too much depending on the scene.

1077
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:04,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like one scene that you could do.

1078
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:05,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of an ad-lib thing.

1079
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the moon or something like moon surface and all it had was his head.

1080
01:16:10,646 --> 01:16:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Just his head was on the screen because...

1081
01:16:13,493 --> 01:16:15,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a terrible game.

1082
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like something you buy for one night of LOLs and then it's over.

1083
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:20,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, wait for it to drop in price.

1084
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:22,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty funny, though, for a drunken party game.

1085
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there you go.

1086
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:25,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other quickfire news here.

1087
01:16:26,523 --> 01:16:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Faction Battlegrounds has a release date.

1088
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:35,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be April 5th, and it will be out for $9.99 on the PlayStation.

1089
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also 800 Microsoft points.

1090
01:16:36,771 --> 01:16:37,432
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

1091
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:44,302
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in the PlayStation Plus thing before March 25th, so this week, you can get the game for free!

1092
01:16:45,003 --> 01:16:48,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is more incentive for you to sign up, I guess, for the PlayStation Plus membership.

1093
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:48,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Free stuff!

1094
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:52,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's Red Faction Battlegrounds.

1095
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:55,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I found this kind of interesting.

1096
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:59,982
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop is now selling 500 gigabyte PlayStation 3s.

1097
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't really make 500 gigabyte PlayStation 3s.

1098
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:04,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do they do it?

1099
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:06,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a refurbished deal.

1100
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:09,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They sell refurbished PlayStation 3s and they call them premium refurbished.

1101
01:17:09,952 --> 01:17:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Refurbished PlayStation 3 Supercharged They come with a 500GB Western Digital Scorpio Blue Hard Drive And like a bunch of peripherals and things come with it too So here's the deal, you can buy one of these for $400 It comes with a PlayStation 3 Slim with the new hard drive A special Supercharged console skin You know, that reminds you how awesome GameStop is for getting this for you A one year warranty on it And then I guess a Media Hub with a remote

1102
01:17:38,335 --> 01:18:05,138
[SPEAKER_05]: uh... increasing the number of USB slots uh... also an HDMI cable so I gotta say it's an interesting little spin on the whole used game stuff uh... there's some people that really like to shop around for used only things to get a deal on it and uh... even though I don't necessarily know if you're getting a deal with this you are getting a lot of extra stuff that a lot of people kind of have to buy anyway like the HDMI cable and so forth um...

1103
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:07,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, guys.

1104
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:10,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have an 80 gig hard drive on my PlayStation 3 and I still haven't hit the limit yet.

1105
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:11,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Knock on wood.

1106
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also don't download a lot of movies.

1107
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not Spazinator.

1108
01:18:15,238 --> 01:18:18,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator calls in every week talking about some video he's downloaded.

1109
01:18:18,419 --> 01:18:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that many movies.

1110
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a 500 gig hard drive in mine.

1111
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:22,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really?

1112
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:24,702
[SPEAKER_05]: You redid it yourself, right?

1113
01:18:24,802 --> 01:18:26,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did it myself because I had 20 in there at one time.

1114
01:18:26,823 --> 01:18:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1115
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:28,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can see.

1116
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:29,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's only 80.

1117
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:30,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't filled it up yet.

1118
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:31,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Knock on wood.

1119
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:40,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess if you're used to paying a lot of money for HDMI cables, it's a good deal.

1120
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:48,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting way to make the used PlayStation 3 business kind of interesting.

1121
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of creative to just get the hard drive and put the new ones in there at the GameStop level.

1122
01:18:53,774 --> 01:19:01,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think also, too, and I'm not sure if GameStop had this problem, but Sony was oh so wonderful and decided, hey, you know what?

1123
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having shortages on the old systems.

1124
01:19:05,402 --> 01:19:08,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So you place a bunch of orders for it and they don't come in forever.

1125
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:11,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, oh, hey, we're going to send a bunch of them to you.

1126
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: You get them.

1127
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:14,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, we're releasing a new SKU.

1128
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:15,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Suckas!

1129
01:19:16,347 --> 01:19:23,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're left with a bunch of systems that... Oh, by the way, we didn't price protect those, so they're going to come out at the same price, and you're stuck with these old systems that nobody wants.

1130
01:19:23,749 --> 01:19:24,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Haha, suckers!

1131
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:34,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if they did that to GameStop, which is very unlikely because they're GameStop, but let's just, for all sakes and purposes, say they did.

1132
01:19:35,372 --> 01:19:37,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are they going to do with all these old systems?

1133
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:40,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they can buy a bunch of hard drives for cheap, upgrade them, and

1134
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:43,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell off the old hard drives, I guess, if they want to.

1135
01:19:44,635 --> 01:19:46,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And sell them for a premium.

1136
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:50,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And make money off the system and the accessories bundled with it.

1137
01:19:52,619 --> 01:19:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And it becomes a unique item for them because there are no 500 gigabyte PS3s.

1138
01:19:58,142 --> 01:20:02,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Toagak in our chatroom is commenting on the size of your hard drive saying, that's a lot of porn, Loki.

1139
01:20:03,686 --> 01:20:04,106
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1140
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:04,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I stream my porn.

1141
01:20:04,906 --> 01:20:05,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually for...

1142
01:20:08,877 --> 01:20:37,570
[SPEAKER_04]: for rips of games but I my system's all legit now I unmodified it because I want to play Motorstorm and you know it's just it was the right thing to do whatever once again remember we got into a couple weeks ago about how there wasn't really much I wanted to play on there well Motorstorm was one of the games I wanted to play but I'm not missing much or anything

1143
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:38,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Wipeout Connect Game

1144
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember this game was already released on the Wii and the DS.

1145
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:09,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it was pretty terrible.

1146
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:18,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they talk about how there are infamous big balls, and I assume they're not talking about genitalia, but these actual giant balls that people bounce.

1147
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never watched this show.

1148
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks idiotic to me, but I guess a lot of people really like it.

1149
01:21:23,442 --> 01:21:26,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But people bounce on giant balls like it's a pinball machine or something.

1150
01:21:27,423 --> 01:21:30,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game, Wipeout, will have more than 30 obstacles.

1151
01:21:30,926 --> 01:21:34,049
[SPEAKER_05]: You will run, duck, dodge, and of course, wipe out.

1152
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:40,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go on this quote about everyone who watches the show wishes they could try the obstacle course, and now this is their chance.

1153
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:42,235
[SPEAKER_05]: No one wishes that.

1154
01:21:42,255 --> 01:21:43,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like Takeshi's Castle?

1155
01:21:43,756 --> 01:21:47,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of like Takashi's Castle, but really dumbed down.

1156
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:52,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of what I get from looking at it, yeah, but I've never... And I'm a reality TV whore, okay?

1157
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch a lot of crap that I deservingly deserve to be made fun of for watching.

1158
01:21:58,883 --> 01:22:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Big Brother, come on.

1159
01:22:00,364 --> 01:22:02,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't watch Wipeout.

1160
01:22:02,545 --> 01:22:03,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to stoop that low.

1161
01:22:04,025 --> 01:22:07,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, remember how they... It's basically, it took all these Japanese game shows and just...

1162
01:22:07,915 --> 01:22:09,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Gutted the soul out of them.

1163
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:14,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like that show, Hole in the Wall, the one that was the funny Japanese game show.

1164
01:22:14,419 --> 01:22:17,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a segment on Ellen, and that's where it should have stayed.

1165
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's funny for two minutes, and that's it.

1166
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was actually, well, it may have been a segment, but it was originally a Japanese game show.

1167
01:22:24,904 --> 01:22:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's funny because they're just playing it for fun.

1168
01:22:29,026 --> 01:22:30,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing it for prizes.

1169
01:22:30,227 --> 01:22:34,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, of course, us Americans don't want to watch anything that's for fun.

1170
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be for money, because who cares about fun?

1171
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:39,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hate that.

1172
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:21,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he would be just as over the top as Chairman Kaga Exactly, he would be just as over the top but this like fictional cousin or something like that is retarded Now he's on a hideous TV sitcom on CBS based off a Twitter account

1173
01:23:22,611 --> 01:23:22,851
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1174
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:28,396
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been on a show for like a year called Shit My Dad Says.

1175
01:23:28,696 --> 01:23:29,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that one.

1176
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:34,841
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've actually thought about starting a Twitter account for Shit My Wife Asked Me About.

1177
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:36,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be kind of long.

1178
01:23:37,963 --> 01:23:39,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weird.

1179
01:23:40,285 --> 01:23:41,286
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some funny stuff.

1180
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:42,467
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it the other day?

1181
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:46,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to remember one of the questions because it was just like, really?

1182
01:23:47,331 --> 01:23:48,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so weird.

1183
01:23:48,112 --> 01:23:48,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1184
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:53,047
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1185
01:24:18,318 --> 01:24:20,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And what if you need to spell Deseret because you're a Mormon?

1186
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:22,860
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Deseret.

1187
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, listen, that's the way I learned how to spell dessert.

1188
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:32,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't like it, you can shut the hell up or you can go to hell.

1189
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:36,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And so she wrote that on Facebook.

1190
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:37,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1191
01:24:38,265 --> 01:24:44,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But she asked me weird shit all the time, like all these random questions about things.

1192
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:46,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the job of a wife to ask her husband really bizarre things.

1193
01:24:47,509 --> 01:24:49,050
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the bizarre things you ask Dan?

1194
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:49,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan!

1195
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:53,371
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the bizarre stuff I ask you?

1196
01:24:56,712 --> 01:24:57,533
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he doesn't know.

1197
01:24:57,833 --> 01:25:00,694
[SPEAKER_04]: She keeps asking me questions about mythological creatures and stuff.

1198
01:25:00,714 --> 01:25:02,954
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, you know, what's this look like?

1199
01:25:02,974 --> 01:25:03,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't know.

1200
01:25:04,235 --> 01:25:04,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid thingy!

1201
01:25:07,576 --> 01:25:08,877
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that happens.

1202
01:25:09,177 --> 01:25:11,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that happens like when you get married?

1203
01:25:11,838 --> 01:25:15,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like, you know, Alan doesn't really ask me stupid shit.

1204
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:15,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Like,

1205
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:30,651
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you've got someone who's got a really kind of wandering mind, every so often the weirdest questions will pop up, and when you hit that comfort level, they'll just ask you.

1206
01:25:31,671 --> 01:25:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically it tends to be, I've noticed the wife, or the girlfriend, or...

1207
01:25:40,723 --> 01:26:08,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess and every so often just the most random questions but because I feel so comfortable around my husband I'll just blurt them on out like you know I don't know it just occurs to me when this whole thing was funnier in your guys' head like it seems like a big in joke or something but I'm just thank god I'm not a lesbian I wonder how it would be amongst lesbians if they would both annoy the crap out of each other with annoying questions

1208
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:10,813
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

1209
01:26:30,271 --> 01:26:33,132
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the Billy Joel Piano Challenge.

1210
01:26:34,632 --> 01:26:43,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It has I Go To Extremes, Miami 2017, Seeing the Lights Go On on Broadway, My Life, which was the theme from Bosom Buddies.

1211
01:26:44,354 --> 01:26:46,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to watch that show.

1212
01:26:46,195 --> 01:26:50,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Prelude, Angry Young Man, and scenes from Italian Restaurant, and She's Always a Woman.

1213
01:26:51,016 --> 01:26:56,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also, for some of these, pro guitar bass expansions available for another 80 Microsoft points.

1214
01:26:57,097 --> 01:27:01,298
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire pack will be 800 Microsoft points or 1,000 Wii points or 10 bucks.

1215
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:04,019
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1216
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:04,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.

1217
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:07,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really... I do not like Billy Joel.

1218
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:07,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1219
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Billy Joel was like kind of one of those things that was better left.

1220
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:14,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why don't they... If it's a piano pack, why don't they freaking put Piano Man in it?

1221
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:15,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1222
01:27:15,823 --> 01:27:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait.

1223
01:27:16,063 --> 01:27:17,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might... That might already be out.

1224
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:17,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1225
01:27:17,743 --> 01:27:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think there was a Billy Joel pack already.

1226
01:27:19,004 --> 01:27:19,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well then fine.

1227
01:27:20,004 --> 01:27:20,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1228
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:21,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Piano Man was in there already.

1229
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:24,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this might be like... That's how much I like Billy Joel.

1230
01:27:24,425 --> 01:27:25,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't look.

1231
01:27:25,165 --> 01:27:26,526
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the only song he does that I like.

1232
01:27:29,304 --> 01:27:31,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the song Philadelphia even though the movie is really sad

1233
01:27:36,112 --> 01:27:36,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story.

1234
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:07,199
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1235
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:10,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told our friend Melody.

1236
01:28:11,122 --> 01:28:11,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1237
01:28:12,183 --> 01:28:14,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not buy that song on iTunes.

1238
01:28:15,185 --> 01:28:16,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Too late.

1239
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:18,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wanted her to reach number one.

1240
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost all respect.

1241
01:28:23,292 --> 01:28:24,253
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the reason why.

1242
01:28:25,393 --> 01:28:31,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no talent rich kids do not need the dollar that is better spent on Jolly Rangers.

1243
01:28:34,157 --> 01:28:34,477
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

1244
01:28:34,537 --> 01:28:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on a diet.

1245
01:28:37,218 --> 01:28:37,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1246
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a Girl Scout cookie?

1247
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:40,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1248
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got some.

1249
01:28:42,782 --> 01:28:43,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get it.

1250
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:45,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't blame a little girl with a dream.

1251
01:28:46,085 --> 01:28:47,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Blame the music production company.

1252
01:28:47,706 --> 01:28:53,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same thing I said when the future could have been a dollar closer to getting that music production company to make you a song.

1253
01:28:54,472 --> 01:28:54,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1254
01:28:56,013 --> 01:28:57,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just jealous because I don't have a song.

1255
01:28:57,594 --> 01:29:01,037
[SPEAKER_01]: She's way auto-tuned, and you can tell she can't sing.

1256
01:29:03,378 --> 01:29:07,181
[SPEAKER_05]: They interviewed her on Good Morning America, and they made her sing a few bars of America the Beautiful.

1257
01:29:07,641 --> 01:29:08,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Was she the best singer I've ever heard?

1258
01:29:08,982 --> 01:29:09,162
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1259
01:29:09,622 --> 01:29:11,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But was she talented?

1260
01:29:11,383 --> 01:29:12,644
[SPEAKER_05]: She's 13!

1261
01:29:13,345 --> 01:29:14,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, why are we arguing about this?

1262
01:29:14,786 --> 01:29:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talented, and I can't sing.

1263
01:29:16,607 --> 01:29:17,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is this guy famous?

1264
01:29:19,809 --> 01:29:22,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you pay this guy a dollar to play this song on a rock band?

1265
01:29:24,253 --> 01:29:25,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this one's funny.

1266
01:29:26,414 --> 01:29:27,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Friday's funny.

1267
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:29,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday's just sad.

1268
01:29:29,815 --> 01:29:32,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only funny with the video, with the girl with the braces.

1269
01:29:32,615 --> 01:29:40,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I would pay a dollar to play Nightman from It's Always Sunny.

1270
01:29:44,499 --> 01:29:44,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1271
01:29:46,343 --> 01:29:48,424
[SPEAKER_04]: About a man coming in and raping somebody.

1272
01:29:48,924 --> 01:29:49,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it or is there another one?

1273
01:29:49,865 --> 01:29:50,625
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's another one.

1274
01:29:51,405 --> 01:30:04,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3's Shuma Gorath and Jill download content are... Shuma Gorath downloadable content is delayed.

1275
01:30:05,712 --> 01:30:08,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be 400 Microsoft points, which is five bucks each.

1276
01:30:09,734 --> 01:30:11,936
[SPEAKER_01]: How does one delay something that's already on the disc?

1277
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:13,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question, actually.

1278
01:30:31,454 --> 01:30:33,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot where the key was to unlock this.

1279
01:30:35,117 --> 01:30:36,858
[SPEAKER_05]: The keys fell on the couch.

1280
01:30:36,978 --> 01:30:38,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta go find those keys.

1281
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Down the drain.

1282
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna have to get a string and a magnet.

1283
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why that's really funny, but I'm just imagining Capcom putting out this press release.

1284
01:30:51,261 --> 01:30:55,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry guys, we had to delay the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 downloads content.

1285
01:30:55,843 --> 01:31:00,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to find a string and a magnet right now to find the unlock key.

1286
01:31:00,304 --> 01:31:03,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So please bear with us, and thank you for your patience.

1287
01:31:03,325 --> 01:31:04,846
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate our fans.

1288
01:31:05,966 --> 01:31:06,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, Capcom.

1289
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:13,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we appreciate you enough for you to pay for our download content.

1290
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:15,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, pay to unlock content.

1291
01:31:15,632 --> 01:31:16,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter topics!

1292
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:17,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1293
01:31:17,453 --> 01:31:19,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1294
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:22,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to a tweet coming up first from Defective Candy.

1295
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, let me turn down the little song there in the background.

1296
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:32,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Defective Candy was sending us a tweet about augmented reality makes the 3DS bigger than Gigantor.

1297
01:31:33,484 --> 01:31:33,804
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this?

1298
01:31:33,824 --> 01:31:43,170
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a link from Japanator sending us this story here about the 3DS had launched some time ago and

1299
01:31:45,732 --> 01:31:49,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, it's about, you have to remember, I'm reading these for the first time thanks to Twitter.

1300
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:52,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it has to do with the AR tech.

1301
01:31:52,756 --> 01:31:53,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

1302
01:31:53,716 --> 01:32:04,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks have made a supersized version of the 3DS pack-in augmented reality card, all for the sake of giving Kobe's lonely life-size Tetsujin 28-go statue some company.

1303
01:32:04,641 --> 01:32:08,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you see in the video below, he does need a friend, it may well be a me.

1304
01:32:08,163 --> 01:32:09,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta see this video, what is going on?

1305
01:32:09,884 --> 01:32:11,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see, they have this big statue that they did.

1306
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.

1307
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:24,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they did, instead of having the guy stand on the mat to take the picture, they got this gigantic version of it to put the statue on.

1308
01:32:24,153 --> 01:32:24,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what they did.

1309
01:32:25,953 --> 01:32:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: They took the little pack-in augmented reality thing, put it under the statue dude, and now he's in the 3DS augmented reality game.

1310
01:32:39,872 --> 01:32:40,872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of funny, I like that.

1311
01:32:42,373 --> 01:32:44,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that probably made for terrible radio, but hey, you tweeted it.

1312
01:32:44,654 --> 01:32:54,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on to another Twitter from Silversonic1534 sending us another really good story about helping the folks out in Japan for the disaster relief.

1313
01:32:55,218 --> 01:33:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: A rare Nintendo DS, it was signed by a bunch of Nintendo veterans and it was auctioned off this week.

1314
01:33:00,861 --> 01:33:01,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1315
01:33:02,602 --> 01:33:18,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it was a Mario Kart DS promo system and it was signed by Miyamoto, Koji Kondo, uh, the Zelda chief Eiji Onomura, uh, Charles Martinet, Martin Lung, who does the pianist for video game or does the piano stuff for video games live.

1316
01:33:19,155 --> 01:33:24,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, all of that was, uh, autographed by all those people and they sold it.

1317
01:33:24,339 --> 01:33:26,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly how much they went for.

1318
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:28,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look, let me see on eBay real quick.

1319
01:33:29,133 --> 01:33:30,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, it hasn't sold yet.

1320
01:33:30,674 --> 01:33:33,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got 16 hours left.

1321
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:35,256
[SPEAKER_05]: $2,500, or sorry, $2,550.

1322
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:39,598
[SPEAKER_05]: $2,550 is what it's at right now.

1323
01:33:40,298 --> 01:33:41,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to check that out.

1324
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,161
[SPEAKER_05]: More tweets coming to us from Tiger Claw.

1325
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:48,943
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP-based augmented reality game.

1326
01:33:48,983 --> 01:33:51,484
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it with all the augmented reality games tonight?

1327
01:33:51,504 --> 01:33:52,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's popular.

1328
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:52,725
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yeah.

1329
01:33:52,905 --> 01:33:56,967
[SPEAKER_05]: This is turning school into an adventure worth writing about.

1330
01:33:57,947 --> 01:34:03,589
[SPEAKER_05]: that actually sounds kind of awesome I'd like to see something like that on an even bigger scale I don't know like Amazing Race but for real

1331
01:34:25,858 --> 01:34:39,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow Amazingly real race The amazingly real race on PSP Apparently the program went over very well Very enthusiastic response to that The kids were well behaved and cooperated when they took part Kind of neat I like that idea

1332
01:34:43,574 --> 01:34:54,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when you were in grade school and you'd go on a tour of a historical building and you'd have to put on those big headphones and as you walked under certain places you would hear the stuff in the headphones.

1333
01:34:54,999 --> 01:34:56,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all based off radios.

1334
01:34:57,401 --> 01:35:06,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine now if you could use these augmented reality devices to scan into certain codes at places and you would read a little bit about what it is you're at or what the importance of the location is.

1335
01:35:07,025 --> 01:35:07,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1336
01:35:07,325 --> 01:35:09,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what this reminds me of to some extent.

1337
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:09,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

1338
01:35:10,107 --> 01:35:10,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of neat.

1339
01:35:11,147 --> 01:35:14,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, one other tweet here from TigerClaw.

1340
01:35:15,129 --> 01:35:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: AMD has made a statement that DirectX is holding back the graphics performance on the PC.

1341
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:25,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Links us to a story from Gamasutra here via our Twitter.

1342
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:28,975
[SPEAKER_05]: A quote here from AMDGP...

1343
01:35:31,136 --> 01:35:34,538
[SPEAKER_05]: GPU Division Worldwide Developer Relations Manager Richard Huddy.

1344
01:35:35,139 --> 01:35:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, it's funny, we often have at least 10 times as much horsepower as an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3 in a high-end graphics card, yet it's very clear that the games don't look 10 times as good.

1345
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:52,730
[SPEAKER_05]: To a significant extent, that's because, one way or another, for good reasons and bad, mostly good, DirectX is getting in the way.

1346
01:35:54,171 --> 01:35:55,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, mostly good, but...

1347
01:35:56,348 --> 01:35:58,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I guess maybe that's because, you know.

1348
01:35:58,690 --> 01:35:59,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bitch about something.

1349
01:35:59,811 --> 01:36:04,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mostly for the good of the game, but we can't do it.

1350
01:36:04,675 --> 01:36:07,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't the Xbox 360 all based off a version of that?

1351
01:36:07,157 --> 01:36:09,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wasn't the original name of the Xbox the DirectXbox?

1352
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:10,960
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1353
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:12,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that's what it was.

1354
01:36:13,062 --> 01:36:14,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that's where this whole thing came from.

1355
01:36:14,463 --> 01:36:23,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's basically like the Xbox 360 is running on a modified version of DirectX 9 that has some of the features of DirectX 10 in it.

1356
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:51,543
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's basically DirectX 9 alright and one more tweet here from GamerGirl saying which do you think is better Torchlight PC version or Torchlight Xbox Live version and what do you find fun about the game as a whole I would say the PC version is much better and the reason for that is that they tried to cram too much into the Xbox Live one and unfortunately it suffers from some frame rate issues and just a really awkward interface I mean

1357
01:36:51,923 --> 01:37:14,288
[SPEAKER_05]: for a dungeon crawler collect a bunch of items games it doesn't work too well on Xbox I mean if for whatever reason you hate gaming on the PC then the Xbox is an okay substitute I've played far worse games on Xbox Live but I just think between the two the PC version is superior what do I like about the game well did you ever play Diablo 2 because if you like that that's why I like Torchlight because it's like a newer version of that

1358
01:37:14,656 --> 01:37:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Dungeons are always randomly generated Exploring and collecting Level 3 is always different

1359
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It's random for each person that plays it and I think that's part of the charm of it.

1360
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm letting in one more tweet here from SSJ100Matt saying Someone took My Little Pony and mixed it with the StarCraft 2 trailer and sends us a link to something on YouTube called PonyCraft.

1361
01:38:03,058 --> 01:38:04,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what to do.

1362
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:06,019
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not My Little Pony.

1363
01:38:06,039 --> 01:38:06,719
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like Noose.

1364
01:38:07,219 --> 01:38:09,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they redo My Little Pony a couple years ago or something?

1365
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:10,800
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have.

1366
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,881
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the one from the airs.

1367
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,841
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not going to make sense to me.

1368
01:38:16,881 --> 01:38:18,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like a new My Little Pony.

1369
01:38:22,423 --> 01:38:24,523
[SPEAKER_02]: My Little Oni.

1370
01:38:24,883 --> 01:38:26,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has far too much time on their hands.

1371
01:38:26,524 --> 01:38:27,424
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm going to say.

1372
01:38:30,615 --> 01:38:34,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, if that's the project you want to be famous for, then cool.

1373
01:38:34,518 --> 01:38:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty hilarious.

1374
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

1375
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:40,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen weirder things on YouTube, I guess.

1376
01:38:40,262 --> 01:38:40,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Nuclear Boy?

1377
01:38:41,503 --> 01:38:41,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1378
01:38:42,044 --> 01:38:42,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not seen Nuclear Boy.

1379
01:38:43,004 --> 01:38:44,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Nuclear Boy.

1380
01:38:44,145 --> 01:38:47,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is... And it's a great way to describe it to children.

1381
01:38:47,941 --> 01:38:52,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not up to date on all my astrological stuff that's going on right now.

1382
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:53,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Or astronomical, I guess.

1383
01:38:54,085 --> 01:38:55,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, astronomical.

1384
01:38:55,666 --> 01:38:59,929
[SPEAKER_04]: But what the fuck is the super moon that I keep seeing fucking tweets about and shit?

1385
01:38:59,969 --> 01:39:03,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about the moon being closer in orbit, I believe.

1386
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:12,334
[SPEAKER_05]: The moon was supposed to be gigantic in the sky last night, but we wouldn't know because it's been raining for like nine fucking days straight here, so the clouds have been blocking the sky.

1387
01:39:12,914 --> 01:39:14,194
[SPEAKER_05]: You missed something, but you didn't.

1388
01:39:14,754 --> 01:39:16,055
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have had to drive that way.

1389
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:19,095
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a picture of it from Washington, D.C.

1390
01:39:19,976 --> 01:39:20,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1391
01:39:20,616 --> 01:39:21,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The supermoon.

1392
01:39:21,696 --> 01:39:22,937
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there it is big.

1393
01:39:23,197 --> 01:39:24,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's dumb.

1394
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not big at all.

1395
01:39:26,144 --> 01:39:28,146
[SPEAKER_05]: But the moon's really big, Loki.

1396
01:39:28,166 --> 01:39:29,106
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one.

1397
01:39:29,126 --> 01:39:30,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a super moon.

1398
01:39:31,068 --> 01:39:31,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Over Los Angeles.

1399
01:39:32,469 --> 01:39:38,054
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it's over Los Angeles, it's orange with a big rip across it like an Evangelion or something.

1400
01:39:39,335 --> 01:39:39,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

1401
01:39:40,596 --> 01:39:41,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can see that.

1402
01:39:43,158 --> 01:39:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1403
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:45,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter topics are done.

1404
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:46,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So back into the news.

1405
01:39:46,621 --> 01:39:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1406
01:39:48,177 --> 01:39:52,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so... Supermoon.

1407
01:39:53,061 --> 01:39:56,724
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been kind of a thing that's been going on with Australia for the longest time.

1408
01:39:58,186 --> 01:40:03,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Take violent game, ban it, because hey, you know what, we don't have anything that's for adults.

1409
01:40:04,552 --> 01:40:05,593
[SPEAKER_04]: So, too bad.

1410
01:40:06,635 --> 01:40:17,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently, Mortal Kombat, they appealed the failure to rate the game, because it was not classified as R15.

1411
01:40:19,028 --> 01:40:22,113
[SPEAKER_04]: and instead their appeal was rejected.

1412
01:40:22,534 --> 01:40:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, unless changes are made, they cannot release it in Australia.

1413
01:40:30,697 --> 01:40:31,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of sucks.

1414
01:40:32,859 --> 01:40:35,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will ban the title from official retail distribution.

1415
01:40:36,423 --> 01:40:38,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Warner Bros.

1416
01:40:38,845 --> 01:40:40,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Games is extremely disappointed.

1417
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:42,429
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always the comment.

1418
01:40:42,489 --> 01:40:43,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We're extremely disappointed.

1419
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:45,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be like, we're fucking pissed.

1420
01:40:46,213 --> 01:40:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be my fucking press statement right there.

1421
01:40:49,116 --> 01:40:50,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck them in their asses.

1422
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:50,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We're pissed.

1423
01:40:52,957 --> 01:41:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were praising thousands of Mortal Kombat fans in Australia and around the world who have voiced their support during the appeal process.

1424
01:41:01,929 --> 01:41:04,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1425
01:41:04,411 --> 01:41:04,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1426
01:41:04,991 --> 01:41:05,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you surprised?

1427
01:41:05,812 --> 01:41:08,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they banned games with lesser crap in there.

1428
01:41:10,855 --> 01:41:12,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say that this will always be the case.

1429
01:41:12,977 --> 01:41:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they're actually pressing the... I guess the Australian federal government is... They're hoping to have a consensus on the R18 game rating creation.

1430
01:41:26,926 --> 01:41:30,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is stupid that this is all government-run anyways, but whatever.

1431
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:53,818
[SPEAKER_04]: of course the MA 15 plus that the country already has for mature games is not good enough for some of these so adding the restricted 18 plus rating will allow them to release some of these more mature games into the country

1432
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:12,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I foreshadow that if there's not consensus around this issue, the Commonwealth will certainly be considering other options because we cannot continue to have an outdated classification system that's actually, in my view, causing harm to young people.

1433
01:42:14,258 --> 01:42:16,760
[SPEAKER_05]: The Saw movies aren't banned there, right?

1434
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:17,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1435
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,682
[SPEAKER_05]: What I saw in this game was no worse than Saw.

1436
01:42:19,982 --> 01:42:22,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm always going to use that as my defense.

1437
01:42:22,904 --> 01:42:24,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Those goddamn Saw movies are terrible.

1438
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't understand how they always rate games as, well, it's interactive, so it's more violent.

1439
01:42:29,528 --> 01:42:30,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

1440
01:42:55,842 --> 01:42:56,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1441
01:43:10,126 --> 01:43:15,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's more serious problems with them than them playing a violent game.

1442
01:43:16,309 --> 01:43:19,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with them taking violence out of video games completely.

1443
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:24,252
[SPEAKER_05]: They could just strip every video game out there of violence as long as we could get ample nudity in its place.

1444
01:43:24,793 --> 01:43:26,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.

1445
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some boobs.

1446
01:43:27,474 --> 01:43:28,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Nudity is even worse.

1447
01:43:28,814 --> 01:43:31,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh my god, there's a little bit of nudity in this game.

1448
01:43:32,016 --> 01:43:32,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, bad.

1449
01:43:33,156 --> 01:43:34,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but violence, we can...

1450
01:43:36,698 --> 01:44:04,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Drill holes in this guy's head while he's still alive But as soon as you want to fuck one of those holes, up, banned Wow Well, speaking of legal troubles You might remember that Activision had filed a suit against Electronic Arts and the former heads of Infinity Ward Well, in California, it was ruled this week that the lawsuit filed by Activision against the former Infinity Ward studio heads was

1451
01:44:05,277 --> 01:44:08,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Vince Sampanella and Jason West, it will be able to proceed.

1452
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:14,926
[SPEAKER_05]: EA wanted to have the case dismissed, but unfortunately the judge felt differently.

1453
01:44:15,506 --> 01:44:18,229
[SPEAKER_05]: They decided there is enough evidence that the case can go on to trial.

1454
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:22,672
[SPEAKER_05]: EA's options now at this point, they can still request a summary judgment.

1455
01:44:23,353 --> 01:44:26,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, you know, it could all be rejected.

1456
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:29,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that doesn't happen, then the case can go to trial in May of this year.

1457
01:44:30,419 --> 01:44:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting.

1458
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:34,282
[SPEAKER_05]: or it will get settled out of court before then because that's what always seems to happen.

1459
01:44:34,342 --> 01:44:36,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Has a video game case ever gone to trial?

1460
01:44:36,464 --> 01:44:37,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't they always get settled out of court?

1461
01:44:37,865 --> 01:44:39,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've ever seen one go to trial.

1462
01:44:41,427 --> 01:44:43,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about one between companies.

1463
01:44:43,428 --> 01:44:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about some crazed asshole played an Xbox and decided to do something stupid.

1464
01:44:48,552 --> 01:44:50,853
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a true game lawsuit.

1465
01:44:50,873 --> 01:44:52,675
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just an idiot doing something idiotic.

1466
01:44:53,075 --> 01:44:56,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about an actual two companies suing each other.

1467
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:58,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it ever not get settled?

1468
01:44:59,565 --> 01:45:00,146
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1469
01:45:22,415 --> 01:45:25,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I pulled up the mailbag instead of the story.

1470
01:45:25,257 --> 01:45:25,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

1471
01:45:25,777 --> 01:45:26,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1472
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:32,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm sure people remember me having spoken of the King of Kong, right?

1473
01:45:33,123 --> 01:45:39,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the video of Steve Weeby and Billy... Mitchell.

1474
01:45:40,148 --> 01:45:40,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitchell, yes.

1475
01:45:40,908 --> 01:45:43,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, he's a jerk, so I don't care.

1476
01:45:44,050 --> 01:45:47,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to compete for the top score on Donkey Kong.

1477
01:45:47,473 --> 01:45:51,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we've got a new documentary out called...

1478
01:45:53,417 --> 01:45:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: and Dr. Kong.

1479
01:45:55,398 --> 01:46:11,968
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is about Dr. Qian, who is a plastic surgeon who beat Steve Weeby's record, reset record, by hitting 1,090,400 points on Donkey Kong.

1480
01:46:12,689 --> 01:46:16,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So there actually is a website about it.

1481
01:46:16,251 --> 01:46:18,792
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to drkongthemovie.com

1482
01:46:21,113 --> 01:46:24,054
[SPEAKER_05]: and... Can I play the trailer here?

1483
01:46:24,175 --> 01:46:24,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Play it, sure.

1484
01:46:24,735 --> 01:46:26,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interesting, actually.

1485
01:46:26,235 --> 01:46:26,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1486
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:27,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

1487
01:46:27,896 --> 01:46:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1488
01:46:28,896 --> 01:46:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see scenes of the plastic surgery going on.

1489
01:46:32,877 --> 01:46:35,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Establishing shots of, yes, this dude is a surgeon.

1490
01:46:35,858 --> 01:46:37,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm copying this to the chatroom, by the way.

1491
01:46:37,219 --> 01:46:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1492
01:46:40,342 --> 01:46:42,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you see him playing some Donkey Kong.

1493
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:45,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And he has a Donkey Kong machine.

1494
01:46:45,285 --> 01:46:52,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I was killing one of the people at Twin Galaxies, and when he found out I was a plastic surgeon, he was like, shouldn't you be out getting laid?

1495
01:46:52,130 --> 01:46:53,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why are you playing Donkey Kong?

1496
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm playing Donkey Kong so I can get laid.

1497
01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1498
01:47:01,514 --> 01:47:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: He's playing Donkey Kong so he can get laid?

1499
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:04,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't get that.

1500
01:47:04,777 --> 01:47:05,697
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a plastic surgeon.

1501
01:47:05,737 --> 01:47:07,699
[SPEAKER_05]: He makes girls' boobies bigger all day long.

1502
01:47:07,959 --> 01:47:09,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what plastic surgeons do, right?

1503
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,961
[SPEAKER_05]: All they do is boob jobs, right?

1504
01:47:12,628 --> 01:47:15,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, chin jobs and lipo and... Nose jobs.

1505
01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Never reconstructive surgeries after accidents, though.

1506
01:47:18,633 --> 01:47:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1507
01:47:18,893 --> 01:47:19,013
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1508
01:47:19,994 --> 01:47:21,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Just boob jobs.

1509
01:47:21,575 --> 01:47:22,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need that.

1510
01:47:22,215 --> 01:47:28,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So he works on boobies all day, but he plays Donkey Kong to get laid.

1511
01:47:29,681 --> 01:47:31,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I see the logic there, but let's continue.

1512
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like, I don't know, fame, I guess, or glory, I don't know.

1513
01:47:40,106 --> 01:47:42,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations!

1514
01:47:42,687 --> 01:47:46,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul, this guy's the guy that beat the world, that just beat the Donkey Kong.

1515
01:47:48,788 --> 01:47:51,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you have the world record, you have to quit playing.

1516
01:47:51,309 --> 01:47:54,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?

1517
01:47:55,270 --> 01:48:00,511
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the trailer.

1518
01:48:01,051 --> 01:48:02,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?

1519
01:48:04,235 --> 01:48:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that the big question that's going to be answered in the movie?

1520
01:48:06,576 --> 01:48:07,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, does he get laid?

1521
01:48:09,598 --> 01:48:09,738
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1522
01:48:10,038 --> 01:48:10,999
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he does not get laid.

1523
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what a downer.

1524
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:17,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And to... He sounds like William.

1525
01:48:19,203 --> 01:48:19,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it!

1526
01:48:20,564 --> 01:48:21,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it!

1527
01:48:21,404 --> 01:48:25,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, Mark, you are so red in the face right now.

1528
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:29,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm mad that he dared bring that up on this program.

1529
01:48:30,028 --> 01:48:30,909
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a dick.

1530
01:48:31,349 --> 01:48:32,810
[SPEAKER_01]: At least he sounds more educated.

1531
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Next story!

1532
01:48:40,775 --> 01:48:42,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, put the 3DS down.

1533
01:48:42,918 --> 01:48:45,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, put the 3DS down before I shove it up your ass.

1534
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:51,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next story, we're going to talk a little bit about Minecraft.

1535
01:48:51,128 --> 01:48:51,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft.

1536
01:48:52,222 --> 01:48:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Minecraft.

1537
01:48:54,743 --> 01:48:58,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft, they're going the route of Nintendogs.

1538
01:48:59,184 --> 01:49:06,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to get your own, I guess, domesticated wolf canines.

1539
01:49:07,167 --> 01:49:11,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll be able to walk around with them and whatnot.

1540
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:30,708
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course later on they're going to be adding achievements as well that's the next thing but for right now they are working on pet wolves neat I guess I don't know if they really would do much I mean can you train them to attack things

1541
01:49:33,785 --> 01:49:35,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who has pet wolves.

1542
01:49:36,266 --> 01:49:36,466
[SPEAKER_01]: For real?

1543
01:49:36,486 --> 01:49:37,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Like real ones?

1544
01:49:37,106 --> 01:49:37,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1545
01:49:37,807 --> 01:49:38,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Just hanging out in the backyard?

1546
01:49:39,127 --> 01:49:42,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a couple of them are half wolves and one of them's full.

1547
01:49:42,728 --> 01:49:43,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Sack?

1548
01:49:44,009 --> 01:49:44,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1549
01:49:45,209 --> 01:49:46,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's kind of random.

1550
01:49:46,309 --> 01:49:47,050
[SPEAKER_01]: They're domesticated.

1551
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of neat.

1552
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:52,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, they're kind of cool looking, I guess.

1553
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: These Minecraft ones are far more adorable, that's all I'm saying.

1554
01:49:54,852 --> 01:49:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: They are pretty adorable.

1555
01:49:56,633 --> 01:49:57,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he going to punch that wolf?

1556
01:49:58,467 --> 01:49:59,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's gonna beat it with a, no?

1557
01:50:00,108 --> 01:50:00,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Punch?

1558
01:50:01,229 --> 01:50:01,770
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

1559
01:50:02,490 --> 01:50:03,611
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that he has in his hand?

1560
01:50:03,992 --> 01:50:04,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like a stub.

1561
01:50:05,613 --> 01:50:06,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's like a stick to play fetch.

1562
01:50:07,014 --> 01:50:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, maybe.

1563
01:50:09,476 --> 01:50:10,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have yet to play Minecraft.

1564
01:50:10,777 --> 01:50:12,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel so uncool and uneducated.

1565
01:50:13,059 --> 01:50:15,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of feel the same way.

1566
01:50:15,561 --> 01:50:16,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so kind to me tonight.

1567
01:50:18,344 --> 01:50:24,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Now he's punching a, oh, he punched a cow in the ass and then the wolves are attacking the cow.

1568
01:50:27,239 --> 01:50:27,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1569
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can sick your wolves on other things.

1570
01:50:32,246 --> 01:50:34,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess you can now release the hounds.

1571
01:50:37,032 --> 01:50:37,673
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat.

1572
01:50:40,617 --> 01:50:41,018
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1573
01:50:41,789 --> 01:50:42,269
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1574
01:51:11,889 --> 01:51:13,110
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1575
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:36,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried, and I just honestly couldn't get into it.

1576
01:51:37,112 --> 01:51:38,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't fun to me.

1577
01:51:38,133 --> 01:51:41,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like the big thing in gaming right now.

1578
01:51:41,436 --> 01:51:45,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Minecraft and Angry Birds are the biggest games.

1579
01:51:45,319 --> 01:51:54,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and if the biggest thing in gaming was for everyone to play their Nintendo 3DS while walking towards the end of a broken bridge, guess what?

1580
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be playing PSP in my house.

1581
01:51:57,911 --> 01:52:00,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kodu Game Lab The Kodu Cup 2011

1582
01:52:21,631 --> 01:52:23,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for students aged 9 to 17.

1583
01:52:24,672 --> 01:52:26,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh great, the target age group of our show.

1584
01:52:27,852 --> 01:52:30,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Divided into two age groups within the 9 to 17 bracket.

1585
01:52:31,093 --> 01:52:33,394
[SPEAKER_05]: You will use the software to design your game.

1586
01:52:33,634 --> 01:52:35,194
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to submit it by May 10th.

1587
01:52:35,474 --> 01:52:48,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Prizes, $5,000 awards for both individuals and schools, a trip to New York City, laptop, Kinect bundles, and a Zune HD, which is amazing because didn't we also have a story this week that the Zune got axed?

1588
01:52:48,457 --> 01:52:48,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1589
01:52:48,937 --> 01:52:51,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they gotta get rid of them somehow.

1590
01:52:51,538 --> 01:52:57,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll have like 5,000 Zune HDs as runner-up prizes trying to get rid of their overstock.

1591
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's too bad.

1592
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:05,122
[SPEAKER_05]: What I like about this is the screenshot I'm looking at of the Kodu Game Lab.

1593
01:53:05,163 --> 01:53:08,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has designed the lost numbers as a computer chip.

1594
01:53:08,164 --> 01:53:09,904
[SPEAKER_05]: The 4, 8, 15, forget it.

1595
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:17,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so if you are between 9 and 17 and you want to win money or a Zune because they're so popular, check that out.

1596
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, let's go to the mailbag!

1597
01:53:20,682 --> 01:53:34,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week, DarkSakura reads the emails that you guys send us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com So, why don't, DarkSakura, I want you to put on your surgical gloves, get ready to jump in there and do some plastic surgery on the mailbag.

1598
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:35,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew, it's squishy!

1599
01:53:37,532 --> 01:53:38,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a boob.

1600
01:53:39,514 --> 01:53:40,414
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not like a boob.

1601
01:53:40,514 --> 01:53:43,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Like putting your finger up a butt or something.

1602
01:53:44,057 --> 01:53:44,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1603
01:53:45,058 --> 01:53:45,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR.

1604
01:53:45,879 --> 01:53:47,400
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your friendly neighborhood spazinator.

1605
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:53,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing as the OLR mailbag has been a wee bit on the light side as of late, I thought it might be...

1606
01:53:54,706 --> 01:54:00,453
[SPEAKER_01]: and Gudum Idea to send an email rather than a tweet for a change of pace.

1607
01:54:01,054 --> 01:54:06,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a little something of note that bears mentioning seeing as it relates to a subject you folks touched on last week.

1608
01:54:06,781 --> 01:54:07,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Must be why I wasn't here.

1609
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:16,581
[SPEAKER_01]: with the recent events in Japan in mind, SCEA's arrangement to relay donations to the Red Cross from one's PSN wallet.

1610
01:54:17,081 --> 01:54:24,823
[SPEAKER_01]: As of the time I typed this, there is a spot on the game's site at the PSN store, the first icon you see once you enter the new releases section, that allow you to make donations of $2, $5, $10, $25, and $50 in US funds.

1611
01:54:29,304 --> 01:54:47,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that you could make multiple donations and mix and match amounts as well Although I can't say for sure that I don't have access to the stores in other regions I'd imagine there's similar setups in other regions' PSN stores as well In case either one of you or a fellow listener is asking, albeit to oneself

1612
01:54:48,343 --> 01:54:49,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Something along the lines of, so?

1613
01:54:50,524 --> 01:54:51,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my point.

1614
01:54:51,245 --> 01:54:57,949
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes things that much easier to donate to a cause if you feel so inclined, but may not necessarily have a PayPal or bank account, etc.

1615
01:54:58,569 --> 01:55:00,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Such is the case with me, but I digress.

1616
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:09,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if Microsoft will be doing a similar setup in the XBL marketplace, but if I were a betting man, the odds are in favor of it.

1617
01:55:10,296 --> 01:55:14,278
[SPEAKER_01]: So in short, if you would like to donate and think you can do without a rock band song, or if not more...

1618
01:55:15,098 --> 01:55:30,043
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're on PSN anyways why not make a donation to the PSN stores whispers besides then you can honestly claim that gaming does actually do some good in the fact that it would just really piss off certain ex-lawyer from Florida XD colon minus P

1619
01:55:31,411 --> 01:55:33,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet he's sitting on a tack going, oh, there's a tack.

1620
01:55:33,792 --> 01:55:34,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn gamers.

1621
01:55:49,157 --> 01:55:49,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn you gamers!

1622
01:55:50,618 --> 01:55:51,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get a cute little theme.

1623
01:55:52,899 --> 01:55:58,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to keep in mind, whenever you make a donation to charity, get a receipt of it.

1624
01:55:58,301 --> 01:56:00,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You can write it off on your taxes.

1625
01:56:00,642 --> 01:56:03,904
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, of course, of tax paying age.

1626
01:56:04,584 --> 01:56:05,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

1627
01:56:06,405 --> 01:56:07,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get kicked back.

1628
01:56:07,706 --> 01:56:08,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.

1629
01:56:09,437 --> 01:56:10,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Also save all your school receipts.

1630
01:56:10,738 --> 01:56:10,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1631
01:56:11,479 --> 01:56:15,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I would close this email with a clever quip or something, but frankly my brain is fried due to lack of sleep.

1632
01:56:16,984 --> 01:56:18,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And the word is lack of sleep.

1633
01:56:19,066 --> 01:56:21,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't think of anything currently, so I'll just say this.

1634
01:56:21,869 --> 01:56:28,195
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to have a PSN account with some spare money on it, please at symbol at least consider donating.

1635
01:56:29,075 --> 01:56:53,051
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just think that because everything else is so flawlessly done and the grammar is so awesome you can see the tiredness coming through I can see the tiredness so and I'm like I do that same crap when I'm tired so I was like okay but some of them made me laugh I like good'em good'em good'em I'm gonna use that word good'em don't know what it means but it's good'em all good'em mm-hmm good'em

1636
01:56:54,326 --> 01:57:10,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Crunchy Crunchy Crunchums There should be a cereal called Goodum Okay, last email No Apparently the last email is from the Tasmanian Devil What?

1637
01:57:10,729 --> 01:57:11,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Dying about fire

1638
01:57:21,624 --> 01:57:22,144
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

1639
01:57:23,005 --> 01:57:24,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm writing about two things.

1640
01:57:24,566 --> 01:57:29,390
[SPEAKER_01]: One, Test Drive Unlimited 2 has finally patched and now does multiplayer events.

1641
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:32,652
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put it down because of the locked out bugs, you can play it again.

1642
01:57:33,513 --> 01:57:37,396
[SPEAKER_01]: They served this up by installing the enticing update named Mandatory 1.

1643
01:57:42,852 --> 01:57:49,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Why has the news lately been talking about how great the iOS devices play games being DS killers or the death of the consoles?

1644
01:57:49,775 --> 01:57:50,735
[SPEAKER_01]: That is total bullshit.

1645
01:57:51,455 --> 01:57:54,617
[SPEAKER_01]: The iOS touchscreen is only better for certain types of games.

1646
01:57:55,017 --> 01:57:58,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo's 3DS is poised to sell like hotcakes and I believe it will.

1647
01:57:58,718 --> 01:58:03,860
[SPEAKER_01]: As for consoles, as long as they are configuration controlled, they will always be popular.

1648
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:09,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I just believe that it's Apple, Apple's fanboys, and Sony that are trying to cast doubt on Nintendo's business.

1649
01:58:11,763 --> 01:58:12,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

1650
01:58:12,584 --> 01:58:12,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1651
01:58:12,844 --> 01:58:20,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've said that on the show before is that the Apple stuff, just the device itself, not all games work on it.

1652
01:58:20,407 --> 01:58:23,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the ports they show being bad ports.

1653
01:58:23,949 --> 01:58:25,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of the original stuff works out okay.

1654
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:27,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that re-rave game we were talking about earlier.

1655
01:58:27,411 --> 01:58:29,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that was designed for a touchscreen.

1656
01:58:29,411 --> 01:58:29,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.

1657
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:31,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works pretty good.

1658
01:58:31,733 --> 01:58:32,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1659
01:58:32,153 --> 01:58:32,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good-em.

1660
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1661
01:58:34,414 --> 01:58:34,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty well.

1662
01:58:35,714 --> 01:58:36,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other emails tonight?

1663
01:58:36,835 --> 01:58:37,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty well.

1664
01:58:37,415 --> 01:58:37,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Well-em.

1665
01:58:38,496 --> 01:58:38,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-em.

1666
01:58:40,437 --> 01:58:40,977
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's it, Rob.

1667
01:58:41,522 --> 01:58:48,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email to possibly maybe read on next week's show.

1668
01:58:49,065 --> 01:58:49,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1669
01:58:50,326 --> 01:58:54,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, some angst in the segment we call FUs of the Week.

1670
01:58:56,388 --> 01:58:56,548
Um...

1671
01:59:13,567 --> 01:59:16,329
[SPEAKER_01]: FU, this is sort of an FU, to jury duty.

1672
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:23,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know it's my civic duty, and actually I kind of want to be on a case, but right now, I don't have to go in tomorrow, so I'm very happy.

1673
01:59:25,015 --> 01:59:27,877
[SPEAKER_05]: You should reschedule yours for May 9th, because that's the night you find.

1674
01:59:28,557 --> 01:59:28,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1675
01:59:30,118 --> 01:59:34,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually am going to have to reschedule mine for after school, because I can't have anything...

1676
01:59:34,954 --> 01:59:35,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my FU.

1677
01:59:36,195 --> 01:59:41,019
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to the damn light cycle that I'm having to model in Maya.

1678
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten the tail of it done, finally.

1679
01:59:45,663 --> 01:59:47,564
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm having a hell of a time with the curve.

1680
01:59:49,726 --> 01:59:52,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get Maya installed on my computer, so it's pissing me off.

1681
01:59:53,929 --> 01:59:58,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really feel like going to hang out at the Mac Lab all day using the Mac Lab to try to get it to work.

1682
01:59:59,693 --> 02:00:01,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So Maya can bite my butt.

1683
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:07,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to not get an A in this class.

1684
02:00:08,772 --> 02:00:09,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of don't care.

1685
02:00:09,793 --> 02:00:10,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to pass it.

1686
02:00:11,555 --> 02:00:13,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Because guess who's graduating this semester?

1687
02:00:13,997 --> 02:00:14,837
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be me!

1688
02:00:15,858 --> 02:00:17,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm done.

1689
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:20,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just reminded of a scene from Strangers with Candy.

1690
02:00:20,982 --> 02:00:21,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a D!

1691
02:00:24,125 --> 02:00:24,585
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1692
02:00:24,785 --> 02:00:25,046
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1693
02:00:26,187 --> 02:00:27,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not gotten a D at all.

1694
02:00:29,549 --> 02:00:30,210
[SPEAKER_05]: What about an F?

1695
02:00:31,334 --> 02:00:35,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I got an F is because I dropped the class and they didn't register me on the books that I dropped it.

1696
02:00:35,897 --> 02:00:37,318
[SPEAKER_05]: F for fantastic work.

1697
02:00:38,979 --> 02:00:39,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

1698
02:00:39,579 --> 02:00:43,781
[SPEAKER_01]: F for fuck this place!

1699
02:00:44,542 --> 02:00:54,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say probably F you to colds and having my son have a cold because he's really cranky.

1700
02:00:55,348 --> 02:01:02,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you did tape gun and attacked my finger earlier this week, I now have multiple cuts on my finger.

1701
02:01:02,331 --> 02:01:03,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it jump up and bite you?

1702
02:01:04,391 --> 02:01:05,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

1703
02:01:05,312 --> 02:01:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks painful, my god.

1704
02:01:08,513 --> 02:01:10,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that painful, but yeah, there's like five.

1705
02:01:11,234 --> 02:01:19,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine if you cut yourself with, not necessarily a piece of paper, but maybe like a knife, just like a small cut.

1706
02:01:20,157 --> 02:01:26,880
[SPEAKER_04]: but five of those really close together that's basically the tape gun for you and it did that in two fingers.

1707
02:01:27,981 --> 02:01:30,282
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurt for a little bit but no more than a paper cut.

1708
02:01:30,902 --> 02:01:32,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It bled really bad though.

1709
02:01:32,143 --> 02:01:33,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

1710
02:01:35,265 --> 02:01:36,766
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1711
02:01:36,846 --> 02:01:41,628
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU goes to Loki for bringing up my ex on the program on live internet radio.

1712
02:01:41,668 --> 02:01:42,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Loki.

1713
02:01:42,848 --> 02:01:49,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, but really though, my FU goes to tacos because they are amazing and addicting and I really want one right now.

1714
02:01:50,432 --> 02:01:52,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, just a taco sounds great.

1715
02:01:52,713 --> 02:01:53,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1716
02:01:54,252 --> 02:01:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Rob?

1717
02:01:55,013 --> 02:01:55,173
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1718
02:01:55,313 --> 02:01:56,233
[SPEAKER_01]: We had pesto chicken.

1719
02:01:56,253 --> 02:01:56,794
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have some.

1720
02:01:57,214 --> 02:01:57,614
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right.

1721
02:01:58,075 --> 02:02:00,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm craving the really fatty Jim Boy's ground beef tacos.

1722
02:02:00,756 --> 02:02:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: With Parmesan cheese on the crust.

1723
02:02:03,598 --> 02:02:03,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.

1724
02:02:04,759 --> 02:02:05,039
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1725
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on with some more news.

1726
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1727
02:02:10,283 --> 02:02:10,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But not yet.

1728
02:02:10,903 --> 02:02:12,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some more news stories real quick.

1729
02:02:12,804 --> 02:02:13,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1730
02:02:13,425 --> 02:02:13,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1731
02:02:14,225 --> 02:02:18,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I don't know, this is kind of interesting.

1732
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:24,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this kind of ties in with announcements of announcements.

1733
02:02:24,813 --> 02:02:32,558
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a rumor right now that there's, I guess, a Hitman ARG that's going on right now.

1734
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That's leading up to the announcement of a new Hitman game at E3.

1735
02:02:36,841 --> 02:02:39,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That series is still around?

1736
02:02:39,563 --> 02:02:39,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1737
02:02:40,183 --> 02:02:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's apparently still around.

1738
02:02:44,144 --> 02:02:52,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's... Right now, they're saying that... I'm trying to see where it's coming from.

1739
02:02:52,986 --> 02:03:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It started with an ad from Faircount Media Group in a catalog at Sundance Film Festival depicting a box of the Hitman series brand donuts with a barcode ending in 47.

1740
02:03:06,889 --> 02:03:17,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it says, I guess, when a Hitman forum user tracked down the agency responsible for the ad and emailed them, he received a response from an account saying, you're on the right track.

1741
02:03:17,739 --> 02:03:28,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they gave him a new image showing a pair of black gloves that appears to be GameScript and another barcode ending in 47 and some other random numbers and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1742
02:03:28,808 --> 02:03:29,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1743
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it's a stupid ARG leading up to the announcement of Hitman.

1744
02:03:33,172 --> 02:03:33,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, great.

1745
02:03:35,453 --> 02:03:37,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll just have to wait until E3.

1746
02:03:38,515 --> 02:03:39,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, surprise.

1747
02:03:39,955 --> 02:03:41,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I love announcements about announcements.

1748
02:03:42,217 --> 02:03:43,717
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite thing in the gaming industry.

1749
02:03:44,538 --> 02:03:50,441
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't... In seven days, we will be announcing an announcement about a game coming out in 14 months.

1750
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:55,083
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't make it so damn obvious what it's going to be.

1751
02:03:55,483 --> 02:03:59,205
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to, like, you know, make it completely weird and off the wall.

1752
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:04,368
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, people are like, oh... There will be a trailer announcing this announcement.

1753
02:04:08,257 --> 02:04:12,180
[SPEAKER_05]: One other quick story for you guys that has to do with the game Doodle Jump.

1754
02:04:12,240 --> 02:04:13,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever heard of Doodle Jump?

1755
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan plays Doodle Jump all the time.

1756
02:04:15,422 --> 02:04:21,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard of this game, but apparently it sold 10 million copies between iPhone and Android.

1757
02:04:21,706 --> 02:04:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: What is Doodle Jump then, DarkSakura?

1758
02:04:23,407 --> 02:04:26,368
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that little dude on the picture.

1759
02:04:27,089 --> 02:04:32,052
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you just turn it and he jumps from platform to platform and you just have to keep him going forward.

1760
02:04:32,212 --> 02:04:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you don't actually doodle in the game.

1761
02:04:33,773 --> 02:04:34,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

1762
02:04:34,574 --> 02:04:34,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1763
02:04:35,194 --> 02:04:35,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it.

1764
02:04:35,854 --> 02:04:36,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just seen Dan play it.

1765
02:04:36,755 --> 02:04:38,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they've sold 10 million copies.

1766
02:04:39,136 --> 02:04:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can make your own characters by doodling.

1767
02:04:41,957 --> 02:04:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And funny enough, this is the perfect kind of last story for tonight to kind of go with that story that came up earlier about how Zynga's like, we don't want to do our game on Xbox because Xbox is too small.

1768
02:04:52,562 --> 02:04:53,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what's the announcement?

1769
02:04:54,022 --> 02:04:56,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, Doodle Jump is going to be coming out for Xbox 360.

1770
02:04:59,845 --> 02:05:08,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Lima Sky, who is the creative person behind the game Doodle Jump, said that they reached 10 million of their milestone.

1771
02:05:08,370 --> 02:05:15,214
[SPEAKER_05]: They've also said that they are going to be bringing the game to Xbox Live Arcade and the Kinect controller from Microsoft.

1772
02:05:15,774 --> 02:05:19,016
[SPEAKER_05]: They also want to release a multiplayer update to the iPhone version.

1773
02:05:19,336 --> 02:05:23,079
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to do an iPad version and, of course, merchandise!

1774
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:25,180
[SPEAKER_05]: T-shirts, stickers, buttons, yay!

1775
02:05:26,738 --> 02:05:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

1776
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:36,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So, even though some people want to hate on Xbox 360 because it's too small, some people think it might be a good place for their game.

1777
02:05:37,226 --> 02:05:39,108
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the doodle jump people think so.

1778
02:05:40,168 --> 02:05:41,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's it for the news tonight.

1779
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:43,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the Skype line.

1780
02:05:43,151 --> 02:05:44,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open up the phone lines right now.

1781
02:05:44,892 --> 02:05:49,776
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.

1782
02:05:50,196 --> 02:05:53,739
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, while we wait for some calls, maybe Loki has a last minute story or five.

1783
02:05:54,763 --> 02:05:59,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually I do, and let's see, this was kind of cool, I saw this earlier today.

1784
02:06:01,248 --> 02:06:05,872
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk a lot about Kinect hacks and stuff like that, but this one's a little different.

1785
02:06:06,232 --> 02:06:07,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Kinect hack working on a PS3.

1786
02:06:09,094 --> 02:06:13,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically it's somebody using the Kinect to play Killzone 3.

1787
02:06:15,179 --> 02:06:16,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's...

1788
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1789
02:06:47,047 --> 02:06:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: This is DJ Blaziken.

1790
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:50,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

1791
02:06:52,932 --> 02:06:59,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was last week or something, Parasite Eve came out for PlayStation Network and I finally picked it up.

1792
02:06:59,918 --> 02:07:01,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it was actually pretty darn well...

1793
02:07:11,454 --> 02:07:30,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks a little bit awkward and really blocky on my 20 inch HDTV and 1080p but looks really good though on the PSP Go and this is a little thing for all the listeners who might have the PSP Go that probably didn't know this or ever figured it out.

1794
02:07:30,467 --> 02:07:40,193
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually sync your PlayStation 3 controller to it via the Bluetooth and makes it a little bit easier to play if

1795
02:07:42,483 --> 02:07:50,025
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're at a desk or something and you just don't like the whole control scheme of that, but, oh my god.

1796
02:07:51,645 --> 02:07:57,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for years I just saw the trailer, and that blew my mind.

1797
02:07:58,947 --> 02:08:08,369
[SPEAKER_10]: It still blows my mind now, looking at the visuals, even though now we're in the HD age, I mean, it still just goes to show, you know, Square...

1798
02:08:09,901 --> 02:08:14,682
[SPEAKER_10]: with a lot of effort into just maxing out the potential of whatever system they're working on.

1799
02:08:14,762 --> 02:08:18,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything from the original NES to now.

1800
02:08:19,023 --> 02:08:20,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've seen it.

1801
02:08:21,163 --> 02:08:21,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's maxed.

1802
02:08:21,924 --> 02:08:25,744
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Parasite Eve, they did make a second game, but they never really made a third.

1803
02:08:26,265 --> 02:08:29,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know there's third birthday, but that was years later, obviously.

1804
02:08:31,566 --> 02:08:34,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's best that some games don't get sequels?

1805
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:37,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you think that really good games deserve sequels?

1806
02:08:38,732 --> 02:08:48,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I think really good games, especially like this, I don't know how much notoriety it got, but it seems like a game for potential of sequels.

1807
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:55,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it being a pretty big deal back in the day because it was one of the first Square games to come out after Final Fantasy VII from what I remember.

1808
02:08:56,626 --> 02:09:00,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, my memory's a little fuzzy because I'm really fucking old, but it's something like that.

1809
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:05,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I saw one of those PlayStation Magazine demo discs

1810
02:09:06,742 --> 02:09:35,366
[SPEAKER_10]: and oh my god even though at the time my mom wouldn't let me play very damn games back then too I just didn't have the cash to get it so and now that I'm of age and have the cash I was just like heck I'll get this that's right I'm mature now I'm gonna play all the mature rated games I want and do you know what it's I don't know what I gotta praise Square cause

1811
02:09:35,816 --> 02:10:04,048
[SPEAKER_10]: they have probably the best I mean I may sound like a little bit of a square fanboy but who hasn't been ever they always just seem to come out with games with a really great story arc that connects you with the characters and makes you feel like an emotional attachment to them almost and it's just like whoa I will admit

1812
02:10:06,378 --> 02:10:34,032
[SPEAKER_10]: if this has ever happened to any of you guys that a game ending ever made you cry it would have had to have been the first Kingdom Hearts ending when Kairi and Sora split apart on two different lands OMG spoilers I could never beat Kingdom Hearts it was hard it was hard but worth the grind yeah, yeah, that's true if you reach the ending it was a pretty sad ending

1813
02:10:35,082 --> 02:10:36,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It just brought tears to my eyes.

1814
02:10:36,443 --> 02:10:37,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, no!

1815
02:10:37,843 --> 02:10:39,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Come back!

1816
02:10:40,404 --> 02:10:42,465
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay, try to keep your emotions in check on the show, buddy.

1817
02:10:42,825 --> 02:10:45,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you played through Parasite Eve yet?

1818
02:10:47,287 --> 02:10:54,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten up to probably the first boss battle so far, and I'm just getting my ass hated to me.

1819
02:10:54,770 --> 02:11:01,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to look at walks through and possible online strategy guides to figure out

1820
02:11:02,276 --> 02:11:08,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What the good news is with those older games, there's a ton of them out there, so that's a good thing.

1821
02:11:08,358 --> 02:11:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I have them all.

1822
02:11:08,998 --> 02:11:09,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1823
02:11:09,219 --> 02:11:09,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1824
02:11:30,697 --> 02:11:45,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, what would you think, because with the PlayStation Move controllers being so in the way of Wii remotes, if with the jailbroken PS3, someone comes out with a Wii emulator that does HD support for the PS3 with Wii games?

1825
02:11:46,492 --> 02:11:52,796
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be difficult because, remember, emulators take a lot more horsepower to run than the actual consoles themselves.

1826
02:11:53,256 --> 02:12:03,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So even right now, running a Nintendo 64 emulator on a PS3, while possible, that's pretty much maxing out the resources right now.

1827
02:12:03,582 --> 02:12:12,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the PlayStation 3 has to emulate the fucking PS2 first, and I'm not talking about the old-school first-generation consoles because they had the extra chip, which is why they were so expensive, but...

1828
02:12:13,368 --> 02:12:23,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it very odd that we still have seen nothing about PlayStation 2 emulation on PlayStation 3 outside of that very, very first generation of consoles.

1829
02:12:24,391 --> 02:12:35,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and someone, I don't know where, this is from the end, you know, quote me here, but I heard rumors that somewhere like the most recent firmware update was supposed to add it.

1830
02:12:36,313 --> 02:12:37,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that.

1831
02:12:37,594 --> 02:12:42,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to try to see if one of my friends can bring down like a Tarko or something on DDR Max.

1832
02:12:43,618 --> 02:12:45,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that old.

1833
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:54,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it does boot up, then maybe it wasn't a firmware patch that we just never really figured.

1834
02:12:54,683 --> 02:12:59,665
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you would have trumpets and fanfare and confetti everywhere if that were to happen.

1835
02:12:59,705 --> 02:13:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I wouldn't expect it to be as easy as putting your discs in.

1836
02:13:03,386 --> 02:13:06,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those sick bastards will make you pay for the games all over again.

1837
02:13:07,808 --> 02:13:08,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can hope not.

1838
02:13:08,889 --> 02:13:09,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure hope not.

1839
02:13:10,327 --> 02:13:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I might just get a PlayStation 2 again if it doesn't work.

1840
02:13:15,508 --> 02:13:26,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so I can have Beatmania, just most of the B-Money titles, really, because, I mean, I have the Rockman keyboard, and it's making me miss Keyboard Mania, because that was at my arcade.

1841
02:13:26,910 --> 02:13:30,130
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta have it for a rainy day.

1842
02:13:31,111 --> 02:13:31,911
[SPEAKER_10]: They got rid of it.

1843
02:13:31,931 --> 02:13:32,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

1844
02:13:32,731 --> 02:13:35,011
[SPEAKER_10]: That along with Poppin' Music, they used to have that.

1845
02:13:36,071 --> 02:13:39,172
[SPEAKER_10]: They had just all the B-Money games here at Family Fun Center, but

1846
02:13:40,049 --> 02:14:03,477
[SPEAKER_10]: they've traded them all in for random stuff and only once we have left the linked Parapara rest in peace the arcades I remember alright Blaziken I gotta let you go so we can get more calls arcade infinity RIP that was just sad watching the video alright we're gonna go pour a 40 right now alright Blaziken I gotta let you go to get more calls have a good one buddy alright peace out bye

1847
02:14:06,976 --> 02:14:12,280
[SPEAKER_05]: 1877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Anything else, Loki, while we're waiting for another call?

1848
02:14:14,682 --> 02:14:34,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have too much I was going to talk, there was some other developments with the whole PlayStation hacking stuff and the whole court case, everything I believe they, was it the judge okayed Sony to get the basically people that have

1849
02:14:36,296 --> 02:14:51,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Donated money from California Into the Geohot thing They've gotten access to those records And then also they're trying to find A software development kit manual

1850
02:14:52,362 --> 02:15:20,925
[SPEAKER_04]: on his computer because in the manual it has like if you need help supporting you're in the US territories call this number because he's basically saying that he was unaware that Sony was in California or something like that and they're trying to find a way to link it to him that he knew that they're in California to which I say who the fuck reads a manual for something like that and I don't think it's actually on his system I think he used open open source stuff to create his hacks so

1851
02:15:22,066 --> 02:15:24,309
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be a stretch.

1852
02:15:24,670 --> 02:15:27,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems like they're really trying to grab at straws here.

1853
02:15:27,694 --> 02:15:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we got another call coming in, so let's go to it.

1854
02:15:29,416 --> 02:15:30,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1855
02:15:30,398 --> 02:15:30,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1856
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:32,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, how's it going?

1857
02:15:32,321 --> 02:15:33,482
[SPEAKER_04]: This is SSJ100 Matt.

1858
02:15:33,662 --> 02:15:34,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt.

1859
02:15:34,484 --> 02:15:35,585
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on, buddy?

1860
02:15:36,567 --> 02:15:37,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hello.

1861
02:15:38,342 --> 02:15:38,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Doing good.

1862
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:42,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to call and get my late PAX East report.

1863
02:15:42,284 --> 02:15:43,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You're late.

1864
02:15:43,265 --> 02:15:45,526
[SPEAKER_05]: PAX East was so last week.

1865
02:15:45,886 --> 02:15:47,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you calling in to talk about PAX East 2012?

1866
02:15:47,727 --> 02:15:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet time, that's like 100 years.

1867
02:15:50,168 --> 02:15:50,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1868
02:15:50,428 --> 02:15:50,869
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

1869
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:51,189
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

1870
02:15:51,789 --> 02:15:54,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, you're probably on the way home or something, so we'll give it a bye.

1871
02:15:54,811 --> 02:15:55,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a good time?

1872
02:15:56,632 --> 02:15:57,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I definitely had a good time.

1873
02:15:57,592 --> 02:15:57,872
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1874
02:15:57,932 --> 02:16:00,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it a lot more than last year.

1875
02:16:00,994 --> 02:16:02,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course, because I wasn't there.

1876
02:16:03,555 --> 02:16:04,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well.

1877
02:16:05,096 --> 02:16:06,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, don't agree with that, asshole.

1878
02:16:08,365 --> 02:16:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1879
02:16:09,986 --> 02:16:11,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was better about it than last year?

1880
02:16:11,547 --> 02:16:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1881
02:16:13,148 --> 02:16:16,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the bigger conventions that really made a difference.

1882
02:16:17,751 --> 02:16:21,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot more people were able to work with the larger space.

1883
02:16:22,795 --> 02:16:24,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Tabletop gaming was big.

1884
02:16:26,897 --> 02:16:31,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the spacing of the booths were good.

1885
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:33,062
[SPEAKER_09]: People weren't hidden behind other booths.

1886
02:16:34,242 --> 02:16:35,643
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're able to see everyone's

1887
02:16:37,375 --> 02:16:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone got plenty of traffic, I think.

1888
02:16:39,096 --> 02:16:45,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a lot more newer stuff there, I guess.

1889
02:16:46,058 --> 02:16:47,479
[SPEAKER_09]: They got to play on the 3DS.

1890
02:16:47,499 --> 02:16:50,300
[SPEAKER_09]: They got to play Duke Nukem Forever.

1891
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:56,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And one game that I really liked, Child of Eden.

1892
02:16:56,943 --> 02:16:57,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1893
02:16:57,903 --> 02:17:00,504
[SPEAKER_05]: The spiritual successor of sorts to Rez, sure.

1894
02:17:01,744 --> 02:17:02,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you know what?

1895
02:17:02,525 --> 02:17:02,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think...

1896
02:17:03,590 --> 02:17:04,790
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys will certainly enjoy it.

1897
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually considering a Kinect because of that game.

1898
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it work?

1899
02:17:09,272 --> 02:17:12,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really like res but you use your hands to kind of highlight things?

1900
02:17:12,993 --> 02:17:14,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that kind of what the deal is?

1901
02:17:14,954 --> 02:17:15,854
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much that way.

1902
02:17:15,954 --> 02:17:20,036
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, it's weird because there's two different ways of shooting.

1903
02:17:20,056 --> 02:17:25,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You use your left hand to shoot, you know, to highlight over and then, you know, push forward to shoot, you know, the missiles.

1904
02:17:26,658 --> 02:17:29,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can use your right hand to shoot like the gun regularly.

1905
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:31,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1906
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:33,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So you switch off

1907
02:17:33,969 --> 02:17:35,771
[SPEAKER_09]: during the gameplay, which is really interesting.

1908
02:17:36,612 --> 02:17:41,156
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really interesting that it's able to capture that with limited problems.

1909
02:17:41,396 --> 02:17:49,404
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I really liked at PAX East was the classic arcade room.

1910
02:17:51,045 --> 02:17:52,126
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a lot more stuff.

1911
02:17:52,466 --> 02:17:58,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you remember last year it was kind of set up like Flynn's Arcade, where you had Journey music playing and

1912
02:18:01,584 --> 02:18:13,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, last year I remember it was just a room full of consoles and you could kind of check out whatever game you wanted to play and do it all that way, but they kind of kicked it up a notch this year with the bigger space?

1913
02:18:14,390 --> 02:18:19,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, but I'm talking about the arcade room where they had the arcade machines all set up.

1914
02:18:19,832 --> 02:18:22,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the one that was next door to the console room.

1915
02:18:22,253 --> 02:18:23,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, I remember.

1916
02:18:23,133 --> 02:18:24,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1917
02:18:26,165 --> 02:18:29,887
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a lot more, I think they doubled the amount of arcade games there.

1918
02:18:30,107 --> 02:18:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.

1919
02:18:30,647 --> 02:18:35,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And they also had a couple of guys from Twin Galaxies trying to beat High Score of Life.

1920
02:18:36,149 --> 02:18:36,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1921
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:37,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

1922
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:39,731
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one of my favorite spots at PAX East.

1923
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:41,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1924
02:18:41,732 --> 02:18:43,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was really interesting.

1925
02:18:44,593 --> 02:18:46,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of fun there.

1926
02:18:46,033 --> 02:18:50,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, it was kind of disappointing because not too many people went up there to play stuff.

1927
02:18:50,155 --> 02:18:51,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone was downstairs on the expo floor.

1928
02:18:52,864 --> 02:18:56,006
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I was able to play all the arcade games I wanted to.

1929
02:18:56,266 --> 02:18:56,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1930
02:18:58,807 --> 02:18:59,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1931
02:18:59,868 --> 02:19:02,289
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you hope that they bring next year to PAX?

1932
02:19:02,329 --> 02:19:04,671
[SPEAKER_05]: What's an improvement they need to make for next year's PAX?

1933
02:19:08,773 --> 02:19:19,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, that as much as it was a great plan, the panels themselves weren't... I didn't really find to enjoy.

1934
02:19:19,879 --> 02:19:21,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the thing was, most of the panels...

1935
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:23,298
[SPEAKER_09]: or by networking.

1936
02:19:23,938 --> 02:19:25,919
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of stuff you kind of see at GDC.

1937
02:19:26,719 --> 02:19:29,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not really into getting into the business.

1938
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:30,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm just, you know, a gamer.

1939
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:31,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't play.

1940
02:19:32,581 --> 02:19:33,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't make games.

1941
02:19:33,941 --> 02:19:35,561
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, they had a lot of panels like that.

1942
02:19:35,601 --> 02:19:37,662
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a great idea and I think they should keep that.

1943
02:19:37,682 --> 02:19:46,884
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, there was, you know, very limited stuff about games, you know, gaming itself, I guess.

1944
02:19:46,944 --> 02:19:49,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they need to diversify the panel lineup a little bit more.

1945
02:19:50,777 --> 02:19:51,738
[SPEAKER_05]: or maybe have more rooms.

1946
02:19:51,958 --> 02:19:57,061
[SPEAKER_09]: There was only one panel they went to and that was the Xbox Live Enforcement.

1947
02:19:57,841 --> 02:19:59,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I saw a clip of that one online.

1948
02:19:59,502 --> 02:20:00,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That looked kind of interesting actually.

1949
02:20:01,223 --> 02:20:04,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Where they were showing how they could ban people.

1950
02:20:04,725 --> 02:20:09,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically just run through giant columns of names and highlight all the colors.

1951
02:20:09,567 --> 02:20:10,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It was interesting.

1952
02:20:10,628 --> 02:20:11,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1953
02:20:11,669 --> 02:20:12,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of neat.

1954
02:20:12,869 --> 02:20:19,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well I am hoping I can go out to PAX East next year but it's a plane ticket so the cost of gas has to come down but we'll see.

1955
02:20:21,141 --> 02:20:22,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's in April next year.

1956
02:20:22,883 --> 02:20:24,044
[SPEAKER_09]: During Passover, in a way.

1957
02:20:24,545 --> 02:20:25,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

1958
02:20:25,806 --> 02:20:26,206
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.

1959
02:20:26,326 --> 02:20:26,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Get this.

1960
02:20:27,588 --> 02:20:29,049
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts on my birthday this year.

1961
02:20:29,630 --> 02:20:30,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it really?

1962
02:20:30,931 --> 02:20:31,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1963
02:20:31,412 --> 02:20:31,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1964
02:20:31,872 --> 02:20:32,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.

1965
02:20:32,313 --> 02:20:32,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Passover.

1966
02:20:33,193 --> 02:20:36,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to say, it would be funny if PAX East was around the same time next year.

1967
02:20:36,617 --> 02:20:37,117
[SPEAKER_01]: No cake.

1968
02:20:37,778 --> 02:20:39,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll eat cake on the day before.

1969
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:41,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Space it out a little more.

1970
02:20:41,021 --> 02:20:42,283
[SPEAKER_05]: You should come to PAX East.

1971
02:20:44,130 --> 02:20:44,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1972
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:50,634
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could afford it or if a bunch of people wanted to get together and put the money together and send me a plane ticket.

1973
02:20:50,895 --> 02:20:55,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Japan disaster relief is kind of important right now.

1974
02:20:55,878 --> 02:21:03,483
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm saying if you got 10 people to put 20 bucks together, that's half a plane ticket.

1975
02:21:03,523 --> 02:21:04,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just wasted $20.

1976
02:21:04,544 --> 02:21:06,705
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

1977
02:21:07,986 --> 02:21:13,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully things will get better next year financially and economically and we can evaluate that for next year.

1978
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy, guys.

1979
02:21:38,091 --> 02:21:42,815
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio while we wait for some more calls.

1980
02:21:42,975 --> 02:21:43,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, anything else?

1981
02:21:45,758 --> 02:21:50,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Um... Not really.

1982
02:21:50,321 --> 02:21:50,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1983
02:21:50,722 --> 02:21:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if we talked too much about Angry Birds and how much they've sold.

1984
02:21:56,566 --> 02:21:59,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking tweet!

1985
02:22:00,209 --> 02:22:02,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand the Angry Birds obsession.

1986
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:02,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.

1987
02:22:03,011 --> 02:22:04,513
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's alright.

1988
02:22:04,833 --> 02:22:05,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

1989
02:22:05,573 --> 02:22:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it's...

1990
02:22:07,745 --> 02:22:09,006
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more fun games out there.

1991
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:12,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really the price point that sold so many copies of that.

1992
02:22:13,231 --> 02:22:15,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand the whole movie franchising thing.

1993
02:22:15,313 --> 02:22:19,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand the whole obsession with it.

1994
02:22:19,817 --> 02:22:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: People are dumb.

1995
02:22:21,059 --> 02:22:31,510
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've really come to understand is this whole new casual gaming market out there, your moms and other relatives or whatever, they're playing these casual games.

1996
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:33,872
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're hardcore now, according to Zynga.

1997
02:22:33,892 --> 02:22:34,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1998
02:22:34,413 --> 02:22:35,674
[SPEAKER_04]: They're hardcore, according to Zynga.

1999
02:22:35,714 --> 02:22:36,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga, you're stupid.

2000
02:22:38,057 --> 02:22:39,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not hardcore, and I'm sorry.

2001
02:22:40,019 --> 02:22:40,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're kind of...

2002
02:22:42,298 --> 02:22:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not dumb necessarily, but their expectations are a lot lower compared to everybody else.

2003
02:22:47,882 --> 02:22:48,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2004
02:22:49,424 --> 02:22:49,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2005
02:23:06,528 --> 02:23:09,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally, totally, totally want to go to that.

2006
02:23:09,269 --> 02:23:11,350
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't know if there'd be enough for me there.

2007
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:15,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would go to hang with people and that would really be it for me.

2008
02:23:16,492 --> 02:23:20,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like when I went to that anime con in Chicago, the ASEN con that I did a little panel at.

2009
02:23:20,914 --> 02:23:21,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to ASEN too.

2010
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:29,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time hanging with people, but the con itself was just We need to see about getting in for fanime.

2011
02:23:29,677 --> 02:23:30,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we need to talk to our people.

2012
02:23:31,478 --> 02:23:31,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2013
02:23:31,638 --> 02:23:33,138
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we got another call coming in.

2014
02:23:33,158 --> 02:23:33,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take it.

2015
02:23:33,959 --> 02:23:34,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

2016
02:23:34,779 --> 02:23:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2017
02:23:36,608 --> 02:23:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, this is Spazineater.

2018
02:23:37,888 --> 02:23:39,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey buddy, how you doing, Spazineater?

2019
02:23:39,969 --> 02:23:40,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, pretty good, you?

2020
02:23:42,310 --> 02:23:45,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Two quick items.

2021
02:23:45,851 --> 02:23:48,072
[SPEAKER_08]: One question and one comment.

2022
02:23:48,092 --> 02:23:52,253
[SPEAKER_08]: The comment first, sorry about the typos and all that in my email.

2023
02:23:52,373 --> 02:23:53,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving a hard time.

2024
02:23:53,873 --> 02:23:55,494
[SPEAKER_08]: She just gives everybody shit, don't worry about it.

2025
02:23:55,514 --> 02:23:57,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I give people I like a hard time.

2026
02:23:57,435 --> 02:23:58,895
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called love.

2027
02:24:00,395 --> 02:24:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

2028
02:24:03,233 --> 02:24:09,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Now as far as my question, now seeing that Microsoft is basically doing away with the zone,

2029
02:24:11,499 --> 02:24:17,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they going to ax the video marketplace as well on Xbox Live?

2030
02:24:17,802 --> 02:24:18,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2031
02:24:18,702 --> 02:24:20,803
[SPEAKER_05]: That was around before the Zoom.

2032
02:24:20,863 --> 02:24:21,904
[SPEAKER_05]: When did the Zoom come out?

2033
02:24:21,944 --> 02:24:26,786
[SPEAKER_05]: The Zoom came out about a year after Xbox was out and I seem to recall that video marketplace was going pretty early.

2034
02:24:27,226 --> 02:24:28,006
[SPEAKER_05]: So, no.

2035
02:24:28,106 --> 02:24:30,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if they can still sell movies on there, they're going to do it.

2036
02:24:31,808 --> 02:24:37,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the Zoom's going away, don't forget they still have the Windows mobile phones and I think that's really kind of where they're focusing.

2037
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:38,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about it.

2038
02:24:39,031 --> 02:24:39,811
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the

2039
02:24:40,231 --> 02:24:44,997
[SPEAKER_05]: The marketplace for the iOS is centered around the iPhone.

2040
02:24:45,378 --> 02:24:49,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, you have your iPads and you have your iPod Touches still.

2041
02:24:50,287 --> 02:25:08,034
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the iPhone claims a pretty fair share of that market So I think the Zune fading out is more Microsoft kind of aligning itself Instead of doing a Zune phone, now they have this Windows 7 phone or whatever it is So no, you're not going to see the movie stuff go away Especially, God, how could you?

2042
02:25:08,094 --> 02:25:17,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with Netflix, Hulu they've announced for the end of the year And all this other stuff Yeah, it's only going to be more

2043
02:25:19,499 --> 02:25:30,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was just kind of curious because now that I got a computer and I use Zune Marketplace on my computer, I'm just going to use a whole lot more now.

2044
02:25:31,425 --> 02:25:37,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll probably see it get rebranded as like, you know, the Windows Mobile or Windows.

2045
02:25:37,408 --> 02:25:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll get rebranded.

2046
02:25:38,428 --> 02:25:42,710
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably walk away from that Zune name, but it'll still be there.

2047
02:25:44,036 --> 02:25:44,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, alright.

2048
02:25:44,777 --> 02:25:46,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for taking my call.

2049
02:25:46,479 --> 02:25:47,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely appreciate it.

2050
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:48,581
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem, buddy.

2051
02:25:48,601 --> 02:25:49,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a good one.

2052
02:25:50,163 --> 02:25:51,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you have a good one.

2053
02:25:51,144 --> 02:25:51,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2054
02:25:52,586 --> 02:25:54,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was a neat call because he said, hey, I got a question.

2055
02:25:54,969 --> 02:25:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: We answered it.

2056
02:25:55,449 --> 02:25:57,291
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, okay, bye.

2057
02:25:58,012 --> 02:25:58,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

2058
02:25:58,753 --> 02:26:01,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so since that call was so fast, we'll go ahead and do one more call.

2059
02:26:01,576 --> 02:26:02,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2060
02:26:02,497 --> 02:26:02,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2061
02:26:04,252 --> 02:26:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.

2062
02:26:04,852 --> 02:26:05,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me?

2063
02:26:05,533 --> 02:26:05,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We can.

2064
02:26:06,253 --> 02:26:06,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2065
02:26:07,334 --> 02:26:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, it's DDR Dollar Bill.

2066
02:26:08,775 --> 02:26:09,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, DDR Dollar Bill.

2067
02:26:09,916 --> 02:26:10,336
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

2068
02:26:11,137 --> 02:26:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, doing all right, man.

2069
02:26:13,558 --> 02:26:17,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Just figured I just want to make it quick because I don't want to take too long.

2070
02:26:17,341 --> 02:26:19,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to give my impressions on PAX East.

2071
02:26:19,222 --> 02:26:19,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're late.

2072
02:26:20,243 --> 02:26:20,823
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's all right.

2073
02:26:21,884 --> 02:26:23,865
[SPEAKER_05]: You were driving in the car with Ranma last week, right?

2074
02:26:24,526 --> 02:26:25,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I was.

2075
02:26:25,286 --> 02:26:27,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, you didn't get to talk because you were probably driving.

2076
02:26:27,168 --> 02:26:28,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did you think of PAX East?

2077
02:26:30,636 --> 02:26:32,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed it, heavily.

2078
02:26:34,138 --> 02:26:38,420
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite part was something that not many people really understood.

2079
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:42,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really the games, it wasn't really the panels.

2080
02:26:43,202 --> 02:26:47,004
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the actual fact that I actually got to interview some of the developers.

2081
02:26:48,025 --> 02:26:54,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so just being close and getting to interact with people that are usually behind closed doors at trade shows.

2082
02:26:56,048 --> 02:26:56,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

2083
02:26:56,729 --> 02:26:56,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2084
02:26:58,568 --> 02:27:00,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are some of the developers you got to talk to?

2085
02:27:01,310 --> 02:27:23,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to talk to one guy from Microsoft who was developing the upcoming Fire Pro Wrestling release on Xbox Live Arcade I was really interested because Fire Pro Wrestling I don't know how many people know this but it's like a really old school wrestling game that was hailed heavily because I've actually got a couple of Fire Pro Wrestling games

2086
02:27:25,444 --> 02:27:26,204
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

2087
02:27:26,244 --> 02:27:29,325
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Dreamcast one that had the Virtua Fighter characters in it.

2088
02:27:30,865 --> 02:27:34,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you mean the All Japan featuring Virtua?

2089
02:27:34,546 --> 02:27:36,866
[SPEAKER_01]: That had a wolf in it, yeah.

2090
02:27:37,767 --> 02:27:39,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the Giant Graham series.

2091
02:27:39,387 --> 02:27:42,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I think we've got one of the Fire Pro.

2092
02:27:44,448 --> 02:27:46,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Dreamcast, yeah, D it's called.

2093
02:27:46,708 --> 02:27:46,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2094
02:27:48,249 --> 02:27:51,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this one actually uses your avatars as wrestlers.

2095
02:27:52,630 --> 02:27:53,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's pretty sweet.

2096
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:53,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

2097
02:27:54,810 --> 02:28:00,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and from what I was told, you actually have to develop the moves from the beginning.

2098
02:28:00,991 --> 02:28:06,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start off at level 1, and you basically keep fighting, and the more levels you get, the more moves you get.

2099
02:28:08,593 --> 02:28:17,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And the moves from what I've seen so far, they seem kind of more arcade-ish, not as so much like the current wrestling games like SmackDown vs. Raw and all that.

2100
02:28:18,975 --> 02:28:19,215
[SPEAKER_03]: But,

2101
02:28:20,086 --> 02:28:41,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if it works well, I think it would actually be a nice hit, especially if you use your avatars and whatnot So you liked getting close to the developers, and it's funny because on a previous call, SJ100 Matt was talking about the panels were a little much on the side of how to get into the business Did you find that same thing to be true, or did you kind of like that?

2102
02:28:43,096 --> 02:28:53,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I found that to be the same thing, and to be quite honest, I actually liked it, because it actually showed me a side of gaming I've never really, you know, explored.

2103
02:28:54,309 --> 02:28:59,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the developing side, the, um... You just discovered a whole new side of yourself you never knew was there before.

2104
02:29:02,437 --> 02:29:05,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I could show you how much video I was doing, yeah.

2105
02:29:05,978 --> 02:29:06,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2106
02:29:06,939 --> 02:29:12,080
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember when I went to PAX the first year, PAX Prime, one of the games they were showing was Warhammer, and it was pretty cool.

2107
02:29:12,541 --> 02:29:16,182
[SPEAKER_05]: The Warhammer Online one, the WoW killer that didn't really end up killing WoW.

2108
02:29:16,502 --> 02:29:21,043
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was cool to be able to kind of like, because one of the guys, I was playing the game, he just came up and was talking to me about it.

2109
02:29:21,083 --> 02:29:21,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really cool.

2110
02:29:22,984 --> 02:29:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2111
02:29:49,622 --> 02:29:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I had two more interviews like that.

2112
02:30:10,038 --> 02:30:12,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get the name wrong, but it's called iRacing.

2113
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:17,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a racing simulator type, kind of like Gran Turismo for the PC.

2114
02:30:18,005 --> 02:30:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had to play against real players, not computer AI.

2115
02:30:25,170 --> 02:30:29,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was actually sitting down there with the driving wheel, with the voice feedback and everything.

2116
02:30:30,975 --> 02:30:35,778
[SPEAKER_03]: After about maybe 10 minutes of driving, and I had to stop because I wanted to do other things.

2117
02:30:36,744 --> 02:30:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually felt my body going forward, like the whole inertia.

2118
02:30:41,309 --> 02:30:41,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.

2119
02:30:42,450 --> 02:30:46,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was like, wow.

2120
02:30:46,555 --> 02:30:56,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like slowly walking away like... That sounds like my first time with a 3DS, but... Oh, I had to turn that 3D off.

2121
02:30:56,445 --> 02:30:57,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see.

2122
02:30:57,106 --> 02:30:57,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2123
02:30:58,617 --> 02:31:00,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I was half blind when I tried it.

2124
02:31:01,298 --> 02:31:02,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just too much headache.

2125
02:31:02,259 --> 02:31:04,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so interesting to hear different people's reactions to that.

2126
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:07,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so curious to see what's going to happen when that thing comes out for the public.

2127
02:31:08,921 --> 02:31:09,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2128
02:31:09,581 --> 02:31:11,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Buy already has a demo unit out.

2129
02:31:11,422 --> 02:31:11,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2130
02:31:11,922 --> 02:31:13,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a lot of places are getting the demo units.

2131
02:31:13,563 --> 02:31:15,564
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're pretty easy to get your hands on now.

2132
02:31:15,584 --> 02:31:16,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're out Sunday.

2133
02:31:16,844 --> 02:31:18,985
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not something that's coming out like six months from now.

2134
02:31:19,045 --> 02:31:20,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It's out like soon.

2135
02:31:20,086 --> 02:31:23,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll probably pick it up later.

2136
02:31:23,587 --> 02:31:25,788
[SPEAKER_03]: But one last thing, though, about 3D real quick.

2137
02:31:26,798 --> 02:31:53,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I also saw the Nvidia 3D cards and for some reason 3DS and most 3D TVs I can't really use the 3D because it makes me dizzy but when I was playing when I was trying out Warcraft in 3D on three screens no problems whatsoever I can only imagine what that must be like that must be insane that's too much wow did I really say that?

2138
02:31:53,766 --> 02:31:54,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too much wow.

2139
02:31:55,367 --> 02:31:55,647
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2140
02:31:55,967 --> 02:31:56,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob.

2141
02:31:57,188 --> 02:31:58,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not such a thing.

2142
02:31:58,269 --> 02:31:59,149
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR dollar bill.

2143
02:31:59,669 --> 02:32:01,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth.

2144
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:02,051
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I said it.

2145
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:04,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the same woman that I've hosted this show with for nine years?

2146
02:32:04,632 --> 02:32:06,133
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said it, Rob.

2147
02:32:06,633 --> 02:32:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

2148
02:32:07,153 --> 02:32:08,034
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called irony.

2149
02:32:08,074 --> 02:32:08,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

2150
02:32:10,556 --> 02:32:11,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like the 3D.

2151
02:32:11,557 --> 02:32:13,038
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, I can actually see it.

2152
02:32:13,098 --> 02:32:18,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The first sign of the end of the world coming in 2012 was when DarkSakura admitted to liking Warcraft.

2153
02:32:18,283 --> 02:32:19,304
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like the first sign.

2154
02:32:19,344 --> 02:32:19,564
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2155
02:32:19,944 --> 02:32:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

2156
02:32:20,465 --> 02:32:20,725
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2157
02:32:21,105 --> 02:32:23,107
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Dollar Bill, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2158
02:32:23,127 --> 02:32:24,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks so much for your call, buddy.

2159
02:32:24,408 --> 02:32:25,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And glad to hear you had fun at PAX East.

2160
02:32:27,050 --> 02:32:27,650
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next year.

2161
02:32:27,810 --> 02:32:27,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

2162
02:32:49,958 --> 02:32:56,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was like a 17-hour drive to get to Prosser, so I would imagine tack on another four to that to get to Seattle.

2163
02:32:56,661 --> 02:33:02,343
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because you can get to Portland in 10, and Seattle's another three to four from Portland.

2164
02:33:02,603 --> 02:33:04,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just a straight shot up five.

2165
02:33:04,744 --> 02:33:05,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

2166
02:33:05,384 --> 02:33:07,145
[SPEAKER_05]: To get to where you're going, you have to go through more hilly roads.

2167
02:33:07,165 --> 02:33:08,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We went, I think, the 93.

2168
02:33:08,545 --> 02:33:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you gotta go through weird... No, Seattle's just a straight shot up five.

2169
02:33:13,947 --> 02:33:15,928
[SPEAKER_01]: See, my ride's quite a bit longer.

2170
02:33:16,428 --> 02:33:18,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually didn't go through that part of Oregon.

2171
02:33:18,609 --> 02:33:19,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We stopped in Bend.

2172
02:33:20,629 --> 02:33:22,030
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, DarkSakura?

2173
02:33:22,090 --> 02:33:25,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I already know Loki's not going to come because of the baby, but you and I should rent a van.

2174
02:33:27,532 --> 02:33:28,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing it.

2175
02:33:29,192 --> 02:33:29,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't promise you.

2176
02:33:29,952 --> 02:33:30,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Money, money.

2177
02:33:31,073 --> 02:33:32,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I need money.

2178
02:33:33,153 --> 02:33:34,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll see.

2179
02:33:34,614 --> 02:33:36,094
[SPEAKER_05]: More to develop in the future.

2180
02:33:36,415 --> 02:33:39,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just do one more check with Loki on any last minute stories and then we're going to wrap up the show.

2181
02:33:40,396 --> 02:33:40,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

2182
02:33:42,509 --> 02:33:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want to get out of here and play more Motorstorm.

2183
02:33:45,259 --> 02:34:12,283
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I won't get to play more Motorstorm at home I could I mean it's just you know a TV and stuff alright well we're gonna go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show but first we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts Loki I guess we'll start with you tonight you have a final thought for our listeners I will be playing lots of Motorstorm at work though that's for sure it's such an awesome game and DarkSakura your final thought tonight

2184
02:34:14,899 --> 02:34:18,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Girl Scout cookies and I am going to be wonderful and not eat one.

2185
02:34:20,764 --> 02:34:23,907
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I will happily eat that Girl Scout cookie on your behalf.

2186
02:34:24,788 --> 02:34:26,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I really want is a taco.

2187
02:34:26,429 --> 02:34:27,630
[SPEAKER_05]: A taco Girl Scout cookie.

2188
02:34:31,154 --> 02:34:31,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob.

2189
02:34:31,974 --> 02:34:32,175
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

02:34:33,396 --> 02:34:35,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I need to go on a diet.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

2202
02:34:59,807 --> 02:35:04,268
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, knowing the game industry and how it works, they're getting the largest portion of those systems.

2203
02:35:05,168 --> 02:35:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ordered a bundle off their website.

2208
02:35:14,993 --> 02:35:19,636
