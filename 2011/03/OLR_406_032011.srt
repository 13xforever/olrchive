Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's the host?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dark Sakura

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sky and Loki

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, March 20th, 2011

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Some big games get delayed

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The NES classic River City Ransom will soon have a sequel

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And could a Silent Hill game be on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we are here live with episode number 406

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
On this March the 20th of 2011

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When my awesome co-hosts say hello to the one and only

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I beat your butt at Pinball Effects

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's Pinball Effects on what? PS3?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Xbox

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You were literally showing me this while the opening was going

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So I didn't have time to process this

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Because I just found the picture

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, I'm putting it up on our thing

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh gee, thank you

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, it's the icons, because I think it's cute

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Your icon's like, sad face

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Mine's like, one!

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh wait, it's not Xbox 360, the FX2 or whatever, the new one?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well we don't have FX2, we just have FX

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But it's got samples of the FX tables

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But we'll get into that in my gaming week

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I was going to say, at some point, I don't want to spoil the gaming week

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But you should get the FX2, because the shell is free

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I totally want, I totally want

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh yeah, go for it

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As he does every week, to the one and only tech master, Loki!

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hi

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How are you, Loki?

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Good

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Awesome

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And Loki's brought some new toys to the show tonight

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That he's been showing off

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You want to tell our listeners about what you've brought to the studio?

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I brought a 3DS from Japan

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm not privy enough to get one of the US ones early

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I am going to be getting one on time, though

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Nice

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
With Street Fighter, because that's the bundle I picked

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And then, Motor Store Apocalypse

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I got review code for that because

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Because Sony loves me so much

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Or because I bought it off eBay

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Nice

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Photographic evidence now on orangerealgeradio.com

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, I noticed you've been taking pictures over and over there

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And you've been uploading them to orangerealgeradio.com

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I actually took a picture on the 3DS of myself

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I can see myself in 3D

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because looking in the mirror obviously isn't good enough

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I wanted to see what I would look like on a 3DS in the picture

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But unfortunately I can't upload that

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can

66
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, can you?

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But it's a format that only 3D devices can read

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's like an ITG

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's some sort of weird format

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But it's for 3D devices

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So it wouldn't do me any good to upload it to orangerealgeradio.com

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Because no one would see it

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You wouldn't be able to see it unless you have

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Like a 3DS

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Or maybe some of those special cameras

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Or the phones or whatever that can view 3D stuff

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or maybe a 3D TV

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know if you can view pictures on a 3D TV

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I would not want to blow up that picture to the size of a 50 inch television

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, look at my crap

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I noticed the resolution on the cameras

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're VJ cameras

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's really just a gimmicky thing right now

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But like 10 year olds will have a field day with it

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm having a field day with it

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you really?

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have to admit I was nosy

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The first thing I did before I took a picture of myself

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is I looked at everything you were taking pictures of

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And it's this cat

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh it's the cat

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh look more pictures of the cat

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Here's a picture of his desk at work

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh and here's the cat again

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well she was there at the time

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's why I took a picture of her

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
She's so exploited

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It works really well with stuff that has a lot of depth in it

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because if you just take a picture of

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I took a picture of triple baked pizza

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thankfully my nose is gigantic

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So there's a lot of depth there

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You can actually almost

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The photo that I took of the game while I was playing it

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can actually almost see the 3D in it

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's actually kind of neat

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Almost

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can actually see the layers in the image

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is what you can see

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Eventually it'll be kind of cool

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because maybe you can download the pictures

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Through the web browser

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When it comes out in May

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's awesome

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Um

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah it's been pretty fun to play with

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've got Nintendogs

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I haven't played Nintendogs

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's mainly just the show off

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because no one really cares about 3D

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Although Ridge Racer does look pretty cool in 3D

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I could have just stuck with that game

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I wanted more than one game

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I picked Nintendogs

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because whatever

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
May would help justify to the wife

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The cost of everything

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like oh I'll get you Nintendogs

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She wouldn't, no

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She doesn't care

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She thought Nintendogs was dumb to begin with

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought Nintendogs was dumb

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I had to see what it looked like in 3D

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And it looks pretty cool, very fuzzy

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They are very fuzzy

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And my whole row, they're just treating them like they're real dogs

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh the puppies are here

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's our official puppies

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I would play Nintendogs

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe that one won't make me feel completely

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Violently ill to my stomach

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I used to play it for like 15 minutes

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I used to play it for 15 minutes

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
During my break at work

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then I would forget about my puppies

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And they would run away

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you gonna get one at launch?

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I might have to wait a little bit

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah it's probably fine

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's only one game

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Other than

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Street Fighter

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That I'm getting with the US one

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And Street Fighter is kind of like eh

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It was either, well the three options I had were

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Street Fighter, Samurai Warriors

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Which eh, don't care about Samurai Warriors

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And uh

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm trying to think of the other one

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't remember

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Madden or something like that

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't want Madden

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So I picked Street Fighter

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then I'll probably pick up Pilotwings

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because I want to play Pilotwings

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah I would play Pilotwings

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That looks fun, otherwise I'll probably wait for the Kid at Gris game

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But, yeah Kid at Gris looks awesome

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But Pilotwings, I'm very disappointed

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's only three types of

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Things

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well the Super Nintendo one was maybe four

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I guess, wow that's kind of sad

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh yeah because they keep forgetting

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Every fifth stage was like

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This random shoot em up that you would have

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it was actually like a fifth

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well they have that kind of stuff in there

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hang gliding, jet pack

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sky diving

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's another one

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
By plane

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then the shoot em up stages

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I mean come on

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you can pull off four on a Super Nintendo

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think you can maybe pull off

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
More than that, I mean come on

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's be honest here

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The geometry for the levels and stuff like that

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're using WooHoo Island or whatever

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
From Wii Sports Resort

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have the island, the 3D object created

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I keep forgetting that WooHoo Island is like a character now

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh it's dumb

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's a character

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a character no one cares about

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's an island, big deal

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know someone can make an island

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Especially with the level of graphics

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That they're putting in there, I mean come on

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is the type of stuff that you would have seen in

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Prop Cycle, hell Prop Cycle had

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
More detail to it than this stuff

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But it's just

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That, I mean, right there

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh you don't have to create the island

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Which is kind of a major part of Pilotwings

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So you have to model the planes

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And weather vehicles and stuff

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And then you have to place your markers around

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stuff like that and code the rest of the game

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It didn't seem to me that that would have been

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
A lot of work

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know what I mean?

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sorry I'm just checking out some gameplay video of Pilotwings

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And remembering how freaking awesome this game was on Super Nintendo

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
When it first came out, like seriously

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And now that I look at it I'm like

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Gosh, the basics for this

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean it's really just a very

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Simple graphic of the island

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
With the mode 7 trick

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But it just

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I remember this game was the shit when it came out

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah and you know what

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I bet you anything that they're going to re-release this

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
On the virtual console for that

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I will bet you anything they will code

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A new emulator for it that everything that has

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Goddamn mode 7 is going to be in 3D

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And all the parallax

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Stuff that was in there, you know, different layers

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sprite layers and stuff like that

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Will be offset in certain distances

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's what's going to happen

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well they said it was going to be as simple as anything that had a Z-axis

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Would be, you know, able to be

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Made in 3D

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Kind of neat

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In the chat room, the ever present fourth guest

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
On our show chat.orangeloungeradio.com

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Big thanks to those of you guys

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That like to show up every week and I love this

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Chat, these comments here

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BlackWolf, our old pal that does the show before us here at All Games Radio

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The Bobby BlackWolf show

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He starts at 5 o'clock Pacific when we start at 6

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And yes, I'm leaving the pilot wings

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Gameplay going because I'm just, I'm being nostalgic

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
BlackWolf says, fact, Dead Island

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Also takes place on Wuhu Island

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If only

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And GameGuru says

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wuhu Island as a fighter for

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Super Smash Brothers 4

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There you go

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyhow

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It'll be a stage

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Alright, so what else did you bring to the show with you?

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You brought a Playstation 3, right?

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I brought a MotorStorm

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Apocalypse

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it's all sorts of awesome

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's basically

266
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're racing through the city that's

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Been destroyed by an earthquake

268
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Among other natural disasters

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so now you're

270
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Basically racing through that

271
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And then at the same time they've got

272
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A little bit of a storyline going on where there's this

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Corporation that basically

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wants you and these crazy

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Homeless people out of the city and the crazy

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Homeless people are throwing molotovs at you during the

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Races

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So while you're racing in some of the later

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Stages after they've established this

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They're shooting at you with guns

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So you have to dodge guns

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You have to dodge molotovs

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have to dodge falling everything

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Like there's just

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
All sorts of crazy stuff

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All of a sudden there's a track where I was racing on a bridge

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And this air raid

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Siren goes off and all of a sudden

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The bridge starts shaking and starts collapsing

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Right as I'm racing through it

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And that was all sorts of

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Cool and then

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There's another stage where I was racing on a motorcycle

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then all of a sudden this building just collapses

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right next to me

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It was awesome

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was an incredibly good time

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Seriously, probably my favorite one out of the series

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So why did you bring the PS3 with you?

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You want to show it off a little later during the show or something?

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because I'm gonna play it

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Instead of paying attention to the show

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh I'm paying attention to the show, I'm multitasking

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
When the calls start coming in

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's just like, I'll let Rob talk to the callers

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And I'll sit here and play Motorstar

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't help it if they're not interesting

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well didn't you think, I thought some of those comments

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Was very interesting before we had a Dead Island

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Taking place on Wuhu Island

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
As a fighter for Super Smash Bros. 4

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I was kind of thinking like

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know, there could be a trailer that's out there

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And it's like

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Pilot wings meets zombies

316
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
On Wuhu Island

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's very awesome

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just like that trailer

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Which by the way I hated that trailer

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I just want to throw that out there

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't think I ever talked about it on the show but I hated that trailer

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I really hated that Dead Island trailer

323
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I thought it was artsy and everything

324
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But like, I just

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I really didn't like it

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I guess I can get into the reasons why later

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Remind me later, I'll talk about it

328
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But for now we always like to start off our show

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
With how was your gaming week

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It was eventful, I just played

332
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Some Ridge Racer on the

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
3DS

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And my eyes hurt

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I played

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Pinball FX, which I talked about earlier

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And uh

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I played a lot of Pinball FX

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Actually, just sitting there all night and I updated

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My avatar

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I played that

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Game with the big

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Stupid dragon

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know, where you click the button and they run

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And you press, you know, the buttons

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And they do stuff

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And the chicks have horns, that type of thing

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
World of Warcraft

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh okay, I was like, what?

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And I like the discussion that we all

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Got into yesterday

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
About what the Dark Stalkers characters would be

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If they were characters in World of Warcraft

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So we were trying to

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Figure out if you wanted to make like

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Victor, would he be a drawn eye

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or whatever, so it was kind of funny

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's it, I'm gonna go get some dinner now

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Awesome, enjoy the noms

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Uh, well, Loki

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I know we've heard a little bit about 3DS

362
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And MotorStorm, but anything else in your gaming week you wanna talk about?

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Um, yeah, sure

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Um, other than

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
MotorStorm and

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, let's see, MotorStorm

367
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You know, I already talked about how awesome it was

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Uh, the 3DS played

369
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ridge Racer, and that's Ridge Racer

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I mean, it's, they didn't really change anything

371
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Too much

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Um, played some of the

373
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Um, games that are

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Kind of packed in with the 3DS, like the

375
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Um, what is that

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Face Invaders game, which is kind of funny

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I took, I took basically

378
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What was the equivalent of the

379
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Drunken Mario Kart picture

380
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
With, uh, the camera

381
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So that was fun, I was shooting my face

382
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then, um, I actually tried some of the

383
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Cards, and you can, there's one

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Where you're shooting targets with a

385
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Arrow, so that was kind of cool

386
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And then, um, other stuff

387
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I actually downloaded, um

388
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
On the IOS re-rave

389
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I was playing a little bit of that

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And that's pretty cool, I dug it

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I was pissed off for a while though, and I still

392
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Kind of am a little bit pissed off about it

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Pretty high scores, I'm like, why aren't they

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Appearing on the high score table

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Didn't realize I had to register for, like, a login

396
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Or something like that for their thing

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So after I did that, it reset all my high scores

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Thanks

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Wah, wah, wah, that's what you get for not

400
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Signing up for the first place

401
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, they didn't make it, they didn't say, in order to have

402
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your scores posted to the site, you need to register

403
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It just says log in and register

404
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
How else is it going to know who you are?

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, I thought I would just take my name

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry, did I throw logic into this equation?

407
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah, exactly

408
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry, Loki, I'll never do that again

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I played that

410
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I dug some of the songs in there, of course

411
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A lot of Kyle Worden music in there

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So if you're a fan of In the Groove, you'll probably

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Dig that

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What else did I play?

415
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Grand Theft Auto

416
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Pretty much

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, that was pretty much it

418
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And there were some random IOS games

419
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I played

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Just going through some of my games

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I downloaded to see, well, hey

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I haven't played this yet, let me try this out

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And see if it's any good or not

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
A lot of them weren't, so I just ended up deleting them

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There was one I played

426
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think it was called Hyper Missile or something like that

427
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That was pretty cool

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, but mainly

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Mainly Motorstorm, I've been playing a lot of that

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Actually

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm really hyped about that game

432
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Awesome

433
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Alright

434
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Anything else or is that it?

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's it

436
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Alright, I'll talk about my gaming week

437
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mostly a lot of the same stuff I've played in the past

438
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So not a whole lot of new stuff

439
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The usual wow

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Torchlight a little bit on XBLA

441
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Even though playing Torchlight

442
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
On Xbox Live makes me want to go back

443
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And play it on the PC more

444
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can go chew on that one for a little bit

445
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And some of the other stuff

446
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I did check out a few new things

447
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
One of them that Loki already mentioned

448
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Because obviously as a music game fan

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There's definitely the roots there

450
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's kind of a mix between

451
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Elite Beat Agents meets

452
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
DJ Max Technica meets

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
In the Groove

454
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I wasn't sure if I was going to dig it at first

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Because

456
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Obviously this show has been on a long time

457
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And way back in the day

458
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We used to be exclusively about music games

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And we would talk for three hours about

460
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The DDR scene and a lot of what was going on

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And at the time

462
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
One of the things that was going on in the DDR scene

463
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Was the game In the Groove that came out

464
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And it's no secret

465
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I was never really a huge fan of the In the Groove games

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's funny because

467
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
In retrospect

468
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think I appreciate what they were trying

469
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
To do a lot more now

470
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Than what I did then

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because especially coming so far

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Now and seeing everything that's happened

473
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Where I don't think Konami ever truly had faith

474
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
In that series

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can appreciate what they were trying to do

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
In retrospect, but just at the time

477
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It really felt cheap to me

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And I was really longing for more

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
DDR. Anyway, sorry for the

480
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Tangent, but just to give you the mindset

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was coming in here. I was coming in here thinking

482
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know if I'm going to really dig this because I was not

483
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really ever a big fan of In the Groove

484
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But I gotta say, I enjoyed

485
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
ReRave. It's cool

486
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's $2 to download

487
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Not a whole lot of songs come

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
With it for free

489
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I right away downloaded a song pack

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That was free

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So I couldn't tell you exactly how many songs you get initially

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It must only be like 2 or 3

493
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It was 3

494
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There was a song pack of about another 4 or 5 songs you get for free

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And then of course

496
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It wants to charge you more money

497
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
To get extra song packs

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Song pack 1, song pack 2

499
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
With a bunch of songs that are very similar

500
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
To what you hear in the default packs

501
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Not a lot of name recognition in those packs

502
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're not exactly going to get Lady Gaga

503
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Rihanna type of stuff

504
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There's one of them, I actually bought all the packs

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Did you?

506
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I wanted some actual songs to play

507
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And I was in a let me buy some stuff mood

508
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But I played

509
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Some songs, once again I don't recognize the artist

510
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But there's one of those songs from

511
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
One of the Geico commercials was in there

512
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh geez, really?

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I wouldn't recognize the artist, but that makes sense

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So I mean, ok, whatever, cool

515
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And a lot of the music games on

516
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm sorry, Xbox Live

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
IOS are set up the same way

518
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And DDR itself

519
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Being one of them, there's a DDR-S game

520
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That comes with no songs and everything you have to buy

521
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And song packs, so

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is nothing new, the model

523
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But as far as the 7 songs that come with it or so

524
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I've been playing most of them, and I enjoy the songs

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
They're pretty good, and the gameplay is

526
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Pretty slick, actually

527
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I like the whole turning power

528
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Power dials or whatever

529
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And you hit them right at the top

530
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And very similar to Elite Beat Angels or Technica

531
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You tap things on the screen

532
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
In time with the song

533
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Right when the power, imagine like a power

534
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Symbol on your computer that slowly turns

535
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
From a 6 o'clock position to a 12 o'clock position

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And you're supposed to tap it

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right when it's at the 12 o'clock position

538
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But some of them are hold

539
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Some of them have multi-taps

540
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Some of them you drag around the screen

541
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You know, different little tricks that kind of go with it

542
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And yeah, I enjoyed it

543
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It was really fun on the harder songs

544
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And the harder levels

545
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Even with Game Center

546
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And their own little system

547
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
As Loki was talking about earlier

548
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
For saving scores

549
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So it's pretty slick what they've done

550
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's kind of what I walked away from the game with

551
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Is that this is a pretty slick IOS game

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So yeah, if you're a fan of music games

553
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You definitely want to check this out

554
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I mean, it's 2 bucks

555
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's not a bad deal

556
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's unfortunate there's no demo or anything

557
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So that people can see what it is first

558
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But there's videos online

559
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So yeah, re-rave on the IOS

560
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The other game I checked out this week

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is a demo

562
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't like to review games based off the demo

563
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But this is one very high-profile game

564
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I've had a lot of anticipation going for

565
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And that's Mortal Kombat

566
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The demo's now out on PlayStation Network for everybody

567
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You don't have to just be a plus subscriber

568
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Regular or a plus can now get the demo on PS3

569
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So I spent a little time with that

570
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Just to see if it was going to be as awesome as I was hoping

571
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't want to say I didn't like it

572
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Because I did

573
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But I felt it was lacking

574
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And granted, it was a demo

575
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's supposed to be lacking

576
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It was only bare bones

577
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But when you get that mode

578
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's you know

579
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Fighter versus fighter

580
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's still kind of the core part of the game

581
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I don't know, it just wasn't as

582
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Action-packed as I was hoping

583
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And as fast-paced as I remember the Mortal Kombat games being

584
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
However, I am saying that

585
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Very open-mindedly

586
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because I realize again, it's a demo

587
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I was playing it single-player

588
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And I think Mortal Kombat really

589
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Best shines in multiplayer modes

590
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So I'm totally not being fair

591
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When I'm saying that right now

592
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But that was my honest-to-god reaction as I walked away from it

593
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Going, gosh

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I was hoping I'd have more fun with that

595
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But the fatalities did make me laugh a lot

596
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Like a little girl

597
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And the trailer that showed the upcoming ones

598
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like there's one where you push some guy's face into a subway train

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And it hits all the windows as the subway goes by

600
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And that made me laugh

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because Mortal Kombat is kind of dopey

602
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Because you like people getting their faces ripped off by a subway train

603
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was funny because Alan called me out on it

604
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And he's like, I don't get it

605
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You hate the Saw movies

606
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But you giggle at this stuff

607
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, but there's different

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's a very clear difference

609
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
There's a difference with like, okay you must torture yourself

610
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
For my amusement

611
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And there's a difference between like

612
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Ha ha, your face is gonna get ripped off

613
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Ha ha

614
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The Saw movies are trying to be real

615
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And teach these moral lessons

616
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Through these really sick things

617
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That I don't like

618
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But Mortal Kombat is basically one step above a cartoon

619
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's about the nether realm

620
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's not real

621
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you want to play a game?

622
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You forgot to feed your cat

623
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Now I'm gonna feed you to a tiger

624
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Those are the Saw movies to me

625
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Exactly

626
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Those are the Saw movies to me

627
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
She was fine, I fed her later on

628
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why do I have to get eaten by a tiger?

629
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That doesn't seem fair at all

630
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I will say what I did like

631
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not trying to

632
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Gosh, I'm gonna bring on the hate mail

633
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I did like about Mortal Kombat

634
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That I was able to pick it right up

635
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And it just felt like playing Mortal Kombat 2

636
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
In like Street Fighter 4 style graphics

637
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And that part was pretty awesome

638
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Like being able to select Mileena

639
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And just remember that Tord Tord

640
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Low kick was the little drop

641
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Cool things like that, really easy to get back into

642
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So that same sort of learning curve

643
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Where you were able to kind of slip right into

644
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Street Fighter 4

645
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
From Street Fighter 2

646
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think a lot of people are gonna find with this new Mortal Kombat

647
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So I probably will still pick up the full version of the game

648
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Even though I walked away from the demo going

649
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I just

650
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't know, there's something

651
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I think online play

652
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And multiplayer play

653
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And a lot of the other modes when the game's fleshed out

654
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Will make up for that

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But I have to be honest

656
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm not gonna lie just for the sake of hype

657
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Anyway, so check out the demo

658
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
See if you had the same reaction

659
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I talked to a friend of mine who felt the same way I did

660
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Very excited about the game after playing the demo

661
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Went, I don't know

662
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wasn't what I remember

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But anyway

664
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
There you go, those are the games I played this week

665
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So chat.orangelandsrated.com

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
If you want to join us in our chat room

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room says

668
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Sky, the fatality that looks the most funny

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Is the one showing Liu Kang getting hit by a taxi

670
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh yeah, that was

671
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That was pretty funny too

672
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I like the x-ray attack stuff

673
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I mean that stuff was funny

674
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I hope there's more of them in the regular game

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Like not just one x-ray attack for every character

676
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because I think some of those might get old quick

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But I cracked up at some of them

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They were pretty funny

679
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There you go

681
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
A lot of the same old moves coming back

682
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Johnny Cage can punch people in the balls still

683
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So in fact he likes to do it over and over again

684
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think he has an issue

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Anyway, let's move on

686
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Some housekeeping for tonight

687
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000

Otherwise we have no planned shows off

692
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Or trips were taken or anything

693
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So every Sunday night in the near future

694
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
At All Games Radio, www.allgames.com

695
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

696
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Is where you can hear us live

697
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So, yes ma'am

698
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I have an arcade report

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Disneyland

700
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh yeah, that's right, you were gone last week because you were at Disneyland

701
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Did you have fun?

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I had a great time

704
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Did you do the Toy Story Midway Mania?

705
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We totally did

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's like a giant video game, I love it

707
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Dan totally kicked my ass, but I kicked his butt at AstroBusters

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The Starcade

709
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Is actually now also

710
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The home of Star Trader

711
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Because they've closed down the Star Trader

712
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And Star Tours for the revamp

713
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I saw when they had shut down

714
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Star Tours

715
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But the Star Trader is also being redone

716
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Right, well to get all the new merchandise I'm sure

717
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So, well that and they sort of

718
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Would have to go through there to take care of the hallway

719
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If they need to redo the hallway

720
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So, um

721
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's now kind of half the arcade

722
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It used to be, literally

723
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Interesting

724
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That's my arcade report

725
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You didn't play anything there

726
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's expensive

727
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
What? Oh, I know

728
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because Electronica doesn't go under the week

729
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And they had said that it was gonna during spring break

730
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And then they didn't

731
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Is Captain EO back already?

732
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes, it's the original 77mm film

733
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
With grain and everything

734
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's showing it's age

735
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The cheeseball 3D

736
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
That was not great

737
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Here's the summary of Captain EO

738
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Is that

739
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Michael Jackson flies through space with a bunch of Muppets

740
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Lands on the Borg homeworld

741
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And turns all the Borg

742
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Into extras from Xanadu

743
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Ruled by Angelica Houston

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The end

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And it's awesome

746
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
But am I not right?

747
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No, that's a pretty good way of summarizing it

748
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The end

749
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm gonna be sad when they get rid of that finally

750
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Because you know it's not

751
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
There's gonna come a time when they're finally gonna have to get rid of Captain EO again

752
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
For a new movie

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It better not be Honey I Shrunk the Audience again

754
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Because that movie was terrible

755
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let's actually get into some other video game news

756
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
No Captain EO game to talk about this week

757
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But maybe some other video games

758
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So we'll start off with Loki tonight

759
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
There's been a few games delayed from Japan

760
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Not necessarily because of the whole tsunami earthquake thing

761
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But you could probably attribute some of that to it

762
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Starting off

763
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Warriors Legends of Troy

764
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
On Xbox 360 and PS3

765
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And Dead or Alive Dimensions

766
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Both coming from Tecmo Koe

767
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Those have been delayed

768
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And won't make their scheduled release dates

769
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Of March 24th and March 31st

770
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Honestly not a big surprise

771
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Dead or Alive Dimensions

772
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Has been delayed a few times already

773
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
For the US

774
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And Warriors Legends of Troy

775
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Not even coming out on the 360 in the US

776
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's been delayed indefinitely

777
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So I'm not surprised one bit

778
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And that was prior to the whole earthquake thing

779
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So

780
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Take that for what it will

781
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And then on top of all that

782
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Of course this is a little bit too

783
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Various reasons why they're delaying some of this stuff

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Yakuza of the End

785
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Motorstorm Apocalypse

786
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And

787
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Disaster Report 4

788
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Well Disaster Report 4 has been cancelled

789
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
From Sega

790
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Which

791
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You know a game about wandering around in a

792
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You know a city that has

793
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Undergone some you know traumatic disaster

794
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Might not be the most sensitive thing to put out

795
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
In a country

796
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Unfortunately the game was a disaster

797
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Honestly it probably was

798
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Because Disaster Report games have not been very good

799
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
They were very budget

800
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But Motorstorm Apocalypse obviously

801
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The content based on that

802
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't really understand

803
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I mean I understand

804
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You know the people might be

805
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
It's not like you're racing through Tokyo

806
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or something like that

807
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Or racing through parts of Japan that are being destroyed

808
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
This is like it looks like San Francisco

809
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So eh

810
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Well you know people are being hyper sensitive

811
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
About it but I

812
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I sort of get it because

813
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
When you put down multi millions of dollars

814
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
On these projects you have to release them

815
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Just right you know

816
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And right now you've got an entire

817
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Country that probably doesn't want to be thinking about

818
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The apocalypse you know what I mean

819
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So for

820
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It just I can see where

821
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
People would be concerned it's in bad taste

822
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But nuclear boy Rob

823
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's a whole other thing though

824
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You're talking about the little YouTube thing

825
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He needs something to distract him from having to poop

826
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And then

827
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Well the other thing is

828
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Not only did they announce it was going to be delayed in Japan

829
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
But Motorstorm Apocalypse also got delayed in Europe

830
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And then later on in the US

831
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I don't understand why

832
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Because the game is done but

833
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Eh whatever okay

834
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You're delaying it

835
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
That's fine

836
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
But eh

837
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Again if your game comes out the wrong week

838
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It might get destroyed like Blur

839
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I would say a lot of the big reason Blur

840
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Didn't do well is it came out the wrong week

841
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But it was coming out the perfect time

842
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I mean granted it's coming out around the same time

843
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
As another Sony game So Com 4

844
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But I don't really think those would compete

845
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
With each other too much

846
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It was coming out in the month where there was essentially nothing

847
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
This time it's not the other releases

848
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah but I mean I can understand delaying it

849
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
In Japan but people in the US

850
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You know they're not going to be like

851
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh well that's just insensitive

852
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's not Japan for one

853
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's just completely

854
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You know it looks like San Francisco

855
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
In fact I would probably

856
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Be willing to bet it's based off

857
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
San Francisco because San Francisco

858
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Kind of known for earthquakes so

859
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You know that's not a stretch

860
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And you know the

861
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Actually I'm going

862
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
To say it is goddamn San Francisco

863
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Because you know having played some of the

864
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Tracks and stuff it looks like San Francisco

865
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There is a Sony office right outside San Francisco

866
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So it wouldn't surprise me at all

867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You know so I mean

868
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't understand delaying it there

869
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Or in Europe

870
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
But okay whatever you know

871
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They want to wait and release it in May

872
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Or something where it's packed full of

873
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Releases and fine

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I really think that they should just

875
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Keep it with the April 12th release date

876
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It was perfect there was nothing else coming out

877
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was just

878
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You know

879
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well are we talking maybe it'll just be a couple weeks

880
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Maybe, maybe a couple weeks

881
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But really a couple weeks

882
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's going to put it out in a lot of

883
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know because let me put it this way

884
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You've got MX vs ATV Alive coming out in about a month

885
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
After it was originally coming out

886
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So if you wait a little bit longer

887
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You're going to have another off-road racing game

888
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Granted both of them are completely different from each other

889
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But they're still both

890
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Kind of in the same genre

891
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I just think it's kind of a mistake to move it

892
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It should have really come out at that time

893
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Because it would have been perfect

894
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There's nothing else coming out

895
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Um

896
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's awesome so seriously pick it up

897
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
When it does come out

898
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Because it's all sorts of awesome

899
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm going into the chat room

900
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
At chat.orangetonstrader.com

901
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat says

902
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Actually yes people in the US find things insensitive

903
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
They bash the event

904
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Because it did an episode this week

905
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
About a nuclear power plant being threatened

906
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And everyone was like how dare NBC air this

907
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh god

908
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You know what they need to just stop

909
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Listening to those people

910
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Because I mean

911
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm going to boycott your show

912
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm not going to watch it next week

913
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But I'll catch it on DVR

914
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well there's been a lot of

915
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I mean I'm just playing the devil's advocate here

916
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I also think people are maybe blowing this out of proportion

917
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
People are dumb

918
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
On the west coast and you know this as well as I do

919
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's been a lot of talk

920
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Like the news is dominated with this talk about

921
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Could the radiation from the power plant in Japan

922
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Get to the west coast

923
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I need to get my tin foil hat

924
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because they're going to spin it any way they can

925
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
To make it sound like it's terrible

926
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Just like you know they were saying oh my god

927
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
The plant's going to melt down

928
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's a matter of minutes you know

929
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh actually no

930
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Everything's back to normal again

931
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh but it's going to kill us all

932
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Nuclear rain

933
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You know fallout

934
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Scary

935
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Vote Republican or this will happen

936
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I mean seriously they just blow it way out

937
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Because what else are they going to talk about

938
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Charlie Sheen I mean seriously

939
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They've got to talk about something

940
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Get you to watch the news

941
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Look I

942
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We've got to be careful how we tread here

943
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because I think to some extent it is a very

944
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Frightful thing

945
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If this was all going on

946
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Like I know they shut it down years ago

947
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No don't get me wrong

948
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It is a frightening thing

949
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
But what's going on

950
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
There and what the reporting is going on

951
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There is completely different

952
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I am honestly going to say

953
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's a lot like nuclear boy

954
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm sorry those who haven't seen it

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The worst that's going to happen is they're going to have

956
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
To evacuate Fukushima

957
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And then

958
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Fish are going to be

959
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Sick you can't go fishing near there

960
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Plants are going to be radiated

961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You're going to have to deal with this for probably the next

962
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
7 to 10 years

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I think is what it takes for

964
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Nuclear radiation to be cleaned out of

965
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Land and our technology is a lot better

966
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Than it was you know around say

967
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Chernobyl

968
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Think about that

969
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Right now they're in a position

970
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
To do that and keep in mind this was

971
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
A place that was designed

972
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
To go against a 7.5

973
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Earthquake

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Which was to date

975
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The biggest I think that Japan had seen

976
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So

977
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Something like this coming up and having

978
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Everything still pretty much

979
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hold intact with just a few problems

980
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
That has to say something

981
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Pretty amazing for you know

982
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
The level of

983
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Of care and

984
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You know thought that went into the construction

985
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Of these places

986
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You know and also should make everybody

987
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
In Sacramento shut up about us having

988
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Nuclear power here

989
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Because we don't have earthquakes

990
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Shut up

991
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Well I got the perfect location for a nuclear power plant

992
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Where the old one was?

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
No

994
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Where the kings normally play because they suck

995
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So you know what

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well they're leaving anyway

997
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And hey we can still hold count

998
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Aren't we a video game show I think we got a little off track

999
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Well but

1000
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I think that my point is made that everyone should watch

1001
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Nuclear Boy because it's great

1002
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You know all we have to worry about

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Is just mutated dolphins

1004
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Rising up you know to enslave humanity

1005
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's really what it comes down to

1006
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Now you're making light of a terrible situation

1007
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Knock it off alright

1008
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's not terrible that those dolphins

1009
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Are so smart it's terrible that they're using it for

1010
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Evil ok? Let's talk about something

1011
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That's definitely

1012
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Fiction let's get away from the real world stuff and get to

1013
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
A land of fiction and one of our favorite fictional places

1014
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Silent Hill

1015
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Of course Silent Hill is

1016
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
At least a one time awesome video game series

1017
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's kind of slipped into a

1018
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Ok yeah I really like

1019
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This series because I used to like it

1020
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Silent Hill we're experimenting with

1021
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
New weather patterns now

1022
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
So anyhow here's the deal

1023
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Apparently Silent Hill is going to have a release

1024
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
On Xbox Live if rumors are to be

1025
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Believed and here's where the rumors are coming from

1026
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's an interview with the Italian based

1027
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Xbox 360 magazine and it's from

1028
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The art director for Silent Hill

1029
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Downpour saying quote

1030
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
At the moment there will be no

1031
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Multiplayer modes in Silent Hill Downpour

1032
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Konami is investigating

1033
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A separate chapter devoted entirely

1034
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
To the multiplayer now

1035
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He went on in this interview to say that he doesn't

1036
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Know any details but it's supposed to be

1037
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Xbox Live Arcade and quote

1038
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That most players have to survive in the

1039
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Town of Silent Hill

1040
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Now I kind of look at this and go that's

1041
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's silent hill cash in

1042
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Well Silent Hill was always supposed

1043
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
To be a very single

1044
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Player experience like I don't see this

1045
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Turning into a shoot em up

1046
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Type of thing like I don't really see it as a

1047
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Bang bang you know kill the others

1048
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Really? It would be kind of cool

1049
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If like one person could be pyramid head

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Really? And everybody else is trying to run away

1051
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You don't see it as a bonus points for you know

1052
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Manic and rape You don't see it as a bang bang

1053
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Shoot em up game but yet Konami does

1054
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Because they released an iOS game that was

1055
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Basically that and they released an arcade game

1056
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
That's basically that so they

1057
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Apparently do see it as a shoot em up Well but

1058
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Not like shoot other people you're shooting

1059
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The creatures of Silent Hill or whatever I don't see

1060
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Where the multiplayer element comes on that's my point

1061
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But then there's a part of me that also pictures

1062
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Like a very Left 4 Dead kind of game

1063
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That actually could be kind of awesome

1064
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Like and maybe it's like don't take

1065
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Left 4 Dead literally but maybe some type of

1066
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Like cooperative survival

1067
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Game where maybe everybody

1068
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Helps each other in a certain way

1069
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
To survive the town of Silent

1070
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Hill that might be kind of cool

1071
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know That would be neat

1072
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And I think like a Left 4 Dead style game

1073
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Would be in demand like right now because Left 4 Dead

1074
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Was very popular there was the original

1075
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
There was a sequel we haven't heard anything about a third

1076
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So maybe

1077
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Silent Hill could kind of release a game like that

1078
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't know that's I mean when you talk multiplayer

1079
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Silent Hill like I just I really hope

1080
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
It isn't blue pyramid head versus red pyramid

1081
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Head that would be ridiculous and dumb

1082
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So it's It's like spy versus spy with

1083
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Pyramid head Yes that would be hideous

1084
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So either it's got to be like a

1085
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Co-op survival or it's got to

1086
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Be one versus

1087
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Everybody which now the

1088
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
More I kind of say that out loud I think that's kind of dumb

1089
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Too so I really hope it's more like the

1090
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Co-op survival that could be kind of rad actually

1091
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Can you imagine like having to figure out puzzles

1092
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
With multiple people that'd be kind of fun Nothing

1093
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Would get done I can think of something like

1094
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh crap Pyramid head's coming

1095
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Push someone in

1096
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
His path Exactly

1097
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Sacrifice dark Sakura

1098
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hey be like bitch

1099
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Please smack

1100
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Alright

1101
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Anyhow yeah we'll see what develops

1102
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
With that I would imagine if this

1103
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Is true if big if remember this

1104
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Is a rumor because it's coming from an

1105
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Italian magazine from the art director

1106
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Like I'm not saying that

1107
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You know that small time stuff but you know

1108
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Again it is it does

1109
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Say it sound a little bit like I have this cousin

1110
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Who's a camera man on you know the new

1111
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Superman movie and he told me that Art directors

1112
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Are pretty big Yeah I know

1113
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
But still Dude it has

1114
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Art director in the title Alright anyhow

1115
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Hey just take it with a grain of salt

1116
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
That's all I'm saying don't be disappointed if this game doesn't happen

1117
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I would love to be an art director of a magazine

1118
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Or if it isn't good

1119
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I would love to be an art director Anyway

1120
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Well maybe you should when this guy gets

1121
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Fired for leaking all the details about the game

1122
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You should apply for his job

1123
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't want to move to Italy

1124
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Alright moving on dark Sakura

1125
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What do you have for us Well

1126
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Apparently the

1127
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Zynga people

1128
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
They Zynga sucks

1129
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm sorry

1130
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
His name is Brian Reynolds

1131
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And he said that Xbox Live

1132
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Is too small for them

1133
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
To bother with

1134
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
For Farmville

1135
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That means my mother won't be getting an Xbox anytime soon

1136
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
They're basically saying

1137
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's too small of a demographic

1138
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He says that most of his friends have

1139
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Smartphones and computers

1140
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
But not too many of them have an Xbox 360

1141
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
That's because your friends suck

1142
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He's an idiot

1143
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I actually

1144
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Kinda get what he said

1145
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
There are way more people on

1146
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Facebook than there are on Xbox Live

1147
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Fact But let's look at

1148
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hard cold numbers okay first of all

1149
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
There are 23 million members

1150
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
On Xbox Live as of February

1151
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
2010

1152
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
In January Facebook had

1153
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
600 million users

1154
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And Farmville had 62 million

1155
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Active since September of last year

1156
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So basically

1157
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
What he's saying is he doesn't like money

1158
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't see how it would be

1159
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That difficult

1160
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I mean really

1161
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But he's like no it's not gonna be worth

1162
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Our time for just these people

1163
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay if you don't want more addicts fine

1164
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Exactly he's basically saying

1165
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Well why would we put it on

1166
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Xbox Live or

1167
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
The Playstation network or something like that

1168
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
They have less people than they have on Facebook

1169
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Duh! It's called expanding your demographic

1170
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You already have it on Facebook

1171
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You already have it on smartphones

1172
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
That's why you would put it on a console because you don't

1173
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Have it there yet

1174
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Here's what he said

1175
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Basically the worry

1176
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Is the social experience

1177
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Basically the social experience is going to be

1178
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
A very small number so that the amount of

1179
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Social capital that is there will not be very

1180
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
High so basically you're not gonna have

1181
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
People doing the microtransactions

1182
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah and I think that

1183
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is more what this boils down to

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think you know

1185
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It's a little bit comparing the

1186
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Apples to oranges and what's going on with these

1187
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Comparisons yes there are zillions more

1188
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
People on Facebook than Xbox Live

1189
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But you have to remember that the Zynga games thrive

1190
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
On this very specific business model

1191
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Where they are free to play with the

1192
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Purchasable enhancements that's not the way

1193
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That Xbox works

1194
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
To some level yes you can enhance

1195
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Certain Xbox Live arcade games with

1196
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Extra things but you're always putting some money

1197
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Down up front to play the games

1198
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I would question sure you might have hundreds of

1199
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Millions of people playing FarmVille on Facebook

1200
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But how many of them are actually paying for it

1201
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You know and it's probably

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
A pretty damn scary number

1203
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
When you know a lot of us kind of sit here and

1204
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Don't understand FarmVille

1205
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But again I think the types

1206
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Of games that you have come to

1207
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Know on Facebook and mobile phones are not

1208
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Necessarily the same types of games that are

1209
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
On Xbox Live Arcade

1210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It's just kind of like

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't know by the way you know

1212
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The percentage is using those

1213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm just going to use those numbers as a basis

1214
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The percentage of people on Facebook

1215
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
That play FarmVille

1216
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
4%

1217
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Tiny

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Tiny tiny

1219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So I mean if I

1220
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Were this guy I'd be looking to find ways

1221
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
To get more revenue in

1222
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'd be adjusting the business model do like

1223
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
XBLA version of FarmVille

1224
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Or my thought why does it

1225
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Have to be FarmVille or something based

1226
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Off of it. If your games are so damn addicting

1227
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Rise to the challenge

1228
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And create a game that you could get away

1229
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
With charging $15 for

1230
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You know there are

1231
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I can't believe I'm about to say this

1232
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But there are some things you can appreciate about FarmVille

1233
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And

1234
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Like it keeps my mother from preaching at me

1235
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's like saying there are some things you can appreciate about Hitler

1236
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
No

1237
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I am not going to go there period

1238
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Other than

1239
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Volkswagen and the Autobahn

1240
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Alright look

1241
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
My thing is that like

1242
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
The thing about

1243
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Now I'm totally lost

1244
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I feel sick

1245
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I feel a little sick now

1246
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The thing about FarmVille is that

1247
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It kind of gets your friends

1248
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Even though it might not be us

1249
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The people that are the quote unquote

1250
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Hardcore gamers

1251
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It gets our moms

1252
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And our relatives and people

1253
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
To be playing a

1254
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Multiplayer game together

1255
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Very easily

1256
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And maybe there's a way they could bring

1257
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
That multiplayer effort

1258
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
To the Xbox Live place

1259
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Which in turn could maybe enhance

1260
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Xbox Live but I don't think that necessarily

1261
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Has to be just fucking FarmVille

1262
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
No. There's plenty of other games they could rip

1263
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Off

1264
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Right? I'm just still

1265
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Kind of feeling ill from

1266
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Orange Lounge

1267
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Making people throw up in their mouths

1268
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Daily

1269
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Making my stomach flip flop and I just ate

1270
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I feel ill

1271
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Going to chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1272
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Spazinator told me to bite my tongue

1273
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Black Wolf says that would require that they actually

1274
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Make something original

1275
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Defective Candy says

1276
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Every time we sell one of those Facebook game cards

1277
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Where I work I die a little on the inside

1278
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Alright

1279
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You're just feeding the beast

1280
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Let's move on

1281
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Loki

1282
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Take us to some completely different news please

1283
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
This is completely different

1284
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
They're actually working on a

1285
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Transformers MMO

1286
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And it's being developed by the people behind

1287
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The browser based

1288
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
MMO RuneScape

1289
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And I guess they've worked out a deal with Hasbro

1290
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And the game is set to be released in

1291
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
North America, Europe, Latin America, Australia

1292
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And New Zealand sometime in 2012

1293
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
And they said that

1294
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
The title will be a dynamic

1295
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And action packed game

1296
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
No word on which

1297
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Transformers universe

1298
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It will be based on

1299
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But that is interesting

1300
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Let's hope it's not the Michael Bay

1301
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Transformers universe although you know that would be

1302
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Action packed

1303
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Apparently Asia is

1304
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Also getting its own Transformers

1305
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
MMO from

1306
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Net Dragon

1307
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And that's slated to roll out

1308
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I guess later this year

1309
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That's interesting

1310
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Be popular

1311
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
People like Transformers

1312
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I don't know the MMO space is a little bit crowded right now

1313
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I don't know if it will be able to kind of

1314
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Get its way in there

1315
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
If it was free to play that would be pretty cool

1316
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Hopefully they don't have the expectation bar very high

1317
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
That's all I'm saying

1318
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
The MMO space is a very tough nut

1319
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
To crack right now

1320
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And if it's not free to play

1321
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It has to triple be that much better

1322
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And judging from the

1323
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Transformer games that have been on the consoles

1324
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The last one was alright

1325
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And the next one is supposed to be okay

1326
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because it's from the same people as the last one

1327
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So hopefully

1328
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'll try to keep an open mind

1329
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But I mean

1330
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We all know that third movie is going to be terrible

1331
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I realize they're all

1332
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Now admitting like wow the second movie

1333
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Was really bad but you know the third movie

1334
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Is going to be even worse

1335
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
That last move

1336
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
If I'm wrong then I'm wrong hooray

1337
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
But I'm just not getting my hopes up

1338
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's all

1339
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Hey let's talk about music games

1340
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Ubisoft is going to be putting out a new game

1341
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's called Rocksmith

1342
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It's a rhythm game that uses real guitars

1343
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Wait a minute

1344
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That worked before

1345
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Isn't that a train that left the station quite some time ago

1346
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Alrighty well whatever

1347
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's called Rocksmith is the game

1348
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Some of the artists that will be in the game

1349
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
David Bowie, Interpol, The Rolling Stones

1350
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Pretty solid song list

1351
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Right there so far

1352
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You can use any electric guitar

1353
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That you might just happen to have

1354
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So we're not talking about buying a cheap

1355
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Plastic peripheral it's using

1356
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
An existing electric guitar

1357
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So that's neat I guess

1358
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Not sure exactly how this all works

1359
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Just yet as to how it's going to identify

1360
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
From any guitar but I would imagine

1361
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Some type of audio

1362
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Pitch sensing peripheral kind of similar

1363
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
To how it detects when you're singing

1364
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
What pitch you're singing at

1365
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It would probably plug into it like you'd plug it in

1366
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Like you'd plug it into an amp

1367
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So there is a trailer out there right now

1368
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's supposed to be coming out the second half of the year

1369
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So I imagine that we'll be hearing

1370
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
More about this at E3

1371
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Okay how are we going to use less

1372
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I was going to try and play it

1373
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah but I wanted to play the trailer but a stupid commercial

1374
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
For those goddamn bears

1375
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That talk about toilet paper

1376
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We had actually talked about this before

1377
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It was actually a game in development called Guitar Rising

1378
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh yeah

1379
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But that never really came out

1380
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And then Ubisoft bought it

1381
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah it shows a guitar plugged into

1382
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The Xbox

1383
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
There's got to be some little adapter

1384
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Thingy or something

1385
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It looks like an amp plugged to USB

1386
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah it's similar to what you use with the

1387
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Um

1388
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Karaoke mics

1389
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm sure it's got to be something just like that

1390
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So

1391
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I was trying to

1392
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Look at the commercial here

1393
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah somebody plugged it in there

1394
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
A little electric guitar

1395
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Again it doesn't really show me anything about the game

1396
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
It's just hey dude is tuning his guitar

1397
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Getting ready to jam

1398
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Man there's so many terrible commercials for games out there

1399
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Nice guitar

1400
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Alright let's move on Dark Soccer

1401
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Well it's been 22 years in the making

1402
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Da da da

1403
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
There will be a sequel to River City Ransom

1404
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yay

1405
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Or as it was known in Europe, Street Gangs

1406
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yay

1407
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Or I really like the Japanese name

1408
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Hot Blooded Downtown Story

1409
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Nice

1410
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It's so hot

1411
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The Japanese developer Miracle Kids

1412
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Is trying to

1413
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Actually got a bunch of the original development team

1414
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Back together

1415
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And they are going to be doing a console version

1416
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
In the summer with a PC release

1417
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
In 2012

1418
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So the console version is this summer

1419
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The PC one will be out next year

1420
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And

1421
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
They're also

1422
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Got

1423
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Downtown Smash

1424
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Dodgeball

1425
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Which for us was Super Dodgeball

1426
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Which is on Xbox Live

1427
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Indie games

1428
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So

1429
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yay

1430
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
If you still want to play the old school one

1431
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Get it on Virtual Consoles

1432
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
500 points

1433
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And to this day my favorite version is still the PC Engine one

1434
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
This is news I want to be excited about

1435
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But I'm just really worried

1436
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
A lot of time has gone by

1437
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And this can either be a retro

1438
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Revival that's done very awesomely

1439
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Or very terribly

1440
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I always worry it's going to end up in the

1441
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Second one there

1442
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I think the man who rearmed

1443
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Did the whole 8-bit retro thing extremely well

1444
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But I don't know

1445
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
The second one apparently wasn't that great

1446
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
A lot of the stuff that's retro too

1447
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Is sometimes better left in the past

1448
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
That's all I'm saying

1449
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We'll see as soon as we start to see

1450
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Some screenshots and some actual gameplay

1451
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But I guess it's kind of cool that that's coming back

1452
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I mean that was a game I really liked

1453
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Hopefully it kind of comes back as an arcade title

1454
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I don't know if I'd want to pay $60

1455
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
For a new River City Ransom game

1456
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But I don't suspect it's going to be

1457
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Something for Xbox Live Arcade

1458
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Remember when they re-did

1459
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Final Fight

1460
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Did they?

1461
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000

A game called Escatos is coming out this week

1574
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
This is like an old school shooter

1575
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Type game that's been revamped basically

1576
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Or I should say it's inspired by old school shooters

1577
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And it's like you know

1578
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
In like 3D

1579
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's basically another shmup

1580
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
But it looks like it has some more retro based modes

1581
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So if you're into like old school shooters

1582
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000

1611
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Huge week

1612
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I almost want to import this

1613
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
But I know I won't be able to read it

1614
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Final Fantasy IV The Complete Collection makes its way out on the Sony PSP

1616
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm so excited for this

1617
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I dust off the PSP, get my charger, get ready to go

1618
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
So excited for this

1619
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Also an interesting game called Are You Alice?

1620
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Comes out this week on the Sony PSP

1621
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
It's set based in the

1622
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Was it the

1623
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Brady Bunch universe?

1624
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
No it is not based in the Brady Bunch universe

1625
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Actually it looks very much like a

1626
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I don't know how to explain this

1627
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Like a very like old time

1628
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Think of like that Castlevania

1629
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Sort of flair

1630
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I mean it's not like vampires

1631
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But definitely the costumes kind of remind me of that

1632
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Sort of story

1633
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's an adventure game

1634
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
On the PSP

1635
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I don't know if that's something

1636
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
That's coming out over here

1637
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I don't think so

1638
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I don't know if it's based on the anime or what the deal is

1639
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Are You Alice?

1640
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
At least it wasn't Are You Jimmy Ray

1641
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Because I hated that song

1642
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Remember the 90s?

1643
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Alright how about the UK?

1644
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Dark Sakura

1645
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Well in the UK we have

1646
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000

That's later

That's on the 30th, nevermind

1677
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
K done

1678
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So excited to be finished with those release dates

1679
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Alright just a couple more stories for you guys

1680
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Then we got the classic game of the week

1681
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
A trip down memory lane

1682
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
With a classic video game coming up in just a little bit

1683
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
But first, two more stories for you guys

1684
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah we got some news about the NGP

1685
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Or what's codenamed the NGP

1686
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
From Sony

1687
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
They're saying that the

1688
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
games will be downloadable day and date with the

1689
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
retail releases

1690
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So you'll be able to either buy

1691
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
the cartridge that these are going to be on

1692
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
or download them from the Playstation Network store

1693
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
All of them? Or just the Sony ones?

1694
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Well they're saying all of them

1695
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But here's kind of an

1696
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
interesting thing though if you think about it

1697
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That sounds

1698
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
good in theory

1699
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Until you realize one thing

1700
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There's no onboard storage on the NGP

1701
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So

1702
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Where the hell am I supposed to put these games that

1703
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
you're having me download? Oh I have to buy your

1704
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
proprietary memory unit

1705
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh how wonderful

1706
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I have to buy a fucking memory card

1707
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
to do that. How about this? I'll just buy the

1708
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
retail game. Man that

1709
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
sounds good. Because you know what I could do with that

1710
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
retail game? When I don't want to play it anymore

1711
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I can sell it back

1712
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Because I'm sure you're not going to have any sort of

1713
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
price break or anything like that on there

1714
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So

1715
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Unless they come out

1716
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
cheaper because I'm not buying

1717
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
all the packaged goods that go along

1718
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
with the game

1719
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm not interested, sorry

1720
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And then on top of that

1721
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
there's a rumor regarding the price of the system

1722
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Apparently

1723
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Sony Europe put out

1724
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
a survey. I guess this is

1725
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
tying in with Ubisoft

1726
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
It was

1727
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Some survey

1728
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
conducted by a

1729
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
research firm and sponsored by

1730
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Ubisoft. They're saying that

1731
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
the retail price of the Sony NGP is expected

1732
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
to be around $350

1733
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
How likely

1734
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
would you be

1735
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
How likely would you be

1736
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
to purchase the NGP now that

1737
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
you know the retail price?

1738
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
They're saying that's the premium model with 3G

1739
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
The next question is

1740
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
How about the one without 3G

1741
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
which will be considerably lower at

1742
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
$250?

1743
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That's fucking expensive

1744
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
both ways and I know that the reason

1745
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
that they're saying, oh well $350

1746
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
we're competing with the iPad and those

1747
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
tablet devices but

1748
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
because you're a handheld

1749
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
gaming console

1750
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I know you may want to think that you're a computer

1751
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
or think that you're a tablet or something like that

1752
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
but the truth of the matter is

1753
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
you're not, you're a game console

1754
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
so your price is too damn high

1755
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
$250 should be the topic

1756
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I don't even think that these

1757
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
prices that we're hearing about mean anything

1758
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I don't think Sony knows what they're charging for this thing yet

1759
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I really don't

1760
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I mean, a week before

1761
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
E3 I believe this rumor right now

1762
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
doesn't mean squat

1763
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
We'll see

1764
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I wouldn't be surprised

1765
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
if they go and try to charge $350

1766
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
but here's the thing, it'll be $350

1767
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
retail but

1768
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
because these are gonna have

1769
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
3G, they're gonna be tied with some sort of

1770
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
data plan and get it for a lot cheaper

1771
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
than that because you're gonna be signing a contract

1772
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
or to your contract or something like that

1773
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
so that's where it's gonna make

1774
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
sense for people to pick up the 3G

1775
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Not necessarily though, you don't have to sign a contract for

1776
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
an iPad

1777
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
an iPhone, yes, but an iPad, no

1778
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
you don't sign a contract for those

1779
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Well then how do you get the 3G?

1780
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You buy it with the 3G enabled and then you buy a separate data plan

1781
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but they don't subsidize the cost of those machines

1782
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
at all

1783
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
because I believe the data can be through

1784
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
either, and correct me if I'm wrong chatters

1785
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
but I'm pretty sure it's either to AT&T

1786
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
or Verizon

1787
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
and now we have this big huge news today

1788
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
that AT&T has gobbled up T-Mobile

1789
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
or at least will be over the next 12 months

1790
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
assuming the government approves of the acquisition

1791
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
or what have you, so that's just gonna be

1792
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
even more, you know, that's one

1793
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
less carrier out of the sea

1794
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It'll be interesting to see what happens

1795
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
A lot of people on my Twitter

1796
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
are not happy about that acquisition by the way

1797
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Apparently a lot more T-Mobile customers than I realized out there

1798
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
who don't want to switch

1799
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Well they have some pretty good budget plans

1800
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
That's okay, I'm already with AT&T

1801
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I know, I've never had a problem with AT&T, but some people really hate them

1802
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But then again, I don't live in a huge city

1803
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It seems like everybody I know that hates AT&T

1804
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
lives in a huge city

1805
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I have better luck with AT&T here than anything else

1806
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
and I have no trouble

1807
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
when I travel, so

1808
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Well, we'll see

1809
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Alright, anyhow

1810
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
More stuff, and this is on a completely different

1811
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
kind of note, you know, obviously last week

1812
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
we spent a little time talking about how

1813
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
you guys can help, what's going on

1814
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
in Japan and the really unfortunate

1815
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
tragedy that's happened over there and

1816
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
a lot of the gaming world now coming on board

1817
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
to do some really cool things for the

1818
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
disaster relief over in Japan

1819
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I don't even have time to name it all

1820
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
but here's some of the ones that caught my eye

1821
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Squeenix

1822
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
is just flat out donating money

1823
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
There's no buy this game for whatever

1824
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
cost or donate through the

1825
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Nope, they are just straight out giving

1826
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
100 million yen to the relief

1827
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
effort, they are also collecting

1828
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
donations from employees throughout the world

1829
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and they are also going to be getting donations

1830
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
through select Squeenix

1831
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
online services and the amusement

1832
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
facilities that Taito operates in

1833
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Japan, so very cool what

1834
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Square Enix, or as we always call them on the show

1835
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Squeenix is doing

1836
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
This weekend, PopCap is donating

1837
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
the sales of their IOS games

1838
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
that means iPhone and iPad games

1839
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
to the Red Cross, so they

1840
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
donate 100% of the sales of

1841
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
the games this weekend

1842
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
March 19th and 20th, so those listening

1843
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
live, today is the last day to do it, those that are

1844
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
listening on the podcast, you missed it

1845
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
but all the money will be donated to the Red Cross

1846
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
and they

1847
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
are saying in a statement that they

1848
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
recently opened an office in Tokyo

1849
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and while the Japan based employees are safe

1850
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and uninjured, we understand countless

1851
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
others in Japan need food, shelter

1852
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
and medical attention, given that Plants vs.

1853
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Zombies reached number one on the iPhone and iPad

1854
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
sales charts in Japan, it seemed like

1855
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
the most appropriate game to feature in the

1856
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
fundraising campaign, so if you don't already

1857
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
own the game, now is the perfect

1858
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
excuse to get it, so very cool

1859
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Also

1860
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
just a lot of other things

1861
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
games purchased on Direct2

1862
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Drive, the company will donate a dollar

1863
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
each game to Disaster Relief

1864
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Bungie is currently selling

1865
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
a little band, the little

1866
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
armbands that kind of remind me of the

1867
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Livestrong, I'm sure everybody has seen those, these blue

1868
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
ones, Japan Quake Relief

1869
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
2011, those proceeds go

1870
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
directly to the Red Cross

1871
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Also, I don't know if you guys saw this, if you

1872
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
logged into the Playstation at all

1873
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
there is a link right in the

1874
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Playstation store that I think also

1875
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
comes up in the What's New, you can just

1876
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
donate money right from your

1877
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Playstation, very similar to what they got

1878
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
going on in iTunes right now, so you can just

1879
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
donate right the funds that are in the Playstation

1880
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
wallet, or just donate through the

1881
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Playstation, so if you

1882
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
don't know how else to donate, that's

1883
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
one way you can do it, and there you go

1884
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So

1885
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Awesome, and that's not even all of

1886
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
them, there's lots of other great things going on out

1887
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
there in the gaming world of people

1888
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
donating money, and you know, as I said

1889
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
last week, please, anybody

1890
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
if you listen to this show

1891
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I really think in lieu of giving us

1892
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
money, which we don't ever ask you for

1893
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
really would hope you would donate what you

1894
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
can to the relief efforts going on

1895
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
in Japan, and even if you're like

1896
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I don't have any money, I've got zero cents

1897
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
donate time

1898
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
would even be helpful at this point, the Red

1899
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Cross can use help all over

1900
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
during this very unfortunate

1901
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
time. Alright

1902
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
let's take a minute to switch gears

1903
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
here and take a trip down memory lane

1904
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
in a segment we do here on the show every week

1905
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
called the Classic Game of the

1906
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Week, Dark Sakura's gonna step

1907
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
into the vault and find a game that she just

1908
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
loves more than anything

1909
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
in the world, and say

1910
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
kids, you better be playing this game this week

1911
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
or I'm gonna beat you up

1912
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1913
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I

1914
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
well I apparently love a lot of games

1915
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
then if that's the story

1916
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the game of the week is

1917
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Strider 2

1918
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
or known as Strider Here U2

1919
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
which is the

1920
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
official sequel to

1921
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
the first Strider game

1922
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
and I'm bringing up a

1923
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
YouTube right now, sorry I'm a little delayed here

1924
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
but here you go

1925
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
here's a little bit of the

1926
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
gameplay

1927
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:17,000
the music too, the music's pretty good

1928
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
actually I really like the first level of the music

1929
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
anyway

1930
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
it really is

1931
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
not a sequel to

1932
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
the NES one, I'm just saying

1933
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
because the NES one is actually a retelling

1934
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
of the manga

1935
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
the Strider 2 the manga

1936
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
so this one

1937
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
is basically set 2000 years

1938
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
after the events of the original game

1939
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
and

1940
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
the Grand Master has returned to life

1941
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
and so has Strider Here U

1942
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
so

1943
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
he's going through different levels

1944
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
it's actually 2D sprites

1945
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
over 3D backgrounds

1946
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
but it's the same as the original

1947
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
it pretty much plays the same

1948
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
you've got three action buttons

1949
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
he has all of his

1950
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
old moves like walking, jumping, crouching

1951
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
sliding, climbing walls and ceilings

1952
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
and he's got a dash

1953
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
now by pressing

1954
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
left or right twice

1955
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
and a double jump, basically you press jump

1956
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
in midair and a backwards somersault done while sliding

1957
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
and then he can

1958
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
do a thrust jump off of a wall

1959
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
if he's holding onto a wall

1960
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and he's got like

1961
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
extra slash moves

1962
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
and all kinds of different moves, he's got like a boost

1963
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
if he's got a boost item

1964
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
so he can shoot, you know

1965
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
out of his plasma, out of his cypher

1966
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
so it's pretty cool

1967
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and this one actually has a few

1968
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
throwbacks as far as health

1969
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
you know, replenishments

1970
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
you can extend your life bar

1971
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
you have a cypher extension, other boosts

1972
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
and then you can get

1973
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
different things

1974
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
in the game, you can get the

1975
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Yasuchi and the Sakji symbol

1976
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
from Vulgus and the Zenny coins from

1977
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Black Tiger and Forgotten Worlds, I love that game

1978
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
anyway

1979
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
so you've got five stages

1980
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
each of them

1981
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
gives you a little breakdown beforehand

1982
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
we have an appearance of

1983
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Tonpuu in here, cause she was so cool

1984
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and

1985
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
it was

1986
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
it was pretty awesome

1987
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
you've got the first three

1988
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
on Earth, Hong Kong, Germany

1989
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
and Antarctica

1990
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and that was Hong Kong, of course the one that

1991
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Tonpuu is in, and then the last two

1992
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
are in space, you have the flying

1993
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
battleship Balrog and

1994
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Third Moon, which are both

1995
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
locations in the original game

1996
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
the home version did come out

1997
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
in 2000 on the Playstation

1998
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
and I've got both

1999
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
versions, I believe, the Japanese and the US

2000
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
one

2001
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
it actually comes with two discs

2002
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
on the first disc is Strider 2

2003
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
and the second disc is the original

2004
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
coin-op version of Strider

2005
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
so that's pretty neat

2006
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
but a labeling error on the American one has

2007
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
both discs labeled as Strider

2008
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
so we used to have to guess

2009
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
so if you finish the games and

2010
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
do all the achievements on the same memory card

2011
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
you get a secret level called Strider 2

2012
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Mission Zero, it's a waterfall stage

2013
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and then if you

2014
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
complete all of the missions you get

2015
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Strider Hyun as

2016
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
a playable character

2017
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
he has two cyphers and is pretty hardcore

2018
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
and awesome

2019
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and that is actually my favorite person

2020
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
to play through the damn game with is

2021
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
just like, I've got two of these suckers

2022
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
and I'm bad

2023
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and he like, I think he can throw one like a boomerang

2024
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
if I'm right

2025
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
anyway, um, so yeah

2026
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
really really hot, this was

2027
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I mean, the game is

2028
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
really cool, it's kind of, if you

2029
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
if you're, I guess a veteran of it

2030
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
then it might seem like it's

2031
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
a little short and a little

2032
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
huh? but there was so much

2033
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
coolness in it that it's just a

2034
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
fun game, I mean I could sit down and

2035
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
play through it in a couple hours, it's just a

2036
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
fun game, so

2037
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
that is my game of the week

2038
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Strider 2

2039
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
alright, good time

2040
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Strider 2

2041
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
the arcade game

2042
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
also on the Playstation 1

2043
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
classic video game of the week

2044
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
hardcore

2045
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
okay chat room, why are you

2046
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
bothering with Deadpool?

2047
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
there's 50 million

2048
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Deadpool titles out, ugh

2049
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Deadpool's jumped the shark

2050
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm sorry, he's only good at Marvel vs Capcom 3

2051
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
really?

2052
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
not a fan anymore, huh?

2053
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
no, okay, I love the character

2054
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and I think he was fine in

2055
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Cable and Deadpool

2056
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
great series, and then they ended it

2057
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but now Deadpool's in like

2058
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
eight titles, seriously?

2059
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I think it's eight

2060
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
and it's like, dude, too much Deadpool

2061
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
too much of a funny thing

2062
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
is annoying, sorry

2063
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Strider 2, awesome game, go play it

2064
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and underappreciated

2065
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
highly underappreciated

2066
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
alright, well we're going to take a quick break guys

2067
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
we'll be back with more of Orange Launch Radio

2068
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
we have some rapid fire news tonight

2069
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
of course Twitter topics is your last chance to get those in

2070
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
at twitter.com slash OLR

2071
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
get those in right now so we can read them in a little bit

2072
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
we're going to talk a little more about the censorship

2073
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
of Mortal Kombat in Australia

2074
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
we'll talk about some legal battles and

2075
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
a possible sequel to the King of Kong movie

2076
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
maybe?

2077
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
yep, it might be happening

2078
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
so we'll talk about that when we come back in just a little bit

2079
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2080
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000

we're about to get into the twitter topics

01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but first, some rapid fire news

2087
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
until we plug the side projects

2088
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000

2089
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000

2090
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
DarkSakura, you have another little podcast you do?

at the end of part A, this is a rant you'll hear

2093
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
all the time on the show

2094
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000

01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
hanging from your shoe, nevermind it's your shoelace

2101
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
well that has happened, yes

2102
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000

so you'll just have to tune in and listen

2111
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
but we go live every Tuesday

2112
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
awesome

2113
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
if you enjoy the World of Warcraft

2114
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
or even if you don't, you just like to hear people talk

2115
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
about it and tell dick and fart jokes along the way

2116
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
you should definitely check out

2117
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth, it's a show that

2118
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Extfer and I do all about World of Warcraft

2119
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
brand new website just launched today

2120
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000

2121
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
for all the information, H-O-R-D-E

2122
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
H-O-U-S-E, for all the information

2123
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and you can download it right there

2124
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
alright, there you go

2125
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
so let's get into some rapid fire news

2126
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
quick news stories about what is going on

2127
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
in the gaming world that we just don't have a lot of time for

2128
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
otherwise, Loki

2129
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
if you're in the UK, you'll be treated

2130
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
to some little big Planet 2

2131
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
download content coming in May

2132
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
this is kind of a little bit different than the normal stuff

2133
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
that they put out, they're actually doing

2134
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
what they call a teacher pack

2135
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and it's being developed by Media Molecule

2136
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it's to be packed with demonstrations

2137
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
of the national

2138
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
curriculum and it's based

2139
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
in game levels that other

2140
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
teachers have made

2141
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
and I guess this pack will also feature

2142
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Playstation Move functionality as well

2143
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
which is pretty cool

2144
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
you know, I didn't get to play

2145
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Little Big Planet when I was

2146
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
in school, well

2147
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
all we had was these kids today

2148
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Number Munchers and

2149
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
DDR machines in their PE classrooms

2150
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
and now Little

2151
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Big Planet teaching a history

2152
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
you should grow up on Number Munchers

2153
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and Oregon Trail

2154
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
like we did

2155
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
and then of course

2156
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
this is kind of neat

2157
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
more download content coming

2158
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000

this new

2160
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I guess, pack is called the

2161
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Indie Hip Hop Mix Pack

2162
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000

and then of course some more music

2190
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
game download content

2191
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Dance Central getting some more

2192
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
tracks

2193
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
not as much as I was hoping, you know, be put out by

2194
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Harmonix but I guess maybe it takes a little longer

2195
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
to get some dance routines put out

2196
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Fat Boy Slim Weapon of Choice

2197
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
awesome song

2198
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Gwen Stefani with Hollaback Girl

2199
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Carrie Hilston

2200
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
with Turning Me On

2201
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
and Paula Abdul with Straight Up

2202
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
those are available for $3 per track

2203
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
or 240 Microsoft points

2204
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
that's a lot of

2205
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
download content there

2206
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
it's good to see that game is still getting supported with

2207
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
download content, better support than a lot of games

2208
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I haven't gotten to play it in a long time

2209
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
but I really want to go back to it

2210
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
oh, that was another thing, I forgot to mention

2211
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
a really late part of my game week

2212
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I played U-Star 2

2213
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
what the hell's that?

2214
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
U-Star is like

2215
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
karaoke for movie scenes, you read

2216
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
lines and it puts you

2217
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
into the movie like a green screen

2218
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
that sounds horrible, actually it sounds like

2219
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
something I've seen at Disney's California

2220
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Adventure, where you can like

2221
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
it's set up like Ursula from

2222
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
the Little Mermaids

2223
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
and you can reenact scenes

2224
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
over where Turtle Talk with Crush is

2225
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
that whole thing, yep, you can reenact scenes from

2226
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
your favorite movies

2227
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
it is a terrible game

2228
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
the interface is just absolutely terrible

2229
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
oh my god, my co-worker though

2230
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
was doing lines from like

2231
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
300 and stuff like that

2232
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
and

2233
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
THIS IS CAKETOWN

2234
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and just the way he was doing it

2235
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
though, it was like

2236
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Igor from

2237
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Frankenstein or something like that

2238
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
and just this really weird voice

2239
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
he did the whole thing

2240
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
it was hilarious, and the game has

2241
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
the worst framing ever

2242
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
we had the camera set up on a table

2243
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
and it would zoom in or zoom

2244
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
out too much

2245
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
depending on the scene, so there's

2246
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
one scene that you could do, it was kind of

2247
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
an ad-lib thing, it was like the moon

2248
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
or something, like moon surface, and all it had

2249
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
was his head

2250
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
his head was on the screen

2251
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
it's a terrible game

2252
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
it's funny, it sounds like something you'd buy

2253
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
for like one night of LOLs and then it's over

2254
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I'll probably wait for it to drop in price

2255
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
it is pretty funny though, for like a drunken party game

2256
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
ok, there you go

2257
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
some other quickfire news here

2258
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Red Faction Battlegrounds has a release date

2259
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
it's going to be April 5th

2260
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
and it will be out for $9.99

2261
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
on the Playstation

2262
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
that's also 800 Microsoft Points

2263
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
but here's the thing, if you're in the Playstation Plus

2264
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
thing, before March 25th

2265
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
so this week

2266
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
you can get the game for FREE

2267
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
so this is more incentive for you to sign up

2268
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
for the Playstation Plus membership, free stuff

2269
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
so yeah, that's Red Faction Battlegrounds

2270
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
also, I found this kind of interesting

2271
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
GameStop is now selling

2272
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
500GB Playstation 3s

2273
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
but they don't really make

2274
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
500GB Playstation 3s, so how do they do it?

2275
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
well, it's a refurbished deal

2276
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
they sell refurbished Playstation 3s

2277
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and they call them premium

2278
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
refurbished Playstation 3s supercharged

2279
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
they come with a 500GB

2280
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Western Digital Scorpio Blue

2281
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
hard drive

2282
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
and a bunch of peripherals and things come with it too

2283
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
so here's the deal

2284
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
you can buy one of these for $400

2285
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
it comes with a Playstation 3 slim

2286
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
with the new hard drive

2287
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
a special supercharged console skin

2288
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
that reminds you how awesome GameStop is

2289
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
for getting this for you

2290
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
a one year warranty on it

2291
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and then I guess a media hub with a remote

2292
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
increasing the number of USB slots

2293
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
also an HDMI cable

2294
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
so

2295
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I gotta say, it's an interesting

2296
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
little spin on the whole

2297
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
used game stuff

2298
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
there's some people that really like to shop around

2299
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
for used only things to get a deal on it

2300
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and even though I don't necessarily

2301
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
know if you're getting a deal with this

2302
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
you are getting a lot of

2303
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
extra stuff that a lot of people

2304
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
kinda have to buy anyway

2305
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
like the HDMI cable and so forth

2306
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I don't know guys, I have an 80GB

2307
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
hard drive on my Playstation 3

2308
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and I still haven't hit the limit yet, knock on wood

2309
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
but I also don't download a lot of movies

2310
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I'm not Spazinator, Spazinator calls in every week

2311
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
talking about some video he's downloaded

2312
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
like I don't have that many movies

2313
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I have a 500GB hard drive in mine

2314
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
do you really, but you redid it yourself right?

2315
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
yeah I did it myself because I had 20 in there

2316
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
oh my gosh, yeah

2317
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I can see

2318
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
mine's only 80, I haven't filled it up yet, knock on wood

2319
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
um

2320
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
yeah I guess if you're

2321
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
used to paying a lot of money for

2322
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
HDMI cables it's a good deal

2323
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but

2324
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
it's an interesting way

2325
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
to make the used Playstation 3

2326
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
business kinda interesting

2327
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
like it's kinda creative

2328
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
to just get the hard drive and put the new ones

2329
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
in there at the GameStop level

2330
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
well I think also too, and I'm not sure

2331
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
if GameStop have this problem, but

2332
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Sony was oh so wonderful

2333
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
and decided, hey you know what

2334
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
we're having shortages on the old systems

2335
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
so

2336
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
you place a bunch of orders for it and they don't come in forever

2337
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and then oh hey we're gonna

2338
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
we're gonna send a bunch of them to you

2339
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
you get them, oh by the way we're releasing

2340
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
new SKU, suckas

2341
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and so you're left with a bunch of systems that

2342
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
oh by the way we didn't price protect those so

2343
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
they're gonna come out at the same price and you're

2344
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
stuck with these old systems that nobody wants

2345
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
haha suckers, so

2346
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
if they did that to GameStop

2347
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
which is very unlikely because they're GameStop

2348
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but let's just for all

2349
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
you know sakes and purposes

2350
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
say they did, and

2351
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
what are they gonna do with all these old systems? Well they can buy

2352
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
a bunch of hard drives for cheap, upgrade them

2353
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
sell off

2354
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
the old hard drives I guess if they want to

2355
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
and sell them

2356
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
for a premium and make money

2357
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
off the system and the accessories

2358
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
bundle with it

2359
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and it becomes a unique

2360
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
item for them because there are no 500

2361
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
gigabyte PS3s

2362
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Togak in our chat room is commenting on the size

2363
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
of your hard drive saying that's a lot of porn Loki

2364
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
no no no

2365
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I stream my porn, that was actually for

2366
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
for rips

2367
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
of games but I

2368
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
my system's all legit now

2369
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I unmodified it because

2370
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I want to play MotorStorm

2371
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and

2372
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
you know it's just

2373
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
it was the right thing to do

2374
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
whatever, once again remember we

2375
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
got into it a couple weeks ago

2376
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
about how there wasn't really

2377
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
much I wanted to play on there, well MotorStorm was

2378
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
one of the games I wanted to play but

2379
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I'm not missing much

2380
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
or anything

2381
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Alright one more story I've got, we'll go over to

2382
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Jamie, this is about a Wipeout

2383
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Kinect game and you might

2384
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
be kind of looking going wait a minute I thought

2385
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Wipeout was a Sony franchise, why is it coming out

2386
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
on the Kinect? Because it's not that

2387
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Wipeout, no no we're talking about the

2388
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
ABC reality show that

2389
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
is kind of like a Japanese game

2390
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
show I guess for American audiences it's

2391
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Wipeout the game show

2392
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
it has a Kinect game coming out

2393
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
this summer

2394
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
you might remember this game was already

2395
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
released on the Wii and the DS

2396
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I'm sure it was pretty terrible

2397
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
now they talk about how there

2398
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
are infamous big balls

2399
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
and I assume they're not talking about genitalia

2400
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
but these actual giant balls that people bounce

2401
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I've never watched this show it just looks

2402
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
idiotic to me but I guess

2403
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
a lot of people really like it but people bounce

2404
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
on giant balls like it's a pinball machine

2405
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
or something so this game

2406
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Wipeout will have more than 30 obstacles

2407
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
you will run, duck

2408
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
dodge and of course Wipeout

2409
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
and they go on

2410
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
this quote about everyone who watches the show

2411
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
wishes they could try the obstacle course and now

2412
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
this is their chance!

2413
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Is it like Takeshi's Castle?

2414
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
It's sort of like Takeshi's Castle but

2415
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
like really dumbed down. Kind of what I get from

2416
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
looking at it yeah but I've never

2417
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
and like I'm a reality TV

2418
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
whore okay I watch a lot of crap

2419
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
that I deservingly

2420
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
deserve to be made fun of for watching

2421
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
like Big Brother come on

2422
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
but I don't watch Wipeout

2423
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
like I'm not going to stoop that low

2424
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Well remember how they like it's basically

2425
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it took all these Japanese game shows and just

2426
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
gutted the soul out of them

2427
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
like that show

2428
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Hole in the Wall the one that was the funny Japanese

2429
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
game show that was a segment on Ellen

2430
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
and that's where it should have stayed like

2431
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
it's funny for two minutes and that's it

2432
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
no it was actually well it may have been a segment

2433
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
but it was originally a Japanese game show

2434
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
and you know

2435
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
that's funny because they're just

2436
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
playing it for fun they're not doing it for prizes

2437
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
but you know of course us

2438
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Americans don't want to watch anything that's for

2439
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
fun it's got to be for money

2440
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
because who cares about fun

2441
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so they

2442
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
had that and then they totally like fucked it up

2443
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
they just it's like

2444
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
it's just like you know American Iron Chef

2445
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
you know they just

2446
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
gutted all the soul of that show

2447
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
out of it and then the

2448
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
it's Iron Chef at least it has Alton Brown

2449
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it does have Alton Brown

2450
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and at least it wasn't as terrible as the original

2451
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
American Iron Chef although William Shatner

2452
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
hosting

2453
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I don't hate that I think he

2454
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
would be just as over the top as Chairman Kaga

2455
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
exactly he would be just as over the top

2456
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
but this like fictional cousin

2457
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
or something like that is retarded

2458
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
now he's on a hideous

2459
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
TV

2460
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
sitcom on CVS

2461
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
based off a Twitter account

2462
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
what?

2463
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
oh yeah William Shatner he's been on a show for like a year called

2464
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
TJ Hooker

2465
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Shit My Dad Says

2466
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
you know I've actually thought about starting

2467
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
a Twitter account for Shit My

2468
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Wife Asked Me About

2469
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
might be kind of long

2470
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
it's just weird

2471
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
there's some funny stuff like

2472
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
what was it the other day she was

2473
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I'm trying to remember one of the questions because it was just like

2474
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
really? that's so weird

2475
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
um

2476
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
oh I don't even remember now

2477
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it was so strange

2478
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
it was funnier in your head wasn't it?

2479
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
it was funnier in my head

2480
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
no but I do say funny stuff now to her and then she

2481
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
posts it on Facebook like she was asking me about

2482
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
so how do you spell

2483
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
how do you spell desert?

2484
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
or was it dessert or something like that I'm like

2485
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
well the way you remember it is

2486
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you know you want more dessert than you want desert

2487
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
so you know

2488
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
dessert has two S's and desert has one

2489
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
so what about the desert something

2490
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I'm like and what if you need to spell

2491
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
deseret because you're a Mormon

2492
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and so I'm like

2493
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
listen that's the way I learned how to spell

2494
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
um desert

2495
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
so if you don't like it you can

2496
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
shut the hell up

2497
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
or you can go to hell

2498
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
so she wrote that on Facebook

2499
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
good times

2500
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but she asked me weird shit all the time

2501
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
like all these

2502
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
random questions about things

2503
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
it's the job of a wife to ask her husband

2504
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
really bizarre things

2505
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
what are some of the bizarre things you asked Dan?

2506
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Dan!

2507
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
what's the bizarre stuff I ask you?

2508
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
he says he doesn't know

2509
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
she keeps asking me questions about mythological creatures

2510
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
and stuff she's like

2511
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you know what's this look like? I'm like I don't know

2512
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
stupid thingy

2513
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
it's just something

2514
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that happens

2515
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
is that something that happens like when you get married

2516
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
because like you know

2517
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Alan doesn't really ask me stupid shit

2518
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
it's no

2519
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
it's like if you've got

2520
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
someone who's got a really kind of

2521
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
wandering mind

2522
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
every so often the weirdest questions will pop up

2523
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and when you hit that comfort level

2524
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
they'll just ask you

2525
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
like

2526
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and typically it tends to be

2527
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I've noticed the wife

2528
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
or the girlfriend

2529
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
or

2530
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I guess

2531
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and every so often

2532
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
just the most random questions but because I feel

2533
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
so comfortable around my husband

2534
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I'll just blurt them on out

2535
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
like you know

2536
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I don't know

2537
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
it just occurs to me

2538
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
this whole thing was funnier in your guys'

2539
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
head like it seems like a big in-joke or something

2540
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
but thank god I'm not a lesbian

2541
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I wonder how it would be

2542
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
amongst lesbians

2543
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
if they would both annoy the crap out of each other

2544
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
with annoying questions

2545
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I think it's just written into the

2546
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
female chromosome

2547
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
alright let's move on

2548
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
speaking of the female chromosome

01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000

2574

I don't know Billy Joel was like kind of one of those things

2575
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
that was better left in the movies

2576
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
if it's a piano pack why don't they freakin put

2577
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000

2578
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000

01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
yeah this might be like a second time

2582
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
that's how much I like Billy Joel I didn't look

2583
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000

2584
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000

2585
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000

2586
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000

2592
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
yay cause they're climbing in your video games

2593
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
playing your guitars

2594
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
playing your bass

2595
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
and playing your keyboards

2596
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
cause they're playing everyone out there

2597
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
and it's the long version

2598
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
god I fucking hope they put

2599
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Friday out next

2600
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
you know what

2601
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told

2602
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
our friend Melody

2603
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
do not buy that song on iTunes

2604
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
too late

2605
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I really wanted her to reach

2606
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
number one cause it would be funny

2607
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I've lost all respect

2608
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
well pfft

2609
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
this is the reason why?

2610
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
because

2611
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
no talent rich kids

2612
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
do not need the dollar that is

2613
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
better spent on Jolly Ranchers

2614
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
the end

2615
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'm on a diet

2616
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
yeah

2617
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
you want a girl scout cookie?

2618
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
you know what I've got some

2619
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I don't want to get it

2620
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
don't blame a little girl with a dream

2621
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
blame the music production company

2622
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
it's the same thing I said when the music

2623
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
could have been a dollar closer to getting

2624
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
that music production company to make you a song

2625
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I know

2626
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
this girl

2627
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'm just jealous cause I don't have a song

2628
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
she's way auto tuned and you can tell

2629
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
she can't sing

2630
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
she did, they interviewed her on

2631
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Good Morning America and they made her sing a few bars

2632
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
of America the Beautiful

2633
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
was she the best singer I've ever heard? no

2634
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
but was she talented?

2635
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
she's 13!

2636
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
anyway why are we arguing about this?

2637
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm not talented and I can't sing

2638
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
why is this guy famous?

2639
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
would you pay this guy a dollar to play this song

2640
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
on a rock band?

2641
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
cause this one's funny

2642
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
well Friday's funny

2643
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Friday's just sad

2644
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
it's only funny with the video, with the girl with the braces

2645
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I would pay a dollar to pay

2646
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
or to play

2647
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Night Man

2648
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
from It's Always Sunny

2649
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
alright anyhow

2650
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
got a man coming in and raping

2651
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
somebody? is that it or is there another one?

2652
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
no there's another one

2653
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Marvel Vs. Capcom 3

2654
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Shuma Gorath

2655
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
and Jill Download Content

2656
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
are...

2657
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Shuma Gorath

2658
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
downloadable content

2659
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
is delayed

2660
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
it was gonna be 400 Microsoft points

2661
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
which is 5 bucks each

2662
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
but now they don't really know why

2663
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it was gonna be out on March 15th

2664
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
but it's been pushed back

2665
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I don't know when, but it's pushed back

2666
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
which is no great loss because it's crap Jill

2667
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and not fun Jill

2668
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
how does one delay something that's already on the disk?

2669
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
yeah, I don't know

2670
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
that's a very good question actually

2671
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I forgot where the key was

2672
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
to unlock this

2673
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000

2674
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000

2675
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
ah down the drain

2676
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
got to get a string and a magnet

2677
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I don't know why that's really funny

2678
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
but I'm just imagining Capcom

2679
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
putting out this press release

2680
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000

01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
let me turn down the little song there

2697
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
in the background

2698
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Defective Candy is sending us a tweet about

2699
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Augmented Reality makes the 3DS bigger than Gigantor

2700
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
what is this?

2701
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
this is a link from

2702
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Candinator

2703
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
sending us this story here

2704
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
about the 3DS had launched some time ago

2705
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
and

2706
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
let's see

2707
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it's about, you have to remember

2708
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I'm reading these for the first time thanks to Twitter

2709
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I guess it has to do with the AR tech

2710
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
oh I see

2711
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
some folks have made a super sized version

2712
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
of the 3DS pack-in Augmented Reality

2713
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
card all for the sake of

2714
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
giving Kobe's Lonely Lifesize

2715
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Tetsujin 28 Ghost statue some company

2716
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
and as you see in the video below

2717
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
he does need a friend, it may well be a me

2718
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I gotta see this video, what is going on

2719
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
oh I see they have this big statue that they did

2720
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
oh

2721
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I see, so what they did

2722
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
instead of having the guy

2723
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
stand on the mat to take the picture

2724
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
they got this gigantic version

2725
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
of it to put the statue on

2726
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I see what they did

2727
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
they took the little pack-in Augmented Reality

2728
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
thing, put it under the statue

2729
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
dude

2730
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
and now he's

2731
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
in the 3DS Augmented Reality game

2732
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
haha

2733
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
it's kind of funny I like that

2734
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
sorry that probably made for terrible radio

2735
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
but hey you tweeted it, alright moving on

2736
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
to another Twitter from SilverSonic1534

2737
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
sending us another

2738
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
really good story about helping

2739
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the folks out in Japan for the

2740
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
disaster relief, a rare

2741
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Nintendo DS it was signed by a bunch of Nintendo

2742
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
veterans and it was auctioned off

2743
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
this week, let's see

2744
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
it was a

2745
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Mario Kart DS promo

2746
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
system and it was signed by

2747
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Miyamoto, Koji Kondo

2748
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
the Zelda chief, Eiji

2749
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Onomura, Charles Martinet

2750
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Martin Lung who does the piano

2751
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
stuff for Video Games

2752
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Live

2753
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
all of that was autographed

2754
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
by all those people and they sold

2755
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
it, I'm not sure exactly how much they

2756
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
went for, let me look, let me see on eBay real quick

2757
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
ooh it hasn't sold

2758
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
yet, it's got 16 hours left

2759
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
$2,500

2760
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
sorry $2,550

2761
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
$2,550

2762
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
is what it's at right now

2763
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
so if you want to check that out

2764
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
more tweets coming at us

2765
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
from TigerClaw

2766
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
PSP based Augmented

2767
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Reality game, what is it with all the

2768
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Augmented Reality games tonight, that's popular

2769
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
that's right yeah, this is

2770
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
turning school into an adventure worth

2771
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
writing about

2772
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
an imaginary worlds project

2773
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
using the system with the AR software

2774
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
you design fantasy landscapes

2775
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
at school by finding art online

2776
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
and matching it with scannable codes that were

2777
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
hidden around the school

2778
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
they then took camera equipped systems around

2779
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
the school and embarked on quests

2780
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
finding items to defeat monsters and writing

2781
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
about the experience afterwards, that actually sounds

2782
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
kind of awesome, I'd like to see something like that

2783
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
on an even bigger scale

2784
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I don't know, like Amazing Race

2785
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
but for real

2786
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
anyhow, Amazingly Real Race

2787
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Amazingly Real Race on PSP

2788
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
apparently the program went over

2789
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
very well, very enthusiastic response to that

2790
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
the kids were well behaved

2791
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and cooperated when they took part

2792
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
kind of neat, I like that idea

2793
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
remember

2794
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I don't know why, but you know what this reminds you

2795
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
remember when you were in grade

2796
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
school and you'd go on a tour of a

2797
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
historical building, you'd have to put on those

2798
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
big headphones and as you walked

2799
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
under certain places you would hear the

2800
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
stuff in the headphones, like it was all based off radios

2801
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
well imagine now

2802
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
if you could use these augmented reality devices

2803
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
to scan in the certain codes at places

2804
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and you would read a little bit about what it is

2805
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
you know, you're at, or what the importance

2806
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
of the location is, I don't know, so this reminds

2807
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
me of to some extent, I can see that

2808
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
kind of neat, anyhow

2809
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
one other tweet here from TigerClaw

2810
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
AMD has made a statement

2811
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
that DirectX is holding back the graphics

2812
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
performance on the PC

2813
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
links us to a story from Gamasutra here

2814
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
via our Twitter

2815
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
a quote here from

2816
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
AMD

2817
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
GPU division worldwide developer

2818
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
relations manager Richard Huddy

2819
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
quote, it's funny, we often have at least

2820
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
ten times as much horsepower as an

2821
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Xbox 360 or a Playstation 3

2822
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
in a high end graphics card

2823
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
yet it's very clear that the games don't

2824
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
look ten times as good

2825
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
to a significant extent, that's because

2826
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
one way or another, for good reasons and bad

2827
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
mostly good, DirectX is getting in the way

2828
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
so

2829
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
so mostly good, but

2830
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
yeah, but I guess maybe that's because

2831
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
I'm gonna bitch about something, it's mostly

2832
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
for the good of the game, but

2833
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
but we can't do it

2834
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
isn't the Xbox 360 all based off

2835
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
a version of that? I mean wasn't the original name of the

2836
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Xbox the direct Xbox?

2837
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
no, that's stupid

2838
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I thought that's where this whole thing came from

2839
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
no, it's basically

2840
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
the Xbox 360

2841
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
like the Xbox 360

2842
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
is running on a modified version of

2843
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
DirectX 9 that has some of the

2844
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
features of DirectX 10 in it

2845
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
but

2846
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
it's basically DirectX 9

2847
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
alright

2848
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and one more tweet here from

2849
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
gamergirl saying, which do you think is better

2850
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Torchlight PC version or Torchlight

2851
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Xbox Live version

2852
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and what do you find fun about the game as a whole?

2853
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I would say the PC version

2854
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
is much better and the reason for that is

2855
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that they tried to cram too much into the Xbox

2856
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Live one and unfortunately it suffers

2857
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
from some frame rate issues and just a really

2858
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
awkward interface, I mean

2859
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
for a dungeon crawler, collect a bunch of items

2860
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
games, it doesn't work

2861
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
too well on Xbox, I mean if for whatever

2862
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
reason you hate gaming on the PC

2863
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
then the Xbox is an okay substitute

2864
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I've played far worse games on

2865
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Xbox Live, but I just think between the two, the PC

2866
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
version is superior. What do I like about the

2867
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
game? Well, did you ever play Diablo

2868
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
2? Because if you like that, that's why

2869
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
I like Torchlight, because it's like a newer version

2870
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
of that, but otherwise I like the fact

2871
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
that the dungeons are always randomly generated

2872
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and there's something about that exploring

2873
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
and collecting, you know, kind of like

2874
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
that slow grind of improving your character

2875
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
and completing quests, kind of like

2876
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
a little bit like an RPG but with

2877
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
much more action in it, I think that's

2878
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
kind of what draws me to the game is that, you know, there's

2879
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
definitely that exploration and you can't

2880
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
really spoil it, like there can't be a strategy

2881
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
guide for how to explore level

2882
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
3, because level 3 is always different

2883
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
it's random for each person that plays it

2884
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
and I think that's part of the charm of it

2885
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Alright, I'm letting in one more tweet

2886
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
here from SSJ100Matt saying

2887
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Someone took My Little Pony

2888
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
and mixed it with the Starcraft 2

2889
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
trailer and sends us a link to

2890
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
something on YouTube called Ponycraft

2891
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm not sure what to do

2892
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
This is not My Little Pony

2893
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It's like Noose. Did they redo My Little Pony

2894
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
a couple of years ago or something?

2895
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
They might have

2896
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
This is not the one from the games

2897
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
That's really not going to make

2898
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
sense to me at most

2899
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Yeah, it's like a new My Little Pony

2900
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Might have a lot of vengeance

2901
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Somebody has far too much time

2902
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
on their hands, that's all I'm going to say

2903
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Whatever, if that's the

2904
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
project you want to be famous for, then cool

2905
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Alright, that's pretty hilarious

2906
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
It's interesting

2907
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I've seen weirder things on YouTube, I guess

2908
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Nuclear Boy

2909
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I have not seen Nuclear Boy

2910
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And what is, ok

2911
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
It's a great way to describe it to children

2912
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And I'm not up to date on all my

2913
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
astrological stuff that's going on right now

2914
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
or astronomical, I guess

2915
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Yeah, astronomical

2916
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
But what the fuck is the super moon that they keep

2917
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
seeing fucking tweets about and shit

2918
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Something about the moon being closer in orbit

2919
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I believe

2920
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
It was supposed to be gigantic in the sky last night

2921
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
but we wouldn't know because it's been raining

2922
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
for like nine fucking days straight here

2923
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
so the clouds have been blocking the sky

2924
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
So you missed something, but you didn't

2925
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You would have had to drive that way

2926
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
There's a picture of it

2927
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
from Washington, DC

2928
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
The super moon

2929
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
See, there it is big

2930
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Oh, that's dumb

2931
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
That's not big at all

2932
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
But the moon's really big, Loki

2933
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's a super moon

2934
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And since it's over Los Angeles

2935
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
it's orange with a big rip across it

2936
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
like an Evangelion or something

2937
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Seriously

2938
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Now I can see that

2939
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Alright, let's move on

2940
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Twitter topics are done, so back into the news

2941
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Loki, what have you got for us

2942
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Yeah, so

2943
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Super moon

2944
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
This has been kind of a thing

2945
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
that's been going on with Australia for the

2946
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
longest time

2947
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Take violent game, ban it

2948
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
because hey, you know what, we don't have anything

2949
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
that's, you know, for adults

2950
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So, too bad

2951
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So apparently, Mortal Kombat

2952
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
they appealed

2953
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
the

2954
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
failure to rate

2955
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
the game

2956
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
because it was not classified as

2957
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
R15, and instead

2958
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
their appeal was rejected

2959
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So, now

2960
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
unless changes are

2961
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
made, they cannot release it in

2962
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Australia

2963
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
So that kind of sucks

2964
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And it will ban the title from

2965
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
official retail distribution

2966
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
And, of course

2967
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
One of our other games is Extremely

2968
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Disappointed

2969
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
That's always the comment, we're extremely disappointed

2970
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I'd be like, we're fucking pissed

2971
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That would be my fucking press statement

2972
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
right there, fuck them in their asses

2973
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
We're pissed

2974
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And they were

2975
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
saying, praising thousands

2976
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
of Mortal Kombat fans in Australia

2977
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
and around the world who have voiced their support

2978
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
during the appeal process

2979
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

2980
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Really? Are you surprised?

2981
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I mean, they banned games with lesser

2982
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
crap in there

2983
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Not to say that this will always

2984
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
be the case, in fact, they're actually

2985
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
pressing the

2986
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I guess the Australian

2987
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
federal government

2988
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
They're hoping to have

2989
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
a consensus on the R18

2990
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
game rating creation

2991
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Which is stupid

2992
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
This is all government run anyways

2993
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But, whatever

2994
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Of course

2995
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
The

2996
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
MA-15 Plus

2997
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
that the

2998
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
country already has for mature games

2999
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
is not good enough for

3000
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
some of these, so adding the

3001
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
restricted R18 Plus rating

3002
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
will allow them to release some of these

3003
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
more mature games

3004
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
into the country

3005
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
They said

3006
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I foreshadow that there is

3007
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
if there's not consensus around

3008
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
this issue, the Commonwealth will certainly

3009
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
be considering other options because we

3010
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
cannot continue to have an outdated

3011
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
classification system that's actually

3012
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
in my view, causing harm to young people

3013
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
It just seems, I mean, the Saw movies aren't

3014
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
banned there, right? I don't think so

3015
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
What I saw in this game was no worse than Saw

3016
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I mean, I'm always gonna use that

3017
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
as my defense. Those goddamn Saw movies

3018
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
are terrible! Well, I don't understand how they always

3019
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
rate games as, well, it's interactive

3020
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
so it's more violent. No,

3021
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I don't think so. I think it's less

3022
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
violent. If you think about it, I mean

3023
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
the content in these games

3024
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
like, for example

3025
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Grand Theft Auto, you can run people

3026
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
over and they, you know, blood

3027
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
sprays and stuff like that, you can set people on fire

3028
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
all that stuff, but it's nowhere near as graphic

3029
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
as you see it depicted in movies

3030
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I mean,

3031
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
it's just way worse. It's cartoony

3032
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
almost. And I mean

3033
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
really

3034
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
at what age are we gonna, like

3035
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
finally let teenagers

3036
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
you know, be able

3037
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
to decide for themselves what's

3038
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
reality and what's fantasy

3039
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
because if they don't know that a game is

3040
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
not real

3041
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
then there's more, you know, serious

3042
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
problems with them than

3043
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
them playing a violent game

3044
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I'm fine with them taking violence

3045
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
out of video games completely. Like, they could

3046
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
just strip every video game out there of violence

3047
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
as long as we could get ample nudity in its

3048
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
place. That's what I'm saying.

3049
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Let's get some boobs. Nudity is even

3050
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
worse. Like, it's like, oh my god, you know

3051
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
there's a little bit of nudity in this game

3052
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
oh, banned. Oh, but violence, we

3053
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
can, you know, we can

3054
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
drill holes in this guy's head

3055
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
while he's, you know, still alive

3056
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
but as soon as you wanna fuck one of those

3057
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
holes, oh, banned.

3058
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Wow.

3059
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Well, speaking

3060
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
of legal troubles

3061
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
you might remember that Activision

3062
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
had filed a suit against

3063
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Electronic Arts and the former

3064
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
heads of Infinity Ward

3065
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
well, in California, it was ruled this

3066
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
week that the lawsuit filed by

3067
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Activision against the former Infinity Ward

3068
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
studio heads, Vince Zampanella

3069
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
and Jason West, it will be able to

3070
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
proceed. EA wanted to have

3071
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
the case dismissed

3072
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
but unfortunately, the judge

3073
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
felt differently. They decided

3074
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
there is enough evidence that the case can go on to trial.

3075
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
EA's options now

3076
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
at this point, they can still request a summary

3077
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
judgment that way

3078
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
you know, it could all be rejected

3079
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
but if that doesn't happen, then the case can

3080
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
go to trial in May of this year.

3081
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
It's gonna be interesting. Or it will get settled

3082
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
out of court before then because that's what always seems to

3083
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
happen. Has a video game case ever gone to trial?

3084
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Don't they always get settled out of court?

3085
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I don't think I've ever seen one go to trial.

3086
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm talking about one

3087
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
between companies. I'm not talking about

3088
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
some crazed asshole

3089
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
played an Xbox and decided to do something

3090
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
stupid. That's not a true

3091
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
game lawsuit. That's just an idiot doing something

3092
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
idiotic. I'm talking about

3093
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
an actual two companies

3094
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
suing each other. Does it ever not

3095
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
get settled? Because they

3096
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
usually end up having to pay less

3097
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
by not going to court.

3098
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Or at least they have the illusion of this.

3099
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
It's all just a giant game of chicken.

3100
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Chicken!

3101
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Alright.

3102
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
So let's move on, DarkSakura.

3103
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Well.

3104
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Hold on.

3105
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Okay.

3106
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
No, I cannot hold on any longer.

3107
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Because I pulled up the mailbag instead

3108
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
of the story. Oops.

3109
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So,

3110
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I'm sure people remember me having

3111
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
spoken of the King of Kong, right?

3112
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
And it was the

3113
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
video

3114
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
of Steve Weeby and Billy

3115
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Mitchell.

3116
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Mitchell, yes. I'm sorry. He's a jerk.

3117
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Mitchell!

3118
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Trying to compete for the

3119
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
top scorer on Donkey Kong. Well, now

3120
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
we've got a new

3121
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
documentary out called

3122
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Dr. Kong.

3123
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
And this

3124
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
is about

3125
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Dr. Chien, who is a

3126
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
plastic surgeon, who

3127
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
beat Steve Weeby's

3128
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
record, reset record,

3129
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
by hitting

3130
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
1,090,400

3131
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
points on Donkey Kong.

3132
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
So,

3133
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
there actually is a website about it.

3134
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
You can go to

3135
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
DrKongTheMovie.com

3136
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and...

3137
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Can I play the trailer here?

3138
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Play it, sure. It's kind of interesting, actually.

3139
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I don't know why. It's funny.

3140
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Here we go. So we see scenes of the

3141
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
plastic surgery going on.

3142
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Establishing shots of

3143
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
yes, this dude is a surgeon.

3144
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I'm copying this to the chat room, by the way. Sure.

3145
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
And then you see him playing some Donkey Kong.

3146
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And he has a Donkey Kong machine.

3147
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I was feeling one of the people at Twin Galaxies

3148
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
and when he found out I was a plastic surgeon, he was like

3149
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
should you be out getting laid?

3150
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Like, why are you playing Donkey Kong?

3151
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I was like, I'm playing Donkey Kong so I can't get laid.

3152
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Wait a minute.

3153
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
He's playing Donkey Kong

3154
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
so he can't get laid?

3155
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Like, I don't get that. He's a plastic surgeon.

3156
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
He makes girls' boobies bigger all day long.

3157
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
That's what plastic surgeons do, right?

3158
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
All they do is boob jobs, right?

3159
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Well, chin jobs

3160
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
and lipo. Never

3161
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
reconstructive surgeries after accidents, though.

3162
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
No.

3163
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Just boob jobs. I don't need that.

3164
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
So he works on boobies all day

3165
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
but he plays

3166
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Donkey Kong to get laid.

3167
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm not sure I see the logic there

3168
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
but let's continue.

3169
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I kind of like, I don't know, fame

3170
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I guess, or glory. I don't know.

3171
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Congratulations!

3172
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Paul, this guy's the guy that beat the world

3173
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
that just beat the Donkey Kong.

3174
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Now that you have the world record

3175
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
you have to quit playing.

3176
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Do you tell Mozart to stop composing music?

3177
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
What?

3178
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
That was the trailer. Do you tell Mozart

3179
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
to stop composing music?

3180
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
So is that the big question that's gonna be

3181
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
answered in the movie? Like, does he get laid?

3182
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
No.

3183
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
No, he does not get laid.

3184
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Aw, what a downer.

3185
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And to...

3186
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
He sounds like William.

3187
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Stop it!

3188
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Stop it!

3189
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Oh my god, Rob.

3190
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
You are so red in the face right now.

3191
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Cause I'm mad that he dared bring that up

3192
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
on this program.

3193
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
You're a dick.

3194
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
At least he sounds more educated.

3195
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
He doesn't sound...

3196
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Next story!

3197
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Oh, put the 3DS down.

3198
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Loki, put the 3DS down

3199
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
before I shove it up your ass.

3200
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Oh, fine.

3201
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Our next story.

3202
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Let's talk a little bit about Minecraft.

3203
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Yes, Minecraft.

3204
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Minecraft, they're going the route of

3205
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Nintendogs.

3206
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And you're gonna get

3207
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
your own

3208
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I guess, domesticated wolf

3209
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Canines.

3210
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And...

3211
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
You'll be able to walk around with them

3212
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
and whatnot.

3213
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
And then of course, later on, they're gonna be

3214
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
adding achievements as well. That's the next thing.

3215
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
But for right now,

3216
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
they are working on

3217
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
pet wolves.

3218
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Neat, I guess.

3219
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I don't know if they really

3220
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
would do much. I mean, can you train them to

3221
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
attack things?

3222
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
I don't know.

3223
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
I have a friend who has pet wolves.

3224
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Like real ones? Yes.

3225
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Just hanging out in the backyard?

3226
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
A couple of them are half-wolves and one of them is full.

3227
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Here in SAC?

3228
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Yeah.

3229
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
They're domesticated.

3230
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Kind of neat. I don't know.

3231
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
They're kind of cool-looking.

3232
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
These Minecraft ones are far more adorable.

3233
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
That's all I'm saying. They are pretty adorable.

3234
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Is he gonna punch that wolf?

3235
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Oh, he's gonna beat it with a... No?

3236
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Punch? What is that?

3237
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
What does that even have in his hand?

3238
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Looks like a stub.

3239
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Maybe it's like a stick to play fetch.

3240
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
I still have yet to play

3241
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Minecraft. I feel so uncool and uneducated.

3242
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Yeah.

3243
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I kind of feel the same way.

3244
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
You're so kind to me tonight.

3245
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Now he's punching a...

3246
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Oh, he punched a cow in the ass

3247
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
and then the wolves are

3248
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
attacking the cow.

3249
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Nice.

3250
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
So you can stick your wolves on...

3251
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
on other things.

3252
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
So I guess you can now release the hounds.

3253
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
That's neat.

3254
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Alright.

3255
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
What happens if you punch the dog?

3256
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
They probably get angry.

3257
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
They bite your nuts off.

3258
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Is Minecraft like an MMO?

3259
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
You can play with other people.

3260
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
So you can visit other people's worlds and stuff?

3261
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
That's kind of cool.

3262
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I really need to try this damn game already.

3263
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I don't know why I've been so lazy.

3264
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Oh, the dog's showing hearts.

3265
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
He likes you.

3266
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
He gave him a bone.

3267
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
You try to hump, you're like...

3268
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
The dog's on fire.

3269
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
That's not good.

3270
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Cause the dog's stupid and standing over the fire.

3271
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Oh good. I've got people in chat. Defective Candy.

3272
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Don't feel bad. I've never played Minecraft either.

3273
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
And SilverSonic. I've never played Minecraft either.

3274
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I will make it my mission this week to play Minecraft.

3275
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
At some point. I promise.

3276
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I couldn't get into it. I didn't like it.

3277
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Really? What about it didn't you like?

3278
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
It's just kind of a pain in the ass.

3279
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I think it's just you don't know where to start with it.

3280
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
It's like...

3281
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I tried and I just honestly

3282
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I couldn't get into it and it just wasn't fun to me.

3283
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
But it's like the big thing in gaming right now.

3284
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's like Minecraft and Angry Birds.

3285
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Yeah, and if

3286
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
you know everybody

3287
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
if the biggest thing in gaming was for everyone to play

3288
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
their Nintendo 3DS

3289
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
while walking towards the end of a broken bridge.

3290
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Guess what?

3291
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I'll be playing PSP in my house.

3292
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Alright, moving on.

3293
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
The Kodoo Game Lab.

3294
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I don't see a lot of coverage on this.

3295
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
But it's out there and about.

3296
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Microsoft did release this.

3297
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
It's a game creation utility.

3298
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
It just came out this past week.

3299
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
It's a free software suite.

3300
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
And it's doing a game design

3301
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
competition to sort of

3302
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
kick off the whole Kodoo Game Lab.

3303
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
It's called the Kodoo Cup 2011.

3304
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
It's for

3305
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
students aged 9 to 17.

3306
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Oh great, the target age group of our show.

3307
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Divided into

3308
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
two age groups within the 9 to 17 bracket.

3309
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
You will use the software

3310
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
to design your game.

3311
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It's submitted by May 10th.

3312
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Prizes. $5,000 awards

3313
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
for both individuals and schools.

3314
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
A trip to New York City. Laptop connect

3315
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
bundles. And a Zune HD.

3316
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Which is amazing because didn't we also have a story

3317
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
this week that the Zune got

3318
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
axed?

3319
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Gotta get rid of them somehow.

3320
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Maybe they'll have like 5,000 Zune HD's

3321
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
as runner up prizes trying to get rid of

3322
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
their Overstock.

3323
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
That's too bad.

3324
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
What I like

3325
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
about this is the screenshot I'm looking at

3326
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
of the Kodoo Game Lab. Somebody has designed

3327
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
the lost numbers as a computer chip.

3328
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
The 4, 8, 15, eh forget it.

3329
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Anyhow, so if you

3330
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
are between 9 and 17 and you want to win money

3331
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
or a, you know, Zune cause they're

3332
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
so popular, check that out.

3333
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Meanwhile, let's go to the Mailbag.

3334
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Every week Dark Sakura reads

3335
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
the emails that you guys send us at

3336
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

3337
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
So, why don't

3338
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Dark Sakura, why don't you

3339
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
put on your surgical gloves, get ready

3340
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
to jump in there and do some plastic surgery

3341
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
on the mailbag. Ew, it's squishy.

3342
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Ok, first

3343
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Like a boob. No, not like a boob.

3344
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Like putting your finger

3345
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
up a butt or something.

3346
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Anyway, hello OLR, it's your

3347
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
friendly neighborhood spazzinator. Seeing as

3348
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
the OLR mailbag has been a wee bit

3349
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
on the light side as of late, I thought

3350
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
it might be

3351
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
a good'em idea

3352
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
G-O-O-D-M, idea to

3353
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
send an email rather than a tweet for

3354
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
a change of pace. I found a little

3355
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
something of note that bears mentioning seeing as it

3356
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
relates to a subject you folks touched on

3357
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
last week. Must be why I wasn't here.

3358
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
With the recent events

3359
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
in Japan in mind, SCEA's

3360
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
arrangement to relay donations to the Red Cross

3361
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
from one's PSN

3362
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
wallet. As of the time I typed this

3363
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
there's a spot on the game's side of the PSN

3364
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
store, the first icon you see once you enter the new

3365
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
pieces section, that allow you to make donations

3366
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
of 2, 5, 10, 25, and

3367
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
50 dollars

3368
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
in US funds. I imagine

3369
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
that you could make multiple

3370
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
donations and mix and match amounts as well.

3371
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Although I can't say for sure that

3372
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
I don't have access to the stores in other regions

3373
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I'd imagine there's similar setups in other regions'

3374
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
PSN stores as well. In case

3375
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
either of you, in case

3376
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
either one of you or a fellow listener is asking

3377
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
albeit to oneself,

3378
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
something along the lines of, so

3379
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
here's my point, this makes things that

3380
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
much easier to donate to a cause if you feel

3381
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
so inclined, but may not necessarily

3382
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
have a PayPal or bank account, etc.

3383
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Such is the case with me, but I digress.

3384
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I'm not sure if Microsoft

3385
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
will be doing a similar setup

3386
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
in the Xbox, the

3387
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
XBL marketplace, but if

3388
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I were betting man, the odds are in favor of it.

3389
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
So in short, if you would like to donate and think

3390
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
you can do without a rock band song, or if not

3391
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
more, and you're on PSN

3392
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
anyways, why not make a donation through the PSN stores?

3393
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Whispers, psss.

3394
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Besides, then you can honestly claim

3395
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
that gaming does actually do some good

3396
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
in the fact that it would just really piss off certain

3397
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
ex-lawyer from Florida.

3398
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
XD colon minus

3399
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
P. I have not

3400
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
heard about that guy in a very long time.

3401
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
That certain ex-lawyer from Florida.

3402
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And that makes me happy that he

3403
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
has not been in the news in a very long time.

3404
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
That's one of the best things

3405
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
to come out of this email, honestly. I bet he's

3406
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
sitting on attack going, ow, there's attack.

3407
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Damn gamers.

3408
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Damn you gamers.

3409
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
And you get a cute little theme.

3410
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And also to keep in mind

3411
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
whenever you make a donation to

3412
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
charity, get a receipt of it.

3413
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
You can write it off on your taxes.

3414
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
If you are, of course,

3415
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
of tax paying age.

3416
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Just saying.

3417
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So you get a kickback. Not bad.

3418
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Also save all your school receipts.

3419
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Okay, I would close this

3420
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
email with a clever quip or something, but frankly

3421
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
my brain is fried due to lack of sleep.

3422
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
And the word is lack of

3423
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
sleep. And I can't think of

3424
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
anything currently, so I'll just say this.

3425
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
If you happen to have a PSN account with some

3426
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
spare money on it, please

3427
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
at symbol, at least consider donating.

3428
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
And I just think

3429
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
that because everything else is so flawlessly

3430
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
done and the grammar is so awesome.

3431
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
You can see the tiredness

3432
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
coming through. I can see the tiredness.

3433
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And I'm like, I do that same crap when

3434
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I'm tired. So I was like,

3435
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
okay, but some of them made me laugh.

3436
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I like good'em.

3437
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Good'em. Good'em. I'm gonna use that

3438
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
word good'em. Don't know what it means,

3439
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
but it's good'em. All good'em.

3440
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Mm-mm, good'em.

3441
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Crunchy- crunchy-um. Crunch'ems.

3442
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
There should be a serial called good'em.

3443
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Okay, last email.

3444
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I'm- Nooooo.

3445
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
AHHHHHHH

3446
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
AHHH

3447
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Rob.

3448
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Apparently the last email was from the Tasmanian devil.

3449
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Rob. Rob. Rob what? Rob what?

3450
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Rob. Rob. What?

3451
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
AHHHHHH

3452
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
AHHH

3453
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Dinoboat fire.

3454
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
No.

3455
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm writing about two things.

3456
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
One, Test Drive Unlimited 2

3457
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
has finally patched

3458
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
and now does multiplayer events. If you put

3459
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
it down because of the locked out bugs,

3460
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
you can play it again. They serve

3461
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
this up by installing the enticing

3462
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
memory- sorry, the enticing

3463
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
update named mandatory 1.

3464
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Two,

3465
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
why hasn't us lately been

3466
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
talking about how great the iOS devices

3467
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
play games being DS killers

3468
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
or the death of the consoles? That is

3469
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
total bullshit. The iOS touch

3470
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
screen is only better for certain types

3471
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
of games. Nintendo's 3DS is

3472
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
poised to sell like hotcakes and I believe it will.

3473
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
As for consoles, as long as

3474
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
they are configuration

3475
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
controlled, they will always be popular.

3476
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
I just believe that it's Apple,

3477
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Apple's fanboys, and Sony that are trying to

3478
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
cast doubt on Nintendo's business.

3479
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I agree.

3480
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Yes. And I think I've said that on the show before

3481
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
is that the Apple stuff,

3482
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
the device itself,

3483
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
not all games work on it.

3484
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
And a lot of the ports, they show

3485
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
being bad ports.

3486
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
But some of the original stuff works out okay, like that

3487
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
re-rave game we were talking about earlier. I mean, that was

3488
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
designed for a touch screen. It works.

3489
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And it works pretty good. I'm sorry,

3490
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
pretty good-um. Alright.

3491
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Pretty well, actually. Any other

3492
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
emails tonight? Pretty well. Well-um.

3493
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Well-um.

3494
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
No, that's it, Rob. Alright,

3495
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
mailbag at orangelaundry.com

3496
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
if you want to send us an email to possibly

3497
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
maybe read on

3498
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
next week's show. Maybe.

3499
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
But for now, some angst

3500
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:10,000
in the segment we call FUs of the Week.

3501
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Um.

3502
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
FU.

3503
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
This is sort of an FU to jury

3504
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
duty. I mean, I know it's my civic

3505
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
duty and actually I kind of want to be on a

3506
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
case, but right now

3507
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I don't have to go in tomorrow, so I'm very happy.

3508
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
You should reschedule yours

3509
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
for May 9th, because that's the night device.

3510
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Okay.

3511
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Well, I actually am going to have to reschedule

3512
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
mine for after school because I can't have anything.

3513
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And here's my FU.

3514
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
FU to the damn light cycle

3515
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
that I'm having to model

3516
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
in Maya.

3517
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I've gotten the tail of it done

3518
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
finally, but I'm

3519
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
having a hell of a time with a curve.

3520
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I can't

3521
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
get Maya installed on my computer, so

3522
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
it's pissing me off.

3523
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
And I don't really feel like going to hang

3524
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
out at the Mac Lab all day using the Mac Lab

3525
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
to try to get it to work.

3526
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
So Maya can bite my butt.

3527
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Yeah.

3528
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I'm probably

3529
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
gonna not get an A in this class.

3530
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
I kind of don't care. I just

3531
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
want to pass it.

3532
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Because guess who's graduating this semester.

3533
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
That would be me!

3534
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Okay, I'm done.

3535
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I'm just reminded of a scene with some

3536
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
strangers with candy. I got a D!

3537
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You know what?

3538
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
What?

3539
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I have not gotten a D at all.

3540
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
What about an F?

3541
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
The only reason I got an F

3542
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
is because I dropped the class and they didn't

3543
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
register me on the books that I dropped it.

3544
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
F for fantastic work.

3545
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
F for

3546
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
fuck this place!

3547
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Um...

3548
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I would say probably F you to

3549
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
um...

3550
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
a few colds

3551
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
and having

3552
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
my son have a cold

3553
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
because he's really cranky. And F you

3554
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
the tape gun that attacked my finger

3555
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
earlier this week. I now have

3556
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I have multiple cuts on my finger.

3557
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Did it jump up and bite you?

3558
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Something like that. I have

3559
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
one, two, three. That looks painful. My god.

3560
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That wasn't that painful. But yeah, there's

3561
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
like five. Imagine if you

3562
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
cut yourself with

3563
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
not necessarily a piece of paper but like

3564
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
maybe like a knife

3565
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
just like a small cut

3566
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
but five of those

3567
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
really close together. That's basically

3568
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
the tape gun for you. And it did that

3569
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
on two fingers.

3570
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It hurt for a little bit but no more than that paper

3571
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
cut. It looked really bad though.

3572
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
That was fun.

3573
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
That's it.

3574
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
My F you goes to Loki

3575
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
for bringing up my ex on the program.

3576
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
On live internet radio. Thank you Loki.

3577
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
But really though

3578
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
my F you goes to

3579
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
tacos because they are amazing and

3580
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
addicting and I really want one right now.

3581
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Like just a taco sounds great.

3582
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Just saying.

3583
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
You know Rob, we had pesto chicken

3584
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
you could have some. That's alright.

3585
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I'm craving the really fatty Jim Boy's ground beef

3586
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
tacos. Parmesan cheese

3587
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
on the crust. Delicious.

3588
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Alright.

3589
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Moving on with some more news and then

3590
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
the Skype line at 1877 game OLR.

3591
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
But not yet. We have some more news stories

3592
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
real quick. Loki. Yes.

3593
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
And you know I don't know this

3594
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
is kind of

3595
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
interesting.

3596
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
But you know

3597
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
this kind of ties in with announcements of announcements.

3598
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
But there is a rumor

3599
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
right now that there's I guess

3600
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
an Hitman ARG

3601
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
that's going on right now.

3602
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
That's leading up

3603
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
to the announcement of a new Hitman game

3604
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
at E3.

3605
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
That series is still around?

3606
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Yes it's apparently still around.

3607
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
I guess it's

3608
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
right now they're saying

3609
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
that

3610
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I'm trying to see where it's coming from.

3611
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
It started with an ad

3612
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
from Faircount Media Group

3613
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
in a catalog at Sundance Film Festival

3614
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
depicting a box of

3615
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
the

3616
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Hitman series brand donuts

3617
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
with a barcode ending in 47.

3618
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And then it says I guess

3619
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
when a Hitman forum user tracked down

3620
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
the agency responsible for the ad

3621
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
and emailed them he received a

3622
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
response from an account saying

3623
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
you're on the right track.

3624
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
And then they gave him a new image showing a pair

3625
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
of black gloves that appears

3626
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
to be a game script

3627
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
and another barcode ending in 47

3628
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
and some other random numbers and blah blah blah blah blah.

3629
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Whatever. Okay so it's a

3630
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
stupid ARG leading up to

3631
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
the announcement of Hitman.

3632
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Great.

3633
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Oldest have to wait until E3.

3634
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh surprise.

3635
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I love announcements about announcements.

3636
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
My favorite thing in the gaming industry.

3637
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
In seven days

3638
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
we will be announcing

3639
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
an announcement about a game coming out in 14 months.

3640
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
You don't

3641
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
make it so damn obvious

3642
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
what it's going to be.

3643
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
You have to make it completely

3644
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
weird and off the wall.

3645
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
And then people are like oh.

3646
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
There will be a trailer announcing

3647
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
this announcement.

3648
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Moving on. One other quick story

3649
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
for you guys. It has to do with the game

3650
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Doodle Jump. Have you ever heard of Doodle Jump?

3651
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Dan plays Doodle Jump all the time.

3652
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I have never heard of this game but apparently

3653
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
it sold 10 million copies

3654
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
between iPhone and Android.

3655
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
What is Doodle Jump then DarkSira?

3656
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
You'd have that little dude

3657
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
on the picture. It's like

3658
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
you just turn it and he jumps from platform

3659
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
to platform and you just have to keep him going forward.

3660
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Oh okay so you don't actually doodle in the game.

3661
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I don't think so. Interesting. I haven't played it.

3662
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I've just seen Dan play it. Well they've sold 10 million

3663
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
copies. I think you can

3664
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
make your own characters by doodling.

3665
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
And funny enough this is the perfect

3666
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
kind of last story for tonight to kind of go

3667
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
with that story that came up earlier about how

3668
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Zynga is like we don't want to do our game on

3669
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Xbox because Xbox is too

3670
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
small. Well what's the announcement?

3671
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Yep Doodle Jump is going to be coming out for

3672
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Xbox 360.

3673
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Lima

3674
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Skye who is the creative

3675
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
person behind the game

3676
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Doodle Jump said that

3677
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
they reached 10 million of their milestone.

3678
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
They've also said that they are going to

3679
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
be bringing the game to Xbox Live

3680
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Arcade and the Kinect controller

3681
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
for Microsoft. They

3682
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
also want to release a multiplayer update

3683
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
to the iPhone version. They want to do an

3684
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
iPad version and of course

3685
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
merchandise, t-shirts, stickers,

3686
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
buttons, yay!

3687
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Can't wait.

3688
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
So even though some people

3689
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
want to hate on Xbox 360 because

3690
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
it's too small, some

3691
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
people think it might be a good

3692
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
place for their game. At least the Doodle Jump

3693
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
people think so.

3694
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So that's it for the news tonight. Let's

3695
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
go to the Skype line. We're going to open up the phone

3696
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
lines right now. 1-877-GAMELR

3697
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
or our username on Skype is

3698
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.

3699
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
In the meantime while we wait for some calls

3700
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
maybe Loki has a last minute story or five.

3701
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Yeah, actually I do

3702
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
and let's see

3703
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
this was kind of cool. I saw this earlier today.

3704
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
We talk a lot

3705
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
about Kinect hacks and stuff like that

3706
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
but this one's a little different.

3707
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
It's a Kinect hack working on a PS3

3708
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
and basically

3709
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
it's somebody using the Kinect

3710
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
to play Killzone 3

3711
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and it's

3712
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
quite a workaround.

3713
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Apparently it allows

3714
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
you also, I guess, to navigate the cross media bar

3715
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
and

3716
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
then

3717
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I'm assuming

3718
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
if it's tied

3719
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
in with some sort of

3720
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
hack, you probably

3721
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
have to have a custom firmware or something like that

3722
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
in order to get it to work. In fact, yeah, it looks

3723
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
like here

3724
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
oh wow, there's lots of stuff here.

3725
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Hold that thought.

3726
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3727
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
This is DJ Blaziken.

3728
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
DJ Blaziken.

3729
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

3730
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Not much other than

3731
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I think it was last week or something

3732
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Parasite Eve came out for PlayStation Network

3733
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
and I finally picked it up.

3734
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
It did. I saw that on the list when I was going to get the

3735
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Mortal Kombat demo. I saw that scrolling by

3736
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
and I was like, oh shit, yeah, I heard that that was

3737
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
coming out. So, what'd you think?

3738
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I thought it was actually pretty

3739
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
darn well. It works a little

3740
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
bit awkward and really blocky

3741
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
on my 20 inch

3742
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
TV and 1080p, but

3743
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
looks really good though on the

3744
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
PSP Go.

3745
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
And this is a little

3746
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
thing for all the listeners who might have the

3747
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
PSP Go that probably didn't know this

3748
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
or ever figured it out.

3749
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You can actually sync your PlayStation

3750
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
3 controller to it

3751
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
via the Bluetooth

3752
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
and makes it a little bit

3753
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
easier to play

3754
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
if

3755
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
you're at a death or something

3756
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and you just don't like the

3757
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
whole control scheme of that.

3758
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
But, oh my god.

3759
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I mean

3760
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
for years I just saw the trailer

3761
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
and

3762
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
that blew my mind.

3763
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
It still blows my mind

3764
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
now, looking at the visuals

3765
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
even though now we're in the HD age

3766
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
it still just goes

3767
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
to show

3768
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Square

3769
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
puts a lot of effort into just maxing

3770
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
out the potential of whatever system

3771
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
they're working on. Everything from

3772
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
the original NES

3773
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
now. I think we've seen it.

3774
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
It's max.

3775
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
The thing about Parasite Eve, they did make a second

3776
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
game, but they never really made a third.

3777
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
I do know there's third birthday, but

3778
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
that was years later obviously.

3779
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Do you think

3780
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
it's best that some games don't get

3781
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
sequels? Or do you think that

3782
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
really good games deserve sequels?

3783
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I think really good games

3784
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
especially like this, I don't know how much

3785
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
notoriety it got, but

3786
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
it seems like a game

3787
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
for a potential of sequels.

3788
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I remember it

3789
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
being a pretty big deal back in the day because

3790
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
it was one of the first Square games to come out after

3791
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Final Fantasy VII from what I remember.

3792
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Now granted my memory's a little fuzzy because

3793
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
I'm really fucking old, but it's something like that.

3794
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Yeah, I saw one of those PlayStation

3795
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
magazine demo discs

3796
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
and, oh my

3797
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
god, even though at the time

3798
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
my mom wouldn't let me play rated M games back then

3799
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
and two, I just didn't have

3800
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
the cash to get it.

3801
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
So, and now that

3802
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I am of age and

3803
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
have the cash, I was just like,

3804
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
heck, I'll get this.

3805
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
That's right. I'm mature now.

3806
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I'm gonna play all the mature rated games I want.

3807
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
And, you know what, it's

3808
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I don't know what, I

3809
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
gotta praise Square because

3810
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
we have probably the best

3811
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I mean, I may sound like a little bit

3812
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
of a Square fanboy, but

3813
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
who hasn't been

3814
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
ever.

3815
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
They always just seem to come out with

3816
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
games with a really great story arc

3817
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
that connects you with the characters

3818
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
and makes you feel like

3819
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
an emotional

3820
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
attachment to them almost didn't.

3821
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
It's just like,

3822
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
whoa.

3823
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Going to our chat

3824
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I will admit,

3825
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
if this has ever happened to any of you guys,

3826
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
that a game ending ever made you cry,

3827
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
it would've had to

3828
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
been the first Kingdom Hearts

3829
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
ending when

3830
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Kyrie and Source split apart

3831
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
on two different lands. OMG spoilers.

3832
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I could never beat

3833
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Kingdom Hearts.

3834
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
It was hard.

3835
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It was hard, but

3836
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
worth the grind. Yeah, yeah, that's true.

3837
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
If you reached the ending,

3838
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
it was a pretty sad ending.

3839
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
It just brought tears to my

3840
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
eyes. I was like, no!

3841
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Go back!

3842
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
It's okay, try to keep your emotions in check

3843
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
on the show, buddy. Have you played

3844
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
through Parasite Eve yet?

3845
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I've gotten up

3846
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
to probably the first

3847
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
boss battle so far,

3848
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
and I'm just getting my ass

3849
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
hated to be like

3850
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
that, and so I'm trying to look at

3851
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
walkthroughs and possible online

3852
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
strategy guides to figure out

3853
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
any ways to beat it.

3854
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
The good news is with those older games,

3855
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
there's a ton of them out there, so that's a good thing.

3856
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Yeah, which there's a lot more

3857
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
help with it.

3858
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I'm just trying to figure out,

3859
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
because I have the PS3 Slim right now,

3860
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
basically,

3861
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
would it be

3862
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
worse...

3863
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I don't know if any of us remember

3864
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Blingcast for the Dreamcast.

3865
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I have them all.

3866
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Okay,

3867
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
basically, what would you think,

3868
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
because with the PlayStation Move controllers

3869
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
being thrown in the way of Wii remotes,

3870
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
if with the jailbroken

3871
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
PS3, someone comes out with a Wii

3872
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
emulator that does HD

3873
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
support for the PS3

3874
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Wii games?

3875
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
It would be difficult because

3876
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
remember, emulators take a lot more horsepower

3877
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
to run than the actual consoles

3878
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
themselves, so even right

3879
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
now running a Nintendo 64

3880
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
emulator on a PS3, while

3881
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
possible,

3882
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
that's pretty much maxing out

3883
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
the resources right now.

3884
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
The PlayStation 3 has to emulate the fuckin' PS2

3885
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
first, and I'm not talking about the

3886
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
old school first generation consoles,

3887
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
because they had the extra chip, which is why they were so

3888
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
expensive, but I find it very

3889
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
odd that we still have seen nothing about

3890
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
PlayStation 2 emulation on PlayStation 3

3891
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
outside of that very, very first

3892
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
generation of consoles.

3893
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Maybe it wasn't a firmware patch

3894
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
that we just never really figured

3895
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
No, you would have

3896
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
trumpets and fanfare and

3897
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
confetti everywhere if that were to happen, and honestly,

3898
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
I wouldn't expect it to be as easy

3899
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
as putting your discs in. I think those sick

3900
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
bastards will make you pay for the games

3901
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
all over again. But I

3902
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
can hope not. I sure hope not.

3903
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I might just get a PlayStation

3904
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
2 again if that, if it doesn't

3905
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
work. Just so

3906
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I can have BeatMania

3907
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
with most of the Beemani

3908
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
titles, really, because

3909
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I mean, I have the Rock Band keyboard, and it's

3910
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
making me miss Keyboard Mania, because that was

3911
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
at my arcade.

3912
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
They traded

3913
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
they got rid of it

3914
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I don't know why, that along with pop and music

3915
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
they used to have that.

3916
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
They had just got all the Beemani games here

3917
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
at Family Fun Center, but

3918
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
they traded them all in for random

3919
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
stuff, and only

3920
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
once we have wrapped the Link's

3921
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Para. Rest in peace

3922
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
the arcades I remember. Alright, Blazekin

3923
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I gotta let you go so we can get our calls.

3924
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Arcade Infinity RIP

3925
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
That was just sad watching the

3926
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
video. Alright, we're gonna go Para40 right now.

3927
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Alright, Blazekin I gotta let you go to get

3928
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
more calls. Have a good one buddy.

3929
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Alright, peace out. Bye.

3930
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Alright.

3931
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
1877 GameOLR

3932
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3933
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Anything else low-key while we're waiting for

3934
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
another call?

3935
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Um

3936
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I don't really have too

3937
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
much. I was gonna talk, there was some

3938
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
other developments with the

3939
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
whole Playstation

3940
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
hacking stuff

3941
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
and the whole court case, everything. I believe

3942
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
they, was it the

3943
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
judge okayed Sony to get the

3944
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
basically

3945
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
people that have

3946
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
donated money from California

3947
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
into

3948
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
the GeoHot thing. They've

3949
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
gotten access to those records

3950
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
and then um also

3951
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
they're trying to find

3952
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
a software development

3953
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
kit manual

3954
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
on his computer because

3955
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
in the manual it has like

3956
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
if you need help support and you're in the

3957
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
US territories call this number because he's

3958
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
basically saying that he was unaware that

3959
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Sony was in California or something like

3960
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
that and they're trying to find a way to link it to him

3961
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
that he knew that they're in California

3962
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
to which I say, who the fuck

3963
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
reads the manual for something like that

3964
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
and I don't think it's

3965
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
actually on his system. I think he used

3966
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
open um

3967
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
open source stuff to create

3968
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
his hacks so

3969
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
it may be a

3970
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
stretch but it seems like they're really trying to

3971
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
grab at straws here. Alright we got

3972
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
another call coming in so let's go to it. Hi you're on

3973
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3974
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Hey how's it going? This is SSJ100 Matt. Hello

3975
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
SSJ100 Matt. What's going on buddy?

3976
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Hello hello

3977
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Doing good. I just wanted to call

3978
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
and get my late PAX East report.

3979
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
You're late. PAX East was

3980
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
so last week. Are you

3981
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
calling in to talk about PAX East 2012?

3982
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
The internet line looks like 100 years.

3983
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Alright no I'm kidding. What's up? Obviously

3984
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
you're probably on the way home or something so we'll

3985
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
give it a buy. Did you have a good time?

3986
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Yeah I definitely had a good time. You know what

3987
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I liked it a lot more than

3988
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
last year's. Oh of course because

3989
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I wasn't there. Yeah well

3990
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Hey don't agree with that asshole.

3991
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I'm just kidding.

3992
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
So what was better

3993
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
about it than last year?

3994
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
You know what? It was the bigger

3995
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
conventions that really made a difference

3996
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
and I think

3997
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
a lot more people were able to work with

3998
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
the larger space.

3999
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Tabletop gaming was

4000
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
big.

4001
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I mean

4002
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
the spacing of the

4003
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
boots were good. People weren't hidden

4004
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
behind other boots.

4005
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
You know you're able to see everyone

4006
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
so everyone got plenty

4007
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
of traffic I think and

4008
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
there were a lot more

4009
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
there was a lot more

4010
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
newer stuff there I guess.

4011
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
They got to play on the 3DS. They got to play

4012
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Duke Nukem Forever

4013
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
and

4014
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
the one game that I really liked

4015
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Child of Eden

4016
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Oh yeah the

4017
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
spiritual successor of sorts to Res

4018
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
sure. Yeah and

4019
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
you know what I think you guys

4020
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
will certainly enjoy it. I'm actually considering

4021
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
a Kinect because of that game.

4022
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
How does it work? Is it really

4023
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
like Res but you use your hands

4024
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
to kind of highlight things? Is that kind of what the deal is?

4025
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
It's pretty much that way

4026
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
and you know what it's weird because

4027
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
there's two different ways of shooting.

4028
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Use your left hand to shoot

4029
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
to highlight over and then push forward

4030
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
to shoot the missiles.

4031
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
And then you can use your right hand

4032
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
to shoot the gun regularly.

4033
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Interesting.

4034
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
So you switch off

4035
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
during the gameplay which is really interesting.

4036
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And it's really interesting that it's able to

4037
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
capture that

4038
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
with limited problems but

4039
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
but you know the other thing I really liked

4040
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
at PAX East was

4041
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
the classic arcade run.

4042
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
They had a lot more stuff

4043
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I'm sure you remember last year

4044
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
it was kind of set up like Flynn's

4045
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
arcade where you had Journey music playing

4046
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
and

4047
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
and

4048
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
last year I remember

4049
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
last year I remember it was just a room full of

4050
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
consoles and you could kind of check out whatever game you wanted to

4051
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
play and do it all that way

4052
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
but they kind of took it, kicked it up a notch

4053
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
this year with the bigger space.

4054
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Well yeah well I'll say that but I'm also

4055
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
talking about the arcade room where they had

4056
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
the arcade machines all set up.

4057
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Oh yeah, the one that was next door to the console room.

4058
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Yes, yes I remember.

4059
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Yeah.

4060
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
You know they had a lot more

4061
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I think they doubled the amount of arcade games there.

4062
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Oh nice. And they also had a couple of

4063
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
guys from

4064
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Twin Galaxies trying to beat high scores live.

4065
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Nice! Oh man

4066
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
that was one of my favorite spots at PAX East.

4067
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Yeah.

4068
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
So that was really interesting so

4069
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I had a lot of fun there

4070
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
and you know it was kind of to the point because you know

4071
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
not too many people went up there to play stuff.

4072
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Everyone was downstairs on the Xbox floor

4073
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
so you know I was able to play

4074
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
all the arcade games I wanted to.

4075
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Nice.

4076
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Very cool.

4077
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
What do you hope that they bring next year to PAX?

4078
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
What's an improvement they need to make for next

4079
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
year's PAX?

4080
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I think you know

4081
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
that

4082
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
as much as it was a great

4083
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
plan, the

4084
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
panels themselves weren't, I didn't really

4085
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
find to enjoy.

4086
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
The thing was most of the panels

4087
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
were about networking.

4088
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
A lot of stuff you would kind of see at GDC.

4089
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I mean I'm not really

4090
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
into getting into the business. I mean I'm just

4091
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
you know a gamer. I don't play.

4092
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I don't make games.

4093
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
But you know they had a lot of panels like that and you know

4094
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
it's a great idea and I think they should keep that but you know

4095
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
there was you know

4096
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
very limited stuff that

4097
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
about games

4098
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
you know

4099
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
gaming itself I guess. So maybe they need to

4100
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
diversify the panel lineup a little bit more.

4101
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Or maybe have more rooms.

4102
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
There was only one panel they went to

4103
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
and that was the Xbox Live

4104
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
enforcement.

4105
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Oh yeah I saw a clip of that one online. That looked kind of

4106
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
interesting actually. Where they were showing

4107
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
how they could ban

4108
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
people. Like they basically just run through

4109
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
giant columns of names and highlight

4110
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
all the colors. It was interesting.

4111
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Yeah. Kind of neat.

4112
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Alright well I am hoping I

4113
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
can go out to PAX East next year but

4114
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
you know it's a plane ticket

4115
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
so the cost of gas has to come down but we'll see.

4116
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
It's in April

4117
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
next year. During Passover in the west.

4118
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Oh no.

4119
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
No no. Get this. It starts on

4120
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
my birthday this year. Does it

4121
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
really? Yep. Interesting.

4122
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Well no Passover. Well I was going to say

4123
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
it would be funny if PAX East was around that same time

4124
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
next year. No cake.

4125
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I'll eat cake on the day before.

4126
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Space it out a little more from like

4127
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
You should come to PAX East.

4128
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
You know what if I could afford it or if

4129
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
a bunch of people wanted to get together and put

4130
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
the money together and send me a plane

4131
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
ticket. Although

4132
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Japan disaster relief is kind of

4133
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
important right now. More important. I know.

4134
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
But I'm saying if you got

4135
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
ten people

4136
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
to put twenty bucks together

4137
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
that's half a plane ticket. Just saying.

4138
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
That's just wasted twenty dollars. No I'm kidding.

4139
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Alright no but I

4140
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Hopefully things will get better

4141
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
next year financially and economically

4142
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
and we can evaluate that for next year.

4143
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
I really want to go to PAX West

4144
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
this year to be honest. I really want to go.

4145
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
But I just don't know if I can. We'll see.

4146
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Alright. Well enough

4147
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
coulda woulda shoulda wanna

4148
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
hopefully talk. I'm gonna go ahead and let you go

4149
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
when I'm out to get a few more calls but

4150
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
thanks for the report. And Child of Eden I definitely

4151
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
have my eye on that one. I want to play out when it comes out.

4152
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Absolutely. Alright. Take care

4153
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
buddy. Take it easy guys. Alright later.

4154
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
1877 Game OLR.

4155
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4156
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
while we wait for some more calls.

4157
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Loki anything else?

4158
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Um

4159
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Not really. I don't know.

4160
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I don't remember if we talked

4161
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
too much about Angry Birds and

4162
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
how much they've sold.

4163
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Freaking tweet! Argh! Angry Birds.

4164
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
That's my impression. I don't understand the

4165
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Angry Birds obsession. I don't either.

4166
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
The game's alright.

4167
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
It's okay but I mean it's

4168
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
there's more fun games out there.

4169
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I think it's really the price point

4170
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
that sold so many copies of that.

4171
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I don't understand the whole movie franchising thing.

4172
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I don't understand the

4173
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
just the whole obsession with it.

4174
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
People are dumb.

4175
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
That's what I've really come to understand is

4176
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
this whole new casual gaming

4177
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
market out there. Your moms and

4178
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
you know other

4179
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
relatives or whatever they're playing these casual

4180
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
games. Oh no they're hardcore now.

4181
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Oh I'm sorry. They're hardcore

4182
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
according to Zynga. Zynga you're stupid.

4183
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
They're not hardcore

4184
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
and I'm sorry I think that they're kind of

4185
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
they're not dumb

4186
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
necessarily but their

4187
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
expectations are a lot lower

4188
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
compared to everybody else. I don't know.

4189
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Whatever.

4190
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Alright sorry I didn't mean to have

4191
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
dead air there but I wanted to remind the folks in chat

4192
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
because there's sometimes a bit of a delay.

4193
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Last call for Skype call is 1-877-GAMO-LR

4194
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
or our username on Skype is orangeontradios

4195
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
so folks in chat want us to go to DragonCon

4196
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
in Atlanta. I totally

4197
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
totally totally want to go to that.

4198
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
See I don't know if there'd be enough for me

4199
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
there. I mean I would go to hang with

4200
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
people and that would really

4201
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
be it for me. It was kind of like

4202
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
when I went to that anime con in Chicago

4203
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
the AsenCon that I did a little panel at.

4204
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I want to get an Asen too. I had a good

4205
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
time hanging with people

4206
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
but the con itself was

4207
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
just kind of like woop over my head. We need to see about getting in for

4208
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Fanime. I mean we need to talk to our people.

4209
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Yeah. Alright we got another call coming

4210
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
up so let's take it. Hi you're on Orangeontradios. Who's this?

4211
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Hi this is

4212
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Spazenator. Hey buddy how you doing Spazenator?

4213
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Pretty good you.

4214
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Two quick

4215
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
items.

4216
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
One question and one comment.

4217
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
The comment first

4218
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
sorry about the typos and all that

4219
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
in my email. I'm just

4220
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
giving a hard time. She just gives everybody shit

4221
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
don't worry about it. I give people I like a hard time.

4222
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
It's called love.

4223
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Yeah I know.

4224
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Now

4225
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
as far as my question

4226
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
now seeing that Microsoft

4227
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
is basically doing away with the

4228
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Zune

4229
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
now are they going to

4230
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
ax the video marketplace

4231
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
as well on Xbox Live

4232
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
or is that going to stick around?

4233
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
That was around before the Zune.

4234
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
When did the Zune come out? The Zune came out about a year

4235
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
after Xbox was out and I seem to recall that

4236
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
video marketplace was going pretty early

4237
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
so no I mean if they can still

4238
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
sell movies on there they're going to do it.

4239
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Even though the Zune's

4240
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
going away don't forget they still have the Windows

4241
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
mobile phones and I think that's really kind of where they're

4242
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
focusing. I mean think about it.

4243
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
A lot of the marketplace

4244
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
for the iOS

4245
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
is centered around the iPhone.

4246
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I mean granted you have your

4247
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
iPads and you have your iPod

4248
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
touches still but I think the

4249
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
iPhone claims a pretty fair share

4250
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
of that market so I think

4251
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
the Zune fading out is more

4252
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Microsoft kind of aligning itself.

4253
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Instead of doing a Zune phone

4254
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
now they have this Windows 7 phone or whatever it is.

4255
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
So no you're not

4256
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
going to see the movie stuff go away.

4257
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
God how could you? Especially with like

4258
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Netflix,

4259
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Hulu they've announced for the end of the year

4260
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
and all this other stuff.

4261
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Yeah it's only going to be

4262
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
more.

4263
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Yeah I was just

4264
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
kind of curious because now that

4265
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I got a computer and I use

4266
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
the Zune marketplace

4267
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
on my computer I'm just going to use

4268
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
a whole lot more now.

4269
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
You'll probably see it get

4270
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
rebranded as like you know

4271
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
the Windows Mobile or

4272
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
it'll get rebranded. They'll probably

4273
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
walk away from that Zune name.

4274
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
But it'll still be there.

4275
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Oh alright.

4276
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Thanks for taking my call.

4277
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Definitely appreciate it. No problem buddy.

4278
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Have a good one.

4279
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Later.

4280
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Wow that was a neat call. Hey I got a question

4281
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
and he answered it and he's like okay bye.

4282
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
I like that.

4283
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Alright so since that call was so fast we'll go ahead and do

4284
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
one more call. Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

4285
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Hi guys.

4286
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Can you guys hear me? We can. Who's this?

4287
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Hi it's DDR Dollar Bill.

4288
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Hey DDR Dollar Bill. How you doing?

4289
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Hey doing alright man.

4290
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Just figured I just want to make it quick

4291
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
because I don't want to waste you know

4292
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
take too long. Just want to give my

4293
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
presence on PAX East. Hey you're late.

4294
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
No that's alright. You were driving in the car

4295
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
last week right? Yes I was.

4296
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Okay well you didn't get to talk because you were probably driving

4297
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
so what did you think of PAX East?

4298
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
I enjoyed

4299
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
it heavily.

4300
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
My favorite part was

4301
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
not exactly was something that not many

4302
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
people really understood.

4303
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
It wasn't really the games. It wasn't really

4304
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
the panels.

4305
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
It was the actual fact that I

4306
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
actually got to interview some of the developers.

4307
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Oh.

4308
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
So just being close and getting

4309
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
to interact with people that are usually

4310
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
behind closed doors at trade shows.

4311
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Exactly.

4312
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Okay.

4313
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Who were some of the developers you got to talk to?

4314
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I got to talk with one guy from Microsoft

4315
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
who was developing

4316
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
the upcoming Firepaw Wrestling release

4317
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
on Xbox Live Arcade.

4318
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I was

4319
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
really interested because

4320
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Firepaw Wrestling, I don't know how many

4321
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
people know this but it's like a really old

4322
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
school wrestling game that

4323
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
was hailed heavily because you know.

4324
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I've actually got a couple of the

4325
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Firepaw Wrestling games.

4326
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
What's that? I've never heard of it.

4327
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
We've got the Dreamcast one that had the Virtua Fighter characters

4328
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
in it.

4329
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Oh. You mean the All Japan

4330
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
featuring Virtua.

4331
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
They had a wolf in it. Yeah.

4332
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Yeah and the Giant Gram series.

4333
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Yeah but I think we've got one of the

4334
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Firepaw.

4335
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I think the Dreamcast

4336
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
yeah D it's called.

4337
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Yeah.

4338
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
This one actually uses your avatars

4339
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
as wrestlers.

4340
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Oh that's pretty sweet.

4341
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Oh yeah and from what I was told

4342
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
you actually have to develop

4343
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
the moves from the beginning.

4344
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So you start off at level 1

4345
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
and you basically keep fighting and the more levels you get

4346
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
the more moves you get.

4347
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
And the moves

4348
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
from what I've seen so far they seem kind of

4349
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
more arcade-ish

4350
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
not so much like the current

4351
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
wrestling games like SmackDown vs. Ball

4352
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
and all that.

4353
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
But I think if

4354
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
it works well I think it would actually be a nice hit.

4355
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Especially since it's used to your avatars

4356
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
and whatnot.

4357
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
So you liked

4358
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
getting close to the developers and it's funny

4359
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
because on a previous call SJ100Matt was talking

4360
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
about the panels were a little

4361
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
much on the side of how to get into the

4362
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
business. Did you find

4363
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
that same thing to be true or did you kind of like

4364
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
that?

4365
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I found that

4366
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
to be the same thing and to be quite honest

4367
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I actually liked it because

4368
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
it actually showed me

4369
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
a side of gaming I've never really

4370
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
explored. Like the developing

4371
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
side. You just discovered

4372
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
a whole new side of yourself you never knew was

4373
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
there before.

4374
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Oh yeah

4375
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
considering how much video I was doing, yeah.

4376
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Nice.

4377
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
You know I remember when I went to PAX the first year

4378
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
PAX Prime one of the games they were showing was Warhammer

4379
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
and it was pretty cool. The Warhammer Online

4380
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
one, the WoW killer that

4381
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
didn't really end up killing WoW. But it was

4382
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
cool to be able to kind of like as one of the guys

4383
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
I was playing the game and he just came up and was talking to me about it

4384
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
it was really cool. Like I

4385
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
like that when folks will just kind of walk up

4386
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
and talk to you about the product. You know E3 is a lot

4387
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
of that too. Unfortunately

4388
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
a lot of the big boosts will kind of

4389
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
turn their nose up at you but the

4390
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
littler companies, man they

4391
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
they'll practically drag you into their

4392
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
boosts to talk about whatever it is they're putting out so

4393
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I always kind of like that, getting to talk to folks

4394
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
just about what they really love

4395
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
doing. A lot of people

4396
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
a lot of people that are really into the game

4397
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
industry really love what they're doing. It's pretty cool.

4398
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
I had two more interviews like that

4399
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I had one with the one developer

4400
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
from Lord of the Rings

4401
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
the MMORPG

4402
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Yeah which

4403
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I'm actually going to probably take a shot at it

4404
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
one day since it's free

4405
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
and another one which

4406
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I actually might pay for because

4407
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
it was really interesting was like

4408
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I'm going to get the name wrong

4409
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
but it's called iRacing

4410
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
it was like a racing simulator type

4411
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
kind of like Gran Turismo for the PC

4412
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
and you

4413
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
had pretty much you had to play against

4414
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
real players not computer

4415
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
AI

4416
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
and I was actually sitting down

4417
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
with the driving wheel with the voice feedback

4418
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
and everything

4419
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
after about maybe 10 minutes of driving

4420
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
and I had to stop because I wanted

4421
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
to do other things

4422
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I actually felt my body going

4423
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
forward like the whole inertia

4424
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Oh wow

4425
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Yeah I was like wow

4426
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
I was like

4427
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
slowly walking away like

4428
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
That sounds like my first time with a 3DS

4429
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
but

4430
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
I had to turn that 3DS off I couldn't see

4431
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I was

4432
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
half blind when I tried it

4433
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
it was just too much headache

4434
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
It was interesting to hear different people's reactions

4435
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
I'm so curious to see what's going to happen when that thing comes out

4436
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
for the public

4437
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I know like Best Buy already has a demo unit out

4438
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Oh yeah I heard a lot of places are getting

4439
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
the demo units so they're pretty easy to

4440
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
get your hands on now I mean they're out Sunday

4441
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
this is not something that's coming out like 6 months from now

4442
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
it's out like soon so

4443
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Yeah I'll probably pick it up later

4444
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
but one last thing though about 3D

4445
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
real quick

4446
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
I also saw the Nvidia 3D cards

4447
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
and

4448
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
for some reason 3DS

4449
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
and most 3D TVs

4450
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I can't really use the 3D because it makes me dizzy

4451
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Right

4452
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
But when I was trying out Warcraft

4453
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
in 3D

4454
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
on 3 screens

4455
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
no problems

4456
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
whatsoever

4457
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I can only imagine what that must be like

4458
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
that must be insane that's too much wow

4459
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
did I really say that?

4460
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
that's too much wow

4461
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Oh Rob that's not such a thing

4462
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I cannot believe that just came out of your mouth

4463
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
that's why I said it

4464
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
that I've hosted this show with for 9 years

4465
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
that's why I said it Rob

4466
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
it's crazy it's called irony

4467
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
it's crazy

4468
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
I just like the 3D it's like wow I can actually see it

4469
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
the first sign of the end of the world coming

4470
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
in 2012 was when Dark Sakura

4471
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
admitted to liking Warcraft that was like the first

4472
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
sign alright anyhow

4473
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
DDR.com I gotta let you go so we wrap up the show

4474
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
but thanks so much for your call buddy

4475
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
and glad to hear you had fun at PAX East

4476
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
see you next year later I hope

4477
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
I hope

4478
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
I really would like to do PAX West this year

4479
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I'm hoping I can save the money fast enough cause Seattle's not that far

4480
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
that's the good news I could drive

4481
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
to Seattle I mean

4482
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
it would be a pain in the ass but I could do it

4483
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Dark Sakura's pretty much driven to Seattle

4484
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I mean granted the town she

4485
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
goes to is in a different corner of Washington

4486
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
but it's about the same length when all

4487
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
said and done right? well it's

4488
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
it was like a 17 hour drive to get to Prosser

4489
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
so I would imagine tack

4490
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
on another 4 to that to get to Seattle?

4491
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
no because you can get to Portland in

4492
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
10 and Seattle's another

4493
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
3 to 4 from Portland but that's

4494
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
just a straight shot up 5 so

4495
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
to get to where you're going you have to go through more

4496
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
we went I think in the 93 yeah

4497
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
you gotta go through weird no Seattle's

4498
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
just a straight shot up 5

4499
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
but see my ride's

4500
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
quite a bit longer and we actually

4501
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
didn't go through that part of Oregon we

4502
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
stopped in like Bend you know what

4503
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Dark Sakura we should rent I already

4504
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
know Loki's not going to come because the baby you

4505
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
and I should rent a van

4506
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
we're doing it go up to Pat

4507
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I can't promise you money money money

4508
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I know I need money

4509
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
alright we'll see more to

4510
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
develop in the future let me just do one

4511
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
more check with Loki on any last minute stories

4512
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
and then we're going to wrap up the show nah

4513
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
you just want to

4514
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
get out of here and play more Motorstorm

4515
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
yeah I won't

4516
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
get to play more Motorstorm at home

4517
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
I could I mean

4518
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
it's just you know a TV and stuff

4519
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000

4520
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
well we're going to go ahead and start to wrap up tonight's show

4521
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
but first we have to go around and get

4522
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
everybody's final thoughts

4523
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Loki well I guess we'll start with you tonight

4524
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000

4525
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
playing lots of Motorstorm at work though that's

4526
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
for sure it's such an awesome

4527
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
game and

4528
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Dark Sakura your final thought tonight

4529
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
we

4530
