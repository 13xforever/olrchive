14244	24103	Tonight, March 6, 2011, the PlayStation 3 stops shipping in one country, GameStop becomes the target of a class action lawsuit, and Microsoft clears up some old gamer tags.
31653	36496	Hello my friends out there on the interwebs and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36596	38477	It is that show about video games.
38898	42920	It's the show that brings every gamer a voice as we have over the past nine years.
43321	48864	We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
49284	50245	My name is Rob Roberts.
50265	52827	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
53127	55929	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
56189	56569	Shimei.
56929	57290	How are you?
57490	57850	Shimei.
58590	59071	Shemazel.
60819	62241	Are we the Laverne and Shirley opening?
63282	66745	This will be showing up on our photo feed shortly.
67246	72131	Because today's alcoholism is brought to you by Chimay, which is tasty.
72171	76175	Uh-oh, you're not drinking during the show again, because last week, oh boy, that was a rough show.
77757	78158	Watch me.
78458	78939	I'm drinking.
79420	80641	Say hello and welcome back.
81002	82544	Loki is back with us tonight.
82704	82945	Hello.
83185	84246	How are you doing?
84266	84787	You feeling better?
86229	86710	Yeah, I guess.
86930	88452	We told all the listeners why you were gone.
88492	89414	Sorry if you want to keep it a secret.
89434	89634	No, I don't.
89654	90455	We figured you'd tweet about it.
90555	91036	I don't care.
91056	91737	It's fine.
92178	93700	I told him that we played a song in Tribute.
93860	97043	That's right, we did play Living with a Hernia on our way out.
97063	109373	Apparently it was something, I don't know, I guess it was something I had for a long time or something, but on Tuesday last week, all of a sudden, my innie became an outie, and it's like, oh, this kind of hurts.
109694	110815	Why is this hurting?
110875	111735	So I went to the doctor.
111755	114318	The doctor said, hey, you better go.
115619	118942	Here, I'm going to make an appointment with the surgeon right now so you can go get checked out.
118982	121084	And then I went to the surgeon's office, and they're like,
121984	123285	We can take care of this right now if you want.
123325	124906	I'm like, all right.
125667	132071	So they did that, and it hurt like a bitch for, well, during the operation.
132691	134192	Well, operations tend to hurt.
134232	134893	Did they put you under?
134913	138755	Nope, it's local, and that felt weird.
138855	139396	Yeah, I bet.
140737	144739	But then, no, then it's just like really stiff and sore for a couple days.
144759	147261	I just want to point out they don't knock you out for a vasectomy either if you want to.
147982	148602	I'm sure that would.
148642	149002	I've heard.
149022	151504	That probably wouldn't have hurt as bad as, you know.
152304	154326	It's not even really hurting, it's weird stuff.
154426	164232	Imagine someone putting their finger into your belly button underneath and then pulling muscle down or something like that.
164552	165553	That's kind of the feeling.
165753	168635	The synchronized sounds of barfing.
168995	176220	Or the feeling of someone electrocuting fat or something on you and popping and then smelling that fat burning.
176560	179481	Once in a while we do talk about video games, I promise.
179802	181442	But no, I'm feeling better.
181462	182663	Wait, did they turn the fat into bacon?
183123	183563	They did not.
183623	184584	It does not smell like bacon.
184884	189266	It's not even... Human flesh smells like chicken burning.
190026	191327	It does not smell like chicken burning.
191407	192807	It's not pleasant.
194588	196729	And it's not pleasant to feel it burning either.
196989	204753	All right, well, look, all this gross medical talk house aside, hopefully you had a chance to play a lot of games while you were recovering.
205493	206034	and so forth.
206494	209658	It was an umbilical hernia.
211179	214483	As long as I can remember, my belly button feels weird.
214543	217206	It felt like there was a tube on the other side or something like that.
217246	218948	You never had a baby to lift before.
218968	222151	I don't even know if it was that.
222211	223933	Is your intestines hooked up to the wrong space?
224153	233376	Basically, what happens with hernia is sometimes fat or tissue can get trapped inside of it, and then the circulation gets cut off and it dies.
233736	236517	Well, that's what started to happen with some of that, so that's why it started hurting.
237897	243799	So they had to get rid of that so that it wouldn't turn into gangrene or something.
245561	261119	I gotta go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com let me read you some of the comments in our chatroom right now we are live at chat.orangeloungeradio.com OMFG Loki stop can't Loki just talk about Grand Theft Auto or Earth Defense Force instead Orange Lounge Trauma Center
262532	263512	Talk about both of those.
264753	273716	I saw the new little trailer or like behind the scenes, or not really a trailer, it was like a behind the scenes thing or a preview of Earth Defense.
273756	276097	It's awesome.
276738	277578	It's so awesome.
279058	279398	All right.
280039	280439	Anyhow.
281059	281339	Wow.
281419	284860	I don't know how to follow that up, but I guess we'll... No, I'm fine now.
285260	289442	Technically, I'm not supposed to be lifting anything or doing anything, but I feel fine.
290942	292583	And so I've been lifting my son and stuff.
292603	295123	I'm just not like, you know... It's because you're secretly a cyborg.
295484	298685	I'm not going to go, you know, try to get more cat litter or something like that.
298725	302726	It's like a 30-pound... It's basically, if it hurts, stop doing it.
303486	328316	uh well you were missed last week Loki but our aim's improving now that you're within targeting range because last week seriously we had a drunk Jamie we had the Oscars girl I was tipsy we had a drunk Jamie and then Mystique came in middle of the show and I don't even know what happened I did pretty good on my Oscar picks I think I haven't got a chance to be back to my work but I hope I won something that'd be kind of cool
329799	333344	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
333424	334185	I played well.
335367	335787	Damn you.
336228	336468	Addict.
337450	337790	Dealer.
338872	343719	I joined the Horde House Guild and made a death knight because I did not want to start from one.
344349	345810	That's the interesting thing about having a new guild.
345830	349713	Yeah, my spinoff show, Horde House with Extover, has an official guild now.
350013	351314	And all the details are on the last show.
351354	352554	On the Goober server.
352995	356177	Yeah, on what WowWiki calls a server full of bad players.
356217	356917	So we had to roll there.
356957	357658	We had to roll there.
358058	358619	Had to do it.
359979	361100	But everything's starting from scratch.
361180	361781	It's been very weird.
361921	364102	I've run into nothing but assholes.
364623	364863	Really?
365103	365863	Except for us.
366204	368805	Of course.
368825	371907	There was one nice person who wanted to group with me, but I'm like, I don't want to play with you.
372588	373769	So it's just been MMOs for you?
374589	381634	Well, today I went in either room because I wanted to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Dan was playing through Shinobi.
382316	387777	So I sit down with my sleeping bag because it's really warm.
388678	389558	Because I was super cold.
389618	393359	So I sat with my sleeping bag and I fell asleep to Shinobi and woke up to Ikaruga.
395139	399120	So I guess that counts that I can sleep to video games.
399981	404862	Apparently at some point Dan beat it because I opened my eyes and saw the ending and I was like, whatever.
405942	408523	And I think that's about it.
408723	409224	DarkSakura.com
428704	431145	And then we were talking about Rygar, the arcade game.
431465	433425	Like, not the NES game that most everybody remembers.
433445	434446	It was also an arcade game.
434786	439547	And I was talking about the Tidal Arcade Classics that is on Xbox, the old school one.
439567	441748	It has Rygar, it has Tecmo Bowl, a bunch of other stuff in it.
442488	444008	And, like, I've been really wanting to play that.
444028	448950	I didn't get to it today, but, like, ever since our little conversation this morning, I've been dying to go back and play some Rygar.
448970	450450	So it's been like an old school arcade day.
450530	453171	It is, I think, one of the backwards compatible games.
453191	453371	It is.
453531	453771	It is.
453911	454751	That's why I know I can play it.
454771	455832	That came up in our discussion today.
456032	456172	Yeah.
456993	459903	So, because I don't think Dan knew that it was backwards compatible and is one of the few.
460211	461151	I don't think he checked.
461711	463892	I think Taito had like the Rainbow Islands and Bubble Bobble.
463912	465092	I can't remember what was in that collection.
465132	468413	It was years ago that I first got it but now it's pretty awesome.
468433	469273	Parasol Stars.
469413	473233	A lot of those arcade games kind of get recycled and they want to charge you five, ten bucks a piece for them.
473353	474334	I love Parasol Stars.
474454	481035	I found a copy of Parasol Stars for a PC Engine and they wanted like a bunch of money for it which was retarded.
481775	482195	I'm sorry.
482575	483435	Which was stupid.
483455	485456	I'm sorry if I offended some retarded people out there.
486516	486836	Whatever.
488538	498147	I was trying to see if I could find the Taito Arcade Classics page, but I can't find it.
498327	500729	It's an older game, so it's probably harder to find.
501710	503752	And I don't want to hear anything about Pokemans.
504973	505593	Are you jealous?
505613	508816	I've already heard about Pokemans from when Shane was playing through Pokemans.
508856	509857	It's all old news.
512720	539245	I find it fascinating how many people are going to get Pokemon Black and White on the 3DS even though you can play it on a DS Lite but because the launch lineup for 3DS is not as strong as it could have been there's a lot of people that want to use Pokemon to kind of fill in the gap Pokemon fans are pretty rabid so it's a big day for a lot of people Dan has announced that we are waiting for Star Fox to get our 3DS and I want Kid Icarus
540447	542127	GameDevStory GameDevStory GameDevStory GameDevStory
569873	577395	and so you can develop games and stuff like that and I'm just kicking ass at it and it's kind of funny though because
579176	599635	It takes place during pre-Nintendo and stuff like that, but there's all these different systems with different names that are supposed to be those consoles, like the Nintendo IES or the Neon Geon, stuff like that.
602097	603879	I have my company, Orange Lounge, here.
604980	610583	Let me go over some of the past products that we have put out and that have sold well.
611303	615205	And of course, everything is really inappropriate, so that's awesome.
616426	616986	Very awesome.
617727	623270	One of our first games, Two Girls, One Cup, sold 847,000 units.
623430	625171	Of course, that's early on.
626832	630954	Pokemans, we put out a game called Pokemans, sold 2.7 million units.
633836	647415	Some of the other more popular games, Fucked Your Mom, 4 million units, Pokemon 3, 11 million, You Is Stupid, which is our You Don't Know Jack game.
649457	654741	and then of course I ripped off other things obviously since Nintendo doesn't exist so we have Mario RPG as well.
655802	659505	Pokemon Online, 54 million copies.
660046	662528	That's pretty awesome.
663829	666932	And then of course our last music game DDR, Olarmy, 46 million.
669548	675811	And that's on our console, the glory hole, because they happen to be watching the soup at the time.
677152	681053	And our console is kicking the PlayStation's ass.
682854	683154	Wow.
684175	686296	I gotta do a quick correction, so I apologize.
687456	689297	I blended my companies together.
689617	694860	The Rygar and Tecmo Bowl, of course, are in the Tecmo Classic Arcade Collection, not Taito.
695566	702068	Sorry, a very similar sounding in my arcade classic knowledge failed me for a moment, but there's Tecmo Classic Arcade.
702428	703869	That is the one that is backwards compatible.
704309	708550	Bomb Jack, Rygar, Tecmo Bowl, Solomon's Key, lots of awesome ones.
708810	710791	There is a separate game called Tidal Legends.
711151	718313	I can't remember if this one was backwards compatible, but this was the one that had like the Bubble Bobble, Space Invaders, Elevator Action, New Zealand Story, and some of those games.
718614	719694	So, oops!
721823	722723	I'm getting old, sorry.
723424	724424	And these games are how many years old?
724904	731767	And funny enough, Frisbee, uh, Fucked Your Mom, the sequel, Fucked Your Dad, that is actually the sequel, so, uh, pretty funny.
732327	737529	Um, you know, but the game, it's all, like, done in pixel art, and it's, um, it's pretty fun.
737809	751194	You basically, you hire people, fire people, you train them, that you can, uh, eventually get, like, uh, you can go to E3, or, I think they call it Game Dex, it's like, uh, Comdex, um,
751957	756759	SSJ100 Matt wants to know what theyplay.com Snap is selling.
757420	759160	That's an old school by the way.
760221	761181	Don't have that game yet.
761942	763182	We may have to develop that game.
764163	768025	But we just put out Call of Duty and sold 7 million units in the first week.
768045	773507	And don't forget my dream game for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade would be Granny's Got a Gun.
775188	776068	Granny's Got a Gun.
776929	779570	And it's the Golden Girls with machine guns.
780171	787338	Yes, and it's great though because you can see what your console, how it's doing and stuff in the marketplace.
787798	789160	They even have the Virtual Boy.
790124	795586	and all the console stuff since we kind of know what's going on with the game industry and everything.
796326	799668	It's like, okay, here comes the virtual kid.
800068	802649	It's a 3D handheld or 3D portable.
803309	806170	I don't think I'll be developing on that because I think it's going away really fast.
806210	808791	And sure enough, it goes away really fast.
809251	810252	Just like the other ones.
811172	813673	Instead of the Saturn, it's the Uranus.
816385	844382	But yeah, it's pretty fun Definitely worth picking up Game Dev Story And they have the new one They don't have it over here yet But they have some spa sim They have the spa sim over here Which is kind of dumb But they have a game store It's called the Game Dealer And you play like a GameStop type thing It's a similar game, Dev Story I've heard about that But yeah, definitely, Game Dev Story Check it out, it's awesome Alright
846033	847094	Oh, and then other things.
847214	847734	I'm sorry.
847794	848154	Sure.
848254	848715	Grand Theft Auto.
849295	850275	Of course, of course.
850595	852276	Wouldn't be a week on OLR without Grand Theft Auto.
852596	856718	In fact, was that what you were playing a minute ago that was in like debug mode or something where you had the flying ice cream truck?
857379	859279	No, that was the PC version.
859600	868824	I'm working on mod stuff for it because I've edited the water and everything to create this kind of a hydro thunder type track thing in there.
869344	872045	So I'm building, I've done the water part of it.
872105	873226	Called Ice Cream Thunder.
873246	873326	Yeah.
873886	874286	So I don't know.
901744	903625	Jack in the Box Jack in the Box
922580	937035	No, but you can... Some other map edit stuff I was working on, I was doing some tweaks to the physics of the bus and the ambulance, and so now I can clear Central Park with a ramp, which is awesome.
937075	938376	That bus moves fast.
938396	939317	Nice.
940538	940818	I don't know.
940858	945020	They need to bring back something like hard drive and modernize it with more stunts.
945340	947401	I mean, I guess you could say, well, like, Burnout or whatever.
947461	950902	Well, that would technically be... Well, yeah, I mean, like, I understand.
950922	954844	As far as, like, that game Stunts, I guess that would be Trackmania.
954864	956024	It would be kind of similar to Stunts.
956064	956844	Oh, yeah, Trackmania.
956944	961526	But, you know, as far as, like, a simulation racing game like that, I don't think they have that.
961866	967288	Hey, but hey, you know, EA, Need for Speed, you know, maybe some Need for Speed stunt game or something like that.
967308	967869	That would be fun.
968969	970510	Alright, my gaming week.
970910	972231	A lot of the same stuff.
972311	974512	I haven't really invested a lot in new games lately.
974552	975913	I was tempted the other day, though, man.
975933	979055	The Dreamcast Collection with Space Channel 5 Part 2.
980275	983377	Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure, which are already out on Xbox Live Arcade.
983417	989160	But I didn't because I figured the game I really, really want, it'll come out on Xbox Live Arcade eventually.
989180	994443	And if I really, really, really wanted to play it, I could probably just borrow, you know, Alan's copy or Jamie's copy or something.
994503	994603	So...
995443	998445	I'll just wait a little longer for some choo-choo in Space Channel 5 Part 2.
999706	1005390	As far as games I actually did play, went back, today I was feeling really old school for some reason.
1005750	1012175	I went back and played Bionic Commando Rearmed because I was going through my Xbox games because I bought a lot of arcade games back in the day and I was like,
1012515	1012975	Thanks for watching!
1031247	1031988	Yeah, you can't forget.
1032649	1035992	Especially for you folks who are just now getting Xbox 360s.
1036032	1039776	I think sometimes you can get a little bit distracted by all the arcade games that are out there now.
1039836	1045703	But seriously, there's a lot of old school stuff that's really pretty good out on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1045763	1047525	So do your research because...
1047785	1048085	DarkSakura.com
1066002	1080141	Um, as far as other games I played this week, I did check out the demo for one new game, Beyond Good and Evil HD, which is of course the big Xbox Live title that came out this week, which made a lot of people really excited because the original game has lots and lots and lots of fans, and
1080953	1082093	Let me admit something to you guys.
1082393	1083794	I never really played the original.
1084114	1088055	I know, I know it was like a huge game, had its fans on PC, PS2.
1088195	1097197	Again, I think the original kind of came out during a time where I wasn't, either I was way too hardcore into the music games where I was missing a lot of this stuff, or I don't know.
1097217	1101778	I just, you know, there's not enough time in the day to play everything, so I missed this the first time around.
1102218	1107679	But I checked it out this time, and I at least played through the demo, and I was left wanting to get the full version.
1108600	1109800	It was pretty cool.
1110220	1115603	So having not played the original, I can't sit here and profess to know a lot about what they upgraded, but I will tell you it was widescreen.
1116143	1122886	It definitely seemed like there was a lot of water effects that seemed to be somewhat new, and everything seemed to be very, very smooth.
1123967	1128489	It did kind of look like an up-resed PlayStation 2 game, but that's okay.
1128549	1135732	I mean, I hear a lot of people are really drawn to this game because of the story, and I know this game really throws you in right away.
1137153	1137753	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1156718	1161941	having to play the first 30 minutes or so in the demo was nice.
1162181	1168845	So I will check out more of that if I don't get too distracted by Torchlight next week because that is the Xbox Live game I am waiting for.
1168965	1170126	I love the PC one.
1170586	1172607	I'm so excited to see how it translates to console.
1172887	1177870	I'm really worried I'm getting my expectations way too high that I'm going to be just left disappointed next week.
1178270	1180131	But hopefully I can fit in Beyond Good and Evil HD too.
1180151	1182693	According to GameGuru, Space Channel 5 is on Steam.
1183693	1184213	Yes, it did.
1184313	1187415	It came out, I believe, over the weekend on Steam.
1187455	1188815	It just kind of suddenly showed up.
1188935	1192537	So yeah, if you want to check that out on the PC, that'd be cool.
1194418	1196799	All right, so that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
1197099	1199100	Those two games and some of the usual stuff.
1199220	1201401	WoW and some other PC games and so forth.
1201461	1203422	Super Meat Boy, getting frustrated.
1203462	1206003	Tried some of those new levels that we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show.
1206363	1207344	Couldn't even beat one.
1207864	1210665	Couldn't even beat stage one on some of those really hard ones.
1211105	1211705	Disgusting.
1212386	1212906	All right, anyhow.
1213689	1217652	Let's get into some housekeeping and then we will get into the gaming news for tonight.
1218112	1223296	Not a lot to say for housekeeping except DarkSakura sadly will not be joining us next week, but there will still be an OLR.
1223556	1224476	Loki and I will be here.
1224897	1227278	Perhaps a guest host.
1227739	1228019	I don't know.
1228039	1228359	We'll see.
1228899	1229700	I will be in a car.
1229980	1231942	Yes, you're going far away.
1232722	1233583	Far, far away.
1233703	1234363	I hope you have fun.
1235244	1236865	Don't go too far that you can't come back.
1237606	1239947	Because we can go one week, but I don't know about two weeks.
1240508	1241028	Not be back.
1241228	1241469	All right.
1242990	1245231	Join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1245251	1248214	You can join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Laundry.
1248534	1254358	Speaking of Twitter, I'm peeking at it a little early tonight, and I thought this was a really funny tweet from Defective Candy sent us a tweet.
1254738	1256680	I know I'm getting to Twitter early, so shoot me.
1257371	1259974	Introducing OLR to seven of my friends tonight.
1260314	1264377	We're partying it up with some old school Unreal LAN partying and tuning in.
1265178	1267000	Well, shout out to you guys at the LAN party.
1267020	1268081	That sounds pretty awesome.
1268741	1270122	Kicking it old school with Unreal.
1271483	1276648	Back in the day, this might be a little more even old school than Unreal, but back in the day we used to get together and play Quake.
1277288	1278289	That used to be kind of the big thing.
1278309	1279891	This is like way before MMOs and all that.
1280171	1281892	We'd get together and play Quake like online.
1281953	1283114	It was just a lot of fun.
1283234	1284455	My first LAN was Duke Nukem 3D.
1285552	1285812	Oh yeah?
1286553	1288634	Yeah, I used to do that on the modem, the dial-up thing.
1288654	1289474	It was a lot of fun.
1289534	1292415	Duke Nukem and Command & Conquer Red Alert were fun over the modem.
1292595	1292836	Nice.
1293516	1296757	So, I hope you guys are having fun and thanks for spreading the word of the show.
1296777	1297398	I appreciate it.
1297878	1298878	Alright, let's get to the news.
1299899	1301400	And Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1301920	1302200	Oh yeah.
1302280	1304001	Much busier week than last week, that's for sure.
1304443	1311612	Yeah, it helps to have stuff going on and conferences and whatnot.
1312092	1319962	We did talk about this a little bit, that it was a possibility, especially with LG suing Sony over the Blu-ray technology.
1320402	1321203	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1343539	1345241	I only know what that's supposed to do for 10 days.
1345842	1354952	Apparently, the consoles collected are temporarily being held in Dutch warehouses until the case moves forward.
1355413	1358336	But right now, they're expected to...
1360773	1376612	I guess retailers are expected to have enough PS3s the last 2 or 3 weeks so you may not necessarily see any shortages or something like that you may if this case goes further and they end up winning everything because somebody's going to have to pay them some money
1378342	1383224	Do you think maybe that's just what's going to ultimately happen, is that this all gets settled out of court to stop this from happening?
1384004	1385825	It all depends.
1385845	1388385	90% of the game lawsuit stories end up settled out of court.
1388546	1391266	It all depends whether they feel they're in the right or not.
1391987	1400430	If Sony knows that they have no chance at winning this, then they probably won't fight it, but...
1401870	1413276	If they think that they're in the right and they don't need to pay them any royalties or whatever, they're going to fight it because it saves them money if they don't have to pay these royalties on every single console shipped.
1414077	1416038	How damaging is this to Sony, do you think?
1416058	1422601	Because I look at this and go, well, if they can't ship it to stores, are stores still okay for a little bit because stores have what's on hand?
1422621	1423101	I mean, come on.
1423402	1424882	It's just a shortage for 10 days.
1425102	1426063	It's no big deal.
1426420	1426620	Yeah.
1427841	1431503	It's not like the PlayStation 3 has a must-have game coming out this week or something.
1431743	1434624	People deal with shortages on stuff for a lot longer than 10 days.
1434664	1435445	I mean, look at the Wii.
1435665	1436705	And it's just fine.
1437246	1438786	I doubt this will make any sort of impact.
1439427	1448972	It's just everybody likes reporting on this stuff because, ha-ha, Sony's getting their taste of legal battles since they're suing GeoHot and stuff like that.
1449632	1449892	Whatever.
1450332	1451133	You know, it's just...
1452554	1452794	That's true.
1452814	1454376	You can't say this is so much a patent troll thing.
1454396	1454776	No, this is not.
1454856	1455297	Interesting.
1469110	1470951	Alright, well we'll see what comes of this.
1471191	1474452	The legal team at Sony working overtime these next couple weeks for sure.
1475633	1481115	Big, big gaming news and kind of always divisive when I talk about Apple.
1481755	1486917	And Apple did announce the iPad 2 is coming out March 11th and you bet this is gaming news because...
1488318	1493305	A lot of folks are gaming on the Apple these days with the iPhone and the iOS.
1493385	1494226	Big, big system.
1494647	1500976	Controversial, too, if you want to get into the whole fact that they charge very little for the games on the iPhone.
1501637	1504300	Some people have a problem with that, as we learned at GDC this week.
1504821	1529965	but I digress iPad 2 was announced this week it is coming out on March 11th it will cost you anywhere between $629 and $829 if you want a unit with 3G lowest you can go though is $499 if you want the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi only up to $699 just throwing it out there too if you wanted to get the original iPad those are now sliced in price by $100 so those are now out as well
1530265	1545876	Some of the big things that are supposed to be coming out with the iPad 2, it's not just the fancy colors, but of particular interest is this cable that will allow you to hook up the iPad to your television and get the output in 1080p display, which is making a lot of people very excited.
1545896	1551080	Of course, streaming movies that are on the device makes it very easy to bypass the Apple TV and so forth in order to do that.
1554122	1559266	But a lot of people also wondering, could this have some feature for games going with it?
1559306	1564750	Where you could use the cord to have the iPad as a control device for something on your TV?
1565190	1570895	Angry Birds HD No, I mean, who wants to be tethered to a TV?
1571735	1574878	Unless they have some sort of wireless thing, it's not
1575518	1603459	Which quite frankly I'm surprised they don't through the whole Apple TV thing They may later on They can stream stuff through Apple TV and it could be something that comes through iOS later on We did have the story last week or two weeks ago about the whole people were playing PS3 games through the iOS was a whole thing that had been set up The technology is getting there and that has nothing to do with Apple themselves That was kind of a
1604160	1605553	Filed in the Hack and Crack bin
1606348	1608729	Yeah, but that's a little in the reverse.
1608769	1618394	That's not necessarily... I mean, playing PlayStation 1 emulated games, that's through the actual system that's running that.
1618494	1624197	But streaming stuff from the PlayStation 3, though, that's a little bit different.
1624217	1625257	That's just streaming video.
1626018	1633742	And I mean, I'm sure that the... Obviously, since the iPad 2 is a dual-core system, I'm sure it can handle streaming stuff, but...
1635062	1643427	As far as the Apple TV goes, that thing is just like an Intel Atom little box.
1643487	1649109	I don't think it has enough oomph to do 1080p.
1649150	1653592	I think it's capped at 720p because I think that's what iTunes is.
1653792	1655153	The ones that are out there now, yeah, 720p.
1656253	1661336	Let me throw this question out there to you guys here in studio and the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1661676	1670282	There's been a lot of talk this week with this news and in the game blogs and so forth about the 3DS, which we'll get into some of that news in a little while, and the iPad 2.
1671790	1672731	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1689811	1690752	What do you guys kind of think?
1691112	1695295	Does the 3DS really have to worry about iPad 2 or vice versa?
1695755	1700518	Or do these things kind of coexist and neither really has to really worry about the other?
1700538	1701779	So why are they dogging on each other?
1701819	1704301	I think it's the latter, but you know how companies are.
1704361	1707002	They like to look for drama where there isn't.
1707563	1710405	And on top of that, the rivalry is only good for both of them.
1711265	1713987	Establishing some type of farcical rivalry.
1714227	1714327	Yeah.
1716767	1724935	Unfortunately, Nintendo will never be able to compete with Apple as far as their online marketplace goes because their online marketplace is open.
1725355	1734244	It's an open marketplace for all these developers to basically create these games, submit them, get approval, and then they are up on the marketplace really quickly.
1734264	1735265	That's why you get like...
1735865	1736686	Thanks for watching!
1753298	1763562	Um, but see, that's what Nintendo needs, because, unfortunately, you're never gonna be able to compete the level with these guys if you're just releasing, like, three games a week, you know, on that.
1763942	1767243	And, I'm sorry, but, you know, the virtual console stuff...
1768263	1769004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1784480	1791285	Cut the Rope, the stuff that's really good on iOS, of which there isn't much, but there are some really, really good games on there.
1791305	1797570	There are good games on the iOS platform, and it's just some of these games that people just decide that they like.
1797690	1800433	Angry Birds, I don't think is a great game.
1801233	1801654	I'm sorry.
1801714	1802534	It's a game that's popular.
1802554	1805356	Well, Sam's Frustrating Game is what it is.
1805637	1807098	But the public disagrees.
1808417	1809557	Public's dumb.
1809637	1810738	It's selling very well.
1811378	1812098	I mean, okay.
1812238	1813419	I don't think it's all that either.
1813479	1814359	I prefer Cut the Rope.
1814619	1818020	But I can say, okay, it's selling like... But exactly.
1818100	1819281	And you know what, though?
1819761	1821562	I wouldn't be surprised.
1821642	1825903	And there's no reason why they can't have Angry Birds on the Nintendo DS.
1826083	1827423	Right now, on the DSi.
1828004	1829644	Why can't they have Angry Birds on there?
1831245	1832405	I mean, it should be able to run.
1832425	1833125	PSP has it.
1833466	1834286	It was a download game.
1834426	1836326	It didn't... I mean, it came out way later.
1836467	1837067	But, I mean...
1839031	1840732	That's even the problem with the PSP.
1840872	1847355	Their little online stuff, it's so closed that they just can't get games fast enough.
1847835	1849436	They need to really open it up.
1850777	1856520	I mean, I think the closest thing to the App Store is probably the Xbox Indie games.
1856820	1859141	Because your lease is there, you're seeing a lot of games coming out.
1859301	1862663	Granted, a lot of them are crap, but that's the same with the App Store.
1862683	1863483	A lot of it is crap.
1864243	1865204	But if you open it up...
1867745	1868726	A lot more stuff comes out.
1868846	1872568	And yeah, you're going to get a lot of crappy games, but you're also going to get a lot of good games.
1872608	1883195	And if you're smart and know how to highlight those good games and know how to push that platform forward, then that is good for you.
1883716	1888439	The problem with Nintendo, though, is if they do that and they start pushing that platform forward...
1889019	1890740	Who's going to want to pay $50 for a game?
1891300	1898783	Because then they can just get some really quality games for like 99 cents or a few bucks instead of $50.
1899504	1903926	Why should I pay $50 for a 3DS game like Zelda?
1903966	1904266	Because it's 3D!
1904286	1905506	So what if it's 3D?
1909148	1911610	It doesn't mean that those digital download games aren't 3D.
1911990	1913591	They could easily program for 3D.
1913872	1919336	Just like there's going to be indie games that are going to support the Kinect eventually once they open it up for everybody.
1921978	1923979	Why should I have to pay that kind of money?
1924480	1925521	And that's what they're complaining about.
1925541	1930204	They're complaining about the fact that they think that these games are devaluing their games.
1930865	1932726	Well, why do you think that?
1932806	1935988	Because obviously if you think your games are so much better...
1937029	1938392	Thank you for watching!
1951516	1952597	Let's go to comments from our chat room.
1952637	1955098	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com for some comments.
1955178	1961403	DarkTitsuya says, I think Nintendo's just jealous because they can't keep releasing all new hardware after a year the way Apple seems to.
1961883	1962643	They don't need to.
1962683	1963644	They do, but they do.
1963964	1968607	The DS Lite, the DS Lite in new colors, the DSi.
1969108	1970048	The XL.
1970889	1974011	As of lately, I would say they have been doing something new every year.
1974051	1974531	Yeah, the XL.
1974571	1974791	Yeah.
1975692	1979934	But see, that's even retarded too, because what's the point of making the system larger?
1980094	1982755	How is this supposed to drive sales for you guys?
1982855	1983936	I never understood that.
1984316	1985976	Let's make a portable system larger now.
1986817	1987037	What?
1987597	1987897	Why?
1988437	1990718	It's just like, oh, let's make the Game Boy Micro.
1990798	1994880	GameGuru says Nintendo pretty much dumped every game they do own on the virtual console.
1995180	1997741	Or at least, well, every game they could dump.
1998442	2001143	I guess maybe a dig at EarthBound, because the whole trouble's there.
2001163	2001623	They're not thinking...
2001923	2009426	The problem is they're a few steps behind when it comes to embracing online.
2009746	2013448	They're not where these first party companies are.
2015389	2017470	They're not supporting download content as well.
2017730	2019831	Why aren't there downloadable tracks for Mario Kart?
2020991	2021591	I mean, come on.
2021931	2023572	And that's stupid simple.
2024452	2027013	You could easily just put out all... Because the Wii can't handle it.
2027614	2028494	I mean, I know it can.
2028534	2029454	The Wii can handle it.
2029694	2035177	But see, the problem with the Wii, though, is because they, you know...
2036297	2036818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2055220	2057861	So if it's that easy, open it up like Mod Nation Racers.
2058001	2060462	Oh my god, you've got a community of people that are excited about a game.
2060482	2065883	You can even start charging for some download content, different tools and stuff that you can put in there like LittleBigPlanet.
2066003	2067404	You can make money off this.
2067424	2071265	The problem is they need to change their stupid business model in order for it to work.
2072345	2075306	I'm sorry, but I just don't see them ever embracing online like that.
2076891	2083057	Let me ask you this and then kind of try to close to this thought because I want to come, believe it or not, I want to come back to the Wii thing later in the show because I have another question about it.
2083598	2084338	But let me ask this.
2084999	2092265	You say they need to change their business model, but at the same time, numbers say they have the number one console in America, period.
2092726	2095889	I mean, so why do they need to change their business model?
2095909	2096569	They're number one.
2097410	2098391	I hate it.
2098591	2099092	You hate it.
2099312	2101734	We all hate it, but they are number one for right now.
2103379	2104239	I mean, that's the problem.
2104399	2105580	That's a cocky attitude though.
2105620	2108421	If you say, oh, but we're number one, we can do whatever the hell we want.
2109141	2116584	That's great until Apple decides to put out a console and then they have this app store and you can download all these games for 99 cents.
2117204	2121446	Or let's just say that they're iPad prices and it's like two bucks a game or something like that.
2122826	2130789	I'm sorry, but a lot of people, there are a lot of good games out there that are on these marketplaces, even like the Android marketplace and stuff.
2132742	2139150	Not everybody really wants you to spend the kind of development time that it costs for a $50 game.
2139430	2141513	For example, a perfect example...
2142799	2143459	Excite Truck.
2143859	2144640	I love that game.
2144680	2145680	That game is awesome.
2145880	2151802	All they needed to do was release download content for it or a sequel that had basically the same style of gameplay, just more track.
2151822	2152522	Not Excite Bots.
2152762	2153542	Not Excite Bots.
2153642	2156543	Excite Bots was... I don't even know what the hell they were doing.
2156963	2160084	But I know Nintendo was behind that kind of crap.
2160324	2161204	Hey, you know what would be better?
2161444	2163025	If we made some more minigames in there.
2163345	2167386	It does not belong... Minigames do not belong in a racing game.
2167846	2168786	It's stupid.
2169186	2171307	It's really, really stupid.
2174142	2175704	All they had to do was download content.
2176004	2180229	And they could have still made some money on top of that.
2180970	2185654	Games like that, even if they have download content, do not devalue their sequels when they come out.
2186055	2188357	So what if there's good download content for that?
2188878	2193523	People will be more willing to buy the next game because they know they're going to be supporting download content on top of that.
2194003	2202725	or hell, you can put out the game for a cheaper cost and then have in-game downloads or something like that you can add to it and increase value that way.
2203085	2207786	There's just so many ways that they could do it but they don't want to because you know what?
2208506	2209647	People don't download games.
2210007	2210667	That's what they think.
2210767	2211827	People don't download games.
2211907	2214968	Well, I think Apple would disagree with you on that.
2216169	2218011	So, let me ask this question.
2218191	2220133	How do you kind of feel about Nintendo right now?
2220253	2225498	Because I do notice you're looking at eBay on your computer looking for 3DSs right now.
2225878	2229161	There's a part of you that must... There's something Nintendo's doing right for you.
2229601	2231943	Well, I just get every console, okay?
2233004	2238990	That doesn't even necessarily... And I was just looking to see if anybody's actually offering up a Japanese system for a decent price.
2240071	2250383	I'm sorry, but even though $350 is a good price for a Japanese console, and it is in California, although his reserve price is probably $500, so screw that.
2251203	2252345	You know me, I like getting stuff early.
2253056	2255957	Anyways, but no, I'm not actually going to probably buy that.
2256057	2265982	I will buy a 3DS when it comes out because I think it's a cool technology, but I got to be honest, the launch lineup is very disappointing.
2266162	2277427	I'm like sitting there going, looking at the tiles coming out, I'm like, well, I'll pick up Pilotwings because that looks fun, but it's like, and then Nintendo's like, but we have Steel Diver.
2277567	2279208	It's a 2D submarine game.
2280980	2281880	Oh, cool.
2282440	2284921	I mean, you know, that's neat, I guess.
2285521	2287641	Or like, you know, hey, we have Nintendogs.
2288282	2289382	Arf, arf, and cats.
2289442	2289742	Meow, meow.
2289762	2290702	Nintendogs and cats.
2292362	2296143	Or, hey, hey, hey, we've got Ocarina of Time.
2297464	2299044	Like, I was reading the news articles.
2299304	2303225	Oh, my God, Master Quest is in Ocarina of Time for the 3DS.
2303265	2304285	That's so amazing.
2304805	2306268	GameGuru says, your Mario Kart example doesn't work.
2306288	2307811	Nintendo only makes one Mario Kart per system.
2319487	2322049	I'm talking about other consoles though.
2323129	2326572	This is even bad now as far as the trend goes.
2327353	2333337	Remember before with Mario Kart for the GameCube I think was the first one they did?
2333397	2335879	It's like, oh look, we've got some of the older tracks in there.
2335939	2336820	Oh, that's kind of cool.
2337040	2339042	A little bit of retro nostalgia there.
2339542	2340724	Game Boy Advance Super Nintendo Nostalgia
2352031	2353072	and now all of them do.
2353332	2355213	Half the tracks are all old tracks.
2355914	2357074	Come on, man.
2358075	2359496	That's lazy right there.
2359516	2360917	You have to admit, Rainbow Road's pretty sweet.
2361317	2366981	They have Rainbow... But yeah, I understand it's really sweet, but there's a new Rainbow Road in every game.
2369262	2372084	It's not necessary to put in one of the...
2375487	2392206	Mario Circuit Tracks from the Game Boy Advance and my 3DS version or something like that they just have such potential a track editor would be so awesome but they'll never do it because they're afraid that people will
2394187	2396869	Drive Mario into a fire repeatedly over and over again
2409557	2410337	Thanks for watching!
2431690	2432511	Come on, people.
2433572	2436035	Mario Kart's a cool game and stuff.
2436235	2438858	Even your Mario games are fun or Zelda or whatever.
2439218	2444724	But if you throw in some sort of community aspect to it, people get really excited about it.
2444824	2446986	And I think that's going to speak a lot louder than...
2448107	2449509	Oh hey, we put out a Mario Kart game.
2449589	2451511	Yeah, I know you're going to put out a Mario Kart game on the 3S.
2451711	2454134	You're also going to put out a Mario Kart game on the next console you put out.
2454194	2455135	I mean, that's dumb.
2455916	2456616	In a Zelda game.
2457057	2458438	I mean, we know that's coming.
2460481	2461702	We'd be dumb to think otherwise.
2462643	2468870	But they have such potential, they just really are squandering it.
2469731	2470911	Alright, let's move on.
2471472	2473894	DarkSakura's been waiting to talk about her next story.
2474014	2474775	I've given up.
2474855	2476596	I'm looking at Monday through Friday.
2476816	2477097	Alright.
2478478	2479579	More to come later though.
2479619	2484883	We haven't finished the Nintendo news yet and I've got another killer question for Loki in a little bit here on the show.
2485407	2490331	GameStop has yet another class action lawsuit.
2491011	2495154	We've gotten a lot of money from GameStop because of employee stuff.
2495955	2506022	And apparently now people should be getting more... Anyone who's bought anything ever from GameStop, actually, that used their credit card to buy it, should be getting their $5.
2507583	2520792	because apparently they acquire additional personal information including the cardholder's physical residential address by pairing the personal identification information with the cardholder's name obtained from the credit card.
2521232	2523794	So basically, you swipe your card, they get all your info.
2524975	2530461	It's not saying what they're doing with it, but they're supposedly doing it against your knowledge.
2531141	2536687	But here's the thing, everywhere that you use your credit card does that without your knowledge.
2537268	2544336	So this is me, we're going to have class action lawsuits against the grocery store and the porn shop and...
2544756	2572085	I don't think it's necessarily that I think it's more because you have to put in all your personal info for like trades or whatever that they're basically saying okay this person here's this person and this person paid here's their name okay we're going to link their card number to this address now which is not good especially if that information just kind of gets leaked out I'm sure those GameStop employees are very trustworthy as far as you know
2572705	2575268	Minimum wage, that has a lot of trust built into it.
2575768	2580493	They kind of should have some people's addresses on file, though, for the people that like to sell back stolen games.
2580553	2584237	That's the point, too, is that I think that it's a good idea.
2584357	2590443	I mean, I don't see any problem with it as long as they're not selling it, and if you're on the opt-out list, then they can't.
2591845	2591925	Um...
2593792	2594692	Identity theft sucks and so forth.
2615729	2629339	This isn't something that... Unless someone actually breaks into a database that all of their stuff is uploaded to and steals the information directly out of the database, I don't think that there's much of a problem.
2631422	2634703	William Murderface in our chatroom says, so GameStop wants to troll me?
2634903	2635763	I don't know how to react.
2636663	2638764	Ranma in our chatroom says, I hate when I swipe my card.
2639144	2642725	Some terminals require your zip code and you can't continue your transaction without it.
2643025	2644425	Isn't that a credit card protection thing?
2644465	2647626	Like at Chevron, a gas station, I don't know if those are everywhere.
2647886	2653267	But at Chevron, when I do the swipe, it always makes me put in my zip code because that's how it knows that I'm... Yeah.
2656369	2658771	Apparently it's illegal, but I still don't see what the big deal is.
2658832	2665037	Because it's not like they can actually go out and sell your information without your permission.
2665998	2667959	Or they have to let you know that they're doing it.
2668019	2677127	If this is just something that automatically pops up, especially if they need to do consumer tracking, I don't see what the big problem is.
2677647	2678168	I really don't.
2680029	2683291	Even... I mean, I really... I think that people are just being paranoid.
2683772	2684052	Really.
2684512	2686333	So if you want to get your $5, go ahead.
2686373	2687414	That's all you're going to get.
2687814	2688014	Maybe $1.50.
2688695	2697381	That's the other thing with these class action lawsuits is that, well, you know, even though you might go, eh, GameStop's getting sued, likely they'll settle out of court because that's the way these things tend to go.
2697841	2705706	And, you know, it'll be like $2 to those that send in a form that swear on an affidavit that their privacy was breached or whatever.
2705746	2708328	You know, it'll be interesting to see how that goes.
2709289	2709429	So...
2710849	2716132	Marisa Congusto in our chatroom says, gas stations are allowed to do this because they do not store it for marketing.
2716432	2718593	We just discussed this in Business Law the other day.
2718833	2721094	I don't think that they keep it for marketing either.
2723174	2723494	Really?
2724795	2728036	We bought stuff at GameStop and never gotten offers and stuff.
2728216	2730797	Yeah, I've never been spammed by them or what have you.
2730817	2734479	We only ever got coupons and stuff when we had a subscription to Game Informer and it came with our magazine.
2734599	2735719	I am spammed by them.
2736060	2736320	Are you?
2736580	2738801	Did you sign up for their little card though?
2738901	2739481	Maybe that's why.
2739847	2744289	I signed up for their card, and then I get two emails from them every week.
2744589	2746589	Because I told them, like, I'm on your mailing list twice.
2746609	2747530	You need to take me off there.
2748370	2748810	Oh, okay.
2749811	2750311	Never happened.
2750611	2758634	And then I also get, oh, hey, you know, you can get this special, you know, this is for GameStop people only.
2759054	2760274	It's a special survey thing.
2760314	2761955	You go fill out surveys and you get cash.
2762035	2764376	It's like, stop bothering me with that crap.
2765756	2772561	Ram on our chatroom says, when I swipe my CC to refill my MetroCard, it asks for verification that I get, but not when I'm in Kmart.
2772621	2773722	It asks every single time.
2773762	2774702	That's not credit card protecting.
2774722	2775823	They're pulling for where people live.
2776103	2777204	Yeah, Kohl's does that, too.
2777524	2778545	They always ask your zip code.
2779766	2781807	That is actually illegal to ask that.
2781827	2782447	Yeah, that's fine.
2782487	2783928	It's for demographic information.
2784429	2785650	That's still legal to ask that.
2785670	2788171	There's actually a... I never said it wasn't.
2788371	2789472	Can't you just say no?
2789852	2790673	Yes, you can say no.
2790853	2795076	And then they don't... You can tell them you don't want to give it, and that can't stop them from...
2796125	2799846	Most of those people that are working there anyway will just be like, alright, whatever.
2800607	2803048	What they'll do, they'll just put in a different zip code.
2803588	2805128	That's what I bet most of them do.
2805148	2808350	You tell them no, they just make up a zip code.
2808450	2811211	You know that's what's happening.
2812311	2814692	Most of the people on the front lines like that don't care.
2816880	2822229	I sometimes feel bad for them because then they're the ones that take the brunt of all this hatred towards the collecting and so forth.
2824153	2825335	Alright, let's move on.
2826016	2826817	More news.
2827218	2829342	Release dates coming up with Classic Game of the Week as well.
2830615	2831935	Yeah.
2832176	2833156	So this is interesting.
2833216	2838898	BurgerTime HD, or as I like to call it, BurgerTime Galaxy, because that's certainly what it looks like.
2840138	2843259	It's being developed, I guess, by Monkey Paw Games.
2843660	2852903	It's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC, I'm guessing as part of their digital platforms, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, WiiWare.
2853863	2866148	and they're introducing new monsters or I guess carrots, apple cores, hot peppers, oversized monsters and other fun stuff.
2866368	2867869	They actually had some video online of it.
2868309	2869309	Looks interesting though.
2869349	2872191	You can actually play it multiplayer, split screen, which is kind of cool.
2873151	2875292	But yeah, it definitely looks like BurgerTime Galaxy.
2877693	2878293	Interesting.
2879867	2883148	I do love me some BurgerTime, the old school 80s machine.
2883188	2884268	Did you see the video of it?
2885268	2886949	I haven't actually watched it yet.
2886989	2887609	Is it on YouTube?
2888789	2889230	No.
2890350	2891710	I can pull it up here real quick for you.
2894511	2894891	I know.
2894931	2895911	We need to be more prepared.
2895951	2897332	Let me see if I can find it here on YouTube.
2897352	2897692	There it is.
2898012	2899952	BurgerTime HD level complete gameplay.
2900012	2901153	Let's take a look at this here.
2901173	2904013	I just got to make sure there's no commercial.
2905434	2906154	Holy moly.
2909522	2916147	It's like running around this 3D-looking circle thing, like all the levels have been changed into this giant cylinder.
2919529	2922811	It's a very different look for the game, but it's kind of the same damn game.
2924733	2925613	At least at first glance.
2925913	2927595	Oh, there's this co-op thing going on.
2927615	2928956	Okay, it's not the same game.
2931597	2933279	Very interesting.
2934319	2936321	I do see where you're getting BurgerTime Galaxy, absolutely.
2936341	2936621	Absolutely.
2938513	2939574	That looks like it could be interesting.
2955052	2957073	I'll have to look at the demo for that when that comes out.
2957113	2959594	That was an old school 80s game I really liked.
2959814	2961214	I'm curious how the co-op works.
2961314	2962795	That's something else.
2962875	2963535	You guys want to see it?
2963615	2965976	I just typed BurgerTimeHD into YouTube.
2965996	2966456	It came right up.
2967916	2974959	Alright, speaking of guilty pleasure games, this is one of my biggest guilty pleasure games ever and it's been so long since I've played one of these games.
2975359	2976379	Mortal Kombat.
2976539	2976919	That's right.
2976979	2982361	Mortal Kombat 9 or really it's the reboot, just Mortal Kombat is coming out soon.
2982981	2983861	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2999369	3003171	Next week, March 8th, by the time some of you guys hear this, here's the catch.
3003191	3007774	You've got to be a PlayStation Plus member because they are the ones that are getting the demo first.
3008614	3014798	You'll be able to play a Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, and Johnny Cage in the Living Forest or the Fire Pit.
3015298	3016079	So that's it.
3016619	3017079	Not bad.
3017159	3020680	Most fighting game demos only have two characters, so it's kind of neat that they have four.
3021161	3021781	So there you go.
3022261	3023521	One or two players.
3023681	3025062	I'm imagining not online, though.
3025462	3032104	The other cool news is that not just the demo on March 8th for PlayStation Plus, but everybody will get it March 15th.
3032464	3037826	So if you're like, I don't really want to sign up for PlayStation Plus, you can just wait one more week and you'll be able to get it.
3039708	3040549	Oh, I should say this though.
3040569	3042191	That is only on PlayStation Network.
3042451	3045735	They do not have a firm date for when Xbox Live is getting it.
3045855	3047196	Just later.
3048418	3050740	Could be a lot closer to the game's release in that regard.
3052062	3052843	Very curious about that.
3053203	3074681	by the way also a small follow-up on Mortal Kombat 9 I don't know if you guys heard but it was banned in Australia because they refused to rate the game and when they refuse to rate a game that basically means that the game is banned well the publishers behind Mortal Kombat they are appealing this decision we'll see just how far they get with it so
3077014	3079135	We'll see before the game's release.
3079235	3081716	Either way, it's probably going to end up getting delayed in Australia.
3082396	3085157	Probably a lot of people just going to import the damn thing from somewhere else.
3085878	3086598	I'll probably be out there.
3086618	3092820	Even though that's supposed to be illegal as well, I don't see them exactly banging down doors because people got bootleg copies of Mortal Kombat.
3093301	3094501	So we'll see what happens.
3094621	3098343	And if it has to be bootleg, I'm sure that you can just import it.
3098363	3099463	Most of those games are region free.
3099503	3100784	I don't mean like actual bootlegs.
3100844	3104745	I mean like, you know, PlayStation 3 is region free.
3104925	3106206	So there'll probably be lots of people just...
3107006	3108970	Hitting up Amazon or something, getting a friend in the U.S.
3109010	3110132	to buy it and then ship it to him.
3110833	3111214	There you go.
3113596	3138833	So, also, on Mortal Kombat, one other thing, I remember reading a story about this this week, I wanted to throw this out there, is that there's this whole challenge mode in it, too, and I remember watching a video for it on YouTube, and they were all talking all excited about this, where, I guess, like, 300 levels, and they say you get something super special if you get all the way to the end, I'm assuming you unlock a bonus character or something, that's just my assumption, but it's like all these cool modifiers, like, there's some modifiers, like, Headless Kombat, where you fight with no head, right?
3139714	3156953	kind of reminds me of some old tacky fighting games upside down mode where the image is flipped upside down and that's how you have to play I just thought it was kind of funny so 300 levels though that might be overkill I don't know about that that's going to take a serious investment to get through but we'll see
3158086	3158566	DarkSakura.com
3179585	3180345	Does that make sense?
3180365	3184908	Because I think I might have drunk a little too much Chimay and it's baffling me.
3185568	3186889	It actually kind of does.
3187109	3191692	There's a lot of people that wait to buy a use to just save the $5 because it's cheaper.
3193853	3194573	I could see this.
3195013	3199796	There's some people that sell back their games fast too.
3199836	3202798	I picked up Tron Evolution maybe a week after it was out.
3202838	3204779	Now I realize why someone sold it back so quick.
3204859	3207740	But some games you can get pretty quick that way.
3207980	3209061	Well, ones they already have on...
3210649	3212830	Wait, wait, oh, Dan, you gotta say that on the air.
3212850	3213311	Hold on, Dan.
3213731	3214271	What's that, Dan?
3215532	3217553	GameCrazy fucking did that for free.
3217593	3218014	How so?
3218094	3219374	Like, you just could put your name on a list?
3219394	3223057	Like, you could come in and say, hey, can you give me a call when this game comes in used?
3223537	3224117	And they did it.
3225078	3226159	But they went out of business.
3226399	3227479	And why did they go out of business?
3228320	3230001	Because Hollywood Entertainment sucked.
3232583	3233063	Sorry to hear it.
3234585	3242148	At any rate, some of the games on the list already are Crysis 2, Homefront Dragon Age 2, Shift 2 Unleashed, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12.
3245149	3248731	So yeah, you can pay five pounds and save a game that's not out yet.
3249091	3253633	Which we'll just go to show you, game stores will take your five dollars for anything.
3254173	3265118	Someone probably had that copy, or when it comes out, they probably got that copy, said this game sucks, and, you know, spanked over it or something, and then took it back, and then you get the spank version.
3267359	3270200	You get it christened with the love of another man.
3270400	3271320	Be careful, though.
3271941	3276883	This could be one of those games that you can't sell back, like DC Universe Online, One Unique Key.
3277383	3279604	So be careful what you pre-order used.
3280094	3281935	I think they've got a specific list for it.
3283316	3287259	GameGuru in our chatroom says, oh great, GameStop is going to push pre-orders of used games now?
3287399	3289920	Oh no, no, no, this is Game in the UK.
3290641	3296785	However, you know if it does well for them, it'll just get copied by everybody else.
3297421	3297762	DarkSakura.com
3312513	3317095	All right, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and games that are coming out real soon.
3318236	3323779	Yes, actually, today, Pokemon Black and White came out, so that's pretty exciting if you're a fan of the Pokemans.
3324299	3327761	Which there are some real rabid fans of Pokemon out there that are over the age of 30.
3328621	3330082	As on the Nintendo DS.
3331262	3334725	This week I actually have a new Kinect game, U-Star 2 in the movies.
3334745	3342872	Remember U-Star was that camera green screen system that they were selling on TV that only worked with PC at one point.
3343053	3347997	Wasn't there already a crappy game like that on 360 that had the vision camera like you in the movies or something?
3349318	3350679	Yeah, that was a little different though.
3350719	3355882	That was more of like you're doing mini games and then it puts you into the game or the movie.
3356042	3356983	It makes a little short film.
3357303	3360846	This is actually, it's like karaoke for movie lines.
3361026	3367871	Basically, you recite movie lines and you can play different people in there and it will actually kind of...
3369411	3373493	Crop the actor or actress out of the scene and it'll put you in their place.
3373753	3378235	And so you can get scored for accuracy and stuff like that.
3379296	3380216	It's neat, I guess.
3380356	3384538	And there's certainly not a lot of Kinect games coming out.
3384578	3388059	That's on PlayStation 3 with Move support.
3388139	3391281	You do need the PlayStation Eye camera, though, if you want to play that.
3391341	3393402	And then, of course, on Xbox 360 for the Kinect.
3395607	3399969	Dragon Age 2 PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 Wii, The One Million Dollar Pyramid
3410266	3412087	Another TV show game.
3413308	3414609	A couple MLB games this week.
3414709	3416650	MLB 2011 The Show.
3417310	3420692	That's on PlayStation 2, PS3, and the PlayStation Portable.
3421312	3430898	Also, MLB 2K11 on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP, I believe.
3432278	3435340	Pets Bunnies Bunch on Nintendo DS.
3435400	3437161	I guess it's gearing up for Easter.
3437181	3438282	Um...
3440080	3441501	What the hell is this?
3442482	3444403	Beastly Frantic Photo?
3448526	3453909	I think this is some sort of stupid application that ties into that crappy movie Beastly.
3453929	3457491	I was going to say, there was a movie with Vanessa Hutchins that came out called Beastly.
3457532	3459093	Yeah, I think that's what this is.
3459293	3461634	I have not heard of that, but that's kind of funny.
3462415	3467218	Yep, I think it's some sort of photo game, and it looks like crap.
3467597	3468898	So it's Vanessa Hudgens' Snap?
3470339	3471560	It might be.
3472421	3473622	Oh, they have a trailer for the movie.
3473702	3474662	I don't really care about that.
3477024	3478725	Alright, moving on.
3478765	3481467	Is Beastly like a knockoff of Twilight?
3481627	3484410	No, it's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.
3485530	3486131	Oh, okay.
3487912	3495141	A modern day retelling of the fairy tale but not with the underground community The guy is suddenly turned ugly by some witch girl and he has to stay in his expensive penthouse
3506560	3507201	Be Our Guest
3520994	3525699	Yeah, just like how, you know, Little Red Riding Hood, I don't remember werewolves being in Little Red Riding Hood.
3525779	3530523	I could be, it's been a while since I heard Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't remember werewolves being in there.
3530663	3532905	And I don't think emo people were in there as well.
3532925	3534247	Now they're making emo Snow White too.
3534287	3541654	Oh, come on, the original Little Red Riding Hood, she gets eaten by the wolf and gets digested and dies.
3543081	3543361	Awesome.
3544122	3545823	As should those types of movies.
3547083	3548364	Atari's Greatest Hits Vol.
3548624	3550185	2 on Nintendo DS coming out this week.
3550625	3554988	Phantom Brave, Heroes of the Hermuda Triangle for the PSP.
3555228	3558049	Not the Bermuda, the Hermuda.
3558169	3559510	Hermuda, like hermaphrodite.
3562132	3562852	Let's see here.
3564773	3565133	Also...
3567315	3567956	What else we got here?
3568036	3571959	Sims 3, Barnacle Bay on PC, in case you want to get your pirate on.
3573881	3574621	For the Sims 3 there.
3576323	3582027	And then some crappy Wii games, Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing, and Maximum Racing, Dragon Sox.
3582047	3583469	And just don't even bother, seriously.
3583929	3584950	And then, because...
3586911	3602218	and I gotta go on the rant mode about this but I'm sorry but like here we go just because Nintendo is so gracious for everybody for a limited time and this is the last time that they're reprinting this game from the Super Nintendo Super Mario All-Stars will be coming out one week from today
3602498	3610482	The Limited Edition, oh my god, limited, going on eBay for $80 because, oh my god, I've never played a game that was on the Super Nintendo on the Wii.
3611483	3613424	That is coming out once again on the Wii.
3613524	3616165	Get it now before it goes away forever.
3617406	3618987	Seriously, if you buy this, you're stupid.
3619527	3619987	I'm sorry.
3620187	3621168	You are stupid.
3622308	3622789	That's right.
3622969	3623389	Stupid.
3627596	3629736	Just spend the money on the virtual console.
3629977	3632938	Better yet, just buy the freaking Super Nintendo and the original game.
3633058	3636579	I mean, you don't need this limited soundtrack and a little art book.
3636679	3637660	I mean, come on.
3639360	3642222	I just think your rants are funnier with Mario Brothers music in the background.
3642442	3643242	That's fine.
3644242	3645003	But yeah, so...
3647267	3648468	That's what we have coming out this week.
3648488	3651252	But seriously though, they are taking you guys for fools.
3651332	3654075	I mean, $30 for a Super Nintendo game.
3655016	3656017	What's next, okay?
3656077	3659781	We're going to have like Game Boy Advance, you know, Mario Land or something.
3659801	3661543	They're going to put no new color in it.
3661563	3662925	They're not going to do shit to it.
3663165	3667069	In fact, they're not even going to change, you know... Aren't all those going to be coming on the 3DS?
3668750	3671031	The virtual console, actually.
3671051	3672371	They're not doing shit to them.
3672851	3673211	Nothing.
3673711	3674291	Nothing at all.
3674512	3676152	And they're going to charge tons of money for that.
3676332	3678833	You know what you can buy a Game Boy for nowadays?
3679693	3683374	Probably $30 including that stupid... Probably even less than that.
3683394	3685694	You can probably find them dirt cheap at a garage sale.
3685714	3686734	People don't even know what they are.
3686754	3687634	They're trying to get rid of them.
3688215	3688415	I mean...
3690755	3691836	Don't.
3692156	3693116	Don't feed the beast.
3694097	3694337	Don't.
3696037	3697598	It's a very beastly week in U.S.
3697678	3698778	releases, apparently.
3698959	3700259	You're just encouraging them.
3701119	3707262	The message that you're sending loud and clear to Nintendo is, we like your old shit, please bring it back and charge us a lot of money for it.
3707322	3708562	That's all that they're doing.
3709623	3710123	And you know what?
3710163	3712984	People are dumb because they're like, oh, Mario must buy.
3713284	3714384	Mario must buy.
3714404	3715605	I mean, they can put out like,
3718101	3721344	Mario teaches brain surgery or something like that.
3721364	3722285	Mario's a wonderful douche.
3722325	3724327	People would buy it because it's got Mario in it.
3724388	3724768	You got it!
3736534	3737135	The Mario!
3766774	3768375	and novel thing that's been ported.
3768616	3771337	It's been on the PS2, Windows, PSP, all this stuff before.
3771878	3775240	It is coming out on the Xbox 360 as well now with some extra stuff.
3775640	3780524	So it's, I guess, I don't even know if it's like an interactive anime or anything, but who knows?
3781484	3783125	So yeah, that is coming out this week.
3783205	3785847	Probably nothing that'll ever see the light of day over here, I gotta be honest.
3785867	3791291	But I have heard something about an English translation patch on some of the other versions for those that are into it.
3793082	3798746	On the PlayStation 3 coming out this week, there's an all-new console coming out in Japan this week.
3798866	3801227	I think it is a satin silver model.
3801688	3805030	I'm not sure what is coming out to kind of drive the sales of that.
3805670	3812134	I know that Heavy Rain is getting a price reduction over there, and there is Shin Sangoku Musou 6 comes out this week as well.
3812814	3813795	That's from Koei.
3813875	3815536	Is this Dynasty Warriors 6?
3816197	3816757	Is that what this is?
3840581	3842623	and Rurouni Kenshin.
3866724	3870587	Meiji, Kenkaku, Ramatan, Saisen comes out from Namco Bandai this week.
3870607	3872448	What the crap are they doing another Kenshin game for?
3873069	3874570	Because the public demands it?
3875751	3876051	I don't know.
3876732	3877172	But there you go.
3877212	3878853	That does it for your Japanese releases.
3879954	3882336	Well, for the UK, we have a few things.
3882436	3884818	On the 9th is Torchlight.
3885899	3888761	And then on the 11th, we have Brunswick Pro Bowling.
3890102	3893484	Dragon Age 2, Homefront, and U-Star 2.
3893544	3895346	And that's it.
3897015	3897396	Alright.
3898578	3903144	Let's move on with some more news and then the Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.
3904346	3906069	Oh boy, can't wait for this next story.
3906730	3907431	Loki, take it away.
3907967	3911368	No, actually, just to go back real quick about my complaining about All-Stars.
3911588	3915049	I mean, seriously, this is Nintendo we're talking about here.
3915089	3916730	It's such a step backwards with this game.
3917730	3919170	Look at Smash Bros., once again.
3919370	3919791	Smash Bros.
3919831	3920071	Brawl.
3920111	3920831	Perfect example.
3920911	3925992	That's how you treat a franchise as far as nostalgia purposes.
3926332	3930654	They had demos for virtual console games on there for some of the old stuff.
3931554	3932154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3950891	3952352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3975605	3978767	Animal Crossing is seriously one of the best games that's come out in the past 10 years.
3979368	3980388	Honestly, it really is.
3980569	3981529	We're talking the original.
3981970	3983330	Not any of the sequel.
3983350	3983951	Not any of them.
3984071	3985172	Not any of the re-releases.
3985212	3987874	But the original is one of my favorite games to have come out in the past 10 years.
3988254	3988514	Easily.
3988634	3993878	Another perfect example, I might add, of a game that Nintendo has done absolutely nothing with.
3994938	3995279	Nothing.
3995919	3998821	Absolutely nothing with from game to game.
3999321	4001423	How much really have they changed from each sequel?
4002136	4002457	Nothing.
4002677	4006144	It's basically the same damn game presented in a slightly different way.
4006424	4007627	And I mean very slight.
4007707	4009811	And most of the times, it's not a good way.
4011338	4014859	Come on, we're seriously, we're just encouraging this crap.
4015159	4017480	So, you got some Nintendo news to report for us, Loki?
4017960	4018680	Yes, yes.
4020340	4023981	Anyways, so, we've got some interesting stuff.
4024922	4028563	Of course, this is all from Game Developers Conference.
4028583	4034024	We're talking a little bit about the 3DS and some neat stuff, I guess.
4034064	4037285	But, I mean, once again, you can't read too much into this because...
4039821	4040141	I don't know.
4040181	4048687	Like, for example, the first part we have here, apparently the 3DS will have access to 10,000 AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots by late May.
4048827	4049708	Why not at launch?
4049728	4051189	Eh, I don't know.
4051349	4051789	But whatever.
4052270	4052670	Late May.
4052790	4057994	So, that's neat that they're embracing... Is that like all the airports?
4058654	4059435	I guess.
4059655	4061836	It's gotta be like some restaurants have them.
4061856	4062137	I don't know.
4062357	4063798	Where do you find AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots?
4063818	4064178	I guess just
4064398	4071165	I don't know, but I know that when they're selling you on their internet and stuff, but you get access to all these for free as well.
4071786	4072186	Big whoop.
4072306	4074348	Is that how they're going to deliver the patches without asking?
4075129	4079414	If you take your 3DS out in public, it finds an AT&T Wi-Fi hotspot, all of a sudden, whoop, patch.
4080575	4081456	They don't, no.
4082877	4085340	You have to agree to apply the patches.
4085700	4086360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4113895	4134709	it's their way of saying we don't have 3GS but you'll be able to get online in public at all these places that's what it says to me and then of course the 3DS Virtual Console is basically getting all the portable platforms on top of I believe Game Boy and Game Boy Color they're getting Game Gear and
4135369	4146555	and TurboGrafx-16 games because it's funny because TurboGrafx-16 played the actual console games on the handheld so you're going to be getting those games.
4147475	4148656	I've got one of those.
4149496	4150097	Turbo Express.
4151357	4156180	How funny this whole NGP joke with the Neo Geo pocket comes forward.
4156220	4158321	Never mind because TurboGrafx, not a Neo Geo.
4158601	4158821	Fail.
4160522	4160642	But
4162884	4169249	But maybe in the future, who knows And I understand it's coming late May Why stop there?
4169650	4170350	Why stop there?
4170410	4191147	You have a virtual console You have virtual console stuff already out there For like Nintendo, Super Nintendo stuff Don't tell me this system can't play Nintendo games Or Genesis games Or Sega Master System games Once again This could be an open marketplace Like the iOS platforms Or Steam or something like that Where you can have a bunch of games on there
4192268	4204083	Right for the picking so people can go, oh my god, I love playing the original Mario Brothers or I love playing Mario Kart 64 or something like that on my Wii.
4204424	4205485	I want to take it with me.
4206947	4208008	Oh damn, I have to buy it again.
4208088	4210752	Oh, that's okay because I love Nintendo and I'll buy whatever they put out.
4212529	4213750	Such a missed opportunity.
4213790	4216711	They only have these portable games coming out for it.
4216771	4217651	I mean, come on.
4218892	4222193	It's so frustrating that they could easily do this.
4222453	4224274	Nope, nope, sorry.
4224934	4226355	We're not going to do that right now.
4226415	4233098	Whoa, but we may announce it later on, and people will be so grateful that we've allowed them to repurchase our game again.
4233158	4234838	Ha, ha, ha.
4235959	4237920	So, yeah, that will be coming out later on.
4241457	4261230	I don't know, it's just so frustrating because they're just dumb and yeah, late May, so if you buy your system when it comes out at launch, just know that you're not going to actually have access to their little service to purchase virtual console games nice
4262151	4266493	and then also they're saying via the system update you're going to get some other online features that they were touting.
4267033	4273176	The DSiWare service of course, the ability to transfer DSiWare games from the DSi or DSiXL to your system.
4274036	4281819	The web browser and of course the eShop which will include the whole virtual console stuff.
4282159	4284380	So let me get this straight.
4284901	4285721	Your console's not done.
4287585	4289206	because that's what it sounds like to me.
4289787	4295931	You don't have one of the advertised features, web browser and all that stuff, at launch.
4296131	4297112	So your console's not done.
4297833	4298393	It's not ready.
4298593	4300815	You're releasing it too early is what it sounds like.
4301095	4308621	And that might explain why you don't have enough games out for it because you want to push this thing out to pad your fiscal year numbers.
4308701	4309081	Is that it?
4309121	4310682	Because it's coming out at the very end of the month.
4310702	4311723	Yeah.
4313703	4314243	Thanks for watching!
4331431	4331971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4357017	4358258	I mean, I don't know.
4376238	4378260	Um, I definitely think it's that.
4378640	4388026	And I think that they did the exact same thing with, um... Well, they did the exact same thing with the Wii, because they had, remember, the web browser, I believe, didn't come out right away.
4388046	4389988	It got released later on.
4390028	4392449	It wasn't, you know, too later on.
4392569	4399094	I mean, we're only talking, like, you know, a month or two for this online shop thing, but...
4400640	4407510	It's just, if they had it ready to go at launch, they could be making so much.
4407590	4413158	It's time wasted and money lost because they could be selling a bunch of stuff.
4413338	4414380	And the fact that they're just like,
4415123	4422324	Yeah, you know, we're just not going to put virtual console games on there because... I don't know.
4422544	4428865	I don't know why they're not putting actual virtual console stuff that's on there for the Wii.
4428985	4431346	Why don't they put Nintendo games or Super Nintendo games?
4431546	4432886	They have all this stuff already done.
4432946	4433966	It's already ready to go.
4434026	4439907	And maybe they have to convert it over to something special or redo it for the 3DS, maybe.
4440007	4440988	But, I mean, come on.
4441008	4442868	We're talking, like, emulators here.
4443508	4447632	It can't be that difficult to port this stuff over.
4447692	4448172	I mean, come on.
4448212	4457840	If the homebrew community can do it on the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS, and this thing does support Nintendo DS games, it should be able to do this.
4458760	4462564	It should have no problem doing this whatsoever.
4463805	4465086	Unless they're going to do something cool.
4465166	4467548	Because they said that, oh hey, we're going to release...
4469511	4469771	Oh, fuck.
4488913	4500640	They may have all sucked, but still though, I mean, there's a lot of games that they release on the virtual console that did suck, but it's still a lot of people haven't gotten a chance to play them because that console is out for such a short amount of time.
4501661	4502782	I don't know.
4502822	4517752	And then lastly, apparently all DSi, or almost all DSiWare games will be available at the 3DS eShop launch, and of course they have some limits as far as the transfers and stuff.
4518252	4520934	It says, of course, we've got virtual console games.
4520994	4526939	Anything that's rendered in 3D, converted into 3D, is called a 3D classic.
4527479	4530282	So they're going to have some converted games, I guess.
4531242	4537107	And it said that, I guess, downloadable games will be under the eShop banner.
4538108	4539068	They're saying that...
4541585	4544206	Pretty much the whole DSiWare lineup will be available at launch.
4544226	4548187	There may be a few exceptions, but the majority of all the games will come over.
4548227	4552649	A few games are being left off the 3DS's eShop for undisclosed reasons.
4555170	4559091	Also, they're saying it's not the number of transferred games.
4559791	4565693	It would be the same... They're saying that the transfer feature will be coming in late May.
4566734	4566914	And...
4569386	4598048	they didn't say it would be the same game the number of times you can transfer it from device to device so if you build up a large category of DSiWare games you won't be penalized just how many times you can move it move that same group of games there'll be a limit on so I guess they're not saying the amount of games there's not going to be a limit on the amount of games you can move over but how many times you can move it so that's that's it hmm and
4600411	4621151	if they were nice which they're not they would also allow you to do that same kind of transfer thing with the Wii and the virtual console stuff that you download but they're not to be fair I mean what Microsoft allows you to transfer it once a year and I don't even know Sony's thing aren't Sony's pretty locked down aren't they
4622212	4634120	um you can transfer actually you can transfer quite a few times because they have people sharing stuff remember you can do it like five times that's right and that's per game um I I don't know it's
4636900	4637180	Whatever.
4637340	4638301	You know, it is what it is.
4638621	4644404	There's going to be a lot of disappointing stuff, I think, as far as how they support their online stuff.
4644444	4644944	And you know what?
4645324	4650626	It's unfortunately just... They could be making a lot more money than they are.
4651007	4655689	If that's really what they're concerned about and making people happy and stuff, they could do it really easy.
4655849	4657129	They're just not.
4658790	4662472	Alright, well, let's move on from all the 3DS talk.
4663833	4666615	Although, I am still excited about the 3D video, but I think you make a point.
4667015	4668596	They gotta let you share it.
4669076	4671358	But here's something that a lot of people are also very excited about.
4671418	4675180	I mean, that feature alone makes the device worth a lot more than...
4675680	4681765	And maybe that's why they're trying to rush it out, too, is because they want to get ahead of a lot of those cameras that are out there on the marketplace that are very expensive right now.
4682005	4683707	They're trying to maybe get the jump on that.
4683787	4684087	I don't know.
4684767	4685468	Cheap alternative.
4685508	4685788	Who knows?
4686249	4689411	Anyhow, I want to mention this because a lot of folks are excited about this.
4690292	4695196	The game Catherine, which is coming out overseas, it is also coming out in the U.S.
4695796	4698438	Summer of 2011 it is coming out this summer.
4698779	4700040	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4700880	4702181	There's a preview site already up.
4702221	4703723	You can pre-order the game on Amazon.com.
4704463	4705083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4728573	4755084	but give it time I'm sure that's details they want to keep under wraps until a little close to the release date but some folks still very excited about the release of that game alright since that game is coming out in a couple months let's talk about something that's coming out a long time ago it's the classic game of the week we like to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a classic video game that's been out for years and years and it's something that maybe you should be checking out
4756055	4758057	DarkSakura is going to step into the vault and find a game.
4758658	4760099	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4760540	4762482	Classic game of the week is Willow.
4763042	4767727	And before people say, you've done Willow before, this is a different Willow.
4768228	4770790	It is the side-scrolling arcade version of Willow.
4774028	4778413	So not the NES RPG game many people remember that you have done before.
4778693	4779534	This is the arcade version.
4779714	4784279	But it was released by Capcom in the arcade and it's freaking hard.
4785240	4788123	So basically this one's platformer.
4789885	4804162	and it has six stages where Willow gets to go kick some butt and sometimes you can play Mad Mardigan and you basically it's typical platformer left or right to move press the A button to use a weapon you can
4804682	4828165	Hold it down and fire charge shots, you've got magic power gauge, you have a B button to jump, and you can go up ledges and do all kinds of stuff, you can climb down them, and you can open chests, and you can get gold and buy items from the Owl Mage, and buy all kinds of stuff, including a life pack, a 1-up, and information.
4828846	4831536	But, um, it's pretty hard.
4832037	4834305	I love the music in it, though.
4834345	4835268	Can you play a little bit of that, Rob?
4847714	4848234	Isn't that good?
4848254	4848334	Neat.
4849494	4851295	It was a really pretty game, too.
4851735	4856536	And the only version that was out was the arcade one.
4856736	4858236	It was a CPS1 game.
4860017	4862197	Pretty much you could fight a giant rat.
4862777	4863597	That was pretty fun.
4865358	4872799	It is unlike the NES version, which was an adventure RPG.
4875120	4876540	Which is weird, because Capcom did them both.
4877065	4887072	Yeah, well, I think that Capcom was notorious for bringing out different versions of games that were one thing in the arcade, but did them different for the NES.
4888212	4891755	You know what this game looks a lot like is Magic Sword, actually.
4891835	4894577	So I'm really surprised I've never played this before.
4895717	4899540	Because there's a lot, like just watching this, there's a lot in common with Magic Sword.
4899900	4900841	This is very interesting to me.
4902180	4904542	It's just that whole side-scrolling thing.
4904802	4907744	I mean, it's really gorgeous.
4907784	4909545	You've got all the story elements.
4909626	4916851	You even have the monsters from the movie.
4917791	4920393	And pretty cool cinematic areas.
4920413	4922114	There's just gorgeous artwork in it.
4922875	4927058	And basically, like in the first... Ah, scary-looking Val Kilmer, sorry.
4927498	4927718	Yeah.
4929520	4929620	Ah!
4930908	4943813	Well, his weapon is kind of like the cipher from Strider, but it can be charged up and increases range and potency.
4943833	4948775	Basically, you can also buy swords when you stop in the shop.
4950616	4953719	And, uh, it's just really cool.
4953799	4958524	Although he's got, like, very pretty boy-looking features when you play with him.
4959525	4960426	Mad Mardigan, that is.
4960506	4962067	Very, very brown hair.
4963188	4964429	And Willow just looks adorable.
4965931	4967772	But yeah, it's a fun game.
4967993	4969274	Pretty tough, but lots of fun.
4970518	4972139	Alright, there it is.
4972760	4976663	The classic video game of the week for the arcades, not the NES.
4977244	4977704	Willow.
4979065	4983169	A very Magic Sword-esque kind of game, but with a bitchin' movie franchise behind it.
4984490	4988413	Although, I gotta admit, I always like the video game way better than I like the movie.
4988934	4989354	That's just me.
4990137	4992178	Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere.
4992198	4994279	There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4994580	4997822	When we come back for Part B, we're going to be talking about dev kits for the Kinect.
4998522	5000223	Yes, it could be really happening.
5000743	5006727	Gamertags being freed up and a classic, classic PC game making its way to the iOS system.
5006747	5011930	So we're going to talk all about that when we come back from a break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5017955	5020697	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5020737	5028222	We are live on this Sunday, March the 6th of 2011 for the 404th episode of our podcast.
5028402	5029163	We 404'd.
5029223	5029623	That's right.
5029643	5033505	I was going to say we didn't make enough 404 jokes in the opening, but yes, it is episode 404.
5034546	5036008	DarkSakura and myself work on.
5036028	5038090	If you like Orange Launch Radio, you might just like these shows too.
5053510	5058052	We have Comic Insanity, which goes live every Tuesday at Infamous.net.
5058072	5059853	That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
5060453	5061293	We are awesome.
5061433	5064975	It's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.
5065235	5068496	And we're pretty geeky and pretty comic-y.
5069157	5069957	And we're pretty awesome.
5070757	5071518	And Insanity?
5072238	5073458	The Insanity's there too.
5074079	5074379	Yeah.
5074919	5077800	And some Infamy along with it and some other in stuff.
5078140	5078360	Nice.
5079101	5079641	And Rob.
5080502	5084683	and The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth is all things World of Warcraft.
5085563	5096586	It's not taped live anywhere right now but we do put out a pretty fun podcast on Thursdays-ish and you can look that up online at The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth in iTunes.
5096626	5101267	Just search for Horde House and it'll come right up or whatever your preferred finder of podcasts is.
5101287	5102708	There is a website coming very soon.
5102728	5105368	I'm hoping next week we'll have more details on that.
5105529	5107109	We have the early workings underway.
5107489	5108050	Very exciting.
5108110	5110473	And now an official guild for this show as well.
5110873	5111754	So check that out.
5112015	5115459	This week's show, by the way, was particularly off-color and explicit.
5115519	5119624	So now's a great time to check it out at the best little hoard house in Azeroth.
5120125	5122107	Loki has a show called Raising a Baby.
5123168	5124210	Although it's not really a show.
5124931	5125691	It's just what he does.
5126572	5128734	I wouldn't have a show even if I didn't have a baby.
5129115	5130696	Been there, tried that, don't think so.
5130956	5131417	I know.
5132277	5137762	And I've said it before, it's a crime how undervalued your mix show was because you were pretty good at it.
5138403	5139784	Oh well, some things are just not meant to be.
5140364	5141285	It took too damn long.
5141665	5142446	What is meant to be?
5142566	5145969	More gaming news and Twitter topics very soon on the Twitters.
5146289	5147991	But first, some rapid news, Loki.
5148621	5152823	Yes, of course, we knew the Gears of War 3 beta was coming soon, thanks to Bulletstorm.
5153504	5159147	Bulletstorm players will actually get access to the Gears of War 3 beta on April 18th.
5159807	5167972	And then, of course, if you don't have Bulletstorm, you can also get into the beta if you've pre-ordered Gears of War 3 from GameStop.
5168772	5171434	Those players will be able to get in a week later on April 25th.
5172034	5176917	And, of course, you know, multiplayer beta, so...
5177617	5178358	Gears of War 3 Beta Tester Medal
5196719	5204524	Also, you get the Thrashball Cole, which is the fictional sport that's in Gears of War.
5204924	5208647	And you get the variant skin for that.
5208987	5215692	The gold-plated Retro Lancer, possible if you complete a bunch of levels in that, 90 matches.
5217394	5218194	That's a lot of matches.
5219415	5225539	The Flaming Hammerburst, if you complete one match by Sunday, April 24th.
5226600	5231243	Also, the Flaming Lancer by one match during the week of April 25th.
5231764	5236187	The Flaming Sawed-Off Shotgun, one match during the week of May 2nd.
5236747	5240730	And the Flaming Nasher Shotgun during the next week, May 9th.
5240750	5241691	What isn't flaming?
5245153	5245513	Not much.
5245553	5245894	Not me.
5248106	5251289	So that's coming soon, and check it out if you haven't yet.
5252830	5255632	I am so excited to get my next issue of Game Informer.
5256253	5259295	The cover game, of course, is Saints Row III.
5260256	5261117	God, I love that game.
5261297	5268303	Saints Row, seriously, you know, what Grand Theft Auto used to be as far as, you know, over the top and ridiculous.
5268903	5270124	Not that I don't, you know...
5271565	5275407	Not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto 4 because I've made it over top and ridiculous.
5276008	5278429	But Saints Row is awesome.
5278869	5283131	But that is coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC this holiday.
5284432	5286193	And the game looks awesome.
5287433	5290455	Well, the cover or whatever that they have looks awesome.
5291055	5298279	And apparently the game is going to be taking place I guess in Stillwater still.
5299079	5299459	Also...
5300660	5318284	I guess there's this gang called the Syndicated Criminal Organization that has contacts in different parts of the world and they're saying that it ultimately propels you into a new city that hosts the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.
5319125	5328247	And they're saying, judging by the cover here, nine-way free-fall gun battle from a plane.
5330023	5332124	I do respect the fact that they have System Link.
5353772	5354213	or Hasselhoff.
5374874	5380137	And then finally, the Panasonic Jungle is not going to be coming out.
5380298	5381778	It was kind of an ambitious idea.
5382419	5383440	Yeah.
5383540	5387262	It was an ambitious idea for a portable handheld MMO system.
5387802	5390724	Just... Oh, the MMO thing.
5390844	5391284	Yeah.
5392245	5394486	Nobody understood that anyway, so that's fine.
5394506	5398289	It's just not feasible.
5398629	5398969	You know...
5400670	5402331	Why don't they just say, nobody got it?
5403332	5406853	It's not a thing that, it's not that nobody got it, I think.
5406913	5409495	It's just, I don't know if we'd be able to run a lot of the popular MMOs.
5409515	5411556	Like, that wouldn't be able to run World of Warcraft, for sure.
5412777	5419180	You know, they're saying, oh, it would have been able to, you know, use titles like Stellar Down, Battlestar Galactica, and RuneScape.
5420360	5421201	It's really Battlestar Galactica.
5421241	5422902	And Rift, it's all about Rift right now.
5423222	5428785	Yeah, I mean, so, it just doesn't have enough oomph to be able to, you know, work.
5431047	5431327	All right.
5431447	5435249	Can you imagine, though, if they ported World of Warcraft to, like, the iPad?
5435509	5436009	It won't happen.
5436569	5441171	It won't happen, but I'm just saying something of that caliber to something like that would be ridiculous.
5441431	5444292	We would have people just moving into their bathrooms.
5444312	5444452	I know.
5444472	5447833	They have that, like... There's some pretty complex MMOs that are on iOS.
5447893	5449074	What's the one?
5449194	5450514	Legends or whatever it's called.
5450554	5451135	Play Legends?
5451195	5451715	I don't remember.
5452555	5455617	Super Mega Neo Climax Super Mega Neo Climax
5474870	5476151	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5502868	5505390	ModNation Racers has reached a milestone this week.
5505490	5508192	Two million user-created items.
5508813	5515678	Plenty more download content on the way, according to the PlayStation blog, including a parts pack that's already available on the PlayStation Store.
5516079	5518040	More track packs to make new tracks.
5518441	5520002	Western and pirate-themed.
5520582	5522924	More career DLC coming as well.
5523284	5525106	The party is not stopping at ModNation Racers.
5525186	5527027	Two million user-created items.
5527107	5528188	Mario Kart Wii Zero.
5528348	5529129	That's pretty crazy.
5529249	5529549	All right.
5530450	5536392	PlayStation Home was announced that it's upgraded to version 1.5 and some of the new features that are coming out in 1.5 of the home client.
5536752	5537752	Games that run within home
5548375	5559018	There's already kind of some of these, but they're trying to take it kind of up to the next step with low lag, real time multiplayer gaming, allowing more first person shooters, racing games and so forth.
5559338	5562859	A demo was shown for Sodium 2 Project Velocity that shows some of this.
5563399	5566420	Hey, you gotta admit, Sodium was one of the more interesting things that happened with Home.
5566520	5568821	I realize it's stretching it, but it was interesting.
5569346	5572370	That's a sad... That's, you know, what's the big thing about Home.
5572390	5574654	Well, but they say now it looks like Wipeout HD.
5574774	5578680	And to that I go, oh, now that's interesting because Wipeout HD is kind of badass.
5578800	5582705	So I... If that is true, that you're going to see more stuff like that in Home...
5583700	5584300	DarkSakura
5607944	5612107	Well, here's some news from a game developers conference.
5613227	5614668	Ninja Gaiden 3!
5616069	5618290	Um, wait, didn't we already have a Ninja Gaiden 3?
5618350	5619571	Wasn't it on NES?
5620432	5623633	Yeah, but this time it doesn't involve Ancient Kingdoms or whatever the subtitle was.
5623654	5625174	The Ancient Warships, whatever it was.
5625335	5631418	This one has a bloody Ryu on it, so that should be really, really hot.
5631678	5632799	I mean, really, really cool.
5633379	5633559	Yeah.
5635246	5643150	And then we have the Rock Band releases, which a friend of mine who was completely nuts over Depeche Mode is all happy with this.
5644331	5649594	We have the Depeche Mode pack that has Never Let Me Down Again and Personal Jesus and Policy of Truth.
5650374	5653015	And then I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab for Cutie.
5653436	5657838	I wish they had more Exciter stuff in there because that album was awesome.
5659702	5663044	And last but never least, we have more news for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5663364	5667566	We have the dates for Jill, Valentine, and Shuma Garath.
5668567	5674750	They will be on March 15th for Xbox Live, 400 points a pop.
5675410	5679292	And then on March 16th for the PS3.
5679753	5682034	You gotta wait on PS3, ha ha ha ha.
5683093	5684174	And you heard that right.
5684935	5689518	For people that aren't familiar with Microsoft Space Dollars.
5689538	5690078	$5 a character.
5690358	5691519	Thank you, Capcom.
5691940	5692460	You suck.
5694281	5695242	$5 a character.
5695542	5696203	I don't think so.
5696263	5697103	I'm gonna get Jill.
5697384	5698564	Pay to unlock content.
5699005	5700806	Yeah, it is pay to unlock content.
5700966	5702167	It's on the disc already.
5702887	5703828	Thank you, Capcom.
5704008	5704849	You suck balls.
5706274	5707474	You're just mad at everyone tonight.
5707494	5708014	No, seriously.
5708035	5708755	I mean, come on.
5708775	5709535	That is ridiculous.
5709735	5710615	Oh, we put it on there.
5711115	5712056	Oh, but we're dicks.
5712556	5713416	So I'm sorry.
5713556	5718677	You need to say something nice about a video game company to balance all this hatred coming out of you tonight.
5719258	5723019	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an awesome game, but they're dicks for charging $5 a character.
5724279	5725920	I'm sorry, it's stupid.
5726241	5730564	I mean, characters should be like $2 at the most.
5730844	5733446	And especially stuff that's not on the disc.
5733526	5734927	This stuff is already on the disc.
5735268	5736248	They're just being dicks.
5736649	5740652	They didn't even spend the time to apparently polish it up.
5740672	5743294	There's no actual storylines or whatever for them.
5743534	5745295	They didn't do any cutscenes for them.
5745535	5746656	They're just assholes.
5746736	5747497	That's all they are.
5747837	5750379	And if you buy them, you're supporting assholes, okay?
5751100	5752741	So just keep that in mind.
5753141	5757322	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Deadpool better make Jill sandwich jokes.
5757502	5757982	Seriously.
5759043	5759663	That's a good point.
5760223	5762064	Do you think Deadpool should make a Jill sandwich joke?
5763224	5765845	No doubt he probably would if silently.
5766325	5767565	Does he ever do anything silently?
5767625	5767865	No.
5769466	5773527	Alright, let's get to the Twitter and read some of the topics that you guys sent to us tonight.
5774907	5779188	Twitter.com slash OLR is the place you can send us tweets and we read them live.
5780689	5781569	Not all of them though.
5782594	5805971	but most of them Spazinator PSN sends us an FYI about the PSN video store there's currently a free anime pilot Hikaru no Go and a movie rental Stranger Than Fiction on the PSN video store yeah I heard PSN was like giving away more movies you know not that these are all movies like people are lining up to see but hey it's free Stranger Than Fiction wasn't terrible yeah if you like free stuff why not there you go
5807132	5809554	SilverSonic1534 is sending us a tweet.
5810034	5811194	Did you see this video?
5811295	5814216	It shows some of Super Mario 3DS screenshots.
5814616	5816597	It looks to be a game like Super Mario Bros.
5817058	5816597	3.
5817398	5818819	And then follows that up with a correction.
5819119	5820540	It's not looking like Super Mario Bros.
5820760	5824642	3, but apparently it's going to have some of the powers that were on Super Mario Bros.
5825002	5826003	3 on the game.
5827684	5831086	Send us a Twitter link to an IGN video.
5833226	5840149	That I guess is kind of showing... I don't want to watch all these talking heads.
5840209	5843630	All they did was show the stupid... It looks like they're comparing it to Mario Galaxy.
5843910	5847471	And I heard about how the raccoon tail was visible in the little logo that they teased.
5848051	5849772	Yeah, and they're kind of showing this a little bit in the video.
5850632	5850792	So...
5853064	5861188	Well, I'm sure, you know, people, one thing they do love about Mario is all these little, like, powers, like the raccoon and, please, the Tanooki suit.
5861208	5862649	That would be amazing if they brought that back.
5862689	5864970	You know, that's kind of one of the things that made Mario Galaxy fun.
5865010	5865530	I want this shoe.
5865870	5867291	The bee suit was awesome.
5867751	5873854	I'm sure some of that stuff, it's all going to be anything that tickles your retro bone and gets you to drop 40, 50 bucks on the games.
5874074	5881258	And by the way, all of that information that was from IGN right there was all speculation because all they showed was the stupid logo.
5882237	5883278	Oh, it's going to be Mario 3.
5883898	5885318	Let's speculate on what it's going to look like.
5885979	5890901	I don't think it... Of course, it's going to look like they're successful Mario games, but 3D.
5891001	5893162	I mean, it's not that hard to figure out, I don't think.
5893822	5894482	Am I crazy?
5894662	5895002	I don't know.
5895443	5898184	All right, going to Actdeft, who sends us a little twit pic.
5898944	5901025	And it's a collection of little Pokey dolls.
5901965	5903846	He showed us his Pokemans live on air.
5904146	5904746	Yay!
5904966	5910989	But the question that goes with this, do you collect a video game paraphernalia or have a collection besides the vault?
5912577	5914421	Will we put it all in the vault?
5915403	5917969	I guess this might be more of a question for Loki and myself, IDK.
5919051	5921412	You guys go ahead and answer that because it's a stupid question.
5921532	5924674	To be honest... Hey, now there's no such thing as a stupid question.
5925294	5926615	I said for me.
5926755	5927195	Oh, for you.
5928015	5929616	For me, I gotta be honest, not really.
5930317	5935019	For a while, I seemed like I had an Xbox Live Arcade collection going on because I was downloading everything.
5935419	5936780	But I don't really collect.
5936880	5938981	I don't buy games just because they're rare.
5939461	5943483	I don't really have a lot of autograph things or collectibles.
5943963	5973486	I rarely if ever buy limited editions I think the last like limited edition I remember buying was that Final Fantasy 12 at GameStop that had like the extra little frills I mean it's got to be a really big game I don't even buy collector's edition of Warcraft exception I did buy collector's editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King but it was at a charity event it was at the first Doom Loud I did buy those so and so that's for different reasons and I ended up giving away the Burning Crusade one to my friend for Christmas so different thing
5974207	5975068	Loki, you a collector?
5975369	5983021	I am not a collector of anything, but I have like, you know, I get tchotchkes sometimes, so I have a bunch of stuff at my desk at work.
5983502	5988190	I've got like, well, I used to collect Gundam models, but then I bought...
5989502	5992483	Pretty much all of them.
5994204	5995465	That's still fun every now and then.
5996645	6005490	I do have, for the last Samurai Warriors game, I think, Samurai Warriors 3, they have these little mini figurines.
6005690	6012453	I have almost a whole collection of those because we got a bunch of boxes of them, and so I opened all of them to try to create a whole collection.
6012473	6014094	I'm missing one, though, I think.
6014914	6016975	Here's the other thing I should say about why I don't collect.
6017055	6018756	I got hoarding tendencies as it is.
6019296	6022617	If I really was a rabid collector, it would be really bad, you guys.
6022677	6024078	So I can't.
6024258	6025579	I can't get rid of the stuff I have.
6025959	6028380	I have my Japanese copy of Smash Bros.
6028580	6035062	at my desk sitting there since I don't need the Japanese version anymore, the real version.
6035663	6037904	And what else did I have that's really weird?
6037924	6037964	Um...
6042186	6044509	I have a poster for the Atari Pac-Man.
6045110	6046932	I want it for a penny on eBay.
6047353	6047593	Nice.
6049255	6052139	But nothing to the scale of DarkSakura's vault.
6052239	6055123	That is a whole little special level all on its own.
6055203	6058847	Some of our stuff that we've gotten that we've really looked into is just sort of like...
6059608	6061489	It'll be there and we'll see it and it's cool.
6061529	6071676	I mean, we've gotten all kinds of neat collector stuff, you know, through Dan getting some swag from the local reps and, you know, going to conventions and things.
6072236	6087645	I still think the coolest, one of the coolest things we got was the Goemon doll because we bought our Twilight Zone pinball game from the guy who owned Working Designs and he just gave one to Dan.
6087665	6087745	Yeah.
6088766	6090527	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6119162	6122568	on the wall and just stuff we've looked into.
6122809	6125173	I mean, sometimes this stuff just falls in our lap.
6125233	6127396	It's not like we're trying to collect it on purpose.
6129039	6129340	All right.
6130163	6134205	And then Dan says from the other room, and some of it we spent stupid money on.
6135826	6136726	All right, well, let's move on.
6137306	6140208	A couple tweets coming to us from Tigerclaw.
6140528	6142049	Tigerclaw linking us to this story.
6142889	6146851	I guess a quote from Cliffy B., Cliff Blazinski.
6147231	6148812	Merry gamers, don't date them.
6149352	6159217	I'm going to read verbatim this article from Joystick with a Q. Proper credit to them because I was tweeted this story and didn't have a chance to skim things in advance for the relevant stuff.
6160237	6172842	In a candid talk during the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Epic Games Design Director Cliff Pazinski advised attendees to have an educated gut and to be cognizant of the value of marketing and long-term relationships with customers.
6173222	6179564	He encapsulated his talk in the Power Creative, a project member who is unique, valuable, and visibly tied to the game's identity.
6179865	6180985	This could be anyone.
6181465	6181745	I see.
6181805	6185947	So it's more like he's not saying that in the literal sense, like Merry Gamers.
6186027	6187848	He's saying kind of, you know, be...
6189068	6189709	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6209745	6218229	According to Blazinski, the market only tolerates games that land on the far end of the spectrum between freemium snack games and big budget games like Gears of War.
6218810	6220691	I believe the middle class game is dead.
6221071	6224172	The power creative understands how to engage fans over a long period of time.
6224552	6227454	Make gamers marry your game, not just date it.
6229065	6233407	Again, if you want to read the rest of that story, it's on JoystickWithACue.com as tweeted to us tonight.
6235047	6243811	Do game developers, some of them, need to work on the relationship with the fan and that whole idea of marry your audience and don't just take them out on one night stands?
6244391	6248953	Or do you think that whole little comparison is way out of... You need to satisfy your market.
6250533	6252354	If you don't satisfy them, they'll leave.
6255826	6259992	They'll leave you for other developers who love them longer and harder.
6274209	6275190	Mega Man Universe Mega Man Universe
6290242	6298245	Anyhow, another tweet to us from Tigerclaw, a link to a story on Kotaku about the social game developers rant.
6299005	6300185	Now, I did hear about this.
6300265	6311069	Apparently, there was a panel at Game Developers Conference where a bunch of the folks that develop for these social game companies like Zynga and Playdom and all this, they basically got up and said, Hey, you know what?
6311449	6312329	Stop picking on us.
6312770	6313310	Screw you.
6314130	6315251	Thank you for watching!
6334511	6361600	they also did a little mini game where the developers were encouraged I'm sorry the people attending the panels were encouraged to collect coins and whoever could get the most coins got to do a rant of their own which is kind of funny because it's like that's kind of like how a social game would actually work so ha so there you go is that it for tweets oh no one last tweet from blue swim orange lounge foodio question which is better Cadbury cream eggs or marshmallow peeps also welcome back Loki
6361874	6364175	Cadbury cream eggs and marshmallows are disgusting.
6366336	6367156	I actually disagree.
6367216	6369637	Marshmallow peeps because they can joust in the microwave.
6370077	6371718	And Cadbury cream eggs are too much.
6372638	6375299	If I'm going to eat a Cadbury cream egg, it needs to be one of those little mini ones.
6375999	6377740	The big ones are too much, too rich.
6377800	6378720	You know what's fantastic?
6379161	6382262	It's going to Touch of Britain and getting the Mars eggs.
6383162	6383943	Those are fantastic.
6384823	6385743	Or the orange cream eggs.
6386023	6387764	I still kind of prefer marshmallow peeps personally.
6389620	6391060	I don't know.
6391420	6392881	I'm not a big fan of either one.
6394301	6395201	Cream eggs, I guess.
6397222	6397482	All right.
6397882	6398562	That's it for tweets.
6399102	6400923	Twitter.com slash OLR.
6401403	6406624	In the meantime, let's get back into some other video game news before we get to the mailbag, the FUs, and of course, your phone calls.
6407744	6409125	All right.
6410085	6414066	So this is kind of neat and kind of along the lines of stuff that
6415487	6416007	and DarkSakura.
6435223	6449216	ISU which stands for the interfaces you and of course it's SoftConnect's 3D gesture recognition software development kit now available for qualified developers and they can license it for free.
6450177	6456722	It says it's going to work with all 3D depth sensing devices, which includes support for the Kinect.
6457242	6462406	And I guess it's a strictly non-commercial software development kit.
6463767	6467009	And a commercial version, of course, can be purchased from them as well.
6467589	6468550	But that's kind of neat.
6468670	6472293	And it says there's going to be different ones actually coming out from it.
6472992	6475314	Evoluce, PrimeSense, and of course, Microsoft.
6475794	6485901	So, neat to see that there's going to be some... I'm actually, I'd be kind of curious to see what the first, like, real retail game that comes out that supports Kinect.
6485921	6486522	That'd be kind of neat.
6487543	6493247	And then, of course, not to be outdone by that, PlayStation, the PlayStation Move, I should say,
6493587	6505811	They actually have some tools as well to be able to program stuff that supports the PlayStation, iCamera, and the Move controllers.
6506371	6514714	It's called MoveMe and it's a software tool that's going to be using the PlayStation Move technology to create unique applications.
6515494	6517436	and, of course, it's coming soon.
6517456	6528706	They're saying that MoveMe is going to be a downloadable application for the PS3 that allows researchers, students, hobbyists, developers, or anyone to build the ability to develop for the PlayStation Move.
6529347	6537694	And they said they want to see what innovative applications programs can create using the PlayStation Move controller, the PS3 system, and the PlayStation Eye camera and the PC.
6538595	6538815	So...
6540475	6549180	Apparently, it's going to be available on the PlayStation Network this spring, but people that are interested will be able to apply for it as well.
6549240	6560787	You can go to, I believe, usplaystation.com slash ps3 slash playstation-move slash move-me and check that out.
6561128	6561728	That's kind of neat.
6561748	6562969	What do you think will ultimately come of this?
6563509	6563549	Oh.
6563829	6565390	Maybe some applications or whatever.
6565430	6566951	I think they're... I don't know.
6567471	6571753	There's a lot of stuff that they could do with the PlayStation that they're not.
6571773	6576696	I mean, remember a long time ago they were showing some of the stuff, even what they could do with the PlayStation Eye camera.
6577156	6579037	Like, they're all, hey, look, we made a combat game.
6579117	6582639	And it was the developers for the PlayStation Eye stuff.
6582899	6586360	They were showing, hey, look, we can make a combat game where you draw your...
6587821	6591303	and tanks that you use and you can scan them in and play a game with it.
6592264	6595306	They did all those cool tech demos but never released them.
6596326	6600749	It's like, you know, you could have done something cool with that but no.
6600769	6604431	Do you see more like bite-sized applications coming maybe to the PlayStation Network?
6604651	6604992	They should.
6605012	6612856	I mean, that was the whole point with like even on the PSP how they have the PlayStation Network on the PSP and they have the PSP minis and stuff.
6613157	6616178	It was supposed to be more of like those bite-sized applications.
6616219	6616759	I'm hoping...
6617639	6619241	and so on and so forth.
6642014	6642935	Thanks for watching!
6663413	6665937	Xbox Live has been around quite a while.
6665957	6666758	It's been around since about 2002.
6678877	6679337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6701647	6704370	They're not saying what meets the qualifications for dead.
6704890	6714679	I am assuming that ones that were used on the old Xbox, because old Xbox Live is gone, that never migrated to a 360 account.
6714719	6717041	I'm assuming that's what qualifies, but it's a huge assumption.
6717922	6723527	I think part of what definitely falls into this, people that change their name, their old name would still be unavailable.
6723867	6726430	So I think a lot of that is kind of getting moved permanently.
6726810	6747568	so uh also it's stressed on here uh the process will take time to complete they will will not be able to tell you when a gamer tag that you want is available you should always check back regularly because they are reviving gamer tags daily you can go into the xbox channel and change gamer tag to see if the gamer tag you want is available I tried to get Major Nelson but it was taken hmm
6748334	6762263	so there you go I did notice though one name I would be interested in changing to was available so who knows I'm not sure how I feel about $10 just to change my gamer tag but you never know we'll see anything's possible
6763925	6765386	Let's move on with some more stories, DarkSakura.
6790745	6793009	Well, today's other story is Metal Cthulhu.
6793029	6793751	No, I'm just kidding.
6794633	6795334	Another World.
6795755	6796536	You remember this game?
6796576	6797498	It came out in the 90s.
6798119	6799662	Oh my god, I do remember that game.
6799702	6802428	It was epic when it came out.
6803414	6806835	Well, it actually first came out in 1991.
6807115	6809016	It was a cinematic sci-fi side-scroller.
6809436	6812877	And it's going to be brought up to date to come out for iPhone and iPad.
6813597	6815878	It's being ported by Dotemu.
6820439	6826421	They haven't said anything about new features, but they're saying that they want it to be the best experience on iOS.
6826860	6830366	Sorry, I'm looking at a video on YouTube of this game being played, actually.
6831849	6833432	Taking me back a little bit, let me skip ahead.
6833472	6834794	This is somebody playing it on an Amiga.
6836117	6836297	Sorry.
6836866	6840207	Well, it really is a pretty game.
6840267	6841728	I mean, it was great.
6842008	6848150	And this is supposed to be just a big old update.
6848550	6858853	And they're also working on an Ubisoft game called From Dust that's going to be out on PC and PSN and Xbox Live Arcade.
6859393	6859633	Nice.
6861074	6861754	Dude, another world.
6862134	6873861	This game was kind of like a souped-up version of Prince of Persia, but, like, that's really... It's like Prince of Persia in space, but with epic cutscenes involved.
6873981	6874321	I don't know.
6874461	6876502	Kind of a little flashback, too.
6877143	6878043	Yeah.
6879884	6881285	Running away from a killer bear.
6881765	6883346	Yeah, this game was so epic when it came out.
6883646	6885587	Wasn't, like, Out of This World or something like that?
6887788	6888369	It was called...
6890868	6893013	Yeah, in the US it was called Out of This World.
6893113	6895459	Another World was the UK release.
6896521	6897844	Yet I still know it by that name.
6898205	6898426	Yeah.
6899548	6899789	Anyhow.
6902506	6928796	very cool Salacious Pop in our chatroom says that game is fucking amazing but it's hard as fuck I have no idea how you can play it without tactile controls and I got the HD version they put out like four years ago I didn't realize they'd done a remake already and damn good point it's cool that they're putting it out again and nostalgia and all that on the iOS but again no joystick means hard game is very very hard so I don't know we'll see
6930566	6932872	Anyhow, let's move on with a few more stories.
6932912	6934937	The mailbag is coming up as well as the Skype line.
6938707	6966873	so they've got some cool stuff coming to OnLive some of the things that they announced at Game Developers Conference that they're going to be offering to developers that want to put their games on to the platform they're saying voice chat game invites for multiplayer games the ability to directly upload brag clips to YouTube and then also achievements which they're guessing is going to be stuff derived from console versions
6969094	6972115	If they want to put up an old retro game or something like that and add achievements to it, they can.
6973015	6987421	Also, they're going to allow developers to let their game support wireless controllers when played on mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, or Android-powered phones or tablets.
6990603	6993764	Really, they need some controllers for some of those devices.
6995307	6995467	True.
6995487	6995527	So...
7025020	7026322	I don't know, they're doing alright, I think.
7026402	7032310	I think they're making progress, and it's definitely been, you know, it works, so... I think it's worked a lot better than anybody thought it would.
7032730	7035053	I think a lot of people wrote this thing off when it first came out.
7035674	7036295	Yeah.
7036335	7037477	Before it came out, really.
7038758	7038918	So...
7040160	7041421	Well, we'll see what continues with that.
7041501	7043062	It's neat that they're still going with it.
7043382	7066036	That type of device, though, how they have the micro-console and stuff like that, if they can do MMOs on that, that's how you would get a device like the Jungle, where it would basically be something that runs on a server at some company or whatever, like World of Warcraft or something like that, and you have your controls on there, and it's very limited, but you don't need to have the powerhouse of...
7066796	7069401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7081345	7082246	Thanks for watching!
7100612	7100772	DJ Maxx
7117106	7123790	And the music's pretty popular amongst the crowd, but usually there's not a real legitimate anyway way to get the music outside of Korea.
7124111	7124711	Well, guess what?
7124851	7132156	Starting in March, it was announced, Pentavision has announced that the soundtracks for DJ Maxx are going to be published on iTunes.
7132836	7161081	three albums followed by a new album every week I guess until they get caught up because that's a lot of albums but there have been quite a few DJ Max games at this point so fans of that series are going to be very happy that they get their nice CD quality sound out of iTunes that'll be pretty cool if they didn't already get it through other means from the Korean albums that's pretty cool you know iTunes has been doing a lot of different Japanese pop artists like the really big names like Ayumi and Goct and
7161721	7163724	Yeah, I bought an Ayumi song on there not that long ago.
7163764	7167248	I got a Larkin CL album a while back.
7167308	7169090	They also do a lot of video game soundtracks.
7169130	7174097	It's interesting to me that they don't have a gaming section in their store.
7174177	7174938	Maybe I missed it.
7174958	7179143	I think there is a soundtracks section, so maybe it's buried in there and I've just missed it.
7179563	7180003	Yeah, yeah.
7205529	7205689	DJ Maxx
7228325	7228465	Loom
7236112	7236672	Loom.
7236953	7237293	Didn't they?
7237433	7238453	They did something.
7238534	7239074	I guess it was a hack.
7239094	7239734	Loom's on Steam.
7239814	7241035	Oh yeah, it's on Steam.
7241055	7243296	I want to say it was like a hack for the iOS or something, of course.
7243397	7244677	You know I got Loom on Steam.
7244757	7247359	Somebody wants to hack the old LucasArts stuff for that.
7247399	7250301	You know, I actually have a copy of Loom for PC.
7250881	7251742	I bought it on eBay.
7251942	7252202	Nice.
7252622	7253743	Because I love that game.
7254643	7258186	I hardly remember how to play it because of all the chords and stuff.
7258226	7260467	And I remember some of the chords and I do them way too early.
7260967	7262028	But Loom would be fun on Steam.
7262848	7263668	Scorched Earth.
7264429	7264809	Yes.
7265449	7266110	Oh, man.
7266170	7268211	It's been years since I played Scorched Earth.
7268351	7269071	Absolutely.
7269091	7270292	What about Phantasmagoria?
7271472	7273873	That's not outside the realm of possibility.
7273893	7276595	There was a news on that not that long ago.
7278075	7283938	I know they brought out the seventh guest, which I know it's a completely different company, but for some reason these go together in my mind.
7283958	7287880	And they were talking about the 11th hour, and I want to say around that same time we had heard something about Phantasmagoria.
7288600	7291701	So that would be pretty cool if that were to come out for iOS.
7291941	7296423	The point and click games would lend themselves much better to the iOS system.
7296523	7301044	So maybe like Kyrandia would be awesome if we could get that.
7301884	7304205	Obviously, I've got to say King's Quest would be kind of neat.
7304685	7309347	And there was the whole Flash versions that got shut down, so we know it's kind of possible.
7311127	7311748	Good old games.
7312728	7315349	Had a Phantasmagoria for digital download.
7315409	7316809	Maybe that's why we reported on it.
7316849	7322051	Maybe you have the SCUMM emulators though for jailbroken devices.
7322691	7327193	And you know me, I'd like to see more classic Commodore 64 games show up outside of just the emulator.
7327273	7330614	There is the emulator that's available but it keeps going up and down and up and down.
7330654	7332294	I don't even know if it's still on the store right now.
7332594	7337456	They also have there's some other emulator that was out there that was
7338334	7340576	iDOS was an emulator.
7340596	7341697	I had Duke Nukem and all that.
7341737	7343778	I have it on my phone, but it's pulled from the store now.
7344218	7344519	iDOS.
7345459	7346020	There was another one.
7346340	7349722	I did get the, they finally leaked that out too.
7349742	7354906	Remember that Minecraft client that got uploaded for just a little brief millisecond or whatever?
7355407	7356487	Yeah, I finally found that.
7357748	7360670	But I don't have a Minecraft account, so I can't play it yet.
7362293	7364678	All right, well, let's get to the mailbag.
7364698	7368767	You guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
7369348	7372295	DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air.
7373675	7375836	The first email is actually directed towards me.
7376517	7379918	It says, Hello, I heard last week that DarkSakura is going to Faname Con.
7380378	7381499	I will be going this year as well.
7381559	7383360	How about an OLR meetup at the convention?
7383780	7384701	Hope to see you, Sakura.
7385021	7385381	Jinai.
7386061	7394065	Um, if everything works out, I'm not making any, like, supreme promises or anything because, honestly, I miss cosplaying and I think I wouldn't mind doing it again.
7394906	7397647	But, um, we definitely need to see about getting our panel.
7398348	7400709	That would be... Might be a little late for that.
7400729	7402710	We're almost into... Oh, we're at, like, mid-March...
7403417	7406218	If we could swing it, yeah, I'd love to do it.
7406538	7407678	I'll probably be here that weekend.
7408198	7409098	I'll bring the dolls again.
7409878	7410939	The scary, creepy dolls.
7413519	7414319	Next email.
7414859	7419140	Hey, OLR, how would you feel if Konami gave the DDR series a reboot on the Kinect?
7419780	7431443	The game would feature songs from DDR's history and songs found in the charts today, and it would also feature an online mode where players can compete in dance battles or form their own dance groups and choreograph their own dances.
7434064	7439968	I think, unfortunately, Konami's already kind of screwed the pooch with that because Dance Masters is kind of that.
7440048	7446972	At least it's a lot of the old DDR songs, but in that whole Para slash Dance Central-esque kind of format.
7446992	7450394	And there's a demo available now on Xbox 360 if you want to see what this game's all about.
7451975	7452595	But yeah, I...
7453896	7460881	I think you have some good ideas, but the weird thing is, I don't know, did he say with a dance mat and Kinect?
7461081	7463602	No, it just says Kinect.
7463662	7464463	Hey, guess what?
7464783	7474069	If you want to use a Kinect, though, with DDR, the upcoming DDR game, Dance Dance Revolution, because, you know, they made it just... We covered last week where there's a hack for it that they're trying to...
7475183	7477866	No, that's Step Mania, but I'm talking about the actual Dance Dance Revolution.
7477886	7483214	Remember the one that came out on PS3 with Move support and then on the Wii as well?
7483414	7489161	Well, it's coming out in April on Xbox 360 and it uses the Xbox Vision Camera.
7489922	7494425	Which is now also technically the Kinect, but you can do crap with that.
7494445	7502231	But seriously, we don't need to give Konami reasons to make more gimmicky crap for Dan Says Revolution.
7502731	7510036	They just need to stick to the core mechanics and improve on that, or just basically do what they were doing back years ago, and they would be fine.
7510156	7511657	But they're trying...
7512618	7513840	I don't know what they're doing anymore.
7514742	7517286	They need to just reform Konami Hawaii and give them the game.
7517867	7521934	That's really the only thing that would get me super interested in DDR again.
7521974	7522655	Put me in charge.
7522675	7525960	I will make you a game that's going to be perfect.
7527970	7528470	More emails?
7528750	7530331	Yes, there was actually more to this email.
7530571	7531151	Oh, my bad.
7531611	7537073	Finally, it would be great if you guys would give my video game blog a quick plug on the show, which I will be happy to do.
7537213	7537613	No!
7537873	7538173	That'll be $50.
7538913	7539213	Hush.
7539893	7540594	Here's the link.
7541254	7545595	PlayStationUK.wordpress.com Thanks, Liam.
7546375	7548256	Okay, Liam.
7548496	7553517	I would like to know Liam's thoughts on the whole LG lawsuit that we covered at the top of the show, since that is affecting the UK.
7553818	7554018	Yeah.
7554178	7555078	Maybe it's on his blog.
7556138	7558620	Well, we'll have to just go there later.
7559220	7561041	And maybe look later.
7562022	7563183	So, next email.
7563283	7564083	Greetings, OLR.
7564123	7565664	This is your neighborhood turtle again.
7566144	7569566	I've included a link you guys should check out concerning Unreal Engine 3.
7570627	7577391	Looking at the screen caps plus the previews of Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3, I'm incredibly impressed, mostly with the lighting.
7577771	7581534	Being a graphics whore, all these next-gen games look very promising.
7582174	7582795	I love pretty things.
7582815	7585176	Why else did I sit through the first 13 hours of Final Fantasy XIII?
7585196	7585597	I mean, really.
7604634	7607695	No, the lighting is really tremendous.
7607755	7608335	It's amazing.
7608455	7612876	You know, Unreal Engine, the last one, was amazing enough.
7612976	7616037	I'm sure the new one's just going to be even more of an improvement.
7616077	7616517	It's going to be great.
7616537	7617317	I don't think that's four.
7617377	7619737	That's just the new updates that they did for three.
7619898	7620538	Oh, my gosh.
7620878	7623798	I thought this was the new engine.
7623858	7627379	No, that's just the tweaks that they did for three, I think.
7627619	7629880	That's a pretty crazy poly count these things are running, too.
7630841	7634680	I don't think they have Unreal Remember the next one's Rage, I thought
7635171	7637112	from, was it Epic Rage?
7637673	7637873	No.
7638553	7638974	I don't remember.
7639814	7641755	But I know Rage is the next big engine.
7641956	7643757	But, yeah, I don't think that's Unreal 4.
7643797	7646439	That's just tweaks to the three, if I remember correctly.
7646639	7649901	I also want to see what crazy, like, non-shooting things come out of the engine.
7649921	7653903	Because, you know, like, we've been getting some really random things in the Unreal Engine.
7655384	7659107	Like, there was a few role-playing games from Square that were done in the engine.
7660508	7662229	Was it Last Remnant that was in Unreal?
7662249	7662289	No.
7662715	7663416	Last tournament was?
7663776	7667258	Well, I've been looking at this, and this is kind of funny since I've been taking my 3D class.
7668259	7675444	It's just, now that I actually understand the physics behind some of this, it's pretty cool seeing, you know, what happens by layer.
7675564	7676585	It's just amazing.
7676605	7681769	Like, I'm going to share this picture with the chat room because this is a really good example.
7683030	7690715	It's the one of the dude's face where they start with the, it's basically just a demo of the subsurface scattering.
7690916	7691476	It's really cool.
7694284	7695986	They're also showing how cool smoking is.
7698629	7706619	Honestly, a falling cigarette is a good showing of lighting and physics in action.
7707300	7709763	Because that was clearly part of their demo.
7710270	7718596	and it also shows that Epic has set the release Falling Cigarette the game after Gears of War 3 and I can't be any more excited than I am possibly right now.
7719597	7720278	Next email.
7721639	7722139	Hi guys.
7722219	7723400	Cigarettes will fall.
7724721	7725622	Fall of 2012.
7725682	7726102	Hi guys.
7726122	7729485	Since the website won't let me post this because it's too long I figured I'd just email it.
7729585	7730085	Oh good.
7732393	7733994	DarkSakura loves long emails.
7760072	7760973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7780792	7782093	Thank you for watching!
7799029	7802070	Her saying that about a game is not something I've seen every day.
7802110	7803270	Wouldn't I be hearing every day?
7803290	7810671	Anyway, in fact, I think this is the third game ever she's been that impressed.
7811211	7819093	So, of course, I went through the rest of the demo, even showing her how much customization was involved in creating her character and following the storylines and how they can branch off.
7819233	7824454	After the full demo, I found that while the controls aren't as good as I'd like them to be, they're far better than the Xbox 360.
7825814	7827356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7843374	7850458	For me, any game that causes a casual person to stop and take notice wins more in my book than something that's designed for hardcore fans.
7851238	7852859	Again, another topic for another day.
7853359	7855200	Also, why the PS3 over Xbox?
7855581	7859162	Besides control, the download content comes with it instead of having to buy it.
7859923	7864345	Besides, it's very rare that a game does better on PS3 for me than the Xbox 360.
7864886	7868067	And to end it, her final thought after I turned off the demo, sure beats Halo.
7868167	7869148	I think that sealed the deal.
7869928	7893942	sometimes having the audience there while playing a game is more fun than playing it alone well you won't be on this week but we'll catch you guys later oh no well won't be on this week but we'll catch you guys later and that was from Mantis Knight that's another one of those games you know it's funny because I brought up Beyond Good and Evil earlier in the show and it's one of those games like everybody played and loved and I'm just now catching up on it yeah put Mass Effect in that same bin it's funny
7896305	7897346	Last email.
7898406	7900207	Hey, OLR gang, ACHP here.
7900887	7904288	I know a lot of people who listen to this show probably want to work in games.
7904389	7904889	I know I do.
7905409	7906769	And I thought I'd share some advice.
7906890	7908010	Meet people who make games.
7908450	7915413	While not being able to afford the $1,000 pass to get into Game Developers Conference this weekend, I was able to squeeze myself into some post-hours events.
7915853	7919535	And let me tell you, it is probably the best thing I have ever done for my professional career.
7920035	7924677	You'd be surprised at how willing people are to chat and network with complete strangers who don't even work in the industry.
7925297	7945502	at a random party for a company I've never heard of I was able to meet the business developer managers for Q Entertainment met a guy who knew a guy who was there with a recruiter who's now helping me find placement as an entry-level programmer so if you want to get your foot in the door and haven't booked a ticket for PAX do it if you and if you have go look up your favorite company
7946562	7950265	Go look up if your favorite company is doing any meet and greet type of activities.
7950706	7951907	You may be glad you did.
7952427	7953328	Hope this helps someone.
7953388	7955009	ACHP P.S.
7955069	7958292	Game developers are definitely the most socially awkward people ever.
7958632	7963596	With an open bar and go-go dancers on the tables, they are just idly chatting or playing on their phone.
7963716	7964137	I lulled.
7964897	7965358	P.P.S.
7965798	7971883	I wrote this on my Android phone, again to prove that you can write grammatically correct and properly spelled and punctuated words without a keyboard or autocorrect.
7971963	7972244	Cheers.
7972624	7973645	You said to be very patient.
7974966	7976126	But yeah, I agree.
7976927	7985830	Some of the best parts, at least about E3, which is one I was going to pretty regularly for a while, some of the best part is networking.
7986770	7988550	So yeah, absolutely.
7988850	7992072	If you're going to be going to any of those shows, just don't be shy.
7992272	7993352	Just say hi to people.
7993772	7998460	You can tell when somebody doesn't want to talk to you or if you're bugging somebody or what have you, you know.
7998840	8003287	But most of the times at these expos, people kind of, you know, they want to be social.
8003327	8004008	They want to hang out.
8004149	8005491	They want to talk their game.
8006432	8007594	So good email.
8008175	8008555	Was that it?
8009400	8009840	That was it?
8010641	8011061	Excuse me.
8011521	8013262	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat.
8013462	8017265	If you want to send us emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8017345	8019366	SSJ100Matt throws in our chat room.
8019526	8022768	There are a ton of networking panels at PAX East this year.
8023588	8024249	So coming up.
8024689	8027951	I would like to know how the networking is at PAX East for those of you guys that are going.
8027971	8032393	I want to know how you guys, you know, if you find people or what you discover.
8032913	8033474	So let us know.
8034115	8039646	In the meantime, we need to stop being so nice talking about all this networking and hand-holding and partying.
8040027	8041610	It's time to get angsty with the FUs of the week.
8057304	8068566	I would like to give a big fuck you to the Library of Congress, more specifically their website, in trying to help my client copyright his book.
8069907	8075128	It's not letting me do the regular copyright submission.
8075208	8079309	It wants me to do the pre-registration submission, which actually isn't even necessary to do.
8080069	8082091	Online registration is $35.
8082231	8083051	Pre-registration is $150.
8083212	8085633	Now, what do you think we want to do?
8085773	8088476	Especially since I've made sure that the book is fully the way it needs to be.
8089076	8089837	Everything's ready.
8089997	8091518	We've got a publisher.
8091838	8094500	I mean, just frustrations.
8095321	8097823	So, bite my butt, Library of Congress.
8099324	8099544	Loki?
8100865	8127251	F you to Dominic's New York Pizza and Italian Deli for not realizing that Philly Cheesesteak has cheese on it and giving me a sandwich that does not have cheese on it and it wasn't that great so I have to throw it away but yes next time I will not be buying the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich from you because you have omitted cheese although my wife does like the clam pizza
8130303	8130883	Not my thing.
8131704	8132025	All right.
8132666	8140856	And my FU goes to those big Belgian waffles for being so yummy and delicious and very fattening.
8142612	8144013	F you to food for making me fat.
8144153	8144833	That's my F you.
8145654	8147294	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
8147314	8152036	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8152057	8153397	We're not ready for that just yet.
8153437	8154598	We have a couple more stories for you.
8155358	8161421	Capcom would like to remind you that Street Fighter 2 has turned 20.
8162241	8165343	It's been 20 years since the game was released in arcades in 1991.
8165483	8172246	It's seen six arcade iterations and of course a ton of ports, cross consoles, PCs, and
8172486	8177409	and definitely one of the top arcade games out there.
8177889	8184233	They are still assholes though for charging $5 for download content for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I'd like to add.
8187214	8192077	But happy birthday Street Fighter and your 20 different iterations to go with those 20 years, right?
8192938	8194519	Pretty soon Street Fighter 4 will have just as many.
8196621	8199226	Which is one of the more interesting launch games on the 3DS, might I add.
8199266	8201770	A game that I played, what, a year and a half ago?
8201850	8202732	Two years ago for the first time?
8206469	8208191	You know Dead or Alive is not a launch game anymore?
8209112	8209512	Yeah, no.
8210093	8211154	It's a launch window game.
8211234	8213436	I'm sorry, that's not a launch game.
8213456	8215398	A launch game is a game that comes out day one.
8215518	8216559	That is a launch game.
8216899	8218761	I'd even give you a week or two after that.
8219021	8221624	A game that comes out two months after that is not a launch game.
8222484	8224286	That is a launch window game.
8224466	8226949	Well, my launch window is four years after the console comes out.
8227029	8227769	It's a launch game.
8228840	8229781	That's Nintendo for you.
8229841	8230121	Thanks.
8231061	8233583	Way to spin that.
8234223	8235784	Oh, we don't have a lot of games on our system.
8235804	8238786	But that's okay because we considered the launch four years after it comes out.
8240727	8241927	All right, Angry Loki.
8242027	8243108	Let's move on to another story.
8243128	8247530	This is about Steam and Steam possibly invading your television.
8247610	8248011	That's right.
8248071	8255515	Here's a quote from Doug Lombardi, the Vice President of Marketing for Valve, from earlier this week in preparation for Game Developers Conference.
8256135	8256255	So, uh...
8275015	8278920	It's not necessarily there's going to be some type of little hookup kit or something.
8279301	8290415	It's that they're talking about actually putting your PC games on the television, a big picture mode, and I guess a controller-friendly version when you want to play on your TV.
8290955	8291496	That's pretty cool.
8293130	8322121	more plans were announced to Game Developers Conference this past week but you know I think a lot of you are just going to wait and get Portal 2 on the consoles if you don't already have it planned on the PC not to disrespect those that do their gaming on the PCs because there will certainly be a lot of people buying it there or I don't know I got to admit that PlayStation 3 deal where you get it in both places looks awesome where you buy Portal 2 on the PlayStation 3 and then you get the Steam copy on PC for free I think that's how you got to do it
8323607	8325269	Microsoft's going to be hurting to sell copies of that.
8325989	8326310	We'll see.
8327190	8332395	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8332435	8335858	The Skype line is open right now for you guys to give us a call.
8336158	8339981	While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
8342023	8343585	I don't know.
8344065	8344405	Maybe.
8346607	8347348	Let's see here.
8349389	8354793	I'm trying to think what we haven't covered yet other than my hatred for what Nintendo's doing with the 3DS.
8359503	8366510	Um, there was some new hackers, well, not really hackers, but stuff that's going on with the whole George Hotz thing and being sued.
8366750	8379402	Apparently, there's some drama over the third-party company that Sony, or I should say the law, the court has going through his hard drives.
8379442	8382645	Apparently, Sony's trying to get a copy of the hard drive for themselves.
8384307	8400102	and even though a third party is supposed to be the only ones looking at the hard drive basically but somebody wants to know what's on there and possibly the steel information it sounds like or maybe manipulating the system a little bit so people are kind of up in arms about that I don't know
8401923	8402923	This is kind of interesting.
8402983	8410585	Also, the NGP, I guess the games, of course, they're coming on kind of a cartridge or memory card type device.
8411025	8424267	They're going to be coming on two and four gigabyte cards with room for game saves and patches because the actual system will not have any onboard storage, or at least that's what the thought is.
8424787	8427408	Is that kind of one of the ways you're trying to get around all the hacking?
8427944	8434569	I don't think it's going to work because the way I'm thinking it now what are you going to save your downloaded games to then?
8435090	8456928	Because obviously they're going to have some sort of online market or something like that and I know it has a second memory card slot for stuff like that so I mean it might be a way to get around it but I mean it didn't work for the Nintendo DS Are they trying to do it maybe because it's a non-standard format or something?
8457551	8466714	Um, maybe just to make it, you know, easy, but I'm sure that's gotta be some sort of, um, you know, it's partly probably anti-piracy.
8469218	8489310	and then again the phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to get through tonight I would advise calling now because the way these things go is I say the number like 20 times and nobody ever calls and then suddenly just at the last minute like everybody calls at once and then I say well we've taken enough calls so I'm just saying get in early
8490110	8505714	Microsoft has gone the route of Spore, where you can basically take your avatars now, you can create poses or whatever with them, and you can get jumbo wall prints of your avatar.
8506034	8516217	If you want to put yourself up on the wall, you can get a 16GB Zune with your avatar on it, etched in, or a $60 figurine of your avatar.
8517057	8532865	and of course the wall print is going to cost you $150 so that better be damn big and the zoom will cost you $170 figuring $60 that would be kind of neat to have at my desk not the wall print, that's retarded that's going to cost you a bit of money though, isn't it?
8533525	8546572	yeah, I'd probably wait I'd want to see what these things look like in the size, because I'm not going to pay $60 for a 3 inch statue, it better be something pretty significant alright, we've got calls coming in, so let's go to it hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8547677	8549178	Hi, this is Spazinator.
8549198	8550439	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind, buddy?
8551739	8557722	Yeah, I'm just calling in about the whole home thing that you were mentioning earlier.
8557923	8562025	Yeah, about the whole upgrades in home where they're going to have more built-in stuff.
8562045	8562745	What do you think of all that?
8564666	8574892	Well, I'm probably in the minority here on this, but my whole opinion is kind of like kind of goes along the lines of who cares?
8575032	8575292	I mean,
8576081	8586426	You know, you kind of sort of touched on it a little bit to a degree, but when you said, you know, when are they going to do anything with the clubhouses?
8587187	8587827	Yeah.
8588668	8595611	Yeah, I mean, you know, there's so much they could be doing with home to make it a little bit more interesting.
8596232	8600234	Like, if you look right, well, it's kind of hard to...
8601792	8611876	You know, talk about something like you're really looking at, but you know how the one wall behind the stage is supposed to be like a video screen in Clubhouse?
8612136	8612396	Yeah.
8612636	8620319	Yeah, they could be doing something with the video screen, like you guys could be showing off...
8621519	8647559	some of the videos that you guys have made for Orange Lounge I will tell you this much the minute that Sony allows us to put some type of video on that monitor I'll do something exclusive video content wise that won't even be on YouTube we will only put it in Sony Home but I'm not going to hold my breath my camera is still in a box because I don't see that happening yeah you could there's always that and also um
8648590	8665018	Now with our own private spaces, whether it be the log caping space or the default one, whatever you happen to have, they could sell virtual jukeboxes and virtual TVs.
8665378	8672201	They'll allow you to stream all the MP3s that you got on your PS3's hard drive or
8672881	8677302	The video content that you add to the video servers or what have you.
8679082	8682803	Although I'm with you to a point here, Spazinator, I got to ask this question.
8682823	8685083	I got to play devil's advocate and ask this question.
8685403	8694525	Since the PlayStation 3 is a gaming system, why not have enhancements to the gaming mechanisms within home and making the gaming within home better?
8696345	8699166	Well, there's that too.
8699226	8701086	I can certainly see your point.
8701940	8719025	But, you know, perhaps Bobby Blackwood loves to point out from time to time, I'm really heavily into the whole PlayStation 3, more so than my 360.
8719906	8720186	No.
8722026	8729329	Your 360 handle, I'm not going to give away your 360 handle, but it has PSN in it, and that always cracks me up that PSN is in your 360 handle.
8730732	8740336	Yeah, well, my point being, you know, you would think, you know, with that being said, you know, I would be all over home like here on the gorilla.
8740936	8746318	But the thing is, I really haven't touched home in God knows how long.
8747298	8752380	And the last time I, the only reason I even bothered with home the last time is because, uh,
8753460	8757741	and all games community said the invite to join them at home.
8758922	8761002	That was about it.
8761022	8763583	There's nothing to do in there but dance with furries right now.
8764003	8770085	But hopefully Sodium 2 will bring people back if not at least for a day while everybody's curious and checks it out, right?
8771425	8771705	Yeah.
8772245	8779907	But, you know, if they implemented some of the ideas that I just thrown out, you know, I would be using home left and right, you know.
8780507	8782368	But, you know, until then, you know,
8783726	8791107	The only reason I would even consider using it is I would have to be bored out of my mind, like borderline comatose bored, you know?
8792048	8794928	Well, maybe you need to go to Game Developers Conference and tell them your ideas.
8795008	8795308	I don't know.
8795388	8795648	All right.
8795848	8798609	Well, Spaz, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call, buddy.
8799589	8799889	Take care.
8799969	8800229	Yeah, sure.
8800249	8800729	Have a good one.
8800829	8802030	You too.
8802050	8804530	1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8804770	8808371	By the way, screen filled up with phone calls while Spaz was on the line.
8808471	8809191	What did I tell you?
8810592	8813715	I tell you, the minute one person tries to call, then everybody's going to try to call.
8813735	8814115	So there you go.
8814416	8815077	It is open now.
8815097	8815937	We'll see if somebody gets through.
8815957	8819101	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8819982	8821584	Any other last minute stories that we have?
8821664	8824747	Loki's looking for stuff for after the show, so I don't know.
8824787	8825568	I guess, is that it?
8826589	8828270	No, I've got stuff.
8828490	8834434	Battle LA is becoming a game that's going to be downloadable on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
8835094	8840198	Being developed by Konami, so I guess that's needed.
8840738	8842800	It's a movie game, so wait and expect.
8842920	8843961	Hopefully that'll be coming out soon.
8844601	8845181	Oh, next month.
8847643	8851146	Right in time for the movie, I guess, considering it comes out in a week.
8852047	8855610	It is being developed by the people that did Timeshift, Saber Interactive.
8855850	8858092	Yay, we got more calls coming in.
8858412	8859493	Yay, let's go to the phones.
8859513	8860293	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8860313	8860634	Who's this?
8861795	8862495	Hey, it's Ron.
8862595	8863676	How are you guys doing tonight?
8863956	8869721	Of course, because when I say get through now, you know how to get through the system and beat everybody else.
8869821	8872743	I don't know, you've got some type of psychic prowess.
8872783	8873364	I don't know what it is.
8874062	8875943	It's a blessing and a curse.
8876943	8878464	A blessing for you, a curse for us.
8878524	8879444	No, I'm kidding.
8879744	8880745	Funny.
8882145	8884126	First thing, I just want to say, Loki, welcome back.
8884146	8885406	I'm glad you're feeling much better.
8885686	8886087	Thank you.
8886827	8888748	You got it.
8888788	8891889	But don't ever talk like that in the opening of the show ever again, am I right?
8893169	8893469	Maybe.
8894570	8894990	Just kidding.
8895470	8897572	That's right, I do remember that.
8925444	8935092	The Special Dance Pad, and both I do remember that Oh yeah, those were selling for crazy money for a while And then, what happened?
8935452	8936493	Reprint?
8937014	8951666	Even more recent than that, the Wii System Everyone was like, oh hey, we can't make enough of these They're just so hard to put together Such advanced technology that's been around since the GameCube How do we do it?
8952387	8952627	Yeah
8953208	8956990	Yeah, like I'm supposed to believe there was a shortage on those that wasn't on purpose.
8957931	8959852	Sure, whatever you say, Nintendo.
8959932	8960832	I'll believe you.
8963854	8964414	Oh, God.
8966535	8969017	So, what do you think about the 3DS?
8970358	8976161	I really want one, but to be perfectly honest, I think I'm going to do what SSJ100Matt said.
8976441	8977021	Wait a while.
8977041	8978082	We'll just see.
8978598	8979799	Man, that's good advice.
8980139	8982841	You know, you asking about all this Nintendo stuff, though, reminded me.
8982881	8986624	I had a big question I was going to ask Loki in Part A when we were doing all the 3DS stories.
8987205	8989706	He was so ranty, I got completely sidetracked.
8989887	8992028	So I'm going to ask it now with you on the line, Robin.
8992328	8994110	He's just making up for last week, so yeah.
8994230	8994650	I know, I know.
8994690	8995871	He's got to do double duty this week.
8995891	8998033	But no, I want to ask this question because this is a serious question.
8998073	9000755	This is one I was talking the other day with some people about is...
9002750	9005272	What's the Wii going to give us this year?
9005972	9010576	Nintendo at E3 this year, we know they're going to announce a Mario game for 3DS.
9010756	9011436	Duh!
9012016	9014938	We know they'll be talking about the other 3DS titles throughout Christmas.
9015639	9017280	What have they got going on the Wii right now?
9017640	9018941	Skyward Sword, that's about it.
9019261	9021603	And they're dragging that shit out as long as possible.
9022882	9032388	Is it possible, not to sound fanboy-esque here, but is it possible that Zelda was pushed back because this is the year they're going to announce a Wii HD?
9032689	9032829	No.
9033329	9035731	And not a Wii 2, but a Wii HD.
9035791	9042715	No, this is exactly what happened to the last Metroid Other M. They announced it way too damn early.
9042755	9044176	It gets delayed forever.
9044977	9047418	It's just like the Metroid Prime Trilogy.
9048559	9078242	they're just pushing shit back longer and longer and they keep announcing stuff well into it much in advance just so they have something to fill up their E3 press conference with because I mean seriously if they cut out all the stuff that's supposed to be coming out this year I mean well they announced Skyward Sword and that was a big part of their thing and I bet you right now it's going to be a big part of their press conference you know coming soon and I'm sure there'll be a Just Dance 3 that they can always
9078302	9080503	X-Differ play a whole lot of Pikmin?
9096963	9121740	I think so I don't know, there's a part of me that feels like now is the time for Nintendo to come out and say it's gotta be next year if not this year, it's got to be next year because the 3DS will be standard by then and they've gotta come out and say okay, here's the next Wii but I don't think it would be the Wii 2 so much as it would be comparing the DS to the DS Lite If it's the Wii 2, is it the Wii Wii?
9122661	9124923	Shut up Maybe it's the Weed
9125763	9125963	VD Sure
9142661	9143261	And why wouldn't it?
9143441	9153585	I mean, because one thing that Nintendo has done pretty well is the whole back, well, I guess really it's only been on the one series of games, backwards compatibility with the Wii.
9153745	9155546	Every GameCube game is playable on the Wii.
9155566	9158327	Well, I mean, for the portable systems, it's been pretty good.
9158627	9158967	That's true.
9158987	9160648	Because the DS had the Game Boy Advance.
9160668	9162228	Stuff like that.
9162248	9163569	And Game Boy Advance had the Game Boy.
9163609	9165830	When you were doing cartridge formats, you kind of couldn't.
9165990	9166830	So I get that.
9167150	9167630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9189426	9209741	and that's why they're not going to embrace that type of mentality because why should they put out a new console that has better graphics on it people don't care and according to them people don't care and really they're just going to be releasing quality games same reason with the whole online argument is like they don't care people don't care about online
9209841	9210902	We too would be weenie in Japanese
9234710	9235030	Get it?
9235670	9237170	That name will never get old.
9238031	9238931	Alright, fine.
9239151	9239911	You make a good point.
9239951	9242651	Maybe this will be the year we finally fucking get F-Zero on the Wii.
9242671	9243131	How about that?
9243151	9243792	No, not gonna happen.
9243852	9244512	Why not?
9244592	9245332	God, Loki!
9245452	9246692	You're ruining everything!
9246732	9247672	No, you have to understand.
9247732	9250313	What you're gonna get is you're gonna get New Super Mario Bros.
9250333	9250313	2.
9250353	9250433	No!
9250453	9252893	It's just gonna have some different levels and stuff.
9252913	9253993	What a goddamn F-Zero game!
9254534	9256334	Wait, I can go for New Super Mario Bros.
9256654	9259794	2, but if Nintendo re-releases Super Mario Bros.
9260094	9262575	64 for the 3DS, I will nerd rage.
9264405	9282181	Look, despite all the hatred, all the vicious, vile hatred that Loki's been throwing at Nintendo this entire show, I am telling you, if Reggie comes out at E3 and announces the Wii HD with F-Zero as a launch title, I will jump on stage and do something very naughty.
9282381	9283081	I would not buy it.
9283122	9284102	He's gonna snog him.
9284342	9284983	No, I'm sorry.
9285083	9285703	I would not buy it.
9286243	9293087	I have a Wii that's gathering dust because I don't play it and there's nothing I want to play on it.
9294248	9296509	I mean, I could play New Super Mario Bros.
9296589	9303013	on it or Mario Galaxy 2 or something like that, but I haven't even finished Galaxy, so I don't know why I'd want to play Mario Galaxy 2.
9303253	9303473	It's just...
9305294	9312216	The only thing that interests me, and this is going back to once again what they could have done right with Mario Kart, is the modded tracks for Mario Kart.
9312236	9313216	Because that sounds interesting.
9313336	9314777	Ooh, new tracks for Mario Kart.
9314917	9316137	I can go play that game again.
9317697	9318538	What's to stop them?
9318618	9322959	Seriously, what is to stop them other than the fact that they probably didn't program DLC into Mario Kart?
9323039	9327860	But let's just imagine a world where they are forward thinking and actually did that.
9328200	9329901	What's to stop them from saying, hey, you know what?
9330381	9335804	Instead of putting out a new Mario Kart game, we're just going to have this $10 expansion that's going to add 16 new tracks to the game.
9336384	9338005	People would be damn excited about that.
9338105	9338866	It would be awesome.
9338886	9339606	But they're not going to do that.
9339626	9341147	Does this mean you can borrow your President Cat?
9341947	9344589	This is such a forward-thinking company that they're like, oh!
9345389	9346490	Patches to games?
9346750	9347451	We don't need that.
9347491	9348612	Games are perfect when they come out.
9348632	9350794	There's never going to be glitches that we'll need to fix.
9351334	9354337	No, let's just not even bother putting a system in there for that.
9354657	9373452	Did you hear that David Jaffe, completely random tangent, did you hear that David Jaffe was out there at a Game Developers Conference and I was reading some article about he said that companies should be limited to only three patches in a calendar year and they should not be allowed to patch a game until at least six weeks after release.
9373692	9376133	No, because you know what all that's going to do?
9376314	9378175	That's just going to leave a broken game for longer.
9378575	9379295	I know what he's thinking.
9379315	9385239	He's thinking, oh, if we limited them to this, then they have to make sure the game is working and spend extra time.
9385479	9386460	No, they don't give a shit.
9386480	9388921	They'll just wait longer for it to be fixed.
9388981	9390042	That's all that's going to create.
9390182	9397286	And he should shut the hell up and just make his Twisted Metals and God of Wars and be done with it because his crappy Calling All Cars game was terrible.
9398106	9400648	And he talks too much, and he's seriously annoying.
9401789	9403650	Damn, Loki, won't you switch to decaf?
9418459	9419960	He was saying, like, the Wii's terrible.
9419980	9423403	And all of a sudden, oh, hey, you know, maybe we should develop games for the Wii because it's popular.
9424644	9427006	I mean, so wishy-washy.
9427166	9432049	But, no, seriously, that's a dumb idea with limiting people to patches and stuff like that.
9432430	9441497	I think even some companies... I want to say it's either Microsoft or Sony charges companies for putting out patches or title updates for their games.
9441657	9443938	I want to say it's probably Microsoft that does that.
9444319	9446380	They like them to put out... So...
9449454	9449815	I don't know.
9449835	9451616	I just don't think it's a good idea.
9451716	9460921	What they should do though is if games are buggy, they should have some sort of, I don't know, penalize the developers somehow for putting out buggy games.
9461141	9462682	They have to figure out a system to do that.
9463983	9465244	Make it more expensive to patch?
9466863	9468827	No, because once again, it just leaves broken games.
9468867	9471452	Look at Activision, Black Ops and stuff like that.
9471732	9473936	There's a lot of stuff that's just broken with that game.
9474417	9476901	It took them forever to patch that stuff.
9478364	9478725	It's just...
9481417	9481997	I don't care.
9504625	9506827	Well, Ranma, thanks for sitting on the line while Loki bitches.
9507087	9508748	Appreciate it.
9508788	9512211	I'm glad to do my dutiful duty as a proud member of the OL Army.
9512271	9514753	There's going to be so much Nintendo fanboy hate mail this week.
9514813	9515374	I can't wait.
9515974	9516254	All right.
9516775	9519237	Well, Ranma, thank you, as always, for your call.
9519997	9520578	Have a good one, buddy.
9521839	9522119	Later.
9522779	9523900	Too bad Loki took up all your time.
9523920	9524321	Alright.
9526122	9526542	I'm kidding.
9526642	9527083	You know what?
9528264	9531386	I've had friends tell me the best part of the show is when Loki gets mad at something.
9531807	9533928	Well, no, it's just annoying.
9534309	9535329	It's just honesty.
9536130	9537591	It's just how it is.
9539553	9542514	Game companies nowadays know that they don't have to put out a perfect game.
9542554	9543775	They can just release it buggy.
9544175	9548498	They get a few more sales out there because they don't have to wait for development.
9548538	9553361	Then they patch it later on when they let people basically test it out.
9553501	9558744	Why should they hire beta testers when they can go ahead and have the public test it out?
9558764	9562707	They figure out what all the bugs are, read their forums or whatever, go fix those bugs, and then...
9563587	9564968	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
9588323	9590345	That's how the game industry works.
9590425	9600316	Unfortunately, since now these games can be patched on the fly, there's less focus on putting out a game that's not buggy from the beginning.
9601678	9603600	Alright, well that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9603640	9605201	Thanks to those of you guys who got through.
9605261	9607524	To those who didn't get through, call sooner next time.
9608085	9610207	Probably could have fit in another call or two if we had some sooner.
9610697	9612459	Alright, but for now we're going to go ahead and close the skyline.
9612479	9619786	If you do want to elaborate on some thoughts, though, or you want to respond to Loki, mailbag at orangelonestrater.com is a great place to do it, or on our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
9620086	9623329	But for now, it's getting to be about 9 o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast.
9623369	9626772	It's probably about time we start to wrap up the show with some final thoughts.
9626812	9627793	Let me check in, though, real quick.
9627833	9630155	Any other last-minute stories we want to throw in before we wrap up the show?
9631356	9631457	Um...
9634244	9634885	Let's see here.
9635125	9637428	I don't think so.
9637708	9642914	We'll have a lot of fun stuff coming from PAX East and I expect those of you guys that are at PAX East next week, I want phone calls.
9643822	9644803	This is kind of neat, I guess.
9644883	9647264	Infamous 2 is going to let you create your own missions.
9648644	9649265	There's something.
9649885	9651606	It doesn't even have to be a Mario Kart type game.
9651686	9655568	You can just have a game where you just create your own levels and stuff.
9655588	9656748	People eat that shit up now.
9657769	9659209	That's what the trend is nowadays.
9660130	9660930	Play, share, create.
9660950	9661490	Sony gets it.
9662451	9662751	Somewhat.
9663631	9664052	Hope sucks.
9665492	9666333	You can't be right all the time.
9667553	9667974	All right.
9668674	9670616	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9670856	9671437	I'm getting worried.
9671477	9673139	Loki might need to get some Eidol here pretty soon.
9674080	9675241	I'm just giving you a hard time.
9675561	9676462	Dismanstrating.
9676542	9676802	All right.
9676862	9678424	He's manstrating all over the place.
9679845	9680406	Copyright.
9680706	9681447	Oh, I'm sorry.
9681467	9682187	One more last thing.
9682247	9682748	Oh, please.
9682848	9683308	By all means.
9683428	9685210	And this is just a rumor, I guess.
9685270	9687993	It's a rumor that Strider and Frank West are coming as download content.
9688013	9689254	Those will be $5 each, too.
9689414	9690515	Thank you, Capcom.
9690675	9692397	I will pay $5 for Strider to hear you.
9693388	9703757	I really want to play the old Strider NES game I know you guys don't like it as much as the Genesis one but I fondly remember the NES one from my childhood I really want to play that again, it's been a long time
9712785	9713025	DarkSakura
9738939	9740920	I'm sure glad Loki's back after a C-section.
9743781	9746282	My final thought tonight is... Ow.
9747542	9748583	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9749503	9751204	I don't know.
9752044	9759387	I thought with a week being off, I'd be able to get more done with the Grand Theft Auto stuff, but some things just take time, I guess, when it comes to modding this stuff.
9759467	9763268	And also, I will still be angry at Nintendo because they just continue to disappoint.
9763288	9764068	I can't help it.
9764128	9767310	If you make stupid decisions, I'm just going to call you out on it.
9768910	9769331	All right.
9769871	9772093	We'll have plenty more next week on the show.
9772193	9774574	DarkSakura, sadly not joining us next week.
9774915	9776176	I won't be sad, though.
9776276	9776736	I know you won't.
9776776	9779278	But we will be back with another edition of Orange Launch Radio.
9779338	9780779	I'll call in from the road.
9781119	9783341	I don't know if we'll have a temp co-host or what we'll do.
9783501	9784121	You have to call me.
9785562	9785842	What's that?
9786103	9786683	You have to call me.
9786803	9787143	We can.
9787644	9787784	Yeah.
9788755	9789355	On the road.
9789715	9790716	Yep, that's it.
9790956	9791376	We're done.
9791556	9792977	We're out of here until next week.
9793377	9794637	We'll do this all again next week.
9794678	9797419	But in the meantime, that's another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
9797599	9803301	Remember, of course, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, we are not a gigantic website with millions of hits.
9804201	9807603	We don't have a magazine that backs us or a gaming company that backs us.
9807963	9810124	We don't throw a bunch of commercials in your face.
9810584	9814266	So all we ask, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, tell some friends about the show.
9814606	9817667	The example at the start of the show where a friend was playing it at his lamb party.
9818067	9820849	Perfect example is an awesome A-plus move.
9821189	9822550	So just tell people about the show.
9822810	9824491	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9824791	9828093	Get us some more voices to bring to the table here at the show.
9828613	9830014	Don't send DarkSakura a dollar.
9831295	9834377	But come back next week for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
9835237	9838038	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
9838559	9841800	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
9842240	9850884	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.
9851404	9863009	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
9863609	9864430	See you next week!
9866702	9867774	Thanks for watching!
