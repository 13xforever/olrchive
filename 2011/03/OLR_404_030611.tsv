0	19740	Today, March 6th, 2011, the PlayStation 3 stops shipping in one country, GameStop becomes
19740	31720	the target of the class-action lawsuit, and Microsoft clears up some old gamer tags.
31720	36000	Hello my friends out there on the interwebs and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36000	37000	Radio.
37000	38960	It is that show about video games.
38960	43360	It's the show that brings every gamer a voice as we have over the past nine years.
43360	48160	We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby
48160	49320	Black Wolf show.
49320	50320	My name is Rob Roberts.
50320	53160	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
53160	56080	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
56080	57080	Shamae.
57080	58080	How are you?
58080	59080	Shamae.
59080	60080	Shamazzle.
60080	63360	Are we the Laverne and Shirley opening?
63360	66640	This will be showing up on our photo feed shortly.
66640	67640	Shortly.
67640	72000	Because today's alcoholism is brought to you by Shamae, which is tasty.
72000	75640	Uh oh, you're not drinking during the show again because last week, oh boy, that was
75640	76640	a rough show.
76640	77640	Alright.
77640	78640	Watch me.
78640	79640	You're not drinking.
79640	81080	Say hello and welcome back.
81080	82600	Loki is back with us tonight.
82600	83600	Hello.
83600	84600	How are you doing?
84600	85600	You feeling better?
85600	87000	Um, yeah, I guess.
87000	88480	We told all the listeners why you were gone.
88480	89480	Sorry if you want to keep it a secret.
89480	90480	No, I don't.
90480	91480	We forget to tweet about it.
91480	92480	I don't care.
92480	93480	Yeah, it's fine.
93480	94480	I told him that we played a song in tribute.
94480	95480	That's right.
95480	96480	We did play living in a hernia.
96480	97480	Living with a hernia on our way out.
97480	100040	Apparently it was something, I don't know, I guess it was something I had for a long
100040	105820	time or something, but like on Tuesday last week, like all of a sudden my innie became
105820	110920	an Audi and it's like, oh, this kind of hurts, you know, why is this hurting?
110920	115800	So I went to the doctor, doctor said, um, you know, hey, you better go, you know, here,
115800	118680	I'm going to make an appointment with the surgeon right now so you can go get checked
118680	119680	out.
119680	122560	And then the went to the surgeon's office and they're like, well, we can take care of
122560	123560	this right now if you want.
123560	125760	I'm like, all right.
125760	126760	So they're wet.
126760	127760	They did that.
127760	133560	And it hurt like a bitch for, well, during the operation because, you know, operations
133560	134560	tend to hurt.
134560	135560	Did they put you under?
135560	136560	I don't know.
136560	137560	It's local.
137560	138560	And that felt weird.
138560	139560	Yeah, I bet.
139560	140560	Oh.
140560	145040	Um, but then, uh, no, then it's just like really stiff and sore for a couple of days.
145040	146920	I just want to point out, they don't knock you out for a vasectomy either.
146920	150320	If you want to, I'm sure that I've heard, I haven't had, that probably wouldn't have
150320	153560	heard as bad as, you know, it's not even really hurting.
153560	154560	It's weird stuff.
154560	160460	Like imagine someone putting like their finger into your belly button underneath and then
160460	164640	pulling muscle, you know, down or something like that.
164640	170520	That's kind of the feeling that stuff or nice sounds of barf or the, um, the feeling of
170520	175580	someone electrocuting fat or something on you and popping and then smelling that fat
175580	176580	burning.
176580	181200	Once in a while we do talk about video games, I promise, but no, I'm feeling, I'm feeling
181200	182200	better.
182200	183200	Did they turn the fat into bacon?
183200	184200	They did not.
184200	185200	It does not smell like bacon.
185200	187920	It's not even, it's not good.
187920	191560	Smells like a chicken burning does not smell like chicken burning.
191560	196840	It's not pleasant and it's not pleasant to feel it burning either.
196840	202920	All right, well look, all this gross medical talk house aside, um, hopefully you had a
202920	205440	chance to play a lot of games while you were recovering.
205440	206440	Yeah.
206440	208160	And it was, it was an umbilical hernia.
208160	212320	It was something I think, cause like for the long, like as long as I can remember, it was
212320	214360	like my belly button feels weird.
214360	217080	Like it felt like there was like a tube on the other side or something like that.
217080	220680	Well you never had a baby to lift before and it's probably what, I don't even know if it
220680	221680	does that.
221680	224520	It was just, if it was there, your intestines hooked up to the wrong spot.
224520	229200	Basically what happened was is like it, what happens with hernia is sometimes fat can,
229200	232600	fat or tissue can get trapped inside of it and then it gets, the circulation gets caught
232600	233600	off and it dies.
233600	235500	Well, that's what started to happen with some of that.
235500	237120	So that's why I started hurting.
237120	242760	Um, so they had to, you know, get rid of that so that, you know, wouldn't turn, you know,
242760	245520	into gangrene or something.
245520	248680	I got to go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
248680	250480	Let me read you some of the comments from our chat room right now.
250480	251480	We are live.
251480	252480	Uh, at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
252480	253480	OMFG.
253480	254480	Loki.
254480	255480	Stop.
255480	256480	Gah.
256480	257480	Yeah.
257480	260040	Can't Loki just talk about grand theft or earth defense force instead?
260040	261360	Orange lounge trauma center.
261360	263880	I can talk about both of those.
263880	269240	I saw the, I saw the new little, uh, trailer or like behind the scenes or not really a
269240	270240	trailer.
270240	274720	It was like a behind the scenes thing on, um, or a preview of earth defense.
274720	277000	It's awesome.
277000	278000	So awesome.
278000	279000	All right.
279000	281320	Anyhow, wow.
281320	285720	I don't know how to follow that up, but, uh, I guess we'll find now that technically I'm
285720	289880	not supposed to be lifting anything or doing anything, but I feel fine.
289880	292560	Um, and so I've been lifting my son's stuff.
292560	295440	I'm just not like, you know, not because you're secretly a cyborg.
295440	299000	I'm not going to go, you know, try to get more cat litter or something like that.
299000	300480	It was like a 30 pound.
300480	303200	It's basically if it hurts, stop doing it.
303200	305720	Uh, well you were missed last week.
305720	306720	Loki.
306720	308720	But our aims improving now that you're with the targeting range.
308720	309720	Was last week.
309720	310720	Seriously.
310720	311720	We had a drunk Jamie.
311720	312720	We had the Oscars.
312720	313720	I was tipsy.
313720	318080	We had a drunk Jamie and the mystique came in middle of the show and I don't even know
318080	319080	what happened.
319080	320080	Shut off our Batman shoes.
320080	321080	I did pretty good on my Oscar picks.
321080	327640	I think I haven't got a chance to be back to my work yet, but I hope I won something
327640	329240	that'd be kind of cool.
329240	332160	All right, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming weeks.
332160	333160	Dark soccer.
333160	334160	How was your gaming week?
334160	335160	I played well.
335160	338800	Damn you addict dealer.
338800	343280	I joined the Horde house guild and made a death night because it did not want to start
343280	344280	from one.
344280	345920	That's the interesting thing about having a new guild.
345920	346920	Yeah.
346920	347920	My a spinoff show.
347920	351120	Horde house with extra for has an official guild now and all the details are on the last
351120	352840	show or the goober server Twitter.
352840	353840	Yeah.
353840	354840	Uh, on what?
354840	355840	Wow.
355840	356840	Wiki calls a server full of bad players.
356840	357840	So we had to roll there.
357840	358840	We had to roll there.
358840	359840	Had to do it.
359840	361840	So, but everything's starting from scratch has been very weird.
361840	366160	I've run into nothing but assholes really except for us.
366160	367160	Of course.
367160	371120	Um, well, I know there was one nice person who wanted to group with me, but I'm like,
371120	372640	I don't want to play with you.
372640	374520	So it's just been MMOs for you?
374520	379680	Well, today I went in either room cause I wanted to play Marvel versus Capcom three
379680	382380	and I was in, and Dan was playing through Shinobi.
382380	388360	So I sit down with my, uh, my sleepy, I sleep with a sleeping bag because it's really warm
388360	392240	and cause I was super cold, so I sat with my sleeping bag and I fell asleep to Shinobi
392240	395200	and woke up to Ikaruga.
395200	401160	So I guess that counts that I can sleep to video games apparently at some point Dan beat
401160	406080	it cause I opened my eyes and saw the ending and it was like, Oh, whatever.
406080	408760	And uh, I think that's about it.
408760	414920	You know, um, uh, off show stuff, we were, um, out to brunch earlier today cause I've
414920	418520	been promising you brunch when Alan was in town for a long time.
418520	419520	Best French toast ever.
419520	420520	Well, I had the waffle.
420520	421520	It was pretty good.
421520	425080	But, um, we were kind of talking about old school video games and I had mentioned, uh,
425080	427680	ever since then, cause we were talking about, um, a certain game that's going to come up
427680	428760	later in the show.
428760	432400	And then we were talking about Rygar, the, uh, the arcade game, like not the NES game
432400	433400	that most everybody remembers.
433400	434840	It was also an arcade game.
434840	439520	And I was talking about the Taito arcade classics that is on Xbox, the old school one.
439520	442000	It has Rygar, has tech mobile, a bunch of other stuff in it.
442000	444000	Uh, and like how I've been really wanting to play that.
444000	447520	I didn't get to it today, but like ever since our little conversation this morning, I've
447520	448800	been dying to go back and play some Rygar.
448800	450520	It's been like an old school arcade day.
450520	452640	It is, I think one of the backwards compatible.
452640	453640	It is.
453640	454640	It is.
454640	455640	That's why I know I can play it.
455640	456640	That came up in our discussion today.
456640	457640	Yeah.
457640	459680	So, cause I don't think Dan knew that it was backwards compatible and it is one of the
459680	460680	few.
460680	461680	I don't think he checked.
461680	463880	Did Taito, I think Taito had like the Rainbow Islands and Bubble Bobble.
463880	465080	I can't remember what was in that collection.
465080	469560	It was years ago that I first got it, but now it's pretty awesome considering a lot
469560	472560	of those arcade games kind of get recycled and they want to charge you five, 10 bucks
472560	473560	a piece for them.
473560	474560	I love Parasol Stars.
474560	480160	I found a copy of Parasol Stars for a PC Engine and they wanted like a bunch of money for
480160	481720	it, which was retarded.
481720	482720	I'm sorry.
482720	483720	Which was stupid.
483720	486080	I'm sorry if I offended some retarded people out there.
486080	487080	Whatever.
487080	489520	I was trying to see if I could find the, uh.
489520	491360	Oh, now I'm sorry if I offended stupid people.
491360	498880	I was trying to see if I could find the Taito arcade classics page, but I can't find it.
498880	501760	An older game, so it's probably harder to find.
501760	503760	And I don't want to hear anything about Pokemans.
503760	504760	Are you jealous?
504760	508920	Cause I've already heard about Pokemans from when Shane was playing through Pokemans.
508920	512480	It's all old news.
512480	513480	Old news.
513480	517160	I find it fascinating how many people are going to get Pokemon black and white on the
517160	523600	3DS, even though you can play it on a DS Lite, but because the launch lineup for 3DS is not
523600	526760	as strong as it could have been, uh, there's a lot of people that want to use Pokemon to
526760	527920	kind of fill in the gap.
527920	528920	So we're waiting.
528920	532600	Pokemon fans are pretty rabid, so it's a big day for a lot of people.
532600	538360	Dan has announced that we are waiting for Star Fox to get our 3DS.
538360	539840	And I want Kid Icarus.
539840	541720	Yeah, hopefully those will all be up on the holidays.
541720	543640	All those other bitches can shut up.
543640	544640	Alright.
544640	546640	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?
546640	547640	Shime.
547640	548640	Let's go to Loki.
548640	549640	How was your gaming week, Loki?
549640	550640	And I know you had time to play a lot.
550640	552640	Yeah, but I didn't play a lot.
552640	556680	But I did play a few things, and it's funny.
556680	561320	So I finished Sword and Poker 2 finally, so I stopped playing that.
561320	567160	And I'm playing a new iOS game, Game Dev Story.
567160	572060	It's the one where it's a game developer sim, and so you can develop games and stuff like
572060	573060	that.
573060	576160	And, uh, you know, I'm just kicking ass at it.
576160	584560	And it's kind of funny, though, because it's, uh, it takes place, like, during, you know,
584560	589240	pre-Nintendo and stuff like that, but there's all these different systems with different
589240	595840	names that are supposed to be the, you know, those consoles, like the Nintendo IES, or,
595840	600720	you know, the Neon Gion, stuff like that.
600720	608200	So I have my company, Orange Lounge, here, and let me go over some of the past products
608200	611360	that we have put out, and that have sold well.
611360	615600	And of course, everything is really inappropriate, so that's awesome.
615600	617760	Very awesome.
617760	625080	One of our first games, Two Girls, One Cup, sold 847,000 units, of course, that's early
625080	627080	on.
627080	633920	Pokemans, we put out a game called Pokemans, sold 2.7 million.
633920	642040	Some of the other more popular games, um, Fucked Your Mom, 4 million units, Pokemans
642040	650240	3, 11 million, You Is Stupid, which is our You Don't Know Jack game, and then of course
650240	654480	I ripped off other things, obviously, since Nintendo doesn't exist, so we have Mario RPG
654480	655480	as well.
655480	665080	Pokeman Online, 54 million copies, that's pretty awesome, and then of course our last
665080	669600	music game, TDR Ol' Army, 46 million.
669600	675240	And that's on our console, the glory hole, because they happened to be watching the soup
675240	681800	at the time, so, and our console is kicking the Playstation's ass.
681800	682800	Wow.
682800	689600	I gotta do a quick correction, so I apologize, I blended my companies together.
689600	695160	The Rygar and Tecmo Bowl, of course, are in the Tecmo Classic Arcade Collection, not Taito,
695160	700640	sorry, a very similar sounding in my arcade classic knowledge failed me for a moment,
700640	704920	but there's Tecmo Classic Arcade, that is the one that is backwards compatible, Bombjack
704920	708840	Rygar, Tecmo Bowl, Solomon's Key, lots of awesome ones.
708840	712380	There is a separate game called Taito Legends, I can't remember if this one was backwards
712380	716080	compatible, but this was the one that had like the Bubble Bobble, Space Invaders, Elevator
716080	721740	Action, New Zealand Story, and some of those games, so, oops!
721740	722740	I'm getting old, sorry.
722740	724920	And these games are how many years old?
724920	728960	And funny enough, Frisbee, Fucked Your Mom, The Sequel, Fucked Your Dad, that is actually
728960	733240	the sequel, so, pretty funny.
733240	739440	But the game, it's all done in pixel art, and it's pretty fun, and basically you hire
739440	746400	people, fire people, you train them, you can eventually get like, you can go to E3, or
746400	755240	I think they call it Game Decks, it's like Com Decks, SSJ100 Matt wants to know how what
755240	757520	theyplay.com snap is selling.
757520	760360	That's an old school, by the way.
760360	761360	Don't have that game yet.
761360	762360	You might have to put that in there.
762360	764240	We may have to develop that game.
764240	768080	But we just put out Call of Duty, and sold 7 million units in the first week.
768080	773080	And don't forget my dream game for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade would be Granny's Got a
773080	774080	Gun.
774080	775080	Granny's Got a Gun?
775080	780080	That would be Granny's Got a Gun, and it's the Golden Girls with machine guns.
780080	785900	Yes, and it's great though because you can see what your console, how it's doing and
785900	791080	stuff in the marketplace, and they even have the Virtual Boy, and all the console stuff
791080	797600	since we kinda know what's going on with the game industry and everything, it's like, okay,
797600	804800	here comes the Virtual Kid, it's a 3D portable, I don't think I'll be developing on that because
804800	809440	I think it's going away really fast, and sure enough it goes away really fast, just like
809440	816460	the other ones, instead of the Saturn it's the Uranus.
816460	818360	But yeah, it's pretty fun.
818360	823760	Definitely worth picking up Game Dev Story, and they have the new one, they don't have
823760	829720	it over here yet, but they have some spa sim, they have the spa sim over here, which is
829720	836200	kinda dumb, but they have a game store, it's called the Game Dealer, and you play like
836200	839600	a Game Stop type thing, it's a similar game, Dev Story.
839600	840880	I've heard about that.
840880	844960	But yeah, definitely, Game Dev Story, check it out, it's awesome.
844960	845960	Alright.
845960	849280	Oh, and then other things, I'm sorry, Grand Theft Auto.
849280	852320	Of course, of course, wouldn't be a week on OLR without Grand Theft Auto.
852320	855400	In fact, was that what you were playing a minute ago, it was in like debug mode or something
855400	856800	where you had the flying ice cream truck?
856800	862680	No, that was the PC version, I'm working on mod stuff for it, because I've edited the
862680	869400	water and everything to create this kind of a hydro thunder type track thing in there,
869400	873840	so I'm building, I've done the water part of it, called ice cream thunder.
873840	876320	No, the ice cream truck has nothing to do with it.
876320	880760	The whole reason there was an ice cream truck that was flying around like a helicopter is
880760	885360	because the annihilator helicopter fires guns off of it, and I was trying to make a vehicle
885360	889200	that drives around that fires guns out of the front of it, that happens to be an ice
889200	894200	cream truck just like, you know, Sweet Tooth and Twisted Metal, so.
894200	898000	Was unable to do that though, because the game just crashes for no apparent reason when
898000	901000	I try to make it drive.
901000	902000	So I don't know.
902000	905240	Does it play that horrible Jack in the Box style music while you're driving it?
905240	909400	It does when it, because that, all I did was I replaced the image of it, so.
909400	915320	But the actual ice cream truck does play all the like, you know, that type of music.
915320	918760	Can you do not just an ice cream truck, but what do they call it, the Roach Coaches that,
918760	919760	you know, the trucks start to incorporate buildings?
919760	920760	They don't have the Roach Coaches.
920760	922640	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
922640	928560	No but you can, like I've, some other map edit stuff I was working on, I was doing some
928560	934800	tweaks to the physics of the bus and the ambulance, and so now I can clear Central Park with a
934800	937120	ramp, which is awesome.
937120	940480	That bus moves fast.
940480	941480	I don't know.
941480	945280	They need to bring back something like hard driving and modernize it with more stunts.
945280	947720	I mean I guess you could say, well like Burnout or whatever, but like.
947720	952560	Well that would technically be, well yeah, I mean like I understand, as far as like that
952560	956080	game Stunts, I guess that would be Trackmania, it would be kind of similar to Stunts.
956080	957080	Oh yeah, Trackmania.
957080	961320	But um, you know, as far as like a simulation racing game like that, I don't think they
961320	962320	have that.
962320	966080	Hey but hey, you know, EA, Need for Speed, you know, maybe some Need for Speed stunt
966080	967400	game or something like that.
967400	969040	That would be fun.
969040	973680	Alright, uh, My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff, I haven't really invested a lot
973680	974680	in new games lately.
974680	978680	I was tempted the other day though, man, the Dreamcast Collection with Space Channel 5
978680	983480	Part 2, uh, Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure, which are already out on Xbox Live Arcade,
983480	988240	but I didn't because I figured the game I really, really want, it'll come out on Xbox
988240	991640	Live Arcade eventually, and if I really, really, really wanted to play it, I could probably
991640	996000	just borrow, you know, Alan's copy or Jamie's copy or something, so I'll just wait a little
996000	999720	longer for some choo choo in Space Channel 5 Part 2.
999720	1004640	As far as games I actually did play, went back, today I was feeling really old school
1004640	1009120	for some reason, I went back and played Bionic Commando Rearmed, because I was going through
1009120	1012240	like my Xbox games, because I bought a lot of arcade games back in the day, and I was
1012240	1014920	like, which one of these did I not play enough of?
1014920	1018280	I got down to B before I found the game, I was like, shit, I need to play more of this.
1018280	1022980	So I spent some quality time with Bionic Commando Rearmed, and I don't know why I just stopped
1022980	1025320	playing that the first time, I think it just came out during a period where there were
1025320	1029320	a lot of games coming out, and yes, I realize there's a sequel out already, so I'm a little
1029320	1035280	bit behind, but yeah, you can't forget, especially for you folks who are just now getting Xbox
1035280	1039120	360s, I think sometimes you can get a little bit distracted by all the arcade games that
1039120	1043640	are out there now, but seriously, there's a lot of like old school stuff that's really
1043640	1048080	pretty good out on Xbox Live Marketplace, so do your research, because there's some
1048080	1052160	games you might have missed that came out even like a year ago, two years, I mean, heck,
1052160	1056000	how old's the Xbox 360 now, coming on five years old, and still some stuff that dates
1056000	1060160	all the way back, that's quality stuff, like Geometry Wars, the original, is still worth
1060160	1064360	your five bucks, and the sequel's probably worth another ten.
1064360	1066480	Rest in peace, Bazaar.
1066480	1071320	As far as other games I played this week, I did check out the demo for one new game,
1071320	1075360	Beyond Good and Evil HD, which is of course the big Xbox Live title that came out this
1075360	1079320	week, which made a lot of people really excited, because the original game has lots and lots
1079320	1083960	of fans, and let me admit something to you guys, I never really played the original.
1083960	1089560	I know, I know, it was like a huge game, had its fans on PC, PS2, again, I think the original
1089560	1094680	kind of came out during a time where I wasn't, either I was way too hardcore into the music
1094680	1098320	games where I was missing a lot of this stuff, or I don't know, I just, you know, there's
1098320	1102360	not enough time in the day to play everything, so I missed this the first time around.
1102360	1106760	But I checked it out this time, and I at least played through the demo, and I was left wanting
1106760	1110520	to get the full version, it was pretty cool.
1110520	1113160	Having not played the original, I can't sit here and profess to know a lot about what
1113160	1118120	the upgraded, but I will tell you it was widescreen, it definitely seemed like there was a lot
1118120	1123760	of water effects that seemed to be somewhat new, and everything seemed very, very smooth.
1123760	1128160	It didn't look like, it did kind of look like an up-res'd PlayStation 2 game, but that's
1128160	1133120	okay, I mean, I hear a lot of people are really drawn to this game because of the story, and
1133120	1137560	I know this game really throws you in right away.
1137560	1140880	There's really not a lot of background explanation given as to, you know, what's going on in
1140880	1145560	the game, but it was cool, like I was interested in it right up until they pulled the plug
1145560	1148080	on it, which was rather abruptly on the demo.
1148080	1151920	What a great way to try and convince people to spend ten bucks, so yeah, I'm interested
1151920	1155040	in going back and revisiting this game since, you know, so many people love it, and I know
1155040	1158840	a lot of good things about it, and having got to play the first, I don't know, thirty
1158840	1164500	minutes or so in the demo was nice, so I will check out more of that, if I don't get too
1164500	1168880	distracted by Torchlight next week, because that is the Xbox Live game I am waiting for,
1168880	1173400	I love the PC one, I'm so excited to see how it translates to console, I'm really worried
1173400	1177240	I'm getting my expectations way too high, that I'm going to be just left disappointed
1177240	1180280	next week, but hopefully I can fit in Beyond Good and Evil HD 2.
1180280	1183000	According to Game Guru, Space Channel 5 is on Steam.
1183000	1188240	Yes, it did, it came out, I believe, over the weekend on Steam, it just kind of suddenly
1188240	1194760	showed up, so yeah, if you want to check that out on the PC, that would be cool, so, alright,
1194760	1198400	so that was pretty much it for my gaming week, those two games, and you know, some of the
1198400	1203520	usual stuff, wow, and some other PC games and so forth, Super Meat Boy, getting frustrated,
1203520	1206480	tried some of those new levels that we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show,
1206480	1211320	couldn't even beat one, couldn't even beat stage one on some of those really hard ones,
1211320	1212320	disgusting.
1212320	1216920	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we will get into the gaming news
1216920	1221520	for tonight, not a lot to say for housekeeping except Dark Soccer, sadly, will not be joining
1221520	1227640	us next week, but there will still be an OLR, Loki and I will be here, perhaps a guest host,
1227640	1228640	I don't know, we'll see.
1228640	1229880	I will be in a car.
1229880	1232840	Yes, you're going far away, so.
1232840	1233840	Far far away.
1233840	1234840	I hope you have fun.
1234840	1239360	Don't go too far that you can't come back, because we can go one week, but I don't know
1239360	1240360	about two weeks.
1240360	1241360	Not be back.
1241360	1242360	Alright.
1242360	1247120	Join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, you can join us on Facebook, facebook.com
1247120	1248120	slash Orange Laundry.
1248120	1251560	Speaking of Twitter, I'm peeking at it a little early tonight, and I thought this was a really
1251560	1256180	funny tweet from Defective Candy sent us a tweet, I know, I'm getting to Twitter early,
1256180	1260400	so shoot me, introducing OLR to seven of my friends tonight.
1260400	1265160	We're partying it up with some old school Unreal LAN partying and tuning in.
1265160	1269160	Well shout out to you guys at the LAN party, that sounds pretty awesome, kicking it old
1269160	1271600	school with Unreal.
1271600	1274480	Back in the day, this might be a little more even old school than Unreal, but back in the
1274480	1278360	day, we used to get together and play Quake, that used to be kind of the big thing, this
1278360	1282000	is like way before MMOs and all that, we would get together and play Quake like online, it
1282000	1283240	was just a lot of fun.
1283240	1284920	My first LAN was Duke Nukem 3D.
1284920	1285920	Oh yeah?
1285920	1289560	Yeah, I used to do that on the modem, the dial-up thing, it was a lot of fun.
1289560	1292920	Duke Nukem and Command & Conquer Red Alert were fun over the modem.
1292920	1293920	Nice.
1293920	1297360	So, I hope you guys are having fun, and thanks for spreading the word of the show, appreciate
1297360	1298360	it.
1298360	1301720	Let's get to the news, and Loki's gonna start us off tonight.
1301720	1302720	Oh yeah.
1302720	1304320	Much busier week than last week, that's for sure.
1304320	1310840	Yeah, it helps to have stuff going on in conferences and whatnot.
1310840	1314760	We may have talked about, well we did talk about this a little bit, that it was a possibility,
1314760	1322560	especially with LG suing Sony over the Blu-ray technology, but now apparently they've won
1322560	1330080	their preliminary injunction, and that means that they have blocked the sale of the Playstation
1330080	1331560	3 in Europe.
1331560	1338200	So basically, LG has an injunction for customs to seize and confiscate all PS3s coming into
1338200	1342640	Europe and from manufacturing plants, etc., up to ten days.
1342640	1345920	I don't really know what that's supposed to do for ten days.
1345920	1351760	It says, apparently they're collecting consuls, the consuls collected are temporarily being
1351760	1360720	held in Dutch warehouses until the case moves forward, but right now they're expected to,
1360720	1364740	I guess retailers are expected to have enough PS3s the last two or three weeks, so you may
1364740	1369360	not necessarily see any shortages or something like that.
1369360	1375560	You may, if this case goes further, and they end up winning everything, because Sony's
1375560	1378360	gonna have to pay them some money.
1378360	1381440	Do you think maybe that's just what's gonna ultimately happen, is that this all gets settled
1381440	1383240	out of court to stop this from happening?
1383240	1384240	It all depends-
1384240	1388560	It seems like 90% of the game lawsuit stories end up settled out of court.
1388560	1392720	It all depends whether they feel they're in the right or not.
1392720	1400040	If Sony knows that they have no chance at winning this, then they probably won't fight
1400040	1405840	it, but if they think that they're in the right and they don't need to pay them any
1405840	1410760	royalties or whatever, they're gonna fight it, because it saves them money if they don't
1410760	1414120	want to pay these royalties on every single console shipped.
1414120	1416040	How damaging is this to Sony, do you think?
1416040	1420520	Because I look at this and go, well, if they can't ship it to stores, they're still okay
1420520	1422880	for a little bit, because stores have what's on hand.
1422880	1425200	Come on, it's just a shortage for ten days.
1425200	1427880	It's no big deal.
1427880	1431920	It's not like the PlayStation 3 has a must-have game coming out this week or something.
1431920	1434560	People deal with shortages on stuff for a lot longer than ten days.
1434560	1437140	I mean, look at the Wii, and it's just fine.
1437140	1440340	I doubt this will make any sort of impact.
1440340	1445760	Everybody likes reporting on this stuff because, haha, Sony's getting their taste of legal
1445760	1450720	battles since they're suing GeoHot and stuff like that, whatever.
1450720	1456000	It's just another lawsuit, but at least this time it's not just something stupid like some
1456000	1461300	no-name company sitting on patents for a while and going, oh, hey, we invented, you know,
1461300	1463240	we patented controller.
1463240	1466240	That's true, you can't say this is so much a patent troll thing.
1466240	1467240	No, this is not.
1467240	1468240	Interesting.
1468240	1473280	All right, well, we'll see what comes of this, the legal team at Sony working overtime these
1473280	1475120	next couple weeks for sure.
1475120	1481800	Big, big gaming news, and kind of always divisive when I talk about Apple.
1481800	1486240	And Apple did announce the iPad 2 is coming out March 11th, and you bet this is gaming
1486240	1492160	news because, you know, a lot of folks are gaming on the Apple these days with the iPhone
1492160	1494720	and the iOS, you know, big, big system.
1494720	1499400	Controversial too if you want to get into the whole fact that they charge very little
1499400	1503960	for the games on the iPhone and some people have a problem with that as we learn GDC this
1503960	1504960	week.
1504960	1505960	But I digress.
1505960	1507280	iPad 2 was announced this week.
1507280	1509760	It is coming out on March 11th.
1509760	1514240	It will cost you anywhere between $629 and $829.
1514240	1520000	If you want a unit with 3G, lowest you can go though is $499 if you want the Wi-Fi only
1520000	1522600	up to $699.
1522600	1526640	Just throwing it out there too, if you wanted to get the original iPad, those are now sliced
1526640	1528560	in price by $100.
1528560	1530300	So those are now out as well.
1530300	1532920	Some of the big things that are supposed to be coming out with the iPad 2, it's not just
1532920	1538120	the fancy colors, but of particular interest is this cable that will allow you to hook
1538120	1544080	up the iPad to your television and get the output in 1080p display, which is making a
1544080	1545640	lot of people very excited.
1545640	1548600	You know, of course streaming movies that are on the device makes it very easy to kind
1548600	1552960	of bypass the Mac Mini, or I'm sorry, not the Mac Mini, the Apple TV and so forth in
1552960	1554200	order to do that.
1554200	1559000	But a lot of people also wondering, could this have some feature for games going with
1559000	1564200	it where you could use the cord to have the iPad as a control device for something on
1564200	1565200	your TV?
1565200	1566200	Angry Birds HD?
1566200	1571560	No, I mean, because who wants to be tethered to a TV?
1571560	1574680	You know, unless they have some sort of wireless thing, it's not.
1574680	1579080	Which, quite frankly, I'm surprised they don't through the whole Apple TV thing that we've
1579080	1580080	seen.
1580080	1581080	They may later on.
1581080	1585120	I mean, they can stream stuff through Apple TV, and it could be something that comes through
1585120	1586760	iOS later on, but...
1586760	1591980	I mean, we did have the story last week or two weeks ago about the whole people were
1591980	1597640	playing PS3 games through the iOS, was a whole thing that had been set up.
1597640	1602920	So I mean, the technology is getting there, and that has nothing to do with Apple themselves.
1602920	1605960	That was kind of a filed-in-a-hack-and-crack bin.
1605960	1608960	Yeah, but that's a little in the reverse.
1608960	1609960	That's not necessarily...
1609960	1618360	I mean, playing PlayStation 1 emulated games, that's through the actual system that's running
1618360	1619360	that.
1619360	1624320	But streaming stuff from the PlayStation 3, though, that's a little bit different.
1624320	1626160	That's just streaming video.
1626160	1630880	And I mean, I'm sure that obviously since the iPad 2 is a dual-core system, I'm sure
1630880	1633720	it can handle streaming stuff.
1633720	1642520	But as far as the Apple TV goes, I mean, I think it's just like an Intel Atom little
1642520	1643520	box.
1643520	1645160	I mean, it's just...
1645160	1649080	I don't think it has enough oomph to do 1080p.
1649080	1653800	I think it's capped at 720 because I think that's what iTunes is.
1653800	1656320	The ones that are out there now, yeah, 720.
1656320	1660720	Let me throw this question out there to you guys here in studio and the chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com.
1660720	1666280	There's been a lot of talk this week with this news and in the game blogs and so forth
1666280	1670200	about the 3DS, which we'll get into some of that news in a little while, and the iPad
1670200	1671760	2.
1671760	1675760	Both had these major press conferences on the same day, literally within an hour of
1675760	1683720	each other, and somewhat of a dig at Apple coming from Nintendo, and kind of a lot of
1683720	1687880	both these devices coming out in March, and a lot of talk about kind of the future of
1687880	1689880	handheld gaming.
1689880	1690880	What do you guys kind of think?
1690880	1697240	Does the 3DS really have to worry about iPad 2 or vice versa, or do these things kind of
1697240	1701360	coexist and neither really has to really worry about the other, so why are they dogging on
1701360	1702360	each other?
1702360	1704360	I think it's the latter, but you know how companies are.
1704360	1707600	They like to look for drama where there isn't.
1707600	1711160	And on top of that, the rivalry is only good for both of them.
1711160	1716720	Establishing some type of farcical rivalry.
1716720	1722240	Unfortunately, Nintendo will never be able to compete with Apple as far as their online
1722240	1725360	marketplace goes, because their online marketplace is open.
1725360	1731280	It's an open marketplace for all these developers to basically create these games, submit them,
1731280	1734320	get approval, and then they are up on the marketplace really quickly.
1734320	1738840	That's why you get hundreds of apps each day on that marketplace.
1738840	1741360	Now granted, not all of them are great, but you know what?
1741360	1744920	That should be up to the consumer to decide what's good, and they have a good review system
1744920	1751120	I think in place on the app store that it's pretty easy to find what you're looking for
1751120	1753960	and know if it's crap or not.
1753960	1757480	But see, that's what Nintendo needs, because unfortunately you're never going to be able
1757480	1763240	to compete at the level with these guys if you're just releasing three games a week on
1763240	1764240	that.
1764240	1769640	And I'm sorry, but the virtual console stuff, at this point you know what?
1769640	1774520	You should just get the rights where you can, and it really shouldn't take much.
1774520	1777960	You've got an emulator built, just dump the ROMs, go, go, go.
1777960	1781880	To PlayDevil's advocate though, what if it were three quality games a week?
1781880	1788040	I'm talking Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, the stuff that's really good on iOS, of which
1788040	1791180	there isn't much, but there are some really, really good games on there.
1791180	1795960	There are good games on the iOS platform, and it's just some of these games that people
1795960	1797560	just decide that they like.
1797560	1801120	Angry Birds I don't think is a great game.
1801120	1803120	I'm sorry, it's a game that's popular.
1803120	1805320	It's a trading game is what it is.
1805320	1808600	But the public disagrees.
1808600	1809600	Public's dumb.
1809600	1812120	It's selling very well.
1812120	1816360	I don't think it's all that either, I prefer Cut the Rope, but I can say okay, it's selling
1816360	1818440	like shit tons of copies.
1818440	1820440	And you know what though?
1820440	1825560	I wouldn't be surprised, and there's no reason why they can't have Angry Birds on the Nintendo
1825560	1826560	DS.
1826560	1831120	Right now, on the DSi, why can't they have Angry Birds on there?
1831120	1839480	I mean, PSP has it, it was a download game, it came out way later, but that's even the
1839480	1846160	problem with the PSP, they're a little online stuff, it's so closed that they just can't
1846160	1847880	get games fast enough.
1847880	1854680	They need to really open it up, I think the closest thing to the app store is probably
1854680	1859080	the Xbox Indie games, because your release is there, you're seeing a lot of games coming
1859080	1860080	out.
1860080	1864320	A lot of crap, but that's the same with the app store, a lot of it is crap.
1864320	1870440	But if you open it up, a lot more stuff comes out, and yeah, you're gonna get a lot of crappy
1870440	1874520	games, but you're also gonna get a lot of good games, and if you're smart, and know
1874520	1882640	how to highlight those good games, and know how to push that platform forward, then that
1882640	1883640	is good for you.
1883640	1887560	The problem with Nintendo though is, is if they do that, and they start pushing that
1887560	1891560	platform forward, who's gonna want to pay $50 for a game?
1891560	1897360	Because then they can just get some really quality games for like 99 cents, or a few
1897360	1899560	bucks instead of $50.
1899560	1904080	Why should I pay $50 for a 3DS game like Zelda?
1904080	1907320	Because it's 3D!
1907320	1909400	So what if it's 3D?
1909400	1914000	Doesn't mean that those digital download games aren't 3D, they could easily program for 3D,
1914000	1917640	just like there's gonna be indie games that are gonna support the Kinect, eventually,
1917640	1922000	once they open it up for everybody.
1922000	1924520	Why should I have to pay that kind of money?
1924520	1925600	And that's what they're complaining about.
1925600	1930080	They're complaining about the fact that they think that these games are devaluing their
1930080	1931080	games.
1931080	1933080	Well, why do you think that?
1933080	1938560	Because obviously if you think your games are so much better, then how would they devalue
1938560	1939560	your games?
1939560	1940560	Oh!
1940560	1942240	Because they're not...
1942240	1943820	Your games aren't that much better.
1943820	1944820	That's the problem.
1944820	1949600	Is, you know, you've spent all this money on developing these games, they're just okay.
1949600	1951600	I mean...
1951600	1952800	Let's go to comments from our chat room.
1952800	1955280	Chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments.
1955280	1958580	Dark Tetsuya says, I think Nintendo's just jealous because they can't keep releasing
1958580	1961920	all new hardware after a year the way Apple seems to.
1961920	1962920	They don't need to!
1962920	1963920	They do!
1963920	1964920	But they do!
1964920	1970920	The DS Lite, the DS Lite in new colors, the DSi, the XL...
1970920	1974080	As of lately, I would say they have been doing something new every year.
1974080	1975080	Yeah, the XL...
1975080	1980160	But, see, that's even retarded too, because what's the point of making the system larger?
1980160	1982760	How is this supposed to, you know, drive sales for you guys?
1982760	1984400	I never understood that.
1984400	1986520	Let's make a portable system larger now.
1986520	1987520	What?
1987520	1988520	Why?
1988520	1990920	It's just like, oh, let's make the Game Boy micro.
1990920	1995200	Game Guru says Nintendo pretty much dumped every game they do own on the Virtual Console.
1995200	1998360	Or at least, well, every game they could dump.
1998360	2002000	I guess maybe a dig at Earthbound because of the whole trouble there.
2002000	2003000	They're not thinking...
2003000	2007040	The problem is they're a step behind when it comes to, well, they're a few steps behind
2007040	2009840	when it comes to embracing online.
2009840	2015480	They're not where these first-party companies are.
2015480	2017780	They're not supporting download content as well.
2017780	2020880	Why aren't there downloadable tracks for Mario Kart?
2020880	2022000	I mean, come on.
2022000	2024480	And that's stupid simple.
2024480	2026040	You could easily just put out all...
2026040	2027200	Says that we can't handle it.
2027200	2028520	No, I mean, I know it can.
2028520	2030400	The Wii can handle it.
2030400	2036480	The problem with the Wii, though, is because they, you know...
2036480	2040560	The problem is they just don't want to do that because then they can't sell another
2040560	2044840	Mario Kart game because they can put, you know, new tracks in there.
2044840	2046520	But here's the thing that's even funny about the Wii.
2046520	2052520	I mean, people can, like, they can modify the tracks that are in the game just by using
2052520	2055280	an SD memory card and some software.
2055280	2057880	So if it's that easy, open it up like ModNation Racers.
2057880	2060520	Oh my god, you've got a community of people that are excited about a game.
2060520	2064360	You can even start charging for some download content, different, you know, tools and stuff
2064360	2066000	that you can put in there, like LittleBigPlanet.
2066000	2067440	You can make, you know, money off this.
2067440	2071240	The problem is they need to change their stupid business model in order for it to work.
2071240	2076960	And I'm sorry, but I just don't see them ever embracing online like that.
2076960	2079800	Let me ask you this and then kind of try to close with this thought, because I want to
2079800	2080800	come...
2080800	2082200	Believe it or not, I want to come back to the Wii thing later in the show because I
2082200	2083760	have another question about it.
2083760	2085040	But let me ask this.
2085040	2089640	You say they need to change their business model, but at the same time, numbers say they
2089640	2092600	have the number one console in America, period.
2092600	2096000	I mean, so why do they need to change their business model?
2096000	2097000	They're number one.
2097000	2098620	I mean, I hate it.
2098620	2099620	You hate it.
2099620	2100620	We all hate it.
2100620	2101620	But they are number one.
2101620	2102620	For right now.
2102620	2104520	I mean, that's the problem.
2104520	2105520	That's a cocky attitude, though.
2105520	2109320	If you say, oh, but we're number one, we can do whatever the hell we want.
2109320	2114640	That's great until Apple decides to put out a console and then they have this app store
2114640	2117220	and then you can download all these games for 99 cents.
2117220	2121040	Or let's just say that they're iPad prices and it's like two bucks a game or something
2121040	2122720	like that.
2122720	2127480	I'm sorry, but a lot of people, you know, there are a lot of good games out there that
2127480	2132880	are on these marketplaces, you know, even like the Android marketplace and stuff.
2132880	2137960	Not everybody really wants you to spend the kind of development time that it costs for
2137960	2139320	a $50 game.
2139320	2143720	Like for example, a perfect example, Excite Truck.
2143720	2144720	I love that game.
2144720	2145920	That game is awesome.
2145920	2149840	All they needed to do was release download content for it or a sequel that had basically
2149840	2151880	the same style of gameplay, just more tracks.
2151880	2152880	Not Excite Bots.
2152880	2153880	Not Excite Bots.
2153880	2157060	Excite Bots was, I don't even know what the hell they were doing.
2157060	2160120	But I know Nintendo had a problem, was behind that kind of crap.
2160120	2163360	Hey, you know what would be better if we made some more mini games in there?
2163360	2167960	It does not belong, mini games do not belong in a racing game.
2167960	2169300	It's stupid.
2169300	2173100	It's really, really stupid.
2173100	2178560	But all they had to do was download content, and they could have still made some money
2178560	2181200	on top of that, and you know what?
2181200	2185080	Games like that, even if they have download content, do not devalue their sequels when
2185080	2186080	they come out.
2186080	2187920	So what if there's good download content for that?
2187920	2189100	You know what?
2189100	2191520	People will be more willing to buy the next game because they know that they're going
2191520	2194040	to be supporting download content on top of that.
2194040	2199360	Or hell, you can put out the game for a cheaper cost and then have in-game downloads or something
2199360	2203240	like that, you can add to it and increase value that way.
2203240	2207300	There's just so many ways that they could do it, but they don't want to.
2207300	2208700	Because you know what?
2208700	2210120	People don't download games.
2210120	2211120	That's what they think.
2211120	2212120	People don't download games.
2212120	2216200	Well, I think Apple would disagree with you on that.
2216200	2218220	So let me ask this question.
2218220	2220440	How do you kind of feel about Nintendo right now?
2220440	2225760	Because I do notice you're looking at eBay on your computer looking for 3DSs right now.
2225760	2229680	So there's a part of you that must... there's something Nintendo's doing right for you.
2229680	2230680	Well I want to...
2230680	2233080	I just get every console, okay?
2233080	2236480	That doesn't even necessarily... and I was just looking to see if anybody's actually
2236480	2240000	offering up a Japanese system for a decent price.
2240000	2246560	I'm sorry but even though $350 is a good price for a Japanese console, and it is in California,
2246560	2251200	although his reserve price is probably $500, so screw that.
2251200	2253000	You know me, I like getting stuff early.
2253000	2255960	Anyways, but no, I'm not actually gonna probably buy that.
2255960	2262720	I will buy a 3DS when it comes out, because I think it's a cool technology, but I gotta
2262720	2266040	be honest, the launch lineup is very disappointing.
2266040	2270160	I'm like sitting there going, looking at the tiles coming out, I'm like, well I'll pick
2270160	2276200	up pilot wings because that looks fun, but pfft, it's like... and Nintendo's like, but
2276200	2277600	we have Steel Diver!
2277600	2279720	It's a 2D submarine game!
2279720	2280720	Oh, cool?
2280720	2285520	I mean, you know, that's neat, I guess.
2285520	2294000	Or like, you know, hey, we have Nintendogs, and Nintendogs and cats, or, hey, hey, hey,
2294000	2297520	we've got Ocarina of Time.
2297520	2301120	Like I was reading the news articles, they're like, oh my god, Master Quest is in Ocarina
2301120	2302440	of Time!
2302440	2304240	For the 3DS, that's so amazing!
2304240	2308400	Alright, I promise I won't let Dark Soccer do her story here, but I gotta read this comment
2308400	2310800	from chat, because it is kind of an interesting point.
2310800	2315320	Game Guru says, your Mario Kart example doesn't work, Nintendo only makes one Mario Kart per
2315320	2316320	system.
2316320	2320880	Well, I'm talking about other consoles though.
2320880	2327560	I mean, I'm saying, you know, and this is even bad now, as far as the trend goes, remember
2327560	2333960	before with like Mario Kart for the GameCube I think was the first one I did, it's like,
2333960	2336960	oh look, we've got some of the older tracks in there, oh that's kind of cool, you know,
2336960	2341280	a little bit of retro nostalgia there, and then they started, one of the Game Boy ones
2341280	2346080	I think started that whole trend, you're right, the Game Boy Advance one did, because it was
2346080	2349680	based off the, you know, it looked like the Super Nintendo game, and I was like, oh that's
2349680	2354480	kind of cool because it's nostalgia, and now all of them do, like half the tracks are all
2354480	2356200	old tracks.
2356200	2359520	Come on, man, that is just, that's lazy right there.
2359520	2361360	You have to admit, Rainbow Road's pretty sweet.
2361360	2365100	They have Rainbow, but yeah, I understand it's really sweet, but there's a new Rainbow
2365100	2376280	Road in every game, okay, and it's not necessary to put in one of the, you know, Mario Circuit
2376280	2382280	tracks from the Game Boy Advance and my 3DS version or something like that, they just
2382280	2388340	have such potential, like, you know, a track editor would be so awesome, but they'll never
2388340	2394240	do it, because they're like afraid that people will, I don't know.
2394240	2401720	I mean, come on, look at, here's a perfect example, a game that they did offer some sort
2401720	2407640	of editor for, a level editor, and it was so insignificant, but it just blew up like
2407640	2408640	crazy.
2408640	2413240	Smash Brothers, for the Wii, they had a level editor in there, oh my god, everybody loved
2413240	2417560	it, they had a website, they had websites sharing levels back and forth, IGN had this
2417560	2421780	big ol' thing that you can share custom levels, there was hundreds of levels to download and
2421780	2429000	play and stuff like that, it was such a minuscule thing, but it really got people excited about
2429000	2431800	the game, so what can I create?
2431800	2436760	Come on, people, Mario Kart's a cool game and stuff, and then, you know, even like your
2436760	2442160	Mario games are fun, or Zelda, whatever, but if you throw in some sort of like community
2442160	2446620	aspect to it, people get really excited about it, and I think that's gonna speak a lot louder
2446620	2450800	than oh hey, we put out a Mario Kart game, yeah, I know you're gonna put out a Mario
2450800	2454160	Kart game on 3S, you're also gonna put a Mario Kart game on the next console you put out,
2454160	2460880	I mean, that's dumb, in a Zelda game, I mean, we know that's coming, it's, we'd be dumb
2460880	2468700	to think otherwise, but they just, they have such potential, they just really are squandering
2468700	2469700	it.
2469700	2473920	Alright, let's move on, Dark Soccer's been waiting to talk about her next story.
2473920	2477400	I've given up, I'm looking at Monday through Friday.
2477400	2481800	More, more to come later though, we haven't finished the Nintendo news yet, and I've got
2481800	2485600	another killer question for Loki in a little bit here on the show.
2485600	2491120	GameStop has yet another class action lawsuit.
2491120	2496720	We've gotten a lot of money from GameStop because of employee stuff, and apparently
2496720	2502560	now people should be getting more, anyone who's bought anything ever from GameStop actually,
2502560	2508760	they use their credit card to buy it, should be getting their $5, because apparently they
2508760	2515240	acquire additional personal information, including the card holder's physical residential address,
2515240	2520160	by pairing the personal identification information with the card holder's name obtained from
2520160	2521280	the credit card.
2521280	2525040	So basically, you swipe your card, they get all your info.
2525040	2529800	It's not saying what they're doing with it, but they're supposedly doing it against your
2529800	2530800	knowledge.
2530800	2536280	But here's the thing, everywhere that you use your credit card does that without your
2536280	2537280	knowledge.
2537280	2543120	So this is me, we're gonna have class action lawsuits against the grocery store, and the
2543120	2544680	porn shop, and eBay.
2544680	2546200	I don't think it's necessarily that.
2546200	2552640	I think it's more because you have to put in all your personal info for trades or whatever,
2552640	2557680	that they're basically saying, okay, this is this person, here's this person, and this
2557680	2562400	person paid, here's their name, okay, we're gonna link their card number to this address
2562400	2563400	now.
2563400	2568280	Which is not good, especially if that information just kind of gets leaked out, because I'm
2568280	2573680	sure those GameStop employees are very trustworthy as far as, you know, minimum wage, that has
2573680	2575800	a lot of trust built into it.
2575800	2579160	They kind of should have some people's addresses on file, though, for the people that like
2579160	2580760	to sell back stolen games.
2580760	2585680	That's the point, too, is that I think that it's a good idea, I mean, I don't see any
2585680	2589920	problem with it as long as they're not selling it, and if you're on the opt-out list, then
2589920	2593920	they can't.
2593920	2596840	And I mean, if you get their card, if you want the magazine, you've got to fill out
2596840	2599000	all that stuff anyway, you know.
2599000	2603280	I don't see what the big deal is, but people are all butthurt over their personal information.
2603280	2608160	Well, privacy's a big thing, you know, especially in the past few years with Facebook and all
2608160	2610000	that, it's really come into the spotlight.
2610000	2615000	People are very sensitive, which, you know, I get it, identity theft sucks, and so forth.
2615000	2622600	But this isn't something that, unless someone actually, you know, breaks into a database
2622600	2627860	that all other stuff is uploaded to, and steals the information directly out of the database,
2627860	2631520	I don't think that there's much of a problem.
2631520	2634800	William Murderface in our chatroom says, so GameStop wants to troll me?
2634800	2635800	I don't know how to react.
2635800	2639240	Rama in our chatroom says, I hate when I swipe my card.
2639240	2642680	Some terminals require your zip code, and you can't continue your transaction without
2642680	2643680	it.
2643680	2644680	Isn't that a credit card protection thing?
2644680	2648680	It's like a gas station, I don't know if those are everywhere, but at Chevron, when I do
2648680	2653520	the swipe, it always makes me put on my zip code, because that's how it knows that I'm
2653520	2656360	who I, you know, somebody didn't steal my card.
2656360	2659400	Apparently it's illegal, but I still don't see what the big deal is, because it's not
2659400	2666120	like they can actually go out and sell your information without your permission, or they
2666120	2668040	have to let you know that they're doing it.
2668040	2673760	If this is just something that automatically pops up, you know, especially if they need
2673760	2677560	to do consumer tracking, I don't see what the big problem is.
2677560	2678560	I really don't.
2678560	2684560	Even, I mean, I really, I think that people are just being paranoid, really.
2684560	2688880	So if you want to get your $5, go ahead, that's all you're gonna get, maybe $1.50.
2688880	2692080	That's the other thing with these class action lawsuits, is that, well, you know, even though
2692080	2696280	you might go, eh, GameStop's getting sued, likely they'll settle out of court, because
2696280	2701100	that's the way these things tend to go, and, you know, it'll be like $2 to those that send
2701100	2705800	in a form, that swear on an affidavit that their privacy was breached, or whatever, you
2705800	2706800	know.
2706800	2709320	It'll be interesting to see how that goes.
2709320	2714680	So Marisa Congusto in our chat room says, gas stations are allowed to do this because
2714680	2716480	they do not store it for marketing.
2716480	2718760	We just discussed this in Business Law the other day.
2718760	2724820	I don't think that they keep it for marketing either, really.
2724820	2728040	We bought stuff at GameStop and never gotten, you know, offers and stuff.
2728040	2730720	Yeah, I've never been, like, spammed by them, or what have you.
2730720	2733680	No, you only ever got coupons and stuff when we had a subscription to Game Informer, and
2733680	2734680	it came with our magazine.
2734680	2736080	I am spammed by them.
2736080	2737080	Are you?
2737080	2739000	Did you sign up for their little card, though?
2739000	2740000	Maybe that's why.
2740000	2744800	I signed up for their card, and then I get two emails from them every week, because I
2744800	2748160	told them, like, I'm on your mailing list twice, you need to take me off there.
2748160	2749920	Oh, okay.
2749920	2750920	Never happened.
2750920	2756400	And then I also get, oh hey, you know, you can get this special, you know, this is for
2756400	2759140	GameStop, you know, people only.
2759140	2762080	It's a special survey thing, you go fill out surveys and you need cash.
2762080	2763080	It's like, stop.
2763080	2765760	You're bothering me with that crap.
2765760	2770240	Ramanarachatram says, when I swipe my CC to refill my Metro card, it asks for verification
2770240	2771240	that I get.
2771240	2773840	But not when I'm in Kmart, it asks every single time.
2773840	2776000	That's not credit card protecting their polling for where people live.
2776000	2777280	Yeah, Kohl's does that, too.
2777280	2779800	They always ask your zip code.
2779800	2782080	That is actually illegal to ask that.
2782080	2784540	That's fine, it's for demographic information.
2784540	2785720	That's still legal to ask that.
2785720	2786720	There's actually a court case.
2786720	2788200	I never said it wasn't.
2788200	2789440	Can't you just say no?
2789440	2790880	Yes, you can say no.
2790880	2792200	And then they don't.
2792200	2796320	You can tell them you don't want to give it and that can't stop them from...
2796320	2799640	Most of those people that are working there anyway will just be like, all right, whatever.
2799640	2803800	And they'll just, what they'll do, they'll just put in a different zip code.
2803800	2805440	That's what I bet most of them do.
2805440	2806440	Make up a zip code.
2806440	2807880	You tell them no, they just make up a zip code.
2807880	2808880	Just make up a zip code.
2808880	2809880	One, two, three, four, five.
2809880	2812480	You know that's what's happening.
2812480	2816800	Most of the people on the front lines like that don't care.
2816800	2819560	I sometimes feel bad for them because then they're the ones that take the brunt of all
2819560	2822960	this hatred towards the collecting and so forth.
2822960	2826080	So all right, let's move on.
2826080	2827360	More news.
2827360	2830460	Release dates coming up at the Classic Game of the Week as well.
2830460	2832180	Yeah.
2832180	2833180	So this is interesting.
2833180	2838320	BurgerTime HD, or as I like to call it, BurgerTime Galaxy, because that's certainly what it
2838320	2840160	looks like.
2840160	2843280	It's being developed, I guess, by Monkey Paw Games.
2843280	2846460	It's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
2846460	2852120	Wii and PC, I'm guessing, as part of their digital platforms, PlayStation Network, Xbox
2852120	2853960	Live, WiiWare.
2853960	2863200	And they're introducing new monsters, or I guess carrots, Apple Cores, hot peppers, oversized
2863200	2866160	monsters and other fun stuff.
2866160	2868400	They actually had some video online of it.
2868400	2869400	Looks interesting though.
2869400	2873160	You can actually play it multiplayer, split screen, which is kind of cool.
2873160	2876960	But yeah, it definitely looks like BurgerTime Galaxy.
2876960	2880520	Interesting.
2880520	2883280	I do love me some BurgerTime, the old school 80s machine.
2883280	2884920	Did you see the video of it?
2884920	2886920	I haven't actually watched it yet.
2886920	2887920	Is it on YouTube?
2887920	2888920	Uh, no.
2888920	2889920	Let's check this out.
2889920	2894900	I'm going to pull it up here real quick for you.
2894900	2895900	We need to be more prepared.
2895900	2897400	Let me see if I can find it here on YouTube.
2897400	2898400	There it is!
2898400	2900100	BurgerTime HD Level Complete Gameplay.
2900100	2901400	Let's take a look at this here.
2901400	2909600	Holy moly!
2909600	2913200	It's like running around this 3D looking circle thing.
2913200	2919600	All the levels have been changed into this giant cylinder.
2919600	2924760	It's a very different look for the game, but it's kind of the same damn game.
2924760	2925760	At least at first glance.
2925760	2931760	Oh, well there's this co-op thing going on, it's not the same game in my life.
2931760	2932760	Very interesting.
2932760	2934200	BurgerTime Galaxy.
2934200	2936960	I do see where you get in BurgerTime Galaxy, absolutely.
2936960	2944840	That looks like it could be interesting.
2944840	2948760	Sorry for the ambient noise, it's somebody filming a screen that's probably a game developer's
2948760	2949760	conference or something.
2949760	2950760	I'm sure it is.
2950760	2952760	But, um, interesting.
2952760	2953760	Huh.
2953760	2957240	I'll have to look at the demo for that when that comes out.
2957240	2959760	That was an old school 80s game I really liked.
2959760	2961520	I'm curious how the co-op works.
2961520	2962920	That's something else.
2962920	2963920	You guys want to see it?
2963920	2967960	I just typed BurgerTime HD into YouTube and it came right up.
2967960	2972200	Alright, speaking of guilty pleasure games, this is one of my biggest guilty pleasure
2972200	2975480	games ever and it's been so long since I've played one of these games.
2975480	2976680	Mortal Kombat.
2976680	2981560	That's right, Mortal Kombat 9, or really it's the reboot, just Mortal Kombat, is coming
2981560	2982560	out soon.
2982560	2984600	My god, it's April 19th.
2984600	2986640	I didn't realize it was that soon.
2986640	2987640	That's my birthday.
2987640	2988960	You know what to get me.
2988960	2990040	It's pretty crazy how soon it's coming out.
2990040	2993120	I just kind of forgot that was on its way out, but yeah, it's coming out.
2993120	2996640	It's coming out on April 19th, but if you want to get your hands on it a little bit
2996640	3001960	sooner you'll be able to play a demo next week, March 8th, by the time some of you guys
3001960	3002960	hear this.
3002960	3003960	Here's the catch.
3003960	3006320	You've got to be a PlayStation Plus member because they are the ones that are getting
3006320	3008760	the demo first.
3008760	3013680	You'll be able to play a Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, and Johnny Cage in the living forest
3013680	3015360	or the fire pit.
3015360	3017420	So that's not bad.
3017420	3021240	Most fighting game demos only have two characters, so it's kind of neat that they have four.
3021240	3022320	So there you go.
3022320	3023640	One or two players.
3023640	3025520	I'm imagining not online though.
3025520	3030420	The other cool news is that not just the demo on March 8th for PlayStation Plus, but everybody
3030420	3032540	will get it March 15th.
3032540	3036080	So if you're like, I don't really want to sign up for PlayStation Plus, you can just
3036080	3038840	wait one more week and you'll be able to get it there.
3038840	3042520	Oh, I should say this though, that is only on PlayStation Network.
3042520	3047320	They do not have a firm date for when Xbox Live is getting it, just later.
3047320	3053280	Hmm, could be a lot closer to the game's release in that regard, so very curious about that.
3053280	3056800	By the way, also a small follow-up on Mortal Kombat 9.
3056800	3062180	I don't know if you guys heard, but it was banned in Australia because they refused to
3062180	3063180	rate the game.
3063180	3067200	When they refused to rate a game, that basically means that the game is banned.
3067200	3072440	Well, the publishers behind Mortal Kombat, they are appealing this decision.
3072440	3077040	We'll see just how far they get with it, so.
3077040	3079120	We'll see before the game's release.
3079120	3082520	Either way, it's probably going to end up getting delayed in Australia.
3082520	3085440	Probably a lot of people are just going to import the damn thing from somewhere else.
3085440	3086680	I'll probably be out there.
3086680	3090000	Even though that's supposed to be illegal as well, I don't see them exactly banging
3090000	3093280	down doors because people got bootleg copies of Mortal Kombat.
3093280	3094280	So we'll see what happens.
3094280	3098120	And then in fact if you bootleg, I'm sure that you can, you know, just import it.
3098120	3099360	Most of those games are region-free.
3099360	3104920	I don't mean like actual bootlegs, I mean like, you know, yeah, PlayStation 3 is region-free.
3104920	3108200	So there'll probably be lots of people just hitting up Amazon or something, getting a
3108200	3110880	friend in the US to buy it and then ship it to them.
3110880	3113620	There you go.
3113620	3117720	So also on Mortal Kombat, one other thing, I remember reading a story about this this
3117720	3121480	week, I wanted to throw this out there, is that there's this whole challenge mode in
3121480	3122480	it too.
3122480	3124880	And I remember watching a video for it on YouTube and they were all talking, all excited
3124880	3125880	about this.
3125880	3129880	Where I guess like 300 levels and they say you get something super special if you get
3129880	3130880	all the way to the end.
3130880	3133600	I'm assuming you unlock a bonus character or something, that's just my assumption.
3133600	3137460	But it's like all these cool modifiers, like there's some modifiers like Headless Combat
3137460	3143240	where you fight with no head, kind of reminds me of some old tacky fighting games.
3143240	3147760	Upside down mode, where the image is flipped upside down and that's how you have to play.
3147760	3150240	I just thought it was kind of funny.
3150240	3153880	So 300 levels though, that might be overkill, I don't know about that.
3153880	3158240	That's going to take a serious investment to get through, but we'll see.
3158240	3161280	Moving on, Dark Soccer's got a story for us, then we're going to get to release dates.
3161280	3164400	I do, of course I do.
3164400	3172400	Game, which is a UK retailer, well they're going to be doing pre-orders for used games.
3172400	3177680	Yeah, they're going to be taking orders for games that people haven't bought yet.
3177680	3179640	But for when they're used.
3179640	3180640	Does that make sense?
3180640	3185600	Because I think I might have drunk a little too much chamois and it's baffling me.
3185600	3187240	It actually kind of does.
3187240	3192300	There's a lot of people that wait to buy it used to just save the $5 because it's cheaper,
3192300	3193520	you know.
3193520	3195120	I could see this.
3195120	3199520	There's some people that sell back their games fast too.
3199520	3203360	Like you know I picked up Tron Evolution like maybe a week after it was out, now I realize
3203360	3207360	why someone sold it back so quick, but you know, some games you can get pretty quick
3207360	3208360	that way.
3208360	3209360	Well once they already have on...
3209360	3210360	Game Crazy fucking did that for free.
3210360	3213840	Wait, wait, wait, oh Dan, you got to say that on the air, hold on Dan.
3213840	3215700	What's that Dan?
3215700	3217600	Game Crazy fucking did that for free.
3217600	3218600	How so?
3218600	3219600	Like you just could put your name on a list?
3219600	3223600	Like you could come in and say, hey, can you give me a call when this game comes in used?
3223600	3225120	And they did it.
3225120	3226120	But they went out of business.
3226120	3228480	And why did they go out of business?
3228480	3232680	Because Hollywood Entertainment sucked.
3232680	3233680	Sorry to hear it.
3233680	3238600	At any rate, some of the games on the list already are Crisis 2, Homefront Dragon Age
3238600	3245160	2, Shift 2 Unleashed, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12.
3245160	3249160	So yeah, you can pay 5 pounds and save a game that's not out yet.
3249160	3254400	Which we'll just go to show you, game stores will take your $5 for anything.
3254400	3257960	Someone probably had that copy, or when it comes out, they probably got that copy, so
3257960	3259440	this game sucks.
3259440	3263960	And you know, spanked over it or something, and then took it back, and then you get the
3263960	3268040	spank version.
3268040	3270400	You get it christened with the love of another man.
3270400	3274560	Be careful though, this could be one of those games that you can't sell back.
3274560	3277400	Like DC Universe Online, one unique key.
3277400	3279920	So be careful what you pre-order used.
3279920	3283420	I think they've got a specific list for it.
3283420	3286640	Game Guru in our chat room says, oh great, GameStop is going to push pre-orders of used
3286640	3287640	games now?
3287640	3290960	No, no, no, this is game in the UK.
3290960	3297560	However, you know if it does well for them, it'll just get copied by everybody else.
3297560	3299040	That's how these things go.
3299040	3302960	Look at charging for bags on airlines.
3302960	3306980	A couple of them did it first, and everybody does it, except those that want to use it
3306980	3310640	as a marketing point that they don't charge for it, like the Jet Blues and Southwest of
3310640	3311640	the world.
3311640	3315680	Alright, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and games that
3315680	3317720	are coming out real soon.
3317720	3322640	Yes, actually today Pokemon Black and White came out, so that's pretty exciting if you're
3322640	3324280	a fan of the Pokemans.
3324280	3328600	Which there are some real rabid fans of Pokemon out there that are over the age of 30.
3328600	3331300	As on the Nintendo DS.
3331300	3334760	This week actually we have a new Kinect game, U-Star 2 in the movies.
3334760	3341120	Remember U-Star was that camera green screen system that they were selling on TV that only
3341120	3343040	worked with PC at one point.
3343040	3346840	Wasn't there already a crappy game like that on 360 that had the vision camera, like you
3346840	3348240	in the movies or something?
3348240	3350760	Yeah, yeah, that was a little different though.
3350760	3355320	That was more of like you're doing mini games and then it puts you into the game, or the
3355320	3357360	movie, it makes a little short film.
3357360	3361360	This is actually, it's like karaoke for movie lines.
3361360	3366880	Basically you recite movie lines and you can play different people in there and it will
3366880	3372960	actually kind of crop the actor or actress out of the scene and it'll put you in their
3372960	3379320	place and so you can get scored for accuracy and stuff like that.
3379320	3383720	It's neat I guess and there's certainly not a lot of Kinect games coming out.
3383720	3388120	That's on Playstation 3 for the Kinect, or I'm sorry, the Playstation 3 with move support.
3388120	3392600	You do need the Playstation Eye camera though if you want to play that and then of course
3392600	3396600	on Xbox 360 for the Kinect.
3396600	3399400	Let's see, some other stuff this week.
3399400	3404560	Dragon Age 2 coming out this week, that's on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360, that's
3404560	3406400	a pretty big game.
3406400	3412920	On the Wii, the One Million Dollar Pyramid, yet another TV show game.
3412920	3419560	A couple MLB games this week, MLB 2011 The Show, that's on Playstation 2, PS3, and the
3419560	3421480	Playstation Portable.
3421480	3432320	Also MLB 2K11 on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP I believe.
3432320	3440120	Pets Bunnies Bunch on Nintendo DS, I guess gearing up for Easter.
3440120	3442480	What the hell is this?
3442480	3448200	Beastly Frantic Photo?
3448200	3453720	I think this is some sort of stupid application that ties into that crappy movie Beastly.
3453720	3457320	I was going to say, there was a movie with Vanessa Hudgens that came out called Beastly.
3457320	3459120	Yeah, I think that's what this is.
3459120	3462160	I have not heard of that, but that's kind of funny.
3462160	3467600	Yep, I think it's some sort of photo game, and it looks like crap.
3467600	3470320	So it's Vanessa Hudgens Snap?
3470320	3474280	It might be, I'm actually, oh they have a trailer for the movie, I don't really care
3474280	3476280	about that.
3476280	3478800	Alright, moving on.
3478800	3481000	Is Beastly like a knockoff of Twilight?
3481000	3485600	No, it's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.
3485600	3488240	Oh, okay.
3488240	3491240	We're talking like a Beauty and the Beast that's going to be more like the old school
3491240	3493240	TV show of Linda Hamilton, right?
3493240	3494240	No.
3494240	3495240	That show is the shit.
3495240	3499360	A modern day retelling of the fairy tale, but not with the underground community.
3499360	3504880	The guy is suddenly turned ugly by some witch girl, and he has to stay in his expensive
3504880	3506020	penthouse.
3506020	3507400	So no, be our guest.
3507400	3508400	Be our guest.
3508400	3512920	No, it's less song and dance, more emo.
3512920	3513920	He turns emo.
3513920	3514920	I see.
3514920	3515920	So it is a little bit Twilight-inspired.
3515920	3516920	Ah, yeah.
3516920	3517920	Aren't they all?
3517920	3520920	Do they sparkle?
3520920	3521920	Yeah.
3521920	3524840	Just like how, you know, Little Red Riding Hood, I don't remember werewolves being in
3524840	3525840	Little Red Riding Hood.
3525840	3529460	I could be, it's been a while since I heard Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't remember
3529460	3532760	werewolves being in there, and I don't think emo people were in there as well.
3532760	3534240	Now they're making emo Snow White, too.
3534240	3541040	Come on, the original Little Red Riding Hood, she gets eaten by the wolf, and gets digested
3541040	3542680	and dies.
3542680	3544200	Awesome.
3544200	3547080	As should those types of movies.
3547080	3550680	Atari's Greatest Hits Volume 2 on the Nintendo DS coming out this week.
3550680	3555880	Phantom Brave, Heroes of the Her-Muda Triangle for the PSP, another Atlus game.
3555880	3557160	Not the Ber-Muda!
3557160	3558160	The Her-Muda.
3558160	3559160	Her-Muda.
3559160	3560160	Like, hermaphrodite.
3560160	3568080	Um, let's see here, also, um, what else we got here?
3568080	3574680	Sims 3 Barnacle Bay on PC, in case you want to get your pirate on, um, for the Sims 3
3574680	3575680	there.
3575680	3576680	Yeah.
3576680	3581720	And then some crappy Wii games, Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing, and Maximum Racing Dragon
3581720	3584000	Sword, and just don't even bother, seriously.
3584000	3589800	And then, because, and I gotta go in the rant mode about this, but, I'm sorry, but like,
3589800	3590800	here we go.
3590800	3596800	Just because Nintendo is so gracious for everybody, for a limited time, and this is the last time
3596800	3601000	that they're reprinting this, game from the Super Nintendo, Super Mario All-Stars will
3601000	3605160	be coming out one week from today, the limited edition, oh my god limited, going on eBay
3605160	3609440	for $80 because, oh my god, I've never played a game that was on the Super Nintendo on the
3609440	3616000	Wii, um, that is coming out once again on the Wii, get it now, before it goes away forever.
3616000	3619400	Um, seriously, if you buy this you're stupid.
3619400	3622440	I'm sorry, you are stupid.
3622440	3627720	That's right, stupid.
3627720	3632080	Just spend the money on the virtual console, better yet, just buy the freakin' Super Nintendo
3632080	3633080	on the original game.
3633080	3639240	I mean, you don't need this limited soundtrack and a little art book, I mean, come on.
3639240	3642440	I just think your rants are funnier with Mario Bros. music in the background.
3642440	3643440	That's, that's fine.
3643440	3649360	But yeah, so, um, that's what we have coming out this week, but seriously though!
3649360	3655120	They, they are taking you guys for fools, I mean, $30 for a Super Nintendo game.
3655120	3656120	What's next, okay?
3656120	3659880	We're gonna have, like, Game Boy Advance, you know, Mario Land or something, they're
3659880	3663840	gonna put no new color in it, they're not gonna do shit to it, in fact they're not even
3663840	3670240	gonna change, you know, um, aren't all those gonna be coming on the 3DS virtual, the virtual
3670240	3671240	console, actually?
3671240	3675600	Yeah, they're not doing shit to them, nothing, nothing at all, and they're gonna charge tons
3675600	3676600	of money for that.
3676600	3679920	You know what you can buy a Game Boy for nowadays?
3679920	3683680	Probably 30 bucks, including that stupid, uh, probably even less than that, you probably
3683680	3685860	can find them dirt cheap, at a garage sale.
3685860	3688120	People don't even know what they are, they're trying to get rid of them.
3688120	3693520	I mean, just don't, don't, don't feed the beast.
3693520	3694520	Don't.
3694520	3699020	It's a very beastly week in US releases, apparently.
3699020	3700680	You're just encouraging them.
3700680	3704040	All your, the message that you're sending loud and clear to Nintendo is, we like your
3704040	3708000	old shit, please bring it back and charge us a lot of money for it, that's all that
3708000	3709000	they're doing.
3709000	3714000	And you know what, people are dumb, because they're like, ooh, Mario must buy, Mario must
3714000	3715000	buy!
3715000	3725640	I mean, they can put out, like, Mario teaches, like, brain surgery or something like that.
3725640	3730920	Mario's a wonderful douche, you know, and people would buy it, because it's got Mario
3730920	3735080	in it.
3735080	3738320	Are you done?
3738320	3741600	I guess.
3741600	3742680	Are you done with releases?
3742680	3743680	Oh, I'm done.
3743680	3744680	I'm done with Nintendo.
3744680	3745680	Oh, okay, alright.
3745680	3751440	Let's, let's move on to the Japanese release dates, and we'll start off with Xbox 360 releases.
3751440	3754360	Um, I thought this was a game at first, but I did more research on it.
3754360	3758640	This is interesting, it's a title called Cross Channel in Memory of All People comes out
3758640	3759640	this week on the Xbox 360.
3759640	3765280	This has actually come out before, and it's a visual novel, so it's not really a game,
3765280	3770800	it's this game novel thing that's been ported, it's been on the PS2, Windows, PSP, all this
3770800	3771880	stuff before.
3771880	3775660	It is coming out on the Xbox 360 as well now, with some extra stuff.
3775660	3780040	So it's, I guess, I don't even know if it's like an interactive anime or anything, but
3780040	3781040	who knows.
3781040	3783400	So yeah, that is coming out this week.
3783400	3785880	Probably nothing that'll ever see the light of day over here, I gotta be honest.
3785880	3790500	But I have heard something about an English translation patch on some of the other versions,
3790500	3793080	for those that are into it.
3793080	3798200	On the PlayStation 3 coming out this week, there's an all-new console coming out in Japan
3798200	3799200	this week.
3799200	3804260	I think it is a satin silver model, I'm not sure what is coming out to kind of drive the
3804260	3805260	sales of that.
3805260	3809680	I know that Heavy Rain is getting a price reduction over there, and there is Shin Sangoku
3809680	3812880	Musou 6 comes out this week as well.
3812880	3817560	That's from Koei, is this Dynasty Warriors 6, is that what this is?
3817560	3820320	That would, I believe, be Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
3820320	3823920	Ah, it is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you're right, Romance of the Three Kingdoms.
3823920	3826000	Maybe that's what necessitates the new console.
3826000	3827000	I don't know.
3827000	3831640	Remember, if you hear Sangoku, then it's Three Kingdoms.
3831640	3834720	You think after nine years of this show, I would understand at least a couple words in
3834720	3836120	Japanese by now, but no.
3836120	3840600	Actually, I don't, ichimi sanshi, I can count to four.
3840600	3841600	Awesome.
3841600	3845080	Ah, nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, does that really surprise anybody?
3845080	3848680	But on the Nintendo 3DS this week, because that's already out there, on the 10th, Ash
3848680	3852200	Vault 3D Nitro Racing comes out this week from Konami.
3852200	3856280	That is on the release date for the 3DS this week.
3856280	3861040	And lastly, on the PSP this week, there's a few games, Deer Drops Distortion comes out
3861040	3869240	this week, Fairy Tail Portable Guild 2, and Rurouni Kenshin Meiji Kenkaku Ramatan Saisen
3869240	3870720	comes out from Namco Bandai this week.
3870720	3873320	What the crap are they doing another Kenshin game for?
3873320	3874880	Because the public demands it?
3874880	3875880	I don't know.
3875880	3879480	But there you go, that does it for your Japanese releases.
3879480	3882440	Well, for the UK, we have a few things.
3882440	3890120	On the 9th is Torchlight, and then on the 11th we have Brunswick Pro Bowling, oooh,
3890120	3897000	Dragon Age 2, Home Front, and U-Star 2, and that's it.
3897000	3898720	Alright.
3898720	3903360	Let's move on with some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.
3903360	3906320	Oh boy, can't wait for this next story.
3906320	3907640	Loki, take it away.
3907640	3913680	Now actually, just to go back real quick about my complaining about All-Stars, I mean seriously,
3913680	3917840	this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so let's just step backwards with this game.
3917840	3923440	Look at Smash Bros., once again, Smash Bros. Brawl, perfect example, that's how you treat
3923440	3926080	a franchise as far as nostalgia purposes.
3926080	3930920	They had demos for virtual console games on there for some of the old stuff.
3930920	3937960	They had at the very least done that, you know, hey, guess what, you beat Mario, Super
3937960	3944360	Mario Bros., and the remade version, you unlock the NES version or something like that.
3944360	3947560	I don't understand, well I understand why they do it now, because they want people to
3947560	3954680	buy it on the virtual console, but man, they were so much more giving on the GameCube than
3954680	3956480	they were on the Wii.
3956480	3961000	I mean, remember all those, like, oh hey, you can unlock the Game Boy version of, or
3961000	3964720	you can unlock the Super Nintendo version of Metroid?
3964720	3968320	Or freaking Animal Crossing, which was so badass, like that was the whole reason all
3968320	3972160	of us bought it, was because you could unlock all the old NES games in it, and then it was
3972160	3975720	like, hey, and the game itself is actually pretty sweet.
3975720	3979000	Animal Crossing is seriously one of the best games that's come out in the past ten years.
3979000	3980400	Honestly, it really is.
3980400	3982120	And we're talking the original.
3982120	3984120	Not any of the original.
3984120	3985120	Not any of the re-releases.
3985120	3988840	But the original is one of my favorite games to have come out in the past ten years, easily.
3988840	3993720	Another perfect example, I might add, of a game that Nintendo has done absolutely nothing
3993720	3999320	with, nothing, absolutely nothing with, from game to game.
3999320	4001920	How much really have they changed from each sequel?
4001920	4002920	Nothing.
4002920	4006440	It's basically the same damn game presented in a slightly different way.
4006440	4007720	And I mean very slight.
4007720	4010360	And most of the times, it's not a good way.
4010360	4015200	I mean, come on, we're seriously, we're just encouraging this crap.
4015200	4018040	So you got some Nintendo news to report for us, Loki?
4018040	4019600	Yes, yes.
4019600	4020600	Goodie.
4020600	4026640	Anyways, so, we've got some interesting stuff, of course.
4026640	4030840	This is all from Game Developers Conference, we're talking a little bit about the 3DS,
4030840	4036740	and some neat stuff, I guess, but I mean, once again, you can't read too much into this
4036740	4043920	because, I don't know, for example, the first part we have here, apparently the 3DS will
4043920	4048880	have access to 10,000 AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots by late May.
4048880	4050680	Why not at launch?
4050680	4051680	I don't know.
4051680	4052680	But whatever.
4052680	4053680	Late May.
4053680	4058520	So, that's neat that they're embracing- Is that like all the airports?
4058520	4059520	I guess.
4059520	4061760	It's gotta be like some restaurants have them.
4061760	4065200	I don't know, where do you find AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots, I guess just miscellaneous restaurants
4065200	4066200	and so forth.
4066200	4069640	So, I know that when they're selling you on their internet and stuff there, but you get
4069640	4071880	access to all these for free as well.
4071880	4072880	Big whoop.
4072880	4074440	Is that how they're gonna deliver the patches without asking?
4074440	4080120	If you take your 3DS out in public, it finds an AT&T Wi-Fi hotspot, all of a sudden, whoop,
4080120	4081120	patch.
4081120	4082120	They don't, no.
4082120	4087640	They do, you have to agree to apply the patches, because I actually saw they had a patch for
4087640	4095280	the 3DS in Japan, and there's a notification you get, hey, there's a patch, download it.
4095280	4098840	So that's neat and all that, they're gonna have access to these Wi-Fi hotspots, but once
4098840	4107160	again, unless they're doing a lot with it, I just don't see the point.
4107160	4111460	It sounds good, but really, what's intended doing with their online stuff?
4111460	4113960	It's kind of yet to be seen.
4113960	4120200	It's their way of saying, we don't have 3GS, but you'll be able to get online in public
4120200	4121560	at all these places.
4121560	4123360	That's what it says to me.
4123360	4129040	And then, of course, the 3DS Virtual Consoles basically getting all the portable platforms
4129040	4136000	on top of, I believe, Game Boy and Game Boy Color, they're getting Game Gear, and Turbo
4136000	4143040	Graphics 16 games, because it's funny, because, well, Turbo Graphics 16 played the actual
4143040	4146680	console games on the handheld, so you're gonna be getting those games.
4146680	4148240	Oh yeah, Jamie loves those games.
4148240	4149240	Yeah, I've got one of those.
4149240	4150240	Yeah.
4150240	4151240	Turbo Express.
4151240	4152240	Yeah.
4152240	4156800	The whole NGP joke with the Neo Geo Pocket comes full, or no, I'm, nah, never mind, because
4156800	4157800	Turbo Graphics.
4157800	4159800	Not a Neo Geo.
4159800	4160800	Fail.
4160800	4161800	But...
4161800	4163920	But maybe in the future.
4163920	4164920	Who knows?
4164920	4168120	And I understand, it's coming late May.
4168120	4169680	Why stop there?
4169680	4170680	Why stop there?
4170680	4174800	You have a Virtual Console, you have Virtual Console stuff already out there for, like,
4174800	4176240	Nintendo, Super Nintendo stuff.
4176240	4182080	Don't tell me this system can't play Nintendo games, or Genesis games, or Sega Master System,
4182080	4183600	Sega Master System games.
4183600	4188920	Once again, this could be an open marketplace, like the iOS platforms, or Steam, or something
4188920	4193320	like that, where you can have a bunch of games on there, ripe for the picking, so people
4193320	4198160	can go, oh my god, you know, I love playing the original Mario Brothers, or I love playing
4198160	4207320	Mario Kart 64, or something like that, on my Wii, I wanna take it with me, oh damn,
4207320	4208320	I have to buy it again.
4208320	4212680	That's okay, because I love Nintendo, and I'll buy whatever they put out.
4212680	4213680	Such a missed opportunity.
4213680	4216960	They only have these portable games coming out for it.
4216960	4218960	I mean, come on.
4218960	4225360	It's so frustrating, that they could easily do this, but, nope, nope, sorry, we're not
4225360	4228900	gonna do that right now, whoa, but we may announce it later on, and people will be so
4228900	4236000	grateful that we've, you know, allowed them to repurchase our game again, ha ha ha.
4236000	4241280	So yeah, that'll be coming out later on.
4241280	4247300	I don't know, it's just, it's so frustrating, because they're just dumb.
4247300	4252500	And yeah, late May, so if you buy your system, you know, when it comes out at launch, just
4252500	4258120	know that you're not gonna actually have access to their little service to purchase virtual
4258120	4260400	console games.
4260400	4262200	Nice.
4262200	4265300	And then also they're saying via the system update, you're gonna get some other online
4265300	4270080	features that they were touting, the DSiWare service, of course, the ability to transfer
4270080	4276080	DSiWare games from the DSi or DSi XL to your system, the web browser, and of course the
4276080	4282200	eShop, which will include the whole virtual console stuff.
4282200	4284940	So let me get this straight.
4284940	4290480	Your console's not done, because that's what it sounds like to me, that you don't have
4290480	4296120	one of the advertised features, web browser and all that stuff, at launch.
4296120	4297840	So your console's not done.
4297840	4298840	It's not ready.
4298840	4301200	You're releasing it too early, is what it sounds like.
4301200	4305000	And that might explain why you don't have enough games out for it, because you wanna
4305000	4308680	push this thing out to pad your fiscal year numbers.
4308680	4309680	Is that it?
4309680	4315880	Because it's coming out the very end of the month, or the very end of their fiscal year?
4315880	4317140	Interesting.
4317140	4321840	And then of course, they're also so gracious to allow us to record video with the 3D camera,
4321840	4328740	which I gotta admit is kinda cool, and it's definitely something that is popular.
4328740	4329960	That is pretty cool.
4329960	4333240	But once again, can I share these videos with my friends?
4333240	4335280	Can I email you a 3D video they shot?
4335280	4337040	Can I do anything with that?
4337040	4344360	Once again, I don't know, because they haven't said, and great, I shot a 3D video of me doing
4344360	4345960	something.
4345960	4348680	If I can't share that with anybody, it doesn't matter.
4348680	4354800	And I guess, I don't know if I could anyways, because with all their online stuff being
4354800	4358320	disabled until May, I don't know.
4358320	4361920	I'm curious about your thoughts on this comment in our chatroom at chat.orangishunterday.com.
4361920	4367440	Akuma JP says, I think it's just Nintendo can't do so many stuff in that short time.
4367440	4371040	Maybe they really have kind of rushed this thing out, and maybe they are kind of putting
4371040	4377160	something out that they are still trying to develop as it goes.
4377160	4378640	I definitely think it's that.
4378640	4384280	And I think that they did the exact same thing with, well they did the exact same thing with
4384280	4387720	the Wii, because they had a member of the web browser, I believe didn't come out right
4387720	4388720	away.
4388720	4396400	It got released later on, it wasn't too later on, I mean we are only talking like a month
4396400	4405600	or two for this online shop thing, but it's just, if they had it ready to go at launch,
4405600	4412520	they could be making so much, it's time wasted and money lost, because they could be selling
4412520	4413520	a bunch of stuff.
4413520	4417640	And the fact that they are just like, yeah you know, we are just not going to put virtual
4417640	4422400	console games on there because, I don't know.
4422400	4425780	I don't know why they are not putting virtual, like actual virtual console stuff that's on
4425780	4428960	there for the Wii.
4428960	4432680	Why don't they put Nintendo games or Super Nintendo games, they have all this stuff already
4432680	4436040	done, it's already ready to go, and maybe they have to convert it over to something
4436040	4440080	special or redo it for the 3DS maybe.
4440080	4447120	But I mean come on, we are talking like emulators here, it can't be that difficult to port this
4447120	4448120	stuff over.
4448120	4451080	I mean come on, if the homebrew community can do it on the Game Boy Advance and the
4451080	4458720	Nintendo DS, and this thing does support Nintendo DS games, it should be able to do this.
4458720	4465120	It should have no problem doing this whatsoever, unless they are going to do something cool,
4465120	4471640	because they said that, oh hey we are going to release, I don't know, some new games or
4471640	4474800	games with 3D support or something like that.
4474800	4477940	That may be the gimmick that they are going to do, hey look it's Super Mario Brothers
4477940	4479720	in 3D or something.
4479720	4482380	Why aren't they releasing Virtual Boy games for this?
4482380	4488920	It makes perfect sense that they would have Virtual Boy games on the 3DS.
4488920	4493800	They may have all sucked, but still though, there's a lot of games that they released
4493800	4497800	on the Virtual Console that did suck, but still a lot of people haven't gotten a chance
4497800	4502920	to play them because that console is out for such a short amount of time.
4502920	4513400	And then lastly, apparently almost all DSiWare games will be available at the 3DS eShop launch,
4513400	4518040	and then of course they have some limits as far as the transfers and stuff.
4518040	4523880	It says, of course we've got Virtual Console games, anything that is rendered in 3D, converted
4523880	4531400	into 3D is called a 3D Classic, so they are going to have some converted games I guess.
4531400	4538160	And it said that, I guess downloadable games will be under the eShop banner.
4538160	4544160	They're saying that pretty much the whole DSiWare lineup will be available at launch,
4544160	4548600	there may be a few exceptions, but the majority of all the games will come over, a few games
4548600	4555320	are being left off the 3DS's eShop for undisclosed reasons.
4555320	4562520	So they're saying it's not the number of transferred games, it would be the same, they're saying
4562520	4571720	that the transfer feature will be coming in late May, and it would be the same game, the
4571720	4576280	number of times you can transfer it from device to device, so if you build up a large category
4576280	4582200	of DSiWare games, you won't be penalized just how many times you can move it, move that
4582200	4585760	same group of games, there will be a limit on it.
4585760	4589360	So I guess they're not saying the amount of games, there's not going to be a limit on
4589360	4593080	the amount of games you can move over, but how many times you can move it, so that's
4593080	4598080	it.
4598080	4605720	And if they were nice, which they're not, they would also allow you to do that same
4605720	4611080	kind of transfer thing with the Wii and the Virtual Console stuff that you downloaded,
4611080	4612240	whether or not.
4612240	4618480	To be fair, I mean, Microsoft allows you to transfer it once a year, and I don't even
4618480	4623100	know Sony's thing, Sony's pretty locked down, aren't they?
4623100	4626320	You can transfer, actually you can transfer it quite a few times, because they have people
4626320	4627320	sharing stuff.
4627320	4629240	Oh yeah, that's right.
4629240	4632240	And that's per game.
4632240	4640000	I don't know, it's, whatever, you know, it is what it is.
4640000	4643520	There's going to be a lot of disappointing stuff, I think, as far as how they support
4643520	4644520	their online stuff.
4644520	4650320	And you know what, it's unfortunately just, they could be making a lot more money than
4650320	4651320	they are.
4651320	4654840	If that's really what they're concerned about, and making people happy and stuff, they could
4654840	4655920	do it really easy.
4655920	4657400	They're just not.
4657400	4663840	Alright, well, let's move on from all the 3DS talk.
4663840	4668080	Although I am still excited about the 3D video, but I think you make a point, they gotta let
4668080	4669080	you share it.
4669080	4672280	But here's something that a lot of people are also very excited about.
4672280	4675720	That feature alone makes the device worth a lot more than I think it is.
4675720	4678680	And maybe that's why they're trying to rush it out, too, is because they want to get ahead
4678680	4681360	of a lot of those cameras that are out there on the marketplace that are very expensive
4681360	4682360	right now.
4682360	4684840	You know, they're trying to maybe get the jump on that, I don't know.
4684840	4685840	Cheap alternative, who knows.
4685840	4690280	Anyhow, I want to mention this, because a lot of folks are excited about this.
4690280	4696400	The game Catherine, which is coming out overseas, it is also coming out in the US, summer of
4696400	4697400	2011.
4697400	4701000	It is coming out this summer, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4701000	4702280	There's a preview site already up.
4702280	4704580	You can pre-order the game on Amazon.com.
4704580	4706160	What makes this game so special?
4706160	4709180	Well, it's a little bit dirty.
4709180	4711980	It's more of one of those erotic thrillers.
4711980	4715980	So a lot of folks were very excited about this in Japan, because, you know, it's a little
4715980	4719280	bit naughty, and folks were planning on importing it.
4719280	4722720	And now that it's coming out over here, a lot of people are like, what, this game's
4722720	4723720	coming out over here?
4723720	4729960	I don't think we know all the details exactly on what's sanitized yet, but give it time.
4729960	4733920	I'm sure that's details they want to keep under wraps until a little close to the release
4733920	4734920	date.
4734920	4737520	But some folks are still very excited about the release of that game.
4737520	4741200	All right, since that game is coming out in a couple months, let's talk about something
4741200	4743480	that's coming out a long time ago.
4743480	4746120	It's the classic game of the week.
4746120	4751400	We like to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a classic video game that's been
4751400	4756120	out for years and years, and it's something that maybe you should be checking out.
4756120	4758680	Dark Soccer's going to step into the vault and find a game.
4758680	4760760	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4760760	4766520	Classic game of the week is Willow, and before people say, you've done Willow before!
4766520	4767800	This is a different Willow.
4767800	4771400	It is the side-scrolling arcade version of Willow.
4771400	4772400	Yay!
4772400	4777920	So not the NES arcade game, er, not the NES RPG game, many people remember, that you have
4777920	4778920	done before.
4778920	4779920	This is the arcade version.
4779920	4785320	It was released by Capcom in the arcade, and it's freaking hard.
4785320	4793640	So basically, this one's a platformer, and it has six stages where Willow gets to go
4793640	4799440	kick some butt, and sometimes you can play Mad Mardigan, and you basically, it's its
4799440	4804600	typical platformer, left or right to move, press the A button to use a weapon, you can
4804600	4810280	hold it down and fire charged shots, you've got a magic power gauge, you have a B button
4810280	4816880	to jump, and you can go up ledges and do all kinds of stuff, you can climb down them, and
4816880	4824560	you can open chests, and you can get gold and buy items from the Owl Mage, and buy all
4824560	4829040	kinds of stuff, including a life pack, and a 1-up, and information.
4829040	4833240	But it's pretty hard.
4833240	4845800	I love the music in it, though, can you play a little bit of that, Rob?
4845800	4848760	Isn't that good?
4848760	4856760	It's a really pretty game, too, and the only version that was out was the arcade one.
4856760	4862160	It was a CPS1 game, um, pretty much you could fight a giant rat.
4862160	4864440	That was pretty fun.
4864440	4875200	Um, it is, uh, you know, unlike the NES version, which was an adventure RPG, and, uh...
4875200	4877560	Which is weird, because Capcom did them both.
4877560	4878560	Yeah.
4878560	4883160	Well, I think that Capcom was notorious for bringing out different versions of games that
4883160	4888280	were one thing in the arcade, but did them different for the NES.
4888280	4893000	You know what this game looks a lot like is Magic Sword, actually, so I'm really surprised
4893000	4895920	I've never played this before.
4895920	4899560	Because there's a lot, like, just watching this, there's a lot in common with Magic Sword.
4899560	4901560	This is very interesting to me.
4901560	4906760	Well, it's just that whole side-scrolling thing, but, I mean, pretty much, I mean, it's
4906760	4907760	really gorgeous.
4907760	4915600	You've got all the story elements, you even have, like, the monsters from the, uh, uh...
4915600	4921400	From the, uh, movie, and pretty cool cinematic, you know, area series, but it's just gorgeous
4921400	4923080	artwork in it.
4923080	4928360	And basically, like, in the first- Ah, scary-looking Val Kilmer, sorry.
4928360	4929360	Yeah.
4929360	4930360	Ah!
4930360	4939560	Well, and his, uh, weapon is kinda like, uh, the cipher from Strider, but, uh, it can be
4939560	4945440	charged up and increases range and potency, and basically, uh, you can also, uh, you can
4945440	4950800	also get, uh, buy swords when you, you know, stop in the shop.
4950800	4956720	And, uh, it's just really cool, although he's got, like, very pretty boy-looking features
4956720	4959600	when he plays with him.
4959600	4960600	Mad Marduken, that is.
4960600	4961600	Very, very brown here.
4961600	4962600	And Lilloo just looks adorable.
4962600	4970120	But yeah, it's, it's a, it's a fun game, pretty tough, but lots of fun.
4970120	4971120	Alright.
4971120	4972800	There it is.
4972800	4977400	The classic video game of the week for the arcades, not the NES.
4977400	4978400	Willow.
4978400	4984640	A very Magic Sword-esque kinda game, but with a bitchin' movie franchise behind it.
4984640	4988320	Although I gotta admit, I always like the, uh, video game way better than I like the
4988320	4989320	movie.
4989320	4990320	That's just me.
4990320	4992280	Alright, anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.
4992280	4994400	There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.
4994400	4998240	When we come back for part B, we're gonna be talking about dev kits for the Kinect.
4998240	5000920	Yes, it could be really happening.
5000920	5006280	Super Tag's being freed up, and a classic, classic PC game making its way to the iOS
5006280	5007280	system.
5007280	5011360	So we're gonna talk all about that when we come back from a break here with more of Orange
5011360	5018040	Lounge Radio.
5018040	5020760	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5020760	5028440	We are live on this Sunday, March the 6th of 2011 for the 404th episode of our podcast.
5028440	5029440	We 404'd.
5029440	5030440	That's right.
5030440	5035040	We didn't make enough 404 jokes in the opening, but yes, it is episode 404 of our show.
5035040	5038400	But we are here, and we're not missing anyone this week like we were last week.
5038400	5041640	Maybe last week would have been a better 404, at least as far as Loki's concerned.
5041640	5042640	But he's back.
5042640	5044480	We're all back and talking about games.
5044480	5047880	We're gonna get into some rapid-fire news in just a minute, but first, some plugs for
5047880	5050660	some other shows that Dark Soccer and myself work on.
5050660	5053160	If you like Orange Lounge Radio, you might just like these shows too.
5053160	5058200	We have Comic Insanity, which goes live every Tuesday at Infamous.net.
5058200	5060480	It's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.
5060480	5061520	We are awesome.
5061520	5069320	It's me and Maron Marvel and Dan Shadow, and we're pretty geeky, pretty comicky, and we're
5069320	5070840	pretty awesome.
5070840	5072280	And Insanity.
5072280	5074980	The Insanity is there too, yeah.
5074980	5078280	And some Infamy along with it, and some other in stuff.
5078280	5079280	Nice.
5079280	5080620	And Rob.
5080620	5085620	And the best little horde house in Azeroth is All Things World of Warcraft.
5085620	5091360	It's not taped live anywhere right now, but we do put out a pretty fun podcast on Thursdays-ish
5091360	5096760	and you can look that up online at the best little horde house in Azeroth in iTunes.
5096760	5100400	Just search for horde house and it'll come right up or whatever your preferred finder
5100400	5101400	of podcast is.
5101400	5102720	There is a website coming very soon.
5102720	5105560	I'm hoping next week we'll have more details on that.
5105560	5107600	We have the early workings underway.
5107600	5108600	Very exciting.
5108600	5110920	And now an official guild for this show as well.
5110920	5112100	So check that out.
5112100	5115560	This week's show, by the way, was particularly off-color and explicit.
5115560	5120160	So now's a great time to check it out at the best little horde house in Azeroth.
5120160	5122480	Loki has a show called Raising a Baby.
5122480	5124960	Well, it's not really a show.
5124960	5125960	It's just what he does.
5125960	5129200	I wouldn't have a show even if I didn't have a baby.
5129200	5130680	Been there, tried that, don't think so.
5130680	5131680	I know.
5131680	5136600	And I've said it before, it's a crime how undervalued your mix show was because you
5136600	5137600	were pretty good at it.
5137600	5140000	But oh well, some things are just not meant to be.
5140000	5141720	And took too damn long.
5141720	5146340	What is meant to be, more gaming news and Twitter topics very soon on the Twitters.
5146340	5148520	But first, some rapid news, Loki.
5148520	5153480	Yes, of course we knew the Gears of War 3 beta was coming soon thanks to Bulletstorm.
5153480	5159840	Bulletstorm players will actually get access to the Gears of War 3 beta April 18th.
5159840	5166120	And then of course, if you don't have Bulletstorm, you can also get into the beta if you've preordered
5166120	5168880	Gears of War 3 from Gamestop.
5168880	5172080	Those players will be able to get in a week later on April 25th.
5172080	5180480	And of course, multiplayer beta, they're seeing some of the beta unlockables you're gonna
5180480	5184680	get as well in Gears of War 3.
5184680	5191200	The beta tester medal, if you complete one match in the beta, you unlock the beta tester
5191200	5196880	medal, which will be carried over to your gamer profile in the final game.
5196880	5204960	Also you get the thrash ball coal, which is the fictional sport that's in Gears of War.
5204960	5209000	And you get the variant skin for that.
5209000	5216040	The gold plated retro lancer, possible if you complete a bunch of levels in that, 90
5216040	5217040	matches.
5217040	5219400	That's a lot of matches.
5219400	5226760	The flaming hammer burst, if you complete one match by Sunday April 24th.
5226760	5231800	Also the flaming lancer by one match during the week of April 25th.
5231800	5236840	The flaming sawed off shotgun, one match during the week of May 2nd.
5236840	5240840	And the flaming gnasher shotgun during the next week, May 9th.
5240840	5242840	What isn't flaming?
5242840	5245640	Not much.
5245640	5248160	Not me.
5248160	5252680	So that's coming soon, and check it out if you haven't yet.
5252680	5256240	I am so excited to get my next issue of Game Informer.
5256240	5259280	The cover game, of course, is Saints Row the 3rd.
5259280	5261280	God, I love that game.
5261280	5267440	Saints Row is seriously, you know, what Grand Theft Auto used to be as far as over the top
5267440	5268960	and ridiculous.
5268960	5274100	Not that I don't, you know, not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto 4 because I've made it over
5274100	5278920	the top and ridiculous, but Saints Row is awesome.
5278920	5285440	But that is coming out on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC this holiday, and the game looks
5285440	5286440	awesome.
5286440	5291120	Well, the cover or whatever that they have looks awesome.
5291120	5299240	And apparently the game's gonna be taking place, I guess, in Stillwater still.
5299240	5307160	Also I guess there's this gang called the Syndicate, a criminal organization, that has
5307160	5312400	certain, you know, contacts in different parts of the world, and they're saying that it ultimately
5312400	5319400	propels you into a new city that hosts the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.
5319400	5327600	And they're saying, you know, judging by the cover here, nine-way free-fall gun battle
5327600	5329960	from a plane.
5329960	5330960	I can dig that.
5330960	5335160	But yeah, the game, seriously Saints Row 2 is awesome, and hell, I mean, they have a
5335160	5336960	double pack you can get for like 20 bucks nowadays.
5336960	5339520	I mean, if you haven't played it, you should really do that.
5339520	5340960	It's a fun game.
5340960	5345200	But yeah, that's a day one purchase for me, right there.
5345200	5351320	But unfortunately, you know, we do play Saints Row online, but online's not as fun.
5351320	5353800	I do respect the fact that they have SystemLink.
5353800	5357600	That came in handy when our internet is down at work, you know, for a while, or Live is
5357600	5359320	down and we can play, you know, SystemLink games.
5359320	5363480	I'm hoping, granted, that's out of five, or whatever it is, the next one has SystemLink
5363480	5369960	as well, like Red Dead Redemption did, because seriously, that saves us a lot of time.
5369960	5370960	Or Hasselhoff.
5370960	5371960	Or Hasselhoff.
5371960	5372960	Or Hasselhoff.
5372960	5373960	Yes.
5373960	5380280	And then finally, the Panasonic Jungle is not gonna be coming out.
5380280	5388720	It was kind of an ambitious idea for a portable handheld MMO system, just...
5388720	5390880	Oh, the MMO thing!
5390880	5391880	Yeah.
5391880	5394120	Nobody understood that anyway, so that's fine.
5394120	5398720	It's just not feasible.
5398720	5403360	Why don't they just say, nobody got it?
5403360	5404880	It's not a thing that...
5404880	5408000	It's not that nobody got it, I think, it's just, I don't know if we'd be able to run
5408000	5412800	a lot of the popular MMOs, like, that wouldn't be able to run World of Warcraft, for sure.
5412800	5417040	You know, they're saying, oh, it would have been able to, you know, use titles like Stellar
5417040	5419640	Down, Battlestar Galactica, and RuneScape.
5419640	5421200	It's really a Battlestar game.
5421200	5422920	And Rift, it's all about Rift right now.
5422920	5429560	Yeah, I mean, so, it just doesn't have enough oomph to be able to, you know, work.
5429560	5430560	Alright.
5430560	5436120	Can you imagine, though, if they ported World of Warcraft to, like, the iPad, the new iPad
5436120	5437120	or something?
5437120	5440760	It won't happen, but I'm just saying, something of that caliber to something like that, that'd
5440760	5441760	be ridiculous.
5441760	5444200	Well, they do have people just moving into their bathrooms.
5444200	5445200	I know, they have that, like...
5445200	5447960	There's some pretty complex MMOs that are on iOS.
5447960	5452520	What's the one, Legends, or whatever it's called, Play Legends?
5452520	5455400	It's pretty intense.
5455400	5456400	I believe it's free.
5456400	5459800	It's a freemium one, where if you want the Uber stuff, you gotta pay for it, you know?
5459800	5461920	Kind of like Lords of the Ring Online, all that.
5461920	5462920	Yeah.
5462920	5463920	Alrighty.
5463920	5466680	Moving on to some other rapid-fire news.
5466680	5469960	This is a game I really liked on PSP, Half-Minute Hero.
5469960	5475000	It's gonna be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, called Super Mega Neo Climax.
5475000	5476000	That's right.
5476000	5478400	Yeah, weird that they're kind of changing up the name, but yeah.
5478400	5483200	I think that's supposed to be the Super Neo Mega Climax edition of Half-Minute Hero.
5483200	5485960	Well, whatever.
5485960	5489760	It's coming out, and I'm just bitter because I paid 30 bucks for this on the PSP, and it'll
5489760	5493720	probably only be 10 on Xbox Live Arcade, but hey, it's a pretty neat concept, so it'll
5493720	5496600	give a whole new audience a chance to check this out.
5496600	5501120	Thank you, Australian Classification Board, for spoiling it, as you do many video game
5501120	5502120	releases.
5502120	5503120	Check that out.
5503120	5505720	ModNation Racers has reached a milestone this week.
5505720	5509040	Two million user-created items.
5509040	5513360	Plenty more download content on the way, according to the PlayStation blog, including a parts
5513360	5518480	pack that's already available on the PlayStation Store, more track packs to make new tracks,
5518480	5523280	western and pirate-themed, more career DLC coming as well.
5523280	5525240	The party is not stopping at ModNation Racers.
5525240	5527160	Two million user-created items.
5527160	5528160	Mario Kart Wii, zero.
5528160	5529160	That's pretty crazy.
5529160	5530160	Alright.
5530160	5531160	PlayStation Home.
5531160	5534400	Well, technically they do have user-created maps.
5534400	5535400	Officially supported.
5535400	5536400	No.
5536400	5537400	Alright.
5537400	5541880	PlayStation Home was announced that's upgraded to version 1.5, and some of the new features
5541880	5545960	that are coming out in 1.5 of the home client.
5545960	5550660	Games that run within Home, there's already kind of some of these, but they're trying
5550660	5555920	to take it kind of up to the next step with low-lag, real-time multiplayer gaming, allowing
5555920	5559240	more first-person shooters, racing games, and so forth.
5559240	5563240	A demo was shown for sodium 2 project velocity that shows some of this.
5563240	5566360	Hey, you gotta admit, sodium was one of the more interesting things that happened with
5566360	5567360	Home.
5567360	5569480	I realize it's stretching it, but it was interesting.
5569480	5572360	That's just a sad, if that's, you know, what's the big thing about Home.
5572360	5576880	Well, but they say now it looks like Wipeout HD, and to that I go, oh, now that's interesting,
5576880	5578840	because Wipeout HD is kind of badass.
5578840	5584320	So I, if that is true, that you're going to see more stuff like that in Home, okay, bring
5584320	5585320	it on.
5585320	5586320	It's free anyway.
5586320	5588520	It's hard to complain about something free.
5588520	5589520	Uh, yeah.
5589520	5592480	Well, free for the first few levels, and then you got paid for it the rest of the time.
5592480	5593480	That's true, that's true.
5593480	5599040	Alright, uh, and I guess some more super smooth frame rates, better graphics engines, and
5599040	5600040	so forth.
5600040	5605640	Uh, still no word if clubhouses will actually be useful.
5605640	5606640	Somehow doubt it.
5606640	5607640	DarkSakura?
5607640	5613560	Well, here's some news from a game developer's conference.
5613560	5614560	Ninja Gaiden 3!
5614560	5618480	Um, wait, didn't we already have a Ninja Gaiden 3?
5618480	5619480	Wasn't it on NES?
5619480	5623680	Yeah, but this time it doesn't involve Ancient Kingdoms, or whatever the subtitle was, the
5623680	5625440	Ancient Warships, whatever it was.
5625440	5631360	This one has a, uh, a bloody, uh, Ryu on it, so that should be really, really hot.
5631360	5635400	I mean, really, really cool, yeah.
5635400	5641120	And then, we have the Rock Band releases, which a friend of mine who is completely nuts
5641120	5644360	over Depeche Mode is all happy with this.
5644360	5649140	We have the Depeche Mode pack that has Never Let Me Down Again and Personal Jesus and Policy
5649140	5653080	of Truth, and then I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab for Cutie, so.
5653080	5659800	I wish they had more Exciter stuff in there, because that one was awesome.
5659800	5663380	And last but never least, we have more news for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
5663380	5668600	We have the dates for Jill Valentine and Shuma Garath.
5668600	5677560	They will be, um, on March 15th for Xbox Live, 400 points and pop, and then, um, on March
5677560	5679840	16th for the PS3.
5679840	5682640	You gotta wait on PS3, ha ha ha ha.
5682640	5688080	And you heard that right, for people that aren't familiar with Microsoft Space Dollars.
5688080	5690520	Um, $5 a character.
5690520	5692000	Thank you, Capcom.
5692000	5693160	You suck.
5693160	5695320	$5 a character.
5695320	5696320	I don't think so.
5696320	5697460	I'm gonna get Jill.
5697460	5698460	Pay to unlock content.
5698460	5701060	It, yeah, it is pay to unlock content.
5701060	5703060	It's on the disc already.
5703060	5704060	Thank you, Capcom.
5704060	5706320	You suck balls.
5706320	5707640	You're just mad at everyone tonight.
5707640	5708640	No, seriously.
5708640	5709640	I mean, come on.
5709640	5710640	That is ridiculous.
5710640	5711640	Oh, I put it on there.
5711640	5713640	Oh, but we're dicks, so I'm sorry.
5713640	5718040	You need to say something nice about a video game company to balance all this hatred coming
5718040	5719440	out of you tonight.
5719440	5724160	Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an awesome game, but they're dicks for charging $5 a character.
5724160	5725160	I'm sorry.
5725160	5726160	It's stupid.
5726160	5732600	I mean, characters should be, like, $2 at the most, and especially stuff that's not
5732600	5733600	on the disc.
5733600	5735360	This stuff is already on the disc.
5735360	5736680	They're just being dicks.
5736680	5740800	They didn't even spend the time to, like, apparently polish it up.
5740800	5743560	There's no actual storylines or whatever for them.
5743560	5745640	They didn't do any cutscenes for them.
5745640	5746880	They're just assholes.
5746880	5747880	That's all they are.
5747880	5751160	And if you buy them, you're supporting assholes, okay?
5751160	5753160	So just keep that in mind.
5753160	5757640	SSG100 Matt in our chatroom says, Deadpool better make Jill sandwich jokes.
5757640	5758640	Seriously.
5758640	5760280	That's a good point.
5760280	5763280	Do you think Deadpool should make a Jill sandwich joke?
5763280	5765560	No doubt he probably would, if silently.
5765560	5768120	Now, does he ever do anything silently?
5768120	5769120	No.
5769120	5773040	Alright, let's get to the Twitter and read some of the topics that you guys sent to us
5773040	5775040	tonight.
5775040	5780800	Twitter.com slash OLR is the place you can send us tweets, and we read them live.
5780800	5784640	Not all of them, though, but most of them.
5784640	5788320	Spazinator PSN sends us an FYI about the PSN video store.
5788320	5794160	There's currently a free anime pilot, Hikaru no Go, and a movie rental, Stranger Than Fiction,
5794160	5795360	on the PSN video store.
5795360	5798600	Yeah, I heard PSN was giving away more movies.
5798600	5802080	Not that these are all movies people are lining up to see, but hey, it's free.
5802080	5803360	Stranger Than Fiction wasn't terrible.
5803360	5805720	Yeah, if you like free stuff, why not?
5805720	5807160	There you go.
5807160	5810080	SilverSonic1534 is sending us a tweet.
5810080	5811280	Did you see this video?
5811280	5814620	It shows some of Super Mario 3DS screenshots.
5814620	5819180	It looks to be a game like Super Mario Bros. 3, and then follows that up with a correction.
5819180	5822040	It's not looking like Super Mario Bros. 3, but apparently it's going to have some of
5822040	5829400	the powers that were on Super Mario Bros. 3 on the game, and they sent us a Twitter
5829400	5839480	link to an IGN video that I guess is kind of showing, I don't want to watch all these
5839480	5840480	talking heads.
5840480	5841720	All they did was show the stupid.
5841720	5845080	It looks like they're comparing it to Mario Galaxy, and I heard about how the raccoon
5845080	5847480	tail was visible in the little logo that they teased.
5847480	5853120	Yeah, and they're kind of showing this a little bit in the video, so.
5853120	5857720	Well I'm sure, you know, people, one thing they do love about Mario is all these little
5857720	5861880	like powers like the raccoon and please the Tanooki suit, that would be amazing if they
5861880	5862880	brought that back.
5862880	5865840	You know, that's kind of one of the things that made Mario Galaxy fun.
5865840	5867280	The bee suit was awesome.
5867280	5871520	I'm sure some of that stuff, it's all going to be, anything that tickles your retro bone
5871520	5874060	and gets you to drop 40, 50 bucks on the games.
5874060	5879360	And by the way, all of that information that was from IGN right there was all speculation
5879360	5881320	because all they showed was the stupid logo.
5881320	5885040	They're like, oh it's going to be Mario 3, let's speculate on what it's going to look
5885040	5886040	like.
5886040	5890160	I don't think it, of course, it's going to look like there's successful Mario games,
5890160	5893400	but 3D, I mean it's not that hard to figure out I don't think.
5893400	5894400	Am I crazy?
5894400	5895400	I don't know.
5895400	5900200	Alright, going to actdeft who sends us a little twit pic, and it's a collection of little
5900200	5901920	pokey dolls.
5901920	5904960	He showed us his pokeymans live on air.
5904960	5908840	But the question that goes with this, do you collect video game paraphernalia or have a
5908840	5912560	collection besides the vault?
5912560	5913560	So I guess this is.
5913560	5915240	Well we put it all in the vault.
5915240	5919040	I guess this might be more of a question for Loki and myself, IDK.
5919040	5921520	You guys go ahead and answer that because it's a stupid question.
5921520	5925160	To be honest, hey now there's no such thing as a stupid question.
5925160	5926640	I said for me.
5926640	5928000	Oh for you.
5928000	5930280	For me, I got to be honest, not really.
5930280	5934680	For a while I seemed like I had an Xbox Live Arcade collection going on because I was downloading
5934680	5935680	everything.
5935680	5936760	But I don't really collect.
5936760	5939280	I don't buy games just because they're rare.
5939280	5943640	I don't really have a lot of autograph things or collectibles.
5943640	5946520	I rarely, if ever, buy limited editions.
5946520	5951320	I think the last limited edition I remember buying was that Final Fantasy XII at GameStop
5951320	5954240	that had the extra little frills.
5954240	5956060	I mean it's got to be a really big game.
5956060	5959360	I don't even buy Collector's Edition of Warcraft exception.
5959360	5964000	I did buy Collector's Editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King but it
5964000	5965000	was at a charity event.
5965000	5966000	It was at the first Doom Loud.
5966000	5967000	I did buy those.
5967000	5969020	So that's for different reasons.
5969020	5972240	And I ended up giving away the Burning Crusade one to my friend for Christmas.
5972240	5973800	So different thing.
5973800	5975200	Loki, you a collector?
5975200	5979760	I am not a collector of anything but I have like, you know, I get tchotchkes sometimes
5979760	5983400	so I have a bunch of stuff at my desk at work.
5983400	5990520	I've got like, well I used to collect Gundam models but then I bought pretty much all of
5990520	5991520	them.
5991520	5996520	And then, that's still fun every now and then.
5996520	6003600	I do have for the last Samurai Warriors game I think, Samurai Warriors 3, they have these
6003600	6005600	little mini figurines.
6005600	6010000	I have almost the whole collection of those because we got a bunch of boxes of them and
6010000	6012440	so I opened all of them to try to create a whole collection.
6012440	6015000	A missy one though, I think.
6015000	6017000	Here's the other thing I should say about why I don't collect.
6017000	6019280	I got hoarding tendencies as it is.
6019280	6022680	If I really was a rabid collector it would be really bad, you guys.
6022680	6024140	So I can't.
6024140	6025840	I can't get rid of the stuff I have.
6025840	6031520	I have my Japanese copy of Smash Bros. at my desk sitting there since I don't need the
6031520	6035800	Japanese version anymore, the real version.
6035800	6039280	And what else did I have that's really weird?
6039280	6045040	I have a poster for the Atari Pac-Man.
6045040	6049280	I want it for a penny on eBay.
6049280	6052340	But nothing to the scale of Dark Sakura's Vault.
6052340	6055240	That is a whole little special level all on its own.
6055240	6059600	Some of our stuff that we've gotten that we've really looked into, it's just sort of like,
6059600	6061720	it'll be there and we'll see it and it's cool.
6061720	6068400	We've gotten all kinds of neat collector stuff through Dan getting some swag from the local
6068400	6072000	reps and going to conventions and things.
6072000	6079920	I still think the coolest, one of the coolest things we got was the Goemon doll.
6079920	6086480	Because we bought our Twilight Zone pinball game from the guy who owned Working Designs.
6086480	6088800	And he just gave one to Dan.
6088800	6090800	So that was pretty cool.
6090800	6099840	One of my favorite things in there is I have a little Pac-Man doll from 1982 that has the
6099840	6100840	ghost in his mouth.
6100840	6106960	I'll take a picture of it and put it up, but that's one of my favorite things in the vault.
6106960	6110200	They've just got stuff everywhere.
6110200	6119120	Even in here we've got all these Guitar Hero face plates that Dan got for cheap slash free
6119120	6122640	on the wall and just stuff we've looked into.
6122640	6125200	I mean, sometimes this stuff just falls in our lap.
6125200	6130200	It's not like we're trying to collect it on purpose.
6130200	6134640	And then Dan says from the other room, and some of it we spent stupid money on.
6134640	6136840	Alright, well let's move on.
6136840	6140520	A couple tweets coming to us from Tigerclaw.
6140520	6147360	Tigerclaw linking us to this story, I guess a quote from Cliffy B, Cliff Blazinski, Mary
6147360	6149120	Gamers, don't date them.
6149120	6154560	I'm going to read verbatim this article from Joystick with a Q, a proper credit to them
6154560	6158520	because I was tweeted this story and didn't have a chance to skim things in advance for
6158520	6160240	the relevant stuff.
6160240	6164880	In a candid talk during the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Epic Games Design
6164880	6170200	Director Cliff Blazinski advised attendees to have an educated gut and to be cognizant
6170200	6173220	of the value of marketing and long-term relationships with customers.
6173220	6177960	He encapsulated his talk in the Power Creative, a project member who is unique, valuable and
6177960	6179940	visibly tied to the game's identity.
6179940	6180940	This could be anyone.
6180940	6181940	I see.
6181940	6186080	So it's more like he's not saying that in the literal sense, like Mary Gamers, he's
6186080	6192200	saying kind of, you know, be educated as to the long-term relationships you build with
6192200	6193200	the gamers.
6193200	6195640	Let me read another paragraph from the article here.
6195640	6200560	With consumers constantly immersed in an information feed via social networking platforms like
6200560	6205720	Twitter and Facebook, it's important for game designers to be surgical and devious in creating
6205720	6209720	IPs that thrive in an always on heavily branded world.
6209720	6214900	According to Blazinski, the market only tolerates games that land on the far end of the spectrum
6214900	6218480	between freemium snack games and big budget games like Gears of War.
6218480	6221040	I believe the middle class game is dead.
6221040	6224640	The Power Creative understands how to engage fans over a long period of time.
6224640	6227560	Make gamers marry your game, not just date it.
6227560	6232240	Again, if you want to read the rest of that story, it's on joystickwithacue.com as tweeted
6232240	6234080	to us tonight.
6234080	6235080	Hmm.
6235080	6239120	Do game developers, some of them need to work on the relationship with the fan and that
6239120	6244360	whole idea of marry your audience and don't just take them out on one night stands?
6244360	6247000	Or do you think that that whole little comparison is way out of...
6247000	6250520	You need to satisfy your market.
6250520	6253000	If you don't satisfy them, they'll leave.
6253000	6254480	All right.
6254480	6261040	They'll leave you for other developers who love them longer and harder.
6261040	6262040	You know, I got to say this.
6262040	6264960	Some people do get very passionate about certain development houses, you know, especially the
6264960	6266120	ones that seem to treat them well.
6266120	6271360	I mean, especially in light of everything that Loki had said a minute ago about Capcom,
6271360	6273960	for the most part, they touch into their fan base pretty well.
6273960	6278440	They have a lot of fans through their blogs and the things that they do online.
6278440	6282320	You know, they really do seem to give the fans what they want despite some of these
6282320	6284560	oversights and things, except Mega Man Universe.
6284560	6285560	Whatever happened to that?
6285560	6286560	Hello?
6286560	6287560	What happened to Mega Man Universe?
6287560	6288560	Where'd it go?
6288560	6289560	Anybody seen it?
6289560	6290560	Anyhow.
6290560	6296800	Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw, a link to a story on Kotaku about the Social Game
6296800	6298200	Developers Rant.
6298200	6300560	Ah, now I did hear about this.
6300560	6304640	Apparently, there was a panel at Game Developers Conference where a bunch of the folks that
6304640	6309040	develop for these social game companies like Zynga and Playdom and all this, they basically
6309040	6312800	got up and said, hey, you know what, stop picking on us.
6312800	6314200	Screw you.
6314200	6315200	We're not that bad.
6315200	6316920	And it was just this whole panel.
6316920	6320360	Kind of sounds like straight out of like a really bad panel at an anime convention or
6320360	6324320	something where it's just dudes up on a stage ranting about shit they don't like.
6324320	6328600	It's kind of like what they did here, but it was about like social network and why do
6328600	6331880	people always pick on us type of thing.
6331880	6332880	Interesting.
6332880	6337440	So they also did a little mini game where the developers were encouraged, I'm sorry,
6337440	6340880	the people attending the panels were encouraged to collect coins and whoever could get the
6340880	6345080	most coins got to do a rant of their own, which is kind of funny because that's kind
6345080	6347440	of like how a social game would actually work.
6347440	6348440	So ha.
6348440	6352960	So there you go.
6352960	6353960	Is that it for tweets?
6353960	6355960	Oh no, one last tweet from Blue Swim.
6355960	6360760	Orange Lounge Foodio question, which is better, Cadbury Creme Eggs or Marshmallow Peeps?
6360760	6361960	Also welcome back, Loki.
6361960	6366240	Cadbury Creme Eggs since marshmallows are disgusting.
6366240	6367240	I actually disagree.
6367240	6371240	I prefer Marshmallow Peeps because they can joust in the microwave and Cadbury Creme Eggs
6371240	6372240	are too much.
6372240	6375160	Like, if I'm going to eat a Cadbury Creme Egg, it needs to be one of those little mini
6375160	6376160	ones.
6376160	6377840	I can't, the big ones are too much, too rich.
6377840	6378840	You know what's fantastic?
6378840	6382600	It's going to Touch of Britain and getting the Mars eggs.
6382600	6385040	Those are fantastic.
6385040	6386040	Orange Creme Eggs.
6386040	6388400	I still kind of prefer Marshmallow Peeps personally.
6388400	6391320	I don't know.
6391320	6394600	I'm not a big fan of either one.
6394600	6397320	Creme Eggs, I guess.
6397320	6398320	Alright.
6398320	6399320	That's it for tweets.
6399320	6401360	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
6401360	6404360	In the meantime, let's get back into some other video game news before we get to the
6404360	6407920	mailbag, the FUs, and of course your phone calls.
6407920	6410140	Alright.
6410140	6416680	So this is kind of neat and kind of along the lines of stuff that they were pimping
6416680	6417680	out before.
6417680	6424240	Of course, the Kinect, there is supposed to be a dev kit coming officially for Microsoft,
6424240	6430760	but until then, there's going to be another dev kit coming out from a different company.
6430760	6436360	The dev kit is called ISU, or I guess the software platform, ISU which stands for the
6436360	6443600	interface is you, and of course it's Soft Connect's 3D gesture recognition software
6443600	6449440	development kit, now available for qualified developers, and they can license it for free.
6449440	6457360	It says they'll work with all 3D depth sensing devices, which includes support for the Kinect,
6457360	6465040	and I guess it's a strictly non-commercial software development kit, and commercial version
6465040	6470440	of course can be purchased from them as well, but that's kind of neat, and it says there's
6470440	6474840	going to be different ones actually coming out from Evaloos, PrimeSense, and of course
6474840	6475840	Microsoft.
6475840	6481360	So neat to see that there's going to be some, I'm actually, I'd be kind of curious to see
6481360	6486040	what the first like real retail game that comes out that supports Kinect, that'd be
6486040	6487040	kind of neat.
6487040	6493000	And then of course, not to be outdone by that, PlayStation, the PlayStation Move I should
6493000	6500880	say, they actually have some tools as well to be able to program stuff that supports
6500880	6506400	the PlayStation, iCamera, and the Move controllers.
6506400	6511520	It's called MoveMe, and it's a software tool that's going to be using the PlayStation Move
6511520	6517520	technology to create unique applications, and of course it's coming soon.
6517520	6522800	They're saying that MoveMe is going to be a downloadable application for the PS3 that
6522800	6528440	allows researchers, students, hobbyists, developers, or anyone the ability to develop for the PlayStation
6528440	6533440	Move, and they said they want to see what innovative applications programs can create
6533440	6537240	using the PlayStation Move controller, the PS3 system, and the PlayStation iCamera, and
6537240	6538620	the PC.
6538620	6545560	So apparently it's going to be available on the PlayStation Network this spring, but people
6545560	6549240	that are interested will be able to apply for it as well.
6549240	6558520	You can go to, I believe, usplaystation.com slash ps3 slash playstation dash move slash
6558520	6561200	move dash me, and check that out.
6561200	6562200	That's kind of neat.
6562200	6563980	What do you think will ultimately come of this?
6563980	6565400	Maybe some applications or whatever.
6565400	6571760	I think there's a lot of stuff that they could do with the PlayStation that they're not.
6571760	6574800	I mean, remember like a long time ago, they were showing some of the stuff, even what
6574800	6577240	they could do with the PlayStation iCamera.
6577240	6579240	Like they're all, hey look, we made a combat game.
6579240	6583000	It was the developers for the PlayStation i stuff.
6583000	6588280	They're showing, hey look, we can make a combat game where you draw, you know, your tanks
6588280	6592280	that you use and you can scan them in and play a game with it.
6592280	6596320	They did all those cool tech demos, but never released them.
6596320	6600780	It's like, you know, you could have done something cool with that, but no.
6600780	6604360	Do you see more like bite-sized applications coming maybe to the PlayStation Network?
6604360	6605360	They should.
6605360	6610560	That was the whole point with like even on the PSP, how they have the PlayStation Network
6610560	6613160	on the PSP and they have the PSP minis and stuff.
6613160	6616160	It was supposed to be more of like those bite-sized applications.
6616160	6623240	I'm hoping that, you know, they kind of look at the next PlayStation Portable as, hey,
6623240	6627520	you know what, we're going to try to make this thing more like a smartphone or something
6627520	6632280	where we're going to have not only the applications that are going to be games, but we're also
6632280	6637760	going to have, you know, like a Twitter program or, you know, a Facebook program or, you know,
6637760	6643760	a bunch of other stuff that people can develop like, you know, just non-gaming applications
6643760	6644760	for.
6644760	6645760	And I think that's smart.
6645760	6652200	And I think that should really be on all portable systems that are coming out, Nintendo.
6652200	6653400	It just, it makes sense.
6653400	6660720	It's just what, you know, that kind of industry's popular for now is applications.
6660720	6662440	People love their applications.
6662440	6663440	Alright.
6663440	6668440	Well, on a completely different kind of topic, we're going to talk about kind of a cleanup
6668440	6670640	that's going on on Xbox Live right now.
6670640	6674760	No, they're not cleaning out games or anything, but they are cleaning out gamertags.
6674760	6676560	You know, Xbox Live has been around quite a while.
6676560	6679600	It's been around, what, since about, uh, 02 was when it launched, right?
6679600	6682600	So it's been around, well, about as long as Orange Launch Radio has.
6682600	6685480	And amongst that time, they have collected a lot of gamertags that really just didn't
6685480	6690240	end up getting used because people changed them or, what, they made them on the old Xbox
6690240	6693000	and never really migrated them or what have you.
6693000	6696680	So Major Nelson made an announcement, uh, this week that they have begun the process
6696680	6701760	of making previously used and unavailable Xbox Live gamertags available.
6701760	6704760	They're not saying what meets the qualifications for dead.
6704760	6712680	I am assuming that ones that were used on the old Xbox, because old Xbox Live is gone,
6712680	6716320	that never migrated to a 360 account, I'm assuming that's what qualifies, but it's a
6716320	6717320	huge assumption.
6717320	6721840	Um, I think part of what definitely falls into this, people that changed their name,
6721840	6725560	their old name would still be unavailable, so I think a lot of that is kind of getting
6725560	6726840	moved permanently.
6726840	6731600	So, uh, the, also it's stressed on here, uh, the process will take time to complete.
6731600	6735360	They will, will not be able to tell you when a gamertag that you want is available.
6735360	6739240	You should always check back regularly because they are reviving gamertags daily.
6739240	6743440	You can go into the Xbox channel and change gamertag to see if the gamertag you want is
6743440	6744440	available.
6744440	6748400	I tried to get Major Nelson, but it was taken.
6748400	6749400	So there you go.
6749400	6753160	I did notice though, one name I would be interested in changing to was available.
6753160	6755680	So uh, who knows?
6755680	6761000	I'm not sure how I feel about $10 just to change my gamertag, but you never know, we'll
6761000	6762000	see.
6762000	6764000	Anything's possible.
6764000	6766840	Would anyone, would anyone try to change their name to something else?
6766840	6770160	Loki, you should see if maybe Loki without the OLR is available.
6770160	6772160	It's not, I'm sure it's not.
6772160	6774960	Well, and even still, it's, it's fine.
6774960	6775960	I'll leave it as is.
6775960	6776960	Yeah.
6776960	6777960	I'm happy with mine.
6777960	6780720	I don't really play that much because it sort of kills me.
6780720	6781720	Yeah.
6781720	6785400	Makes my hands hurt, which, uh, nevermind.
6785400	6790840	All right, anyhow, let's move on with some more stories, Darth Zira.
6790840	6792800	Well today's other story is Metal Cthulhu.
6792800	6794120	No, I'm just kidding.
6794120	6795800	Um, Another World.
6795800	6796800	You remember this game?
6796800	6797800	It came out in the nineties.
6797800	6798800	Oh my God.
6798800	6799800	I do remember that game.
6799800	6803320	It was, it was epic when it came out.
6803320	6807120	Well, it's, it actually first came out in 1991.
6807120	6811240	It was a cinematic sci-fi side-scroller, and it's going to be brought up to date to come
6811240	6813680	out for iPhone and iPad.
6813680	6822400	It's being ported by Dotemu, so, uh, it, they haven't said anything about new features,
6822400	6826440	but they're saying that they want it to be the best experience on iOS.
6826440	6831120	Sorry, I'm looking at a video on YouTube of this game being played, actually, so I can
6831120	6834040	kind of re- take, take me back a little bit, let me skip ahead, this is somebody playing
6834040	6836040	it on an Amiga.
6836040	6837040	Sorry.
6837040	6844800	Well, it, it really is a pretty game, I mean, it's, it was great, and this is, uh, supposed
6844800	6848620	to be just a big, uh, a big ol' update.
6848620	6855360	And they're also working on, um, an Ubisoft, uh, game called From Dust that's gonna be
6855360	6859160	out on PC, and PSN, and Xbox Live Arcade.
6859160	6860160	Nice.
6860160	6862220	But, dude, another world.
6862220	6867640	This game was kind of like, um, a souped-up version of, uh, Prince of Persia, but, like,
6867640	6873920	I, that's really, it's like Prince of Persia in space, but with epic cutscenes involved,
6873920	6874920	I don't know.
6874920	6879200	Kind of a little flashback, too, what that came out after.
6879200	6880200	Yeah.
6880200	6881200	Running away from a killer bear.
6881200	6883440	Yeah, this game was so epic when it came out.
6883440	6886960	Wasn't, like, Out of This World or something like that.
6886960	6890800	Um, it was called, uh, oh, in the States.
6890800	6893320	Yeah, in the US it was called Out of This World.
6893320	6896600	Another world was the UK release.
6896600	6898640	Yet I still know it by that name.
6898640	6899640	Yeah.
6899640	6900640	Anyhow.
6900640	6901640	Very cool.
6901640	6906960	Uh, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, that game is fucking amazing, but it's hard as
6906960	6907960	fuck.
6907960	6911280	I have no idea how you can play it without tactical, tactile controls.
6911280	6913760	And I got the HD version they put out, like, four years ago.
6913760	6915920	I didn't realize they'd done a remake already.
6915920	6917380	And damn good point.
6917380	6920680	It's cool that they're putting it out again in nostalgia and all that on the iOS, but
6920680	6925980	again, no joystick means hard game is very, very hard.
6925980	6928480	So I don't know.
6928480	6929480	We'll see.
6929480	6932920	Um, anyhow, uh, let's move on with a few more stories.
6932920	6936400	The mailbag is coming up as well as the Skype line.
6936400	6941680	Um, so they've got, uh, some cool stuff coming to OnLive.
6941680	6946680	Um, some of the things that they announced at Game Developers Conference, uh, that they're
6946680	6951840	gonna be offering to developers that want to put their games on to the platform.
6951840	6957760	They're saying, uh, voice chat, game invite for multiplayer games, uh, the ability to
6957760	6963880	directly upload brag clips to YouTube, and then also achievements, um, which they're
6963880	6968800	guessing is gonna be stuff derived from console versions, um, but, you know, hey, if they
6968800	6972520	want to put up an old retro game or something like that and add achievements to it, they
6972520	6973520	can.
6973520	6977720	And then, um, also they're gonna allow, uh, developers to let their games support wireless
6977720	6985200	controllers when played on mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, um, or Android powered,
6985200	6990760	um, phones or tablets.
6990760	6995400	Basically they need some controllers for some of those devices.
6995400	6998600	Kind of interesting though how this thing is like kind of turning into a gaming console
6998600	7002600	like in reverse, like the way it kind of all mapped out and like now they have the, you
7002600	7005880	know, the streaming thing and now they're talking about voice chat.
7005880	7010640	But the lineup of games, if I'm not mistaken, is still relatively weak for this console,
7010640	7011640	right?
7011640	7014780	I mean, there's a few good ones in there, but it's not like you have the gigantic array
7014780	7018200	of games like it's available on most gaming consoles.
7018200	7019200	That's true.
7019200	7022400	I mean, it didn't launch that long ago, it was like a few months ago.
7022400	7023400	True.
7023400	7026360	So, I don't know, they're doing alright, I think.
7026360	7030200	I think they're making progress and it's definitely been, you know, it works, so.
7030200	7032400	I think it's worked a lot better than anybody thought it would.
7032400	7036880	I think a lot of people wrote this thing off when it first came out, or before it came
7036880	7037880	out really.
7037880	7038880	So.
7038880	7039880	Hmm.
7039880	7041580	Well, we'll see what continues with that.
7041580	7043560	It's neat that they're still going with it.
7043560	7047380	That type of device though, um, you know how they have the micro console and stuff like
7047380	7053760	that, if they can do MMOs on that, that's how you would get a device like the Jungle,
7053760	7059060	where it would basically be something that runs on a server, you know, at some company
7059060	7063600	or whatever, like World of Warcraft or something like that, and you have your controls on there,
7063600	7068020	it's very limited, but you don't need to have the powerhouse of like, you know, a tablet
7068020	7073960	or whatever in this device, because all it's doing is streaming stuff over wifi.
7073960	7079360	Although I don't know if you can do that over wifi very well, it would be pretty slow.
7079360	7085760	But um, you know, once, once our internet catches up to the speeds that there are in
7085760	7090340	other countries, you know, it might be a little bit different, you know, 5G, 6G, whatever
7090340	7097280	the next, you know, speed increase that we're going to see here, stupid 4G, but yeah, once
7097280	7099840	it gets up to that, then you'll see stuff like that happening.
7099840	7103640	Alright, well, let's move on to another quick story before we get to the mailbag, and this
7103640	7105480	is about the game DJ Max.
7105480	7108980	It's a music game, of course on the PSP, has a very cult-like following, of course a lot
7108980	7114060	of the folks that followed BeatMania 2DX and DDR back in the day still follow this series.
7114060	7118240	It's filled with a lot of Korean music, K-pop and so forth, and the music's pretty popular
7118240	7122480	amongst the crowd, but usually there's not a real legitimate, anyway, way to get the
7122480	7124180	music outside of Korea.
7124180	7125180	Well guess what?
7125180	7129860	Starting in March, it was announced, Pentavision has announced that the soundtracks for DJ
7129860	7133020	Max are going to be published on iTunes.
7133020	7138000	Three albums followed by a new album every week, I guess until they get caught up, because
7138000	7142360	that's a lot of albums, but there have been quite a few DJ Max games at this point, so
7142360	7148080	fans of that series are going to be very happy that they get their nice CD-quality sound
7148080	7149080	out of iTunes.
7149080	7152480	That'll be pretty cool, if they didn't already get it through other means from the Korean
7152480	7153480	albums.
7153480	7154480	That's pretty cool.
7154480	7157960	You know iTunes has been doing a lot of different Japanese pop artists, like the really big
7157960	7161280	names like Ayumi and Gokt and...
7161280	7164440	Yeah, I bought an Ayumi song on there not that long ago, it's kind of funny.
7164440	7167320	I got a Lark and Seal album, like a while back.
7167320	7169160	They also do a lot of video game soundtracks.
7169160	7174340	It's interesting to me that they don't have a gaming section in their store.
7174340	7175340	Maybe I missed it.
7175340	7179120	I think there is a soundtracks section, so maybe it's buried in there and I've just missed
7179120	7183880	it, but there's more and more gaming soundtracks on there, like the Pac-Man Championship Edition,
7183880	7186160	the Deluxe that has the awesome techno music.
7186160	7190900	That soundtrack's on there, you can get that, and there's, you know, pretty much every Final
7190900	7192660	Fantasy soundtrack's on there now.
7192660	7196760	You know, in some of the newer games, DDR has soundtracks on there now, so a lot of
7196760	7198320	games have been showing up.
7198320	7201260	Warcraft has a soundtrack there too.
7201260	7205040	Lots of games starting to get showing up on iTunes, so it's kind of neat.
7205040	7206040	Yeah.
7206040	7208080	Especially for those that like the music in their games, I wish there's a lot of really
7208080	7214040	good stuff that the mass market doesn't often get to hear, so that's pretty cool.
7214040	7218080	So maybe it will expose more fans to DJ Max.
7218080	7220320	I guess that's the ultimate goal for this.
7220320	7221320	We'll see.
7221320	7222320	Might be.
7222320	7223320	Might be.
7223320	7225520	Before we get to the mailbag here in a minute, I wanted to back up a minute, because we were
7225520	7228320	talking about Out of This World or Another World.
7228320	7232000	Do you think there's any other PC games that ought to be coming out for iOS that maybe
7232000	7233000	they've missed?
7233000	7234320	Because that's definitely a classic.
7234320	7235320	Loom.
7235320	7236320	Loom.
7236320	7237320	Loom.
7237320	7238320	Didn't they, they did something.
7238320	7239320	I guess it was a hack.
7239320	7240320	Loom's on Steam.
7240320	7241320	It was like a hack.
7241320	7242320	Oh yeah, it's on Steam.
7242320	7243320	I want to say there was like a hack for the iOS or something.
7243320	7244320	Of course.
7244320	7245320	You know I got Loom on Steam.
7245320	7247400	Somebody wants to hack the old LucasArts stuff for that.
7247400	7250720	You know, I actually have a copy of Loom for PC.
7250720	7252080	I bought it on eBay.
7252080	7253080	Nice.
7253080	7254080	Because I love that game.
7254080	7255080	It's pretty nice.
7255080	7258880	I hardly remember how to play it, because of all the chords and stuff, and I've remembered
7258880	7263280	some of the chords and I do them way too early, but Loom would be fun one.
7263280	7264280	Scorched Earth.
7264280	7265280	Yes!
7265280	7269120	Oh man, it's been years since I've played Scorched Earth, absolutely.
7269120	7271720	What about Phantasmagoria?
7271720	7274160	That's not outside the realm of possibility.
7274160	7277920	There was a news on that not that long ago.
7277920	7282160	I know they brought out the seventh guest, which I know it's a completely different company,
7282160	7285280	but for some reason these go together in my mind, and they were talking about the eleventh
7285280	7288640	hour, and I want to say around that same time we had heard something about Phantasmagoria.
7288640	7291960	So that'd be pretty cool if that were to come out for iOS.
7291960	7296560	The point-and-click games would lend themselves much better to the iOS system.
7296560	7299600	So maybe like Chirandia would be awesome if we could get that.
7299600	7304760	Obviously, you know, I gotta say King's Quest would be kind of neat.
7304760	7311200	And there was the whole Flash versions that got shut down, so we know it's kind of possible.
7311200	7315560	Good Ol' Games had a Phantasmagoria for digital download last year.
7315560	7316560	Maybe that's why we reported on it.
7316560	7322760	They do have the SCUMM emulator, so for jailbroken devices.
7322760	7326560	And you know me, I'd like to see more classic Commodore 64 games show up outside of just
7326560	7327560	the emulator.
7327560	7330640	There's the emulator that's available, but it keeps going up and down and up and down.
7330640	7332640	I don't even know if it's still on the store right now.
7332640	7338520	They also have... there's some other emulator that was out there that was...
7338520	7340520	iDOS was an emulator.
7340520	7341640	I had Duke Nukem and all that.
7341640	7344400	I have it on my phone, but it's pulled from the store now.
7344400	7345400	iDOS.
7345400	7346400	There's another one.
7346400	7349880	I did get the... they finally leaked that out too.
7349880	7355120	Remember that Minecraft client that got uploaded for just a brief millisecond or whatever?
7355120	7356720	Yeah, I finally found that.
7356720	7357720	Nice.
7357720	7362080	But I don't have a Minecraft account, so I can't play it yet.
7362080	7366040	Alright, well let's get to the mailbag.
7366040	7369400	You guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaungeready.com.
7369400	7373640	Dark Sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air.
7373640	7376120	The first email is actually directed towards me.
7376120	7380240	It says, hello, I heard last week that Dark Sakura is going to Faname Con.
7380240	7381560	I will be going this year as well.
7381560	7383360	How about an OLR meetup at the convention?
7383360	7385080	Hope to see you, Sakura.
7385080	7387000	She and I.
7387000	7391720	If everything works out, I'm not making any supreme promises or anything, because honestly
7391720	7395120	I miss cosplaying and I think I wouldn't mind doing it again.
7395120	7398440	But we definitely need to see about getting our panel.
7398440	7399440	That would be...
7399440	7400800	Might be a little late for that.
7400800	7401800	We're almost into...
7401800	7402800	We're like mid-March.
7402800	7406480	If we could swing it, yeah, I'd love to do it.
7406480	7408160	I'll probably be here that weekend, so yeah.
7408160	7409960	I'll bring the dolls again.
7409960	7413720	The scary creepy dolls.
7413720	7414720	Next email.
7414720	7415720	Hey, OLR.
7415720	7419800	How would you feel if Konami gave the DDR series a reboot on the Kinect?
7419800	7425000	The game would feature songs from DDR's history and songs found in the charts today, and it
7425000	7429520	would also feature an online mode where players can compete in dance battles or form their
7429520	7432040	own dance groups and choreograph their own dances.
7432040	7433040	Oh.
7433040	7434040	Yeah.
7434040	7438120	I think, unfortunately, Konami's already kind of screwed the pooch with that, because Dance
7438120	7440040	Masters is kind of that.
7440040	7446120	At least it's a lot of the old DDR songs, but in that whole para-slash-dance-central-esque
7446120	7447120	kind of format.
7447120	7452000	And there's a demo available now on Xbox 360 if you want to see what this game's all about.
7452000	7457080	But yeah, I think you have some good ideas, but the weird thing is...
7457080	7460840	And I don't know, did he say with a dance mat and Kinect?
7460840	7463400	Because that might be a little weird for some people.
7463400	7464400	If you...
7464400	7465400	Hey, guess what?
7465400	7470200	We do use a Kinect, though, with DDR, the upcoming DDR game, Dance Dance Revolution,
7470200	7471200	because they made it just...
7471200	7474680	We covered last week where there's a hack for it that they're trying to...
7474680	7478200	No, that's StepMania, but I'm talking about the actual Dance Dance Revolution member,
7478200	7483200	the one that came out on PS3 with move support and then on the Wii as well.
7483200	7489960	Well, it's coming out in April on Xbox 360, and it uses the Xbox Vision camera, which
7489960	7494520	is now also technically the Kinect, but you can do crap with that.
7494520	7497920	But seriously, you need...
7497920	7502720	We don't need to give Konami reasons to make more gimmicky crap for Dance Dance Revolution.
7502720	7506680	They just need to stick to the core mechanics and improve on that, or just basically do
7506680	7512480	what they were doing back, like, years ago, and they would be fine, but they're trying...
7512480	7514440	I don't know what they're doing anymore, and I don't think...
7514440	7517960	Uh, they need to just reform Konami Hawaii and give them the game.
7517960	7521960	That's really the only thing that would really get me, like, super interested in DDR again.
7521960	7522960	Put me in charge!
7522960	7528040	I will make you a game that's gonna be perfect.
7528040	7529040	More emails?
7529040	7530480	Yes, there was actually more to this email.
7530480	7531480	Oh, my bad.
7531480	7535200	Finally, it would be great if you guys would give my video game blog a quick plug on the
7535200	7537480	show, which I will be happy to do.
7537480	7538480	No!
7538480	7539480	That'll be $50.
7539480	7540480	Hush.
7540480	7541480	Here's a link.
7541480	7542480	PlayStationUK.wordpress.com.
7542480	7543480	Thanks, Liam.
7543480	7544480	Okay, Liam.
7544480	7545480	Send me...
7545480	7551960	I would like to know Liam's thoughts on the whole LG lawsuit that we covered at the top
7551960	7553840	of the show, since that is affecting the UK.
7553840	7554840	Yeah.
7554840	7555840	Maybe it's on his blog.
7555840	7561520	Well, we'll have to just go there later, and maybe look later.
7561520	7563320	So, next email.
7563320	7564320	Greetings, OLR.
7564320	7565920	This is your neighborhood turtle again.
7565920	7570840	I've included a link you guys should check out concerning Unreal Engine 3.
7570840	7575120	Looking at the screen caps plus the previews of Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3, I'm incredibly
7575120	7577880	impressed mostly with the lighting.
7577880	7582080	Being a graphics whore, all these next-gen games look very promising.
7582080	7586000	I know y'all like the retro games, but isn't there a part of you that loves beautiful graphics
7586000	7587000	in your games?
7587000	7588000	Fuck yeah.
7588000	7591920	As the only turtle gamer I know, I have to say that I get more immersed in games that
7591920	7593440	look realistic.
7593440	7597640	Keep up the best podcasts on the internet to your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.
7597640	7599960	I love pretty things.
7599960	7603040	Why else did I sit through the first 13 hours of Final Fantasy 13?
7603040	7604360	I mean, really.
7604360	7607800	No, the lighting is really tremendous.
7607800	7608800	It's amazing.
7608800	7612880	You know, Unreal Engine, the last one, was amazing enough.
7612880	7615800	I'm sure the new one's just gonna be even more of an improvement.
7615800	7616800	It's gonna be great.
7616800	7617800	I don't think that's four.
7617800	7619800	That's just the new updates that they did for three.
7619800	7620800	Oh my gosh.
7620800	7621800	I thought that was the...
7621800	7622800	I thought...
7622800	7623800	I thought this is the new engine.
7623800	7627720	No, that's just the tweaks that they did for three, I think, because remember...
7627720	7630720	That's a pretty crazy poly count these things are running, too.
7630720	7632400	I don't think they have Unreal.
7632400	7635800	Remember, the next one's Rage, I thought, from...
7635800	7637800	Was Epic Rage?
7637800	7638800	No.
7638800	7639800	I don't remember.
7639800	7643920	But I know Rage is the next big engine, but yeah, I don't think that's Unreal 4.
7643920	7646520	That's just tweaks to the new three, if I remember correctly.
7646520	7651400	I also wanna see what crazy non-shooting things come out of the engine, because you know,
7651400	7655920	we've been getting some really random things in the Unreal Engine.
7655920	7659160	There's a few role-playing games from Square that were done in the engine.
7659160	7660160	The last...
7660160	7662240	Was it Last Remnant that was in Unreal?
7662240	7663560	No, Last Remnant was.
7663560	7667320	Well, I've been looking at this, and this is kinda funny since I've been taking my 3D
7667320	7668320	class.
7668320	7672120	It's just, now that I actually understand the physics behind some of this, it's pretty
7672120	7675640	cool seeing, you know, what happens by layer.
7675640	7676640	It's just amazing.
7676640	7683140	Like, I'm gonna share this picture with the chatroom, because this is a really good example.
7683140	7688520	It's the one of the dude's face where they'd start with the...
7688520	7690980	It's basically just a demo of the subsurface scattering.
7690980	7694360	It's really cool.
7694360	7696760	They also showing how cool smoking is.
7696760	7698440	Yeah, like...
7698440	7707480	Honestly, a falling cigarette is a good showing of lighting and physics in action.
7707480	7710360	Because that was clearly part of their demo.
7710360	7715000	And it also shows that Epic has set the release Falling Cigarette the Game after Gears of
7715000	7719840	War 3, and I can't be any more excited than I am possibly right now.
7719840	7721720	Next email.
7721720	7722720	Hi guys...
7722720	7723720	Cigarettes will fall.
7723720	7724720	Fall of 2012.
7724720	7728720	Hi guys, since the website won't let me post this because it's too long, I figured I'd
7728720	7729720	just email it.
7729720	7730720	Oh good.
7730720	7731720	Bleh.
7731720	7734560	Yay, DarkSakura loves long emails.
7734560	7737360	Especially after my mouth is dry from just having a beer.
7737360	7741640	It seems, first off, if I ever call the show again, I have to close the all-games window.
7741640	7745760	Twice, it just suddenly turned itself back on while I was in the call.
7745760	7746760	Weird.
7746760	7749760	Anywho, I just thought I'd give a very interesting story.
7749760	7753960	Now I know I've stated before how much I like PC gaming and console these days for various
7753960	7754960	reasons.
7754960	7757680	Recently I was a bit bored and was curious, so I decided to try out a game I heard a lot
7757680	7760120	about, Mass Effect 2 on the PC.
7760120	7764200	Now the game ran smooth-smooth-ly, not smooth, dude.
7764200	7766360	The game looked great.
7766360	7771320	And honestly, after playing out the entire demo, I was impressed enough that I made plans
7771320	7773360	to purchase the game at a later time.
7773360	7776740	A few days ago on a whim, and because of the common thoughts of how important frames per
7776740	7780880	second is to me, I can tell the difference even after 60 FPS.
7780880	7784520	Despite people saying it's impossible, but that's another story.
7784520	7786400	I decided to download the PS3 demo.
7786400	7790880	Now granted, it looked the same, with a bit less framerate, but it wasn't too bad.
7790880	7794200	After the first part of the demo, where the big shit blew up, I looked at my girlfriend
7794200	7799060	who was watching the game with me, and all I heard was, can I see more?
7799060	7802080	Her saying that about a game is not something I've seen every day.
7802080	7803560	Wouldn't I be hearing every day?
7803560	7804560	Anyway.
7804560	7811280	In fact, I think this is the third game ever she's been that impressed.
7811280	7814920	So of course I went through the rest of the demo, even showing her how much customization
7814920	7818520	was involved in creating your character, and following the storylines and how they can
7818520	7819520	branch off.
7819520	7822880	After the full demo, I found that while the controls aren't as good as I'd like them to
7822880	7825840	be, they're far better than the Xbox 360.
7825840	7831460	In fact, I would rather use the PS3 controller for first person shooters than the Xbox.
7831460	7836220	And yes, the framerate isn't as silky smooth, but it still looks great and felt like a movie.
7836220	7840200	My girl just had the biggest jaw drop and grins, so in a rarity, I'm going to get the
7840200	7843440	PS3 version mainly so she can watch and enjoy the story.
7843440	7848400	For me, any game that causes a casual person to stop and take notice wins more in my book
7848400	7850680	than something that's designed for hardcore fans.
7850680	7853560	Again, another topic for another day.
7853560	7855600	Also why the PS3 over Xbox?
7855600	7859480	Besides control, the download content comes with it, instead of having to buy it.
7859480	7864960	Besides, it's very rare that a game does better on PS3 for me than the Xbox 360.
7864960	7868080	And to end it, her final thought after I turned off the demo sure beats Halo.
7868080	7869960	I think that sealed the deal.
7869960	7872840	Sometimes having the audience there while playing a game is more fun than playing it
7872840	7873840	alone.
7873840	7876800	Well, you won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.
7876800	7880360	Oh no, well, won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.
7880360	7882880	And that was from Mantis Knight.
7882880	7883880	That's another one of those games.
7883880	7887000	You know, it's funny because I brought up Beyond Good and Evil earlier in the show,
7887000	7890400	and it's one of those games like everybody played and loved, and I'm just now catching
7890400	7891400	up on it.
7891400	7893400	Yeah, put Mass Effect in that same bin.
7893400	7895200	It's funny.
7895200	7897360	Now, last email.
7897360	7899520	Hey, OLR gang.
7899520	7900800	ACHP here.
7900800	7904320	I know a lot of people who listen to this show probably want to work in games.
7904320	7905460	I know I do.
7905460	7907000	And I thought I'd share some advice.
7907000	7908540	Meet people who make games.
7908540	7912300	While not being able to afford a $1000 pass to get into a game developer's conference
7912300	7915560	this weekend, I was able to squeeze myself into some post-hours events.
7915560	7919120	And let me tell you, it is probably the best thing I have ever done for my professional
7919120	7920120	career.
7920120	7923320	You'd be surprised at how willing people are to chat and network with complete strangers
7923320	7925320	who don't even work in the industry.
7925320	7928720	At a random party for a company I've never heard of, I was able to meet the business
7928720	7933740	developer managers for Q Entertainment, met a guy who knew a guy who was there with a
7933740	7937660	recruiter who is now helping me find placement as an entry-level programmer.
7937660	7942780	So if you want to get your foot in the door and haven't booked a ticket for PAX, do it.
7942780	7948300	And if you have, go look up your favorite com- go look up if your favorite company is
7948300	7950760	doing any meet-and-greet type of activities.
7950760	7952520	You may be glad you did.
7952520	7954320	Hope this helps someone as DHP.
7954320	7955320	T.S.
7955320	7958680	Game developers are definitely the most socially awkward people ever.
7958680	7963000	With an open bar and go-go dancers on the tables, they are just idly chatting or playing
7963000	7964000	on their phone.
7964000	7965000	I lulled.
7965000	7966000	P.P.S.
7966000	7968960	I wrote this on my Android phone, again to prove that you can write grammatically correct
7968960	7971920	and properly spelled and punctuated words without a keyboard or autocorrect.
7971920	7972920	Cheers!
7972920	7975100	He said he'd be very patient.
7975100	7977000	But yeah, I agree.
7977000	7981600	Some of the best parts, at least about E3, which is one I was going to pretty regularly
7981600	7986820	for a while, some of the best part is networking.
7986820	7988880	So yeah, absolutely.
7988880	7992480	If you're going to be going to any of those shows, just don't be shy.
7992480	7993820	Just say hi to people.
7993820	7996800	You can tell when somebody doesn't want to talk to you or if you're bugging somebody
7996800	7998200	or what have you.
7998200	8002960	You know, but most of the times at these expos, people kind of, you know, they want to be
8002960	8003960	social.
8003960	8004960	They want to hang out.
8004960	8005960	They want to talk.
8005960	8006960	They're a game.
8006960	8008200	So, good email.
8008200	8009200	Was that it?
8009200	8010200	That was it?
8010200	8011200	Excuse me.
8011200	8012200	Chat.orangelouncerator.com.
8012200	8017200	If you want to chat, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelouncerator.com.
8017200	8019600	S.H.A. 100 Matt throws in our chat room.
8019600	8023640	There are a ton of networking panels at PAX East this year.
8023640	8027000	So coming up, I would like to know how the networking is at PAX East.
8027000	8031040	For those of you guys that are going, I want to know how you guys, you know, if you find
8031040	8032960	people or what you discover.
8032960	8033960	So let us know.
8033960	8038380	In the meantime, we need to stop being so nice talking about all this networking and
8038380	8039380	hand-holding and partying.
8039380	8057280	It's time to get angsty with the FUs of the week.
8057280	8062600	I would like to give a big fuck you to the Library of Congress, more specifically their
8062600	8070040	website in trying to help my client copyright his book.
8070040	8075260	It's not letting me do the regular copyright submission.
8075260	8080120	It wants me to do the pre-registration submission, which actually isn't even necessary to do.
8080120	8082400	Online registration is $35.
8082400	8083400	Pre-registration is $150.
8083400	8087600	Now, what do you think we want to do, especially since I've made sure that the book is fully
8087600	8089400	the way it needs to be?
8089400	8090400	Everything's ready.
8090400	8091400	We've got it publisher.
8091400	8095360	I mean, just frustrations.
8095360	8098200	So bite my butt, Library of Congress.
8098200	8099200	Loki?
8099200	8108160	FU to Dominic's New York pizza and Italian deli for not realizing that Philly cheesesteak
8108160	8114200	has cheese on it and giving me a sandwich that does not have cheese on it.
8114200	8115200	And it wasn't that great.
8115200	8117200	So I have to throw it away.
8117200	8121320	But yes, next time I will not be buying the Philly cheesesteak sandwich from you because
8121320	8130400	you have omitted cheese, although my wife does like the clam pizza.
8130400	8131400	Not my thing.
8131400	8140200	Alright, and my FU goes to those big Belgian waffles for being so yummy and delicious and
8140200	8141200	very fattening.
8141200	8144280	FU to food for making me fat.
8144280	8145280	That's my FU.
8145280	8150640	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8150640	8152120	username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.
8152120	8153440	We're not ready for that just yet.
8153440	8155400	We have a couple more stories for you.
8155400	8162320	Capcom would like to remind you that Street Fighter II has turned 20.
8162320	8166480	It's been 20 years since the game was released in arcades in 1991.
8166480	8174200	It's seen six arcade iterations and of course a ton of ports across consoles, PCs, and handhelds.
8174200	8177960	And definitely one of the top arcade games out there.
8177960	8183080	They are still assholes though for charging $5 for download content for Marvel vs. Capcom
8183080	8187280	3, I'd like to add.
8187280	8191680	But happy birthday, Street Fighter, and your 20 different iterations to go with those 20
8191680	8192680	years, right?
8192680	8196680	Pretty soon Street Fighter IV will have just as many.
8196680	8199600	Which is one of the more interesting launch games on the 3DS, might I add, a game that
8199600	8204600	I played, what, a year and a half ago, two years ago for the first time?
8204600	8208440	It's, it's, you know Dead or Alive is not a launch game anymore?
8208440	8213720	Yeah, no, I, it's a launch window game, I'm sorry, that's not a launch game, okay, a launch
8213720	8215640	game is a game that comes out day one.
8215640	8216960	That is a launch game.
8216960	8218920	I'd even give you a week or two after that.
8218920	8222580	A game that comes out two months after that is not a launch game.
8222580	8224520	That is a launch window game.
8224520	8227080	Well my launch window is four years after the console comes out.
8227080	8229000	It's a launch game.
8229000	8231100	That's Nintendo for ya, thanks.
8231100	8233640	Way to, way to spin that.
8233640	8237040	Oh, we don't have a lot of games on our system, but that's okay because we considered the
8237040	8239520	launch four years after it comes out.
8239520	8243000	Alright, Angry Loki, let's move on to another story.
8243000	8249240	This is about Steam and Steam possibly invading your television, that's right, here's a quote
8249240	8253580	from Doug Lombardi, the Vice President of Marketing for Valve from earlier this week
8253580	8256160	in preparation for Game Developers Conference.
8256160	8259760	Our partners and customers have asked us to make Steam available in more places.
8259760	8263280	With the introduction of Steam on the Mac and soon in Portal 2 on the Playstation 3,
8263280	8264600	we've done just that.
8264600	8268460	With big picture mode, gaming opportunities for Steam partners and customers become possible
8268460	8273920	via PCs and Macs on any TV or computer display in the house.
8273920	8279320	So it's not necessarily there's gonna be some type of like little hookup kit or something,
8279320	8284620	it's that they're talking about actually putting your PC games on the television, a big picture
8284620	8291000	mode and I guess a controller friendly version when you wanna play on your TV.
8291000	8293200	That's pretty cool.
8293200	8297520	More plans were announced to Game Developers Conference this past week.
8297520	8300240	But you know, I think a lot of you are just gonna wait and get Portal 2 on the consoles
8300240	8304000	if you're not gonna, if you don't already have it planned on the PC, not to disrespect
8304000	8307400	those that do their gaming on the PCs cause they'll certainly be a lot of people buying
8307400	8308400	it there.
8308400	8312880	Or I don't know, I gotta admit that Playstation 3 deal where you get it in both places looks
8312880	8313880	awesome.
8313880	8318120	And the whole where you buy Playstation 2, or absolutely, you buy Portal 2 on the Playstation
8318120	8322440	3 and then you get the Steam copy on PC for free, I think that's how you gotta do it.
8322440	8326040	Microsoft's gonna be hurting to sell copies of that.
8326040	8327040	We'll see.
8327040	8331440	Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype
8331440	8332440	is ORANGELAUNGERADIO.
8332440	8336240	The Skype line is open right now for you guys to give us a call.
8336240	8340880	While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
8340880	8345040	Uh, I don't know.
8345040	8346040	Maybe.
8346040	8347560	Um, let's see here.
8347560	8354200	I'm trying to think of what we haven't covered yet, other than my hatred for what Nintendo's
8354200	8360800	doing with the 3DS.
8360800	8364240	There was some new hackers, well not really hacker, but stuff that's going on with the
8364240	8366680	whole George Hotch thing and being sued.
8366680	8375160	Apparently there's some drama over the third party company that Sony, or I should say the
8375160	8379760	law office, the court has going through his hard drives.
8379760	8384840	Apparently Sony's trying to get a copy of the hard drive for themselves, even though
8384840	8389720	third party's supposed to be the only ones looking at the hard drive basically, but Sony
8389720	8393720	wants to know what's on there and possibly the steal information it sounds like, or maybe
8393720	8395920	manipulating the system a little bit.
8395920	8399000	So people are kind of up in arms about that.
8399000	8402000	I don't know.
8402000	8403400	This is kind of interesting also.
8403400	8409880	The NGP, I guess the games of course, they're coming on kind of a cartridge or memory card
8409880	8411120	type device.
8411120	8418880	They're going to be coming on 2 and 4 gigabyte cards with room for game saves and patches
8418880	8423560	because the actual system will not have any on board storage, or at least that's what
8423560	8424800	the thought is.
8424800	8427680	Is that kind of one of the ways they're trying to get around all the hacking?
8427680	8432440	I don't think it's going to work because the way I'm thinking it now, what are you going
8432440	8435300	to save your downloaded games to then?
8435300	8440200	Because obviously they're going to have some sort of online market or something like that,
8440200	8444120	and I know it has a second memory card slot for stuff like that.
8444120	8454000	So it might be a way to get around it, but it didn't work for the Nintendo DS.
8454000	8458580	Are they trying to do it maybe because it's a non-standard format or something?
8458580	8465120	Maybe just to make it easy, but I'm sure it's got to be some sort of...
8465120	8469280	It's partly probably anti-piracy.
8469280	8470280	And then...
8470280	8475860	Again, the phone number 1877-GAMELR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8475860	8478740	If you want to get through tonight, I would advise calling now because the way these things
8478740	8482840	go is I say the number like 20 times and nobody ever calls, and then suddenly, just at the
8482840	8485240	last minute, everybody calls at once.
8485240	8489000	And then I say, well, we've taken enough calls, so I'm just saying.
8489000	8490120	Get in early.
8490120	8498980	Microsoft has gone the route of Spore, where you can basically take your avatars now.
8498980	8504920	You can create poses or whatever with them, and then you can get jumbo wall prints of
8504920	8505920	your avatar.
8505920	8511020	If you want to put yourself up on the wall, you can get a 16 gigabyte zoom with your avatar
8511020	8516200	on it etched in, or a $60 figurine of your avatar.
8516200	8520960	And of course, the wall print's gonna cost you $150, so that better be damn big, and
8520960	8524360	the zoom will cost you $170 with the figurine, $60.
8524360	8529520	So that'd be kind of neat to have at my desk.
8529520	8530520	Not the wall print.
8530520	8531520	That's retarded.
8531520	8533520	That's gonna cost you a bit of money, though, isn't it?
8533520	8535360	Yeah, I'd probably wait.
8535360	8539000	But I'd want to see what these things look like in the size, because I'm not gonna pay
8539000	8542400	$60 for, like, a three inch, you know, statue.
8542400	8543400	Better be something pretty significant.
8543400	8545400	Alright, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.
8545400	8546400	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8546400	8547400	Who's this?
8547400	8548400	Hi, this is Bazzinator.
8548400	8549400	Hey, Spazzinator.
8549400	8550400	What's on your mind, buddy?
8550400	8557680	Uh, yeah, I'm just calling in about the whole home thing that you were mentioning earlier.
8557680	8562080	Yeah, about the whole upgrades in home, where they're gonna have more built-in stuff.
8562080	8563080	What do you think of all that?
8563080	8573120	Well, I'm probably in the minority here in this, but my whole opinion kind of goes along
8573120	8574960	the lines of, who cares?
8574960	8582080	I mean, you know, you kind of sort of touched on it a little bit to a degree, but when you
8582080	8586760	said, you know, when are they gonna do anything with the club houses?
8586760	8587760	Yeah.
8587760	8594720	I mean, you know, there's so much they could be doing with home to make it a little bit
8594720	8595720	more interesting.
8595720	8602920	Like, if you look right and well, it's kind of hard to, you know, talk about something
8602920	8607520	unless you're really looking at it, but you know how the one wall behind the stage is
8607520	8612160	supposed to be, like, a video screen in the clubhouse?
8612160	8613160	Yeah.
8613160	8619960	Like, they could be doing something with the video screen, like, you guys could be showing
8619960	8625360	off some of the videos that you guys have made for Orange Lounge.
8625360	8629400	I will tell you this much, the minute that Sony allows us to put some type of video on
8629400	8635320	that monitor, I'll do something exclusive video content-wise that won't even be on YouTube.
8635320	8637880	We will only put it in Sony Home.
8637880	8639480	But I'm not gonna hold my breath.
8639480	8643280	My camera is still in a box, because I don't see that happening.
8643280	8650400	Yeah, you could, you know, there's always that, and also, you know, with our own private
8650400	8657280	spaces, you know, whether it be the log cabin space or the default one, whatever you happen
8657280	8665520	to have, you know, they could sell, like, virtual jukeboxes and virtual TVs.
8665520	8673240	They'll allow you to stream all the MP3s that you got on your PS3's hard drive, or the video
8673240	8679080	content that you had filed through the video servers, or what have you.
8679080	8683320	Although I'm with you to a point here, Spaznator, I gotta ask this question, I gotta play Devil's
8683320	8685520	Advocate and ask this question.
8685520	8691860	Since the PlayStation 3 is a gaming system, why not have enhancements to the gaming mechanisms
8691860	8695600	within Home and making the gaming within Home better?
8695600	8699120	Well, there's that too.
8699120	8709080	I can certainly see your point, but, you know, perhaps Bobby Blackwood likes and loves to
8709080	8718800	point out from time to time, I'm really heavily into the whole PlayStation 3, more so than
8718800	8719800	my 360.
8719800	8720800	No!
8720800	8727160	Your 360 handle, I'm not gonna give away your 360 handle, but it has PSN in it, and that
8727160	8730720	always cracks me up that PSN is in your 360 handle.
8730720	8736360	Yeah, well, my point being, you know, you would think, you know, with that being said,
8736360	8743560	you know, I would be all over Home, like, here on the gorilla, but the thing is, I really
8743560	8747000	haven't touched Home in, God knows how long.
8747000	8754080	And the last time I even bothered with Home the last time is because someone in the All
8754080	8761140	Games community said the invite to join them in Home, and that was about that.
8761140	8764080	There's nothing to do in there but dance with furries right now.
8764080	8768740	But hopefully Sodium 2 will bring people back, if not at least for a day, while everybody's
8768740	8771520	curious and checks it out, right?
8771520	8777160	Yeah, but, you know, if they implemented some of the ideas that I'd just thrown out, you
8777160	8780640	know, I would be using Home left and right, you know.
8780640	8786280	But, you know, until then, you know, the only reason I would even consider using it is I
8786280	8791840	would have to be bored out of my mind, like borderline comatose bored, you know?
8791840	8795120	Well, maybe you need to go to Game Developers Conference and tell them your ideas, I don't
8795120	8796120	know.
8796120	8797120	All right.
8797120	8798120	Well, as far as they are, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so
8798120	8799120	much for the call, buddy.
8799120	8800120	Take care.
8800120	8801120	Yeah, sure, have a good one.
8801120	8802120	All right.
8802120	8804800	One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
8804800	8808560	By the way, screen filled up with phone calls while Spaz was on the line.
8808560	8809560	What did I tell you?
8809560	8810920	What did I tell you?
8810920	8813680	The minute one person tries to call, then everybody's gonna try to call.
8813680	8814680	So there you go.
8814680	8815680	It is open now.
8815680	8816680	We'll see if somebody gets through.
8816680	8820040	One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
8820040	8821720	Any other last minute stories that we have?
8821720	8824760	Logie's looking for stuff for after the show, so I don't know.
8824760	8825760	I guess, is that it?
8825760	8826760	You done?
8826760	8827760	No, I've got stuff.
8827760	8828760	Oh, okay.
8828760	8835160	O-L-A is becoming a game that's gonna be downloadable on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
8835160	8840200	Being developed by Konami, so, you know, I guess that's needed.
8840200	8841200	I don't know.
8841200	8842280	It's a movie game.
8842280	8843280	So what do you expect?
8843280	8844280	Hopefully that'll be coming out soon.
8844280	8845280	Oh, next month.
8845280	8846280	Yeah.
8846280	8852080	It's right in time for the movie, I guess, considering it comes out like in a week.
8852080	8855880	It is being developed by the people that did Time Shift, Saber Interactive.
8855880	8858200	Yay, we got more calls coming in.
8858200	8859200	Yay.
8859200	8860200	Let's go to the phones.
8860200	8861200	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8861200	8862200	Who's this?
8862200	8863200	Hey, it's Ron.
8863200	8864200	How are you guys doing tonight?
8864200	8868320	Of course, because when I say, you know, get through now, you know how to get through the
8868320	8869920	system and beat everybody else.
8869920	8872760	It's, it's, I don't know, you've got some type of psychic prowess.
8872760	8874120	I don't know what it is.
8874120	8876560	It's a blessing and a curse.
8876560	8878560	It's a blessing for you, a curse for us.
8878560	8879560	No, I'm kidding.
8879560	8880560	Funny.
8880560	8881560	All right.
8881560	8884120	First thing, I just wanna say, Logie, welcome back.
8884120	8885840	I'm glad you're feeling much better.
8885840	8886840	Thank you.
8886840	8887840	You got it.
8887840	8888840	Thank you.
8888840	8893080	But don't ever talk like that in the opening of the show ever again, am I right?
8893080	8894080	Maybe.
8894080	8895080	Just kidding.
8895080	8896080	Yeah.
8896080	8902200	In regards to what Logie said about the re-release of Mario All-Stars for the Wii, this is not
8902200	8905720	the first time Nintendo has pulled something like this.
8905720	8906720	Yeah.
8906720	8907720	Oh, yeah.
8907720	8914000	I'm just reminded of when DDO Mario Mix came out and everyone went nuts and bought it and
8914000	8919480	then you found out, oh, we're no longer making copies of this game, and I remember my friends
8919480	8928040	going on eBay, spending up to 80 to 100 bucks for the game, the special dance pad, and both.
8928040	8934680	I do remember that, oh yeah, those were selling for crazy money for a while, and then, what
8934680	8935680	happened?
8935680	8936680	Reprint.
8936680	8939240	Hey, even more recent than that, the Wii system.
8939240	8946600	Everyone was like, oh, hey, we can't make enough of these, they're just so hard to put
8946600	8951000	together, such advanced technology that's been around since the GameCube, how do we
8951000	8952000	do it?
8952000	8953000	Yeah.
8953000	8957440	Yeah, like I'm supposed to believe there was a shortage on those that wasn't on purpose.
8957440	8962320	Sure, whatever you say, Nintendo, I'll believe you.
8962320	8966560	Oh, God.
8966560	8970040	So what do you think about the 3DS?
8970040	8976520	I really want one, but to be perfectly honest, I think I'm going to do what SSJ100Matt said.
8976520	8977760	Wait a while.
8977760	8978760	Just see.
8978760	8979760	Yeah.
8979760	8980760	That's good advice.
8980760	8982800	You know, you asking about all this Nintendo stuff, though, reminded me.
8982800	8987000	I had a big question I was going to ask Loki in part A when we were doing all the 3DS stories.
8987000	8991400	He was so ranty, I got completely sidetracked, so I'm going to ask it now with you on the
8991400	8992400	line, Robin.
8992400	8994040	He's just making it for last week, so yeah.
8994040	8995040	I know, I know.
8995040	8996040	He's got to do double duty this week.
8996040	8998080	No, I want to ask this question, because this is a serious question.
8998080	9003440	This is one I was talking the other day with some people about is, what's the Wii going
9003440	9005120	to give us this year?
9005120	9012000	Like, Nintendo at E3 this year, we know they're going to announce a Mario game for 3DS, duh.
9012000	9015680	We know they'll be talking about the other 3DS titles throughout Christmas.
9015680	9017560	What have they got going on the Wii right now?
9017560	9019280	Skyward Sword, that's about it.
9019280	9022840	And they're dragging that shit out as long as possible.
9022840	9028920	Is it possible, not to sound fanboy-esque here, but is it possible that Zelda was pushed
9028920	9032560	back because this is the year they're going to announce a Wii HD?
9032560	9033560	No.
9033560	9035760	And not a Wii 2, but a Wii HD.
9035760	9041520	No, this is exactly what happened to the last Metroid Other M. You know, they announced
9041520	9045120	it way too damn early, it gets delayed forever.
9045120	9048640	It's just like the Metroid Prime trilogy.
9048640	9054440	They're just pushing shit back longer and longer, and they keep announcing stuff well
9054440	9059960	and too much in advance, just so they have something to fill up their E3 press conference
9059960	9060960	with.
9060960	9064320	Because, I mean seriously, if they cut out all the stuff that's supposed to be coming
9064320	9070520	out this year, I mean, well they announced Skyward Sword, and that was a big part of
9070520	9071520	their thing.
9071520	9075320	And I bet you right now it's going to be a big part of their press conference, you know,
9075320	9076320	coming soon.
9076320	9079600	Either there'll be a Just Dance 3, that they can always, you know, have.
9079600	9080600	Exactly.
9080600	9086240	I mean, that's just a no-brainer, but from Nintendo themselves, I would assume a new
9086240	9093880	Pikmin game, which is great for people that like it, but honestly, I could, I don't care.
9093880	9094880	It's not a game I'm interested in.
9094880	9096880	It's different to play a whole lot of Pikmin.
9096880	9099080	I think so.
9099080	9102980	I don't know, there's a part of me that feels like now is the time for Nintendo to come
9102980	9108400	out and say, and maybe, it's gotta be next year, if not this year, it's got to be next
9108400	9109400	year.
9109400	9110800	Because the 3DS will be standard by then.
9110800	9113920	And they've gotta come out and say, okay, here's the next Wii.
9113920	9118600	But I don't think it would be the Wii 2, so much as it would be comparing the DS to the
9118600	9119600	DS Lite.
9119600	9122280	If it's the Wii 2, is it the Wii Wii?
9122280	9123520	Shut up.
9123520	9131560	I would think if they're going to release an HD system like that, then what they're
9131560	9136920	going to have to do is do something more along the lines of the DS and the DSi, where it
9136920	9141840	plays the old Wii games, it plays the GameCube games, but it also plays these new HD Wii
9141840	9142840	games.
9142840	9143840	And why wouldn't it?
9143840	9148760	I mean, because one thing that Nintendo has done pretty well is the whole, I guess really
9148760	9153960	it's only been on the one series of games, backwards compatibility, with the Wii, every
9153960	9155680	GameCube game is playable on the Wii.
9155680	9158400	Well, I mean, for the portable systems, it's been pretty good.
9158400	9159400	That's true.
9159400	9163680	It's had the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that, and Game Boy Advance had the Game Boy.
9163680	9167360	When you were doing cartridge formats, you kind of couldn't, so I get that.
9167360	9171480	But you know, you get the sense that if there is going to be a Wii HD or whatever, a Wii
9171480	9176440	D, I like that, there's going to be a Wii, then it's got to be backwards compatible with
9176440	9179200	everything else from GameCube on up.
9179200	9182400	But I mean, it's an interesting idea as that sounds.
9182400	9183800	I don't think they're going to do it.
9183800	9184800	Why?
9184800	9188120	Because they feel that graphics aren't really an issue for people.
9188120	9193840	It's all about gameplay, and that's why they're not going to embrace that type of mentality.
9193840	9198080	Because why should they put out a new console that has better graphics on it?
9198080	9200080	People don't care.
9200080	9203480	According to them, people don't care, and really, they're just going to be releasing
9203480	9204840	quality games.
9204840	9207720	Same reason with the whole online argument.
9207720	9208720	They don't care.
9208720	9210060	People don't care about online.
9210060	9212960	They just want to play family games and party games.
9212960	9214200	That's what the Wii's for.
9214200	9216320	It's for families and stuff like that.
9216320	9221480	Well, once again, the Wii was supposed to be something that was, hey, we're going to
9221480	9226240	break the mold and make it so that the system isn't just for kids and stuff, it's for everybody,
9226240	9227240	but they didn't.
9227240	9229440	Sorry, I'm laughing about this in our chat room.
9229440	9232760	Spazinator says, Wii 2 would be Wii-Nii in Japanese.
9232760	9233760	Haha, Wii-Nii.
9233760	9234760	Get it?
9234760	9237720	That name will never get old.
9237720	9239160	Alright, fine.
9239160	9240160	You make a good point.
9240160	9242640	Maybe this will be the year we finally fucking get F-Zero on the Wii.
9242640	9243640	How about that?
9243640	9244640	No, not going to happen.
9244640	9245640	Why not?
9245640	9246640	You're ruining everything.
9246640	9250080	No, you have to understand, what you're going to get is you're going to get New Super Mario
9250080	9251080	Brothers 2.
9251080	9252080	No!
9252080	9253080	It's just going to have some different levels and stuff.
9253080	9254080	What goddamn F-Zero game?
9254080	9259400	Wait, I can go for New Super Mario Brothers 2, but if Nintendo re-releases Super Mario
9259400	9263480	Brothers 64 for the 3DS, I will nerd rage.
9263480	9270280	I'm telling you, look, despite all the hatred, all the vicious, vile hatred that Loki's been
9270280	9275080	throwing out of Nintendo this entire show, I am telling you, if Reggie comes out at E3
9275080	9281440	and announces the Wii HD with F-Zero as a launch title, I will jump on stage and do
9281440	9282440	something very naughty.
9282440	9283440	I would not buy it.
9283440	9284440	He's going to snog him.
9284440	9285440	No, I'm sorry.
9285440	9286440	I would not buy it.
9286440	9287440	He's still kissing one of the lips.
9287440	9292560	I have a Wii that's gathering dust because I don't play it, and there's nothing I want
9292560	9293560	to play on it.
9293560	9294560	We loaned our Wii out.
9294560	9299200	I mean, I could play New Super Mario Brothers on it, or Mario Galaxy 2 or something like
9299200	9302600	that, but I haven't even finished Galaxy, so I don't know why I'd want to play Mario
9302600	9304600	Galaxy 2.
9304600	9305600	It doesn't interest me.
9305600	9309100	The only thing that interests me, and this is going back to, once again, what they could
9309100	9312960	have done right with Mario Kart, is the modded tracks for Mario Kart, because that sounds
9312960	9313960	interesting.
9313960	9314960	Ooh, new tracks for Mario Kart.
9314960	9316680	I can go play that game again.
9316680	9318800	Hell, what's to stop them?
9318800	9321720	Seriously, what is to stop them, other than the fact that they probably didn't program
9321720	9326960	DLC into Mario Kart, but let's just imagine a world where they are forward thinking and
9326960	9328340	actually did that.
9328340	9330000	What's to stop them from saying, hey, you know what?
9330000	9333640	Instead of putting out a new Mario Kart game, we're just going to have this $10 expansion
9333640	9336620	that's going to add 16 new tracks to the game.
9336620	9338040	People would be damn excited about that.
9338040	9339040	That would be awesome.
9339040	9342040	But they're not going to do that.
9342040	9347080	This is such a forward thinking company that they're like, oh, patches to games, we don't
9347080	9348080	need that.
9348080	9349080	Games are perfect when they come out.
9349080	9350960	There's never going to be glitches that we'll need to fix.
9350960	9354720	No, let's not even bother putting a system in there for that.
9354720	9358920	Did you hear that David Jaffa, completely random tangent, did you hear that David Jaffa
9358920	9363540	was out there at a game developers conference, and I was reading some article about he said
9363540	9369720	that companies should be limited to only three patches in a calendar year and they should
9369720	9373760	not be allowed to patch a game until at least six weeks after release.
9373760	9377480	No, because you know what all that's going to do is that's just going to leave a broken
9377480	9378480	game for longer.
9378480	9379480	I know what he's thinking.
9379480	9384120	He's thinking, oh, if we limit them to this, then they have to make sure the game is working
9384120	9385360	and spend extra time.
9385360	9386520	No, they don't give a shit.
9386520	9389120	They'll just wait longer for it to be fixed.
9389120	9390120	That's all that's going to create.
9390120	9393960	And he should shut the hell up and just make his Twisted Metal and God of Wars and be done
9393960	9398200	with it because his crappy Calling All Cars game was terrible.
9398200	9400960	And he talks too much, and he's seriously annoying.
9400960	9403840	Damn, Loki, why don't you switch to decaf?
9403840	9404840	He complained.
9404840	9405840	He's like, I made God of War!
9405840	9406840	I know everything!
9406840	9408600	Oh, I made Twisted Metal!
9408600	9410680	You know, he's a dumbass.
9410680	9415080	He's just like Cliffy B and fucking, you know, or actually it wasn't even him, it was Mark
9415080	9420160	Rain with Epic Games, you know, said, oh, you know, he was saying, like, the Wii's terrible.
9420160	9422800	And all of a sudden, oh, hey, you know, maybe we should develop games for the Wii because
9422800	9423800	it's popular!
9423800	9427280	I mean, so wishy-washy.
9427280	9432040	But no, seriously, that's a dumb idea with limiting people to patches and stuff like
9432040	9433040	that.
9433040	9438560	I think even some companies, I want to say, it's either Microsoft or Sony charges companies
9438560	9441600	for putting out patches or title updates for their games.
9441600	9444040	I want to say, probably Microsoft that does that.
9444040	9446800	They'd like them to put out.
9446800	9451800	So I don't know, I just don't think it's a good idea.
9451800	9457040	What they should do, though, is if games are buggy, they should have some sort of, I don't
9457040	9461180	know, penalize the developer somehow for putting out buggy games.
9461180	9464080	They have to figure out a system to do that.
9464080	9466160	Make it more expensive to patch?
9466160	9468780	No, because once again, it just leaves broken games.
9468780	9471840	Because look at Activision, like, you know, Black Ops and stuff like that.
9471840	9475960	There's a lot of stuff that's just broken with that game, and it took them forever to
9475960	9478400	patch that stuff.
9478400	9479400	It's just...
9479400	9482320	A lot of times you just don't care.
9482320	9486360	They don't care because their game's selling like crazy, and so what if it's buggy or you
9486360	9487360	bought the game?
9487360	9488840	They already have the money from you.
9488840	9493860	And in all sense, actually, they already had the money from you before you even bought
9493860	9497340	the game because somebody's got to buy the game to put the game in the store.
9497340	9501760	So unless you're buying it directly from them, they have your money already.
9501760	9503240	They have the game store's money.
9503240	9507040	Well, Rama, thanks for sitting on the line while Loki bitches.
9507040	9508040	Appreciate it.
9508040	9512360	I'm glad to do my dutiful duty as a proud member of the O.L. Army.
9512360	9514840	There's going to be so much Nintendo fanboy hate mail this week.
9514840	9515840	I can't wait.
9515840	9516840	All right.
9516840	9520040	Well, Rama, thank you, as always, for your call.
9520040	9522040	Have a good one, buddy.
9522040	9523040	Later.
9523040	9524040	Too bad Loki took up all your time.
9524040	9526040	All right.
9526040	9527040	I'm kidding.
9527040	9528200	You know what?
9528200	9531540	I've had friends tell me the best part of the show is when Loki gets mad at something.
9531540	9532880	Well, no.
9532880	9533880	It's just annoying.
9533880	9536240	It's just honesty.
9536240	9539720	It's just how it is.
9539720	9542560	Game companies now, they know that they don't have to put out a perfect game.
9542560	9544200	They can just release it buggy.
9544200	9548480	They get a few more sales out there because they don't have to wait for development.
9548480	9553560	Then they patch it later on when they let people basically test it out.
9553560	9558360	Why should they hire beta testers when they can go ahead and have the public test it out
9558360	9561120	and they figure out what all the bugs are, read their forms or whatever.
9561120	9566280	Go fix those bugs and then let it percolate a little bit more and see if there's any other
9566280	9568240	bugs.
9568240	9570280	It will save them a little bit of money on the back end.
9570280	9577200	Maybe they, for example, the developers or whatever of these games, have deadlines with
9577200	9581840	their publishers and publishers will pay them bonuses if they hit their deadlines.
9581840	9585320	Why would they wait extra time to polish a game when they can just release it?
9585320	9588840	It still sells a lot and they get their extra bonus.
9588840	9590680	That's how the game industry works.
9590680	9597880	Fortunately since now these games can be patched on the fly, there's less focus on putting
9597880	9601640	out a game that's not buggy from the beginning.
9601640	9603520	Alright well that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
9603520	9605200	Thanks to those of you guys that got through.
9605200	9607440	To those who didn't get through, call sooner next time.
9607440	9610360	Probably could have fit in another call or two if we had some sooner.
9610360	9612440	Alright but for now we're going to go ahead and close the Skypline.
9612440	9615720	If you do want to elaborate on some thoughts though or you want to respond to Loki, mailbag
9615720	9618920	at orangehonestreader.com is a great place to do it or on our Twitter at twitter.com
9618920	9619920	slash o-l-r.
9619920	9623360	But for now it's going to be about 9 o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast.
9623360	9626720	It's probably about time we start to wrap up the show with some final thoughts.
9626720	9627840	Let me check in real quick.
9627840	9634280	Any other last minute stories we want to throw in before we wrap up the show?
9634280	9635280	Let's see here.
9635280	9636960	I don't think so.
9636960	9640720	We'll have a lot of fun stuff coming from PAX East and I expect those of you guys that
9640720	9643880	are at PAX East next week, I want phone calls.
9643880	9644880	This is kind of neat I guess.
9644880	9648760	Infamous 2 is going to let you create your own missions.
9648760	9651680	There's something, you know, it doesn't even have to be a Mario Kart type game.
9651680	9656080	You can just have a game where you just create your own levels and stuff and people eat that
9656080	9657920	shit up now.
9657920	9659960	That's what the trend is nowadays.
9659960	9660960	That play, share, create.
9660960	9661960	Sony gets it.
9661960	9662960	Somewhat.
9662960	9663960	Home sucks.
9663960	9667600	But you can't be right all the time.
9667600	9668760	Alright.
9668760	9670440	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9670440	9671440	I'm getting worried.
9671440	9673360	Loki might need to get some eyeball here pretty soon.
9673360	9675680	No, I'm just giving you a hard time.
9675680	9676680	Just menstruating.
9676680	9678680	Alright, he's menstruating all over the place.
9678680	9679680	I'm just...
9679680	9680680	Copyright.
9680680	9681680	Oh, I'm sorry.
9681680	9682680	One more last thing.
9682680	9683680	Oh please!
9683680	9684680	By all means.
9684680	9685680	And this is just a rumor I guess.
9685680	9687880	It's a rumor that Strider and Frank West are coming as download content.
9687880	9689520	Those will be $5 each too!
9689520	9690520	Thank you Capcom.
9690520	9693240	I will pay $5 for Strider Hear You.
9693240	9694240	I know, I was like...
9694240	9695240	Is this with Dan and the other room?
9695240	9699880	I was like, the minute that word Strider left your mouth, I'm like, oh, Jamie and Dan will
9699880	9700880	get it.
9700880	9701880	No questions.
9701880	9704200	I really want to play the old Strider NES game.
9704200	9707120	I know you guys don't like it as much as the Genesis one, but I fondly remember...
9707120	9708520	The Genesis one's authentic.
9708520	9710840	I fondly remember the NES one from my childhood.
9710840	9711840	I really want to play that again.
9711840	9712840	It's been a long time.
9712840	9715680	You should come over some time and play through Strider 2 with us.
9715680	9716680	On the Genesis?
9716680	9717680	No, no, no, no.
9717680	9718680	The PS...
9718680	9719680	Oh!
9719680	9720680	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
9720680	9721680	Oh god.
9721680	9722680	It's such a fun game.
9722680	9723880	It's super easy, but it's lots of fun.
9723880	9724880	Fun is what's important.
9724880	9725880	Alright, Loki.
9725880	9726880	Anything else?
9726880	9727880	That's it.
9727880	9728880	You sure?
9728880	9729880	I'm done.
9729880	9730880	Alright.
9730880	9731880	Do you need some, you know, Allways or something?
9731880	9732880	Alright.
9732880	9733880	Anyhow.
9733880	9737880	Let's go ahead and wrap up the show tonight by going around in Garibay's final thoughts.
9737880	9738880	Dark Sakura.
9738880	9743800	I'm sure glad Loki's back after a C-section.
9743800	9746120	My final thought tonight is...
9746120	9747120	Ow.
9747120	9749000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9749000	9750000	Uh...
9750000	9751960	I don't know.
9751960	9755720	I thought with a week being off I'd be able to get more done with the Grand Theft Auto
9755720	9759520	stuff, but some things just take time, I guess, when it comes to modding this stuff.
9759520	9763320	And also, I will still be angry at Nintendo because they just continue to disappoint.
9763320	9764320	I can't help it.
9764320	9768960	If you make stupid decisions, I'm just gonna call you out on it.
9768960	9769960	Alright.
9769960	9772360	We'll have plenty more next week on the show.
9772360	9774800	Dark Sakura, sadly not joining us next week.
9774800	9775800	I won't be sad, though.
9775800	9779240	But we, I know you won't, but we will be back with another edition of Orange Launch Radio.
9779240	9780240	I don't know if we'll have a...
9780240	9781240	I'll call in from the road.
9781240	9783520	I don't know if we'll have a temp co-host or what we'll do.
9783520	9784520	You have to call me.
9784520	9785520	Uh...
9785520	9786520	What's that?
9786520	9787520	You have to call me.
9787520	9788520	We can.
9788520	9789520	Yeah.
9789520	9790520	So...
9790520	9791520	On the road.
9791520	9792520	Yep.
9792520	9793520	That's it.
9793520	9796840	We'll do this all again next week, but in the meantime, that's another week of Orange
9796840	9797840	Launch Radio.
9797840	9800800	Remember, of course, if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, we are
9800800	9804240	not a gigantic website with millions of hits.
9804240	9808000	We don't have a magazine that backs us or a gaming company that backs us.
9808000	9810640	We don't throw a bunch of commercials in your face.
9810640	9814640	So all we ask, if you enjoy Orange Launch Radio, tell some friends about the show.
9814640	9818160	The example at the start of the show where a friend was playing it at his LAN party,
9818160	9821240	perfect example, is an awesome A-plus move.
9821240	9822920	So just tell people about the show.
9822920	9824880	Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.
9824880	9828760	Get us some more voices to bring to the table here at the show.
9828760	9831360	Don't send DarkSakura a dollar.
9831360	9834600	But come back next week for more of Orange Launch Radio.
9834600	9838560	You've been listening to Orange Launch Radio.
9838560	9842280	Orange Launch Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
9842280	9850920	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific time.
9850920	9856280	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Launch Radio do not necessarily reflect those
9856280	9862240	of the entire staff of Orange Launch Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right
9862240	9863240	anyway.
9863240	9881920	See you next week!
