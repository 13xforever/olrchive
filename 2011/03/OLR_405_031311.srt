00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's the host?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dark Sakura

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sky and Loki

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, March 13th, 2011

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Microsoft shatters sales records

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
EA bans a player from Dragon Age 2 unintentionally

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And despite what's happened to Guitar Hero, could Dance Hero be a reality?

Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the show where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at AllGames.com

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
www.AllGames.com

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Not here tonight, sadly

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
She is out of town, don't feel too bad for her though

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
She's on her way to Disneyland

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, you know, how can you feel sorry for her when she's going to the happiest freaking place on earth

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And we're stuck here doing the show in her place

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh well

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Anyhow, so she might be joining us a little later for a call, we'll see

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But joining us here, as always, say hello at least to tech master, Loki is here

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes I am

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, how you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm doing great

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Awesome, good to hear it

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Everything going well with the baby and all that good stuff?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Good, good

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, and joining us tonight, since unfortunately Dark Sakura is not here

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We do have a third host sitting in the studio with us

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And he hasn't been on the show in quite some time

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But say hello everybody to Matt2

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well hello Rob number one

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How are you doing Matt2?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm doing well yourself

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm pretty good, I feel like we just had this conversation

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It seems like deja vu, but you know, we're not in the matrix or anything so it can't be

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, for the podcast listeners, this is take two of the live show because we had a little screw up

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But just pretend I didn't ask you these questions just five minutes ago

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Anyhow, Matt2 hasn't been here in about two years and five studios ago

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, we've had like five studios throughout all of OLR

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You were in the last one that we did

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So it's been a little while

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But some of the folks that listen to Hoard House, my Warcraft show, might know you as Grandpa Warcraft

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, that's right, I am the Deckard Cain of your show

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, so what types of video games do you play?

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just tell us, I'll ask you about your gaming weekend a little bit

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But generally, what types of video games do you like to play? What consoles do you own?

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's mainly MMOs for the moment and a lot of iOS games

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm playing a lot of games on the iPhone 4 and soon my iPad 2 if it ever gets here

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But I own a 360 and I'm still debating on whether getting a Kinect

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But my console history goes way back to Atari 5200 and every NES system

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And then made the transition to PC games when games like Descent and Duke Nukem 3D were uber back in the day

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So is that really where you like to game the most, just PC?

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It kind of fell into PC. I got the 360 because of Halo

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was definitely a fan of the Halo series until recently

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And other first-person shooters

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, you say that a little stinging like, I did not like a certain Halo game that really ruined it for me

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is that what's going on?

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, I bought Reach and I beat it on hard, not legendary, within the first few hours

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I went, oh, this is going to be focusing on the multiplayer side, isn't it?

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And sure enough it does

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Which I'm an okay fan of

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I do like a lot of story

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And I was really disappointed in how quick the first person went through

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But, you know, there's other first-person shooters out there, Call of Duty, Gears of War, things like that

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But for the time being it's 360, debating on the Kinect

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And a lot of Warcraft on the PC and iOS 4 games

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You do anything else on the PC besides Warcraft?

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not as of recent, I tried Star Trek Online

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Jamie Summers convinced me to give it a try

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
As a huge, huge, huge Trekkie

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All your WoW characters are named after Star Trek characters

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They used to be

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I thought you had one named like, B'Elanna

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I'm like, I know who that is

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was the other guy that watched Voyager

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When I first started Warcraft, all my characters were named after obscure Star Trek characters

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Not Picard and Riker, because that's just too pretentious

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And those names are taken in five minutes

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, I'm sure they are

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I went Neelix, Kes, B'Elanna, Darmok

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you remember the Darmok

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Who liked Kes?

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I never leveled her up

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She's a rogue sitting there collecting dust, obviously

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And now they're all Latin names

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because now I'm Alliance

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And it's much more formal on that side of the...

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ho ho

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, exactly

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PC games-wise, Fable, I played a lot of Fable back in the day

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Awesome

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And stuff like that

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright, so it sounds like you've played quite a variety of different things

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I try to

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you do the iOS stuff now?

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's where gaming seems to be going in some ways

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I do

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
At least it's casual

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I confess I downloaded Angry Birds Seasons today

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Because I figured it's appropriate

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's St. Patrick's Day on Thursday

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They play Irish music in the background

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And there's shamrocks everywhere

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And pots of gold if you hit, you get bonus points

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So yeah, that's my new diction

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I did download, reluctantly, or regretfully, Mega Man 2

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And it doesn't work when you don't have an actual tactile controller

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't get me started

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I know, and I listened to your podcast about it and it made sense

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I love Mega Man

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a huge, huge favorite series of mine

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I wanted to get it because I'm a supporter

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I can't even get through the air stage because I can't

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When they play the buttons, so

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, they have those little things, like stickers that you can put on your iPad

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or, you know, iPods or whatever

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
To create tactile controls for the touchpad stuff

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I might invest in that with my iPad 2

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because little buttons like on my phone and you gotta take them off and put them back on

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They actually have some pretty sweet ones

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's ones that were through, like, ThinkGeek or whatever

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They had actual, looks like an arcade joystick that plugs on there

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which is kind of cool

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then they had some that just kind of stick to the side suction cup wise

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But apparently they're pretty decent

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I mean, but really they just need to come out with something better

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So yeah, when it comes to the iPhone 4

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And what my iPhone 4 and iOS games is kind of my main focus right now

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not on WoW or the PC games

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They're good bathroom games

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I find the, like, Cut the Rope is a great potty game, actually

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For cutting the rope?

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For pinching the loaf?

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Wow

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Out on the ice tour coming soon

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Anyhow, speaking of St. Patrick's Day, since you brought up St. Patrick's Day

145
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You were kind enough

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I like this, when we invite you to the show you do bribe us a little bit

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well, yeah

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I brought this gigantic beer in a green, like, can thing

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It is green, I didn't think of that

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's imported from Canadian

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I love Canadian

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I know, yeah, we love Canadian

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
America's hat

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
America's big, liberal, loving hat

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's America's suburb

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anyhow, no, obviously I'm just giving them a hard time

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But, so I'm gonna drink this beer

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Since you drove tonight, I can drink a beer

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's right

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm gonna get drunk in Jamie's house when she's not here

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yay!

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I brought her for Loki

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then I'm gonna go pass out in the vault

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I brought her for Loki

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, but I have to drive and I don't like beer, so, sorry

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, anyway, let's start the celebrating a little early

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There you go

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, I was so hoping that would explode in your face

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey, that's not nice

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It would ruin his microphone

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It would ruin the microphone and the keyboard

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now, the audience

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have to do a third take

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, the audience doesn't know is it's not your average, you know, Budweiser 12 ounce can of beer

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's 18

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a 40

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, it's not a 40

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's 18 ounces, I believe, or 20

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And it's a Pilsner with a mild aftertaste and it's very hoppy

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What do you think, Rob?

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Not bad for beer

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, good

183
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I can drink one of these

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know, usually I don't screw around with beer

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You don't?

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, I'm just like, let's fill the glass with vodka, splash of cranberry, I'm good

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And a twist of lime

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But after one of those, Rob, I do get a little tipsy, so I can only imagine what the drive home

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My driving you home is gonna be like in a couple hours

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, look, this will be, I guess you could say in some ways, my gift to the listeners

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know what, it's been, it's been a crazy week in the world

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It has been a crazy week in the world and, you know, I realize some people play video games to escape

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sometimes the crazy things that are going on in the world

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And I like this show to kind of be like that too

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That, you know, if we can give you a few lulls tonight to take your mind off of some of the not so lullsy things going on in the world

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then I think mission accomplished

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sounds like a plan

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Share some

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And the type of video games that you've been playing this week

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Since we do always start off the show that way

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Loki, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't play much

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I played Grand Theft Auto at work

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I played Naughty Bear for like a few minutes

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Which the game is really low budget

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But it's kind of funny because they have this like British guy who, you know, yells out these, you know, different things like

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
De-fluffication!

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know, it's just like, it's so weird

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's just a weird, weird game

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
De-fluffication sounds like something you could go to prison for

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But yeah, it's a weird, really low budget game

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're doing a game of the year edition that's coming out in May

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So if you want to, you know, pick it up later on I guess you could

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But honestly it's really low budget

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But it's kind of fun, I guess

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because I mean the whole game feels like a really kiddie game but you're just brutally murdering these teddy bears

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's just not bloody enough though, that's the only downside to it

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then mainly just working on Grand Theft Auto edits at home

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I finally finished, I think, some of the stuff that I got to burn my new discs that we're going to be playing at work now

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Which is incredibly bloody now because I made the blood effects really huge

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But it serves two purposes

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Needs more blood!

227
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It serves two purposes. One, people are always saying, well, you know, I swear I hit you with those, you know, the minigun or something like that

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I'm like, no you didn't

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well this way you'll know if you hit somebody because the blood effect is just so huge that you'll see that bullet spray from, you know, pretty far away

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And because it looks fucking awesome

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because you shoot somebody and it's just hilarious because it's just all this blood everywhere

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Um, I'm trying to think of one else

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is there ever enough blood for you, Loki?

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's just fun to see what I can do with the game

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
On a completely random note since you're talking about blood and all of this stuff

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
One of these things that I saw this week that, um, I think she needs her own video game

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know the rap artist Lil' Kim?

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She has a new album out called Black Friday

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I don't know if you've seen the album cover but it's very like Kill Bill with blood splattering everywhere

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And there's this little decapitated pink wig that's on the ground on the album cover

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That I think is supposed to symbolize Nicki Minaj and their little feud, I don't know

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But, um, I'm thinking she should have her own video game

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't know, there's something about Lil' Kim

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, I don't think so

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What, you wouldn't play a Lil' Kim video game?

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, I would not play a Lil' Kim video game

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why is that?

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because, I, I'm sorry, she, what, she thinks she's some sort of sexy samurai there?

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry, that does not happen

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She's got big ol' boobies

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, oh, well in that case she has all the requirements to fill, you know, the samurai position

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Big tits, done

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're a samurai now

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If there were a video game called Big Titted Samurai, you would check it out

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You would at least kind of look, you would pick up the box and look at the back

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I would look at that, but, you know, I'm just saying though, it

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Only goes rated M

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It, it's just, it's stupid

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's stupid, it's stupid that artists have feuds

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No one cares

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh no, this artist doesn't like this artist

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh no, who cares, it's just

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Westside rap and East Coast rap

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh god, so stupid

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, you're all gangsters, oh my god

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, such the feud

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright, sorry to derail the conversation

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But I don't know, when you were talking about Gran Todano and blood splattering everywhere

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I was thinking about that album cover I saw and I was like

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I would play her in a game

271
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes, exactly, I agree with Kitsune

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I would play a Robogatia video game

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'd play anything from that company because

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Robogatia's really weird

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
As, you know

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And by the way

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Many of the other movies that they put out

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Since I'm very rude and the second take made me derail a little bit

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I forgot to introduce the chat room tonight

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you are listening live at All Games Radio on this Sunday, March the 13th

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You should hop on over to our chat room and join us live

283
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Chat.OrangeOnTrady.com

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And besides, a big-tit samurai game, that's just basically, you know, the last Ninja Gaiden game

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Couldn't they just take, was Dead or Alive 4

286
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And all those big-titty characters and give them swords

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And they already got the basic code down for that

288
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's kind of Soul Calibur

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or Soul Calibur

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, they already kind of did that though

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
With the last Ninja Gaiden game, they had, you know

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Bonus characters from Dead or Alive

293
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And from the other, you know, DS, Dragon Sword game

294
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And that kind of stuff, but

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Once again, you know, I don't think we should really give

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
A rap star a video game

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Have we not learned from 50 Cent?

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Really, I mean, Blood in the Sand was amazing

299
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I do give you the fact that it is so ridiculous

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That it is awesome, but

301
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I just don't think Lil' Kim has that same appeal

302
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, rap stars have their own game, isn't it?

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Rap star, rap hero

304
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Which is not a bad game

305
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It really isn't

306
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A lot of people want to pass it off, it's like

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, I don't like rap, but if you look at it as a game

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They invested more in, especially coming from Konami

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Or what, I'm sure somebody else did it and they published it

310
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But coming from that kind of that same family

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you look at that next to like DDR

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Which has been recycled so many times

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Or the Karaoke Revolution games

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's like, wow, they're the only ones that are like

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Really doing something new and exciting as Def Jam rap stars

316
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
With their community features

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's really amazing that they have all that

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And they didn't put in anything else

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey, we have this cool dancing game that has camera support

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That we, you know, people dance in front of a camera

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Could we have community support for that?

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Nope, sorry, that would be forward thinking, of course

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Or, you know, how about

324
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Now's the time, seriously, Guitar Freaks, you know, Drummania

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Maybe you give it another go and not make a crappy game this time

326
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no, let it be, let it be

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Put it out to pasture

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Moo

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Alright

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, I bet we'll get another Guitar Hero game

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We'll see

332
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They're looking at you like

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The money's there

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They're just waiting for, you know

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They've milked the cow dry

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They just have to wait for it to melt to come back

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So you're not saying like we're gonna have a new Guitar Hero game

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Like this year or next year

339
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because, no, they announced it's done

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This year

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But you think there'll be that renaissance

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In like three years' time

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They've announced, they didn't say that they've dissolved the franchise completely

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They said there's no Guitar Hero, no Tony Hawk game this year

345
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, alright

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's very tinfoil hat of you, but we'll see

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, come on

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They think money's there

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, we were talking with Bobby beforehand

350
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, and it's gonna be a story we're gonna be covering later on

351
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Talking about a trademark that they had

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
A long time ago, I remember with Drum Villain and Dance Hero

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And everyone was like, oh no

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Here they go, copying DDR

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, you know what, I mean, seriously

356
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They're just like, okay, what's Homarnax doing that seems profitable

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I would like to see what that whole Guitar Villain idea was all about

358
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Unless that was, I always envisioned that that was just to protect someone else from doing it

359
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That'd be dumb

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I mean, but anyways

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They're basically just gonna look at whatever

362
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Homarnax is doing that's profitable

363
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then they're gonna copy it

364
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I mean, that's...

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What's gonna happen? I mean, seriously

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If Rockman 3 continues to be profitable

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I mean, granted the game didn't sell as well as

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, maybe 2 did, but

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Once again, they have a lot of download content

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's not really market

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You can't really look at the game sales

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And say, oh, this game, you know, the series is dead

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's just, I think their download content is doing really well

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But, once again though

375
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The dance games are doing really well now

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like Just Dance and Dance Central and stuff like that

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So, of course they're gonna be like

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We have this completely original idea that we're gonna put out

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And you're gonna buy it because it's part of the hero franchise

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know, our wonderful hero franchise that we support greatly

381
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No, we didn't kill off the hero franchise

382
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We're bringing it back with dance hero

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think Matt's got some angst left over from last week

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, it's just...

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It's just so retarded

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They're so two-faced

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, the music industry, music genre's dead

388
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's so dead

389
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, but here's our dance game

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's part of the music genre, right?

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, it's a different music genre

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We were talking about the other music genre

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They'll do whatever, you know, has money behind it

394
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If they can make money doing it, they're gonna do it

395
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Just like there's gonna be another Call of Duty game

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because it's Call of Duty

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It makes money

398
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Somewhere in there we were talking about Loki's gaming week

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I get the feeling he's done

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So, Matt, too, do you want to share your gaming week?

401
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What you've been playing?

402
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm afraid

403
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, my gaming week

404
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Again, I do play Warcraft semi-regularly

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm in class right now

406
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So that inhibits some things

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've got different characters I work on there

408
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm part of a guild with some IRL friends

409
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So that helps pass the time with WoW

410
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Gaming week, Angry Birds is really addicting

411
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm going through all of them

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Trying to get three stars and everything

413
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
For me, it's all about the physics

414
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The math behind it, I get the right angle

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And the right, I don't know

416
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know what, I feel for him

417
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't want to cut the rope, but I do

418
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, I'm sorry

419
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I understand the physics part of it

420
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And that's kind of cool and stuff

421
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I promise I only play when I poop

422
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I do not play when I poop

423
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sometimes I play in bed

424
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I tried to give

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have played in bed, actually

426
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I have tried to give Angry Birds

427
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I gave Angry Birds a try

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is one of the games I bought

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Everybody likes it, so I'm going to buy it

430
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's 99 cents, what the hell

431
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I didn't play it for the longest time

432
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I actually played it

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's okay, but I just

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't see how everybody's so obsessed about this game

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If it was Scorched Earth

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There's no discussion

437
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And that has physics

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And angle calculation and all that fun stuff

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And tanks

440
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
See, that's what Angry Birds needs

441
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you played Angry Birds

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And they released an ad

443
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Every time you killed a pig, it would explode bloody

444
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Would you then play it?

445
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, I wouldn't, because it's a cheap cash-in

446
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Just like all these holiday add-ons are cheap cash-in

447
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What if the pig exploded

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And then bacon comes out the USB slot

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
On your phone?

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay, really it's alright

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Keep your protein to yourself

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I forgot to mention it because it wasn't really part of my gaming week

453
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But I made bacon ice cream this week

454
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Eww

455
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's actually breakfast ice cream

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Breakfast ice cream?

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, it's because there's waffle cone in there

458
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And maple syrup

459
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Bacon waffles

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Did you cover it in chocolate butter?

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's something you'd order at IHOP

462
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Where you can get dessert for breakfast

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Seriously, that French toast that's fucking stuffed with cream cheese

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That is not breakfast

465
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I had chicken and waffles for breakfast today

466
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's better than bacon-flavored ice cream

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Uh, actually

468
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Anyways, think about getting chicken and waffles at IHOP

469
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't. It's alright

470
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But it's not good

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I mean, it's not like

472
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Mmm, that's really yummy

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm full now

474
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Somewhere in here was Angry Birds and IOS

475
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And now we're talking about frying the birds

476
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You said bacon! This is all your fault

477
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You did say bacon

478
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, so I did make bacon ice cream

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think I put too much bacon in it

480
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And I know how- Nonsense!

481
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Exactly, nonsense

482
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But it's just

483
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You have to really be in the mood for bacon ice cream

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Because if you're eating it

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's ice cream-y and then all of a sudden salty

486
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And it's just like

487
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Huh? Why is there salt in there?

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I mean, it's a little strange

489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
My wife likes it actually, though

490
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She likes the bacon ice cream

491
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
She is a horrible Jew

492
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Horrible

493
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Horrible

494
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Nah, I'm just kidding. You know I love her

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Anyhow, so yeah, Angry Birds, right?

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, it's a lot of

497
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
IOS games on my iPhone 4

498
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And again, as I mentioned, I'm getting an iPad 2

499
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hopefully by week's end

500
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't want to wait in lines and get it

501
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So I ordered it online

502
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Once I have that, it'll sync in and play Angry Birds

503
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And huge, huge, uh

504
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What's that? 9.7 inch- Angry Birds HD

505
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
HD, well, it's not Retina display, unfortunately

506
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's HD because it's in the 9.7 inch

507
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Diagonal screen, whatever

508
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Holy crap, that's a game that's really gonna utilize HD graphics

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hell yeah

510
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You see those pigs' beady eyes winking at you

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Aside from that, I

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The pig is saying no

513
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
To see you know

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The last thing I'm thinking about picking up

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And hopefully you're fourth guest in the chat room at

516
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
chat.orangeloudradia.com

517
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, so you have been listening for a little while

518
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think you've been slipping into this role very easily

519
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I've been thinking about picking up Dragon Age 2

520
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I had original Dragon Age, I downloaded a lot of the

521
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
DLC content

522
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I like the DLC content

523
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was disappointed that it was very out of

524
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
chronological order

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Once you pass the game, you download some DLC

526
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It pretty much says, oh, just pretend that you didn't

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You know, end the game and

528
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
This is extra stuff

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But I'm curious about Dragon Age 2

530
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Getting reviews, I'm hearing mostly good

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I defer to your chat room if anyone's

532
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Bought it, I appreciate your opinions

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I might be picking up that and

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Detoxing from WoW for a bit

535
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And then going over to my Xbox

536
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And of course, you know what

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The best part about any new Dragon

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Age game coming out is of course going to be

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Gay sex scene!

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yay! Gay sex scene in Dragon

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Age! Hooray!

542
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Let's talk you more penis

543
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Here's what I have a problem with Bioware

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
There's such fucking teases

545
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's no nudity, and there's definitely

546
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No sex scenes

547
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They just kind of like, jump on the bed

548
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm looking for this

549
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
See, look at that, that's tongue right there

550
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That was some tongue, some big gay kissing

551
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes, there's

552
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Woman on woman and man on woman

553
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Whatever you want, it's all there

554
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If we can have boobs in God of War, why can't we have boobs

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In, you know, Dragon Age, or Mass Effect

556
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because it just wouldn't be classy

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, who cares!

558
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I thought it was classy

559
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I would rather die than spend a moment

560
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Not here with you

561
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Well then fine, they need to consult with Hugh Hefner

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
To make a classy, you know

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Topless woman game, okay

564
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean, seriously

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't understand why they can't do this

566
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And you know what, they can do full frontal for guys on there

567
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
They did it in Grand Theft Auto

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In, you know, the Lost in Damned expansion

569
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So, if they can do it classy there

570
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Then why can't they

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But the important thing is classy

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Classy, topless women

573
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm trying to think of a classy penis

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And I don't think there really is one

575
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, why yes, Guinevere

576
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This tea tastes rather lovely

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes, I'm quite enjoying

578
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This little tea and crumpets that we're having today

579
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, but I seem to have lost my bra

580
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Have you seen my bra?

581
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That would be the game that Loki wants to play

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Classy, topless women

583
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That sounds very boring

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They only have swords

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That would conclude my gaming week because we're moving on to another topic

586
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That I think is probably a different podcast

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Right, then

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Moving on, my gaming week

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
A lot of the same old stuff, Warcraft

590
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You Don't Know Jack and a lot of those fun games

591
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
But I did play one new game this week that I wanted to talk about

592
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And if you've been listening over the past couple of weeks

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You know I've been very excited about Torchlight

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Coming out on Xbox Live Arcade

595
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Torchlight

596
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Was kind of an indie, it's a startup

597
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Studio, some of the folks that used to be

598
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Blizzard are a part of this studio

599
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They put together Torchlight

600
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And it was on Steam a couple of years ago

601
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And it's been the subject of some of their

602
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
$10 sales

603
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I think at one point you might have been able to get the game for $5

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But in a nutshell, Torchlight

605
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Is very much inspired by Diablo 2

606
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And obviously we've gone through a huge drought

607
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There hasn't been a Diablo game in many

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Many years, the last Diablo game was

609
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What, 99? 2000?

610
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes, there's one coming out

611
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But that doesn't help me now

612
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So Torchlight was really there to fill the void

613
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If you like those dungeon crawling games

614
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Where you kind of get the items

615
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And socket the items, have your talent trees, all that stuff

616
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The one thing it lacked

617
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Unfortunately, multiplayer

618
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Multiplayer was lacking in the game

619
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But it is a $10 game

620
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
At some point, $20 I think is the most you're going to pay for Torchlight

621
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I think if you buy it at retail

622
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Which is still pretty good value considering

623
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I think they still charge $30 for Diablo 2

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
In the battle chest all these years later

625
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So it's not a bad deal

626
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Randomly generated dungeons and all that good stuff

627
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Never the same game twice, woohoo

628
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So finally they ported this thing to Xbox Live Arcade

629
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And they've had to make some changes with the game

630
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And that kind of had a lot of people nervous

631
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Because the dungeon crawly games are usually very reliant on point and click

632
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And these style of games I kind of throw all the way back to

633
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know if you remember this on the PC

634
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
A very, very old PC game called Rogue

635
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Did you ever play Rogue way back in the day?

636
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Diablo's clearly inspired by this game

637
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
From way back in the day

638
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And I want to say, isn't NetHack a derivative of that too?

639
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think, or am I crazy?

640
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't know, something I was reading about, I haven't played that one

641
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I just remember Rogue back in the Commodore 64

642
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They're all kind of like this

643
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So it was very interesting to kind of see that style of game now on the Xbox

644
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Because this isn't really the type of game we see a lot on Xbox I think

645
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's not an action-y game like Tomb Raider

646
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's not an intense role-playing game like Final Fantasy

647
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's kind of somewhere in between

648
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So it's neat to see something like this on Xbox

649
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But they had to change some things

650
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
There's less pointy and clicking

651
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You attack with the X button

652
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Your menus are totally different now

653
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because you don't really have the bag that you have everything in

654
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It's just straight up, you have 50 slots and different tabs

655
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's really weird to navigate

656
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's a little overwhelming at first

657
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I've got to be honest

658
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Torchlight's biggest drawback for me on the Xbox 360 is

659
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What they had to do to convert it to console I think in some ways

660
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The text is very small

661
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So if you don't have a big TV

662
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You might be in a little bit of trouble

663
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
There's some framerate issues and it's noticeable

664
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
When I was going through some of the dungeons

665
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There's a lot of enemies on the screen at once

666
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And you're trying to do some attacks

667
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It just seems like the framerate really drops

668
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And then suddenly everything's dead which is cool

669
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But not the smoothness that I came to expect on the PC

670
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And just the weird, having so many buttons

671
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
To send your pet to town you have to bring up your menu

672
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
With start, hit the back button to bring up the pet menu

673
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And then hit the Y button to send him to town

674
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
There's a lot to it which I understand

675
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's what they have to do to make a PC game work on the Xbox 360

676
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
With minimal loss

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You don't want the game to lose anything

678
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And the good news is it doesn't

679
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's still got that same kind of feel to it

680
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But unfortunately these few drawbacks

681
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Make it really hard for me to recommend on the 360

682
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
When I know most 360 owners own a PC

683
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So my point is

684
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
If you have this game on the PC already

685
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I think you're good

686
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Like you really only need this if you insist

687
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Like I've got to have something to play on the TV

688
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Or I really want to have this on console

689
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I want to go for the achievements

690
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Those are all really good reasons I suppose

691
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But I would say if you've never played the game before

692
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And you're kind of trying to decide

693
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Do I want to play this?

694
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Go check out the PC demo

695
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Not the Xbox 360 one

696
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Because I think the PC demo is a little bit better representative

697
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Of what Torchlight really is

698
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So that would be my recommendation

699
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
But it's not a bad game

700
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I just feel like it lost a little something

701
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
When it came over from the PC

702
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The PC version is

703
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Excuse me, really superior

704
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So check that out on the PC

705
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If you must, if you don't have a computer

706
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Good enough or something

707
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I guess you could always use the Xbox 360 one as a substitute

708
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's not bad

709
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's just not, again, that same level as the PC

710
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So that was pretty much my gaming week

711
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping

712
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Not a whole lot in housekeeping I want to talk about right now

713
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I want to talk about something after this first story here

714
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But I will say, of course, our Twitter

715
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to add us on Twitter

716
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Or you can always add us on Facebook as well

717
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

718
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
A good way to always follow us

719
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And we'll see what the latest and greatest is about our show

720
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Forgot to mention my gaming week

721
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Since I'm not really playing it yet

722
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But it will be tomorrow

723
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm getting a Japanese 3DS

724
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So that's coming tomorrow

725
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Nice, what made you decide to take the plunge and get the Japanese 3DS?

726
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Because I like everything early

727
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Even his ice cream for breakfast

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I have a problem with needing to have things early

729
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm getting a Japanese 3DS with Nintendogs

730
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And then Ridge Racer

731
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Only because Pilotwings wasn't out yet

732
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Otherwise I would have gotten Pilotwings

733
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We have to bring that to the studio next week

734
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I got to see one a while ago

735
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But I want to see what that finished product looks like

736
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm sure Jamie would love to check it out too

737
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It would be fun too if they have good import games later on

738
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Because sometimes Japan gets stuff before we do

739
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Like Smash Brothers and stuff

740
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And I'm still getting a US one when that comes out

741
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
With Street Fighter 4

742
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because you have an addiction

743
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's so funny too

744
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Because just last week you were all

745
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Last week was a really good Loki hatin' on Nintendo show

746
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And now he's sitting here going

747
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, I'm buying 2DS, 3DS's

748
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's just really funny

749
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hey, I never said I wasn't buying the 3DS

750
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No, I know, I know

751
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
It just makes you mad that they don't reach their full potential

752
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Exactly

753
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't have a problem with Nintendo as far as making hardware and stuff

754
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I just have a problem with them not

755
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yeah, like you said, reaching their full potential

756
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Remaking games, come on

757
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
These Nintendo 64 ports to the 3DS

758
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
That's just some cheap shit right there

759
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'm going into our chatroom

760
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
At chat.oransonshady.com

761
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Darktoygak says

762
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Loki is going to make 3D porn on it, no doubt

763
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
No, I'm not

764
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Let's see

765
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, what's the old adage about new hardware coming out?

766
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Time to penis?

767
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Is the whole like, how long before somebody tries to put their penis on it?

768
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says

769
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Loki bought Nintendogs, he's part of the problem

770
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You are part of the problem

771
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I am part of the problem

772
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
But, okay

773
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Here's why I bought Nintendogs, okay

774
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And this is a completely weird reasoning for

775
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Cats, that's the reason I wanted

776
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Well, not the cats too

777
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I have a cat that's already annoying

778
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, the reason I bought Nintendogs plus cats

779
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Is because I think that shows off the 3D pretty well

780
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And this is something I'm really going to be kind of showing to my co-workers

781
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
To kind of say, hey look, check out the thing

782
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh, research purposes

783
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yes

784
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I mean, I

785
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, whatever

786
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Alright, fair enough

787
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It was, okay, it was either that or Professor Layton

788
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Because I can't read Japanese so that's not going to do me any good

789
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Or there's like some

790
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Cube puzzle game, no thanks

791
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And then the rest of the games are coming out over here anyways

792
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Once again, it would have been

793
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If they had pilot wings, I would have bought pilot wings

794
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I will get pilot wings when it comes out in the US

795
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Alright

796
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Alright, well we'll be hearing more about the 3DS next week then for sure

797
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yes, absolutely

798
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Awesome

799
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Alright, well let's get into the news tonight

800
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And Loki's going to start us off with some news

801
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And like I mentioned a minute ago

802
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A lot of stuff going on in the world

803
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And some of it reaching into video games for all of us

804
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, of course

805
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You may have heard that there were some major earthquakes in Japan

806
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And tsunamis and all that fun stuff

807
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That caused a lot of damage

808
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And because of that, they're having issues with being able to keep the power up

809
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And so they're asking companies to conserve power

810
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And bring back their services once that power has been restored fully

811
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So because of that, Square Enix has decided to shut off the servers for Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XI

812
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
For at least one week

813
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
And also other companies affected by this as well

814
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Well, Konami, they're shutting off the servers for Metal Gear Online

815
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Which, to be honest, until I read that, I forgot that Metal Gear Online even existed

816
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So yeah, I'm sure lots of people are playing that

817
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So yeah, those are the two companies so far that are included

818
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Part of that, who knows what other companies will be having that

819
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
That's still pretty big though

820
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Yeah, because you're talking about two major MMOs, for better or for worse

821
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean, I know we've given Final Fantasy XIV a hard time on the show

822
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
One major MMO, one major pile of crap

823
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But you and I spent many years on Final Fantasy XI and it still certainly has its fans

824
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So that's kind of not something we hear a lot in the gaming world

825
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Where it's like an MMO literally gets put on hold because of real life

826
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And it's just kind of, there's an old adage, especially in Warcraft

827
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And I'm sure the other MMOs have this too, is that RL greater than wow or whatever your game of choice is

828
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I think that especially is kind of what's coming into play this week

829
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And I can't see how really anyone can complain about this

830
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm curious if they're going to shut down for that week if they're going to issue credits to all those customers for that week

831
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Because it's on their bad and their decision to shut it down

832
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I think they're going to, I think they're going to do a free month or something like that

833
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think they will, and I think I read somewhere it is confirmed they're going to gift them the month of April

834
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think that's awfully generous

835
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I honestly, in a situation like this, I really don't think they would necessarily owe them anything

836
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I think most people would understand but you would always have that one person

837
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And I'm sure all of us have probably seen the pictures and the damage that we have

838
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And definitely take a moment to look at that

839
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But I don't, my gut tells me the extensive damage they have

840
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
One week, them shutting down, I think it's going to be the first of many weeks

841
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Or rotating weeks off

842
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah

843
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So just maybe time to take the games offline for a little while

844
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Or maybe something else you could consider doing is seeing what you can do to help

845
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And that was kind of the other thing I wanted to make sure I mentioned at some point tonight

846
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Obviously we've all seen what's been going on in Japan

847
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And it's just, there are no words

848
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There are no words for what is happening and what we're seeing on the television

849
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I just, I couldn't imagine that scale of what a tsunami can do

850
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So I really would challenge you, all our listeners

851
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
We've been doing this show for nine plus years

852
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Never once have we ever asked you for money

853
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Tonight I'm going to ask you for money

854
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And I'm going to say, you need to buy one less game this month

855
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or one less arcade game, Xbox Live arcade game

856
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Or maybe not pay for an MMO for a month

857
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Take the money that you're saving on Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XIV

858
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And go to redcross.org

859
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And please make a donation

860
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Everybody should try to do at least ten dollars

861
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
If all the OLR listeners could donate ten dollars

862
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's still a little bit for what they're really going to need in the big picture

863
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But it's a start

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And just whatever you guys can give would be so appreciated

865
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So please consider cutting back on a game this month

866
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And giving money to an organization that's going to need it to help a lot of people

867
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So redcross.org is where you can go to donate

868
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And there's many, you can do texts on your phone

869
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I know a lot of people get our show on the iTunes store

870
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
There's a big little link there in the iTunes store

871
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It says donate and you can donate and 100% of the proceeds go directly

872
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But you know what, why don't you go look at the horse's mouth redcross.org

873
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And see what you can do to help

874
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Because even if you're strapped for cash

875
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There's probably a lot of other volunteer types of things you could do to help

876
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And that would all go a long way as well

877
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So I needed to get that out there

878
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I know I talked about our show being an escape

879
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But there is the reality that there's people that need help

880
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So alright

881
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news

882
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And this has to do with the Microsoft Kinect

883
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
A lot of big news this week about the Kinect and some of the sales figures

884
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Some reports coming out there that 10 million Kinect units have been sold

885
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That is from Aaron Greenberg who is one of the executives at Xbox

886
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Wrote a tweet

887
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And apparently this is so fast and so reaching

888
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
That Guinness World Records actually went out and said that the Kinect is the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time

889
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
133,000 plus units each day for the first 60 days

890
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's faster than the iPhone or the iPad

891
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That's really surprising to me

892
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because I thought with all this iPad-a-balloo last year and everything

893
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I would have thought for sure the iPad sold faster

894
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But I guess not

895
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Congratulations to Microsoft for that

896
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But seriously, Guinness, you need to find some different types of records to put in your book

897
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Look for some tall people or people that are fat or people that can eat dog food or something like that

898
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't know, just not consumer electronics

899
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Seriously, the gamer edition of the Guinness World Records is just retarded

900
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's just the most popular character

901
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's like ugh

902
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Well look, something else to follow that up with is that Microsoft also apparently had the biggest non-holiday month ever

903
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
February 2011 they sold over half a million Xbox 360s

904
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
535,000 to be exact

905
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The biggest non-holiday month ever

906
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
27% up over last year

907
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
That's pretty significant because nothing is really coming out for them

908
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And it's all this Kinect momentum

909
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because obviously it's these bundles with the Kinect and Kinect adventures

910
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And now that people are starting to play them at friends' houses and see them on shows

911
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And hear about it in school and so forth

912
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I think the word is really starting to spread about this

913
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And I think that's what's kind of keeping it going

914
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So, very interesting

915
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Not hearing a lot about the move

916
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
From what I understand though, Sony didn't have a bad month

917
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I think Sony sold quite a few units too

918
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
They're getting closer to Nintendo

919
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Nintendo's about to slip into third place

920
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Which is really big news

921
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Nintendo is not even going to slip into third place

922
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They're in first place

923
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I believe they sold more 360s than we used last month, didn't they?

924
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah, last month

925
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But overall, they're in first place

926
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They've got a lot of catching up to do before they're in third place

927
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Honestly though, I think

928
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
With the move, it's kind of funny because

929
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
From a retail standpoint

930
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
They're treating it like there's still shortages on the move stuff

931
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Which makes no sense

932
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Because there's no demand for the move stuff

933
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
At all

934
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And yet, the stuff is hard to get

935
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
For some reason

936
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But, yeah

937
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
They're doing some stuff with the move now

938
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
That people are actually interested in

939
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You'd be surprised, like the SOCOM4

940
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And Killzone 3 stuff

941
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
With their stupid move gun

942
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That they have

943
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
People are actually interested in that

944
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And it's just

945
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I guess it seems really stupid

946
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But the actual peripherals that they've made for it

947
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Aren't just like

948
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Shells

949
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Like the Zapper

950
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
These are actual things that do have

951
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Integrated buttons and triggers and stuff like that

952
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That aren't just

953
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Ok, I pull this trigger and it

954
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Pulls a lever that pushes this button

955
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's not anything like that

956
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's actual

957
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Some special stuff that they're adding to these

958
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So it's a little bit better

959
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I think to play a first person shooter that way

960
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But people are interested

961
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So that may help

962
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I am so curious about

963
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This year's E3 and where the Kinect goes

964
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So, props to Sony though

965
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
For at least allowing

966
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The move to be supported by

967
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Their big tent pole

968
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Titles that they're putting out

969
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Because the Kinect, not really having that

970
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You have the Kinect games and that's it

971
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You're not going to see Kinect support for Gears of War

972
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
At least not Gears of War 3

973
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Maybe some spinoff or something like that

974
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And Halo

975
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm sure there's going to be some sort of spinoff Halo game

976
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But not real

977
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We didn't see any Kinect

978
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Kinect support for

979
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't even know what the next Microsoft title is

980
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Because they haven't really announced anything

981
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Actually, that's funny

982
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah, there are no first priority

983
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Microsoft titles right now for a while

984
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Probably the fourth quarter

985
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
We're not seeing anything like

986
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The question of the Fable or something like that

987
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
There's no Kinect support for that stuff

988
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So, they haven't really

989
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Embraced it yet, I guess

990
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I mean, they have their first party Kinect games

991
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That they made, but there's no

992
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Core games that are a part of that

993
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Again, E3 I think is going to

994
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Really be telling as to what their

995
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Strategic direction is for

996
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Phase 2 of the software

997
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And possibly integrating that into their core lineup

998
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Especially, didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago

999
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
About the whole Halo remake happening

1000
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That now the rumor is it could be Kinect

1001
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Halo Kinect or whatever

1002
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, I don't think, once again

1003
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean, they should have it be optional

1004
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Obviously, and then the other thing

1005
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Is I think they should have a couple different levels

1006
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That you go with it where

1007
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Not necessarily everything is motion controlled

1008
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But maybe head tracking, once again

1009
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I think head tracking added to a

1010
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
First person shooter is just no brainer

1011
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You should be doing this anyways

1012
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
For having that

1013
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Part Kinect enabled, you don't need to be running around

1014
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
With Kinect for everything, just do that

1015
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It shouldn't be mass arm flailing

1016
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
All over the place, that's what I fear

1017
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But it might be kind of cool, you have the controller

1018
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Or whatever, and maybe to lob a bomb

1019
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Or something, you would throw your hand up

1020
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Or something, like lob a bomb

1021
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Something very subtle

1022
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Where you're not breaking out of that

1023
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Controller thing, but I don't know

1024
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I just would not want mass arm flail

1025
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Like some Wii games are

1026
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I can see someone lobbing their controller by accident

1027
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Like a real grenade, hitting their flat screen TV

1028
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't design the games

1029
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm just trying to come up with ideas

1030
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Once again though, head tracking would be

1031
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Head tracking is pretty cool

1032
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You can implement that pretty easily

1033
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And once again

1034
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It doesn't interfere with playing a game

1035
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
If you don't want to move your head around

1036
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Fine, then don't

1037
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Or you can just turn that off

1038
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That kind of support would be awesome

1039
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
There's a ton of first person shooters coming out

1040
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I mean, come on

1041
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Seriously, you should be able to do that

1042
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
They've got to find a way to keep reinventing

1043
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Or adding to FPS

1044
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
At least for me, the allure

1045
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Has kind of died away, like I mentioned earlier with Halo

1046
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Even Medal of Honor

1047
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And stuff like that

1048
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It died for me after Quake 2

1049
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm like, they just don't make them

1050
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Actually, I take that back, because Quake 3 I love

1051
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They don't make them like they used to

1052
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
True, the last PC first person shooter

1053
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I played was actually Jedi Knight 2

1054
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
From what?

1055
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The mid 90s?

1056
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I play lightsaber, that was awesome

1057
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I only play a lot of first person shooters on

1058
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Console or PC

1059
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Especially not PC, because I cannot stand keyboard, mouse

1060
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
No, no thanks

1061
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I will take an Xbox 360 controller any day

1062
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And yeah, I know

1063
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's not really good when it comes to

1064
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Playing multiplayer online

1065
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But I don't play multiplayer online, so it doesn't matter

1066
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
But yeah, the last game I played was

1067
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Crysis

1068
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
With the Xbox 360 controller, it was awesome

1069
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So I do plan on picking up Crysis 2 when it comes out on consoles

1070
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Screw the PC, I don't want to upgrade my PC again

1071
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
To play fucking Crysis, I already built

1072
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The PC for that, that's enough

1073
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I do need to upgrade my graphics card

1074
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So they're old

1075
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We'll be good thinking about it

1076
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Thinking forward with Kinect

1077
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's an unknown game that maybe people don't remember

1078
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PsyOps came out for Xbox while back

1079
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
You gain telekinesis power

1080
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It can move things with your mind

1081
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It was a puzzle, first person shooter

1082
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Third person, if you readjust the bit of things

1083
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I can see that having a lot of fun with Kinect

1084
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
You move your arm to move a box out of the way

1085
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Then you go back to your controller and shoot things

1086
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You could throw a box at enemies

1087
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And knock them around

1088
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That'd be pretty freaking amazing

1089
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
How about an Xbox Live Arcade game that's

1090
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Kinect enabled called Slap-a-Bitch

1091
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And what you would do is

1092
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You walk around with the controller or whatever

1093
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And then you can just reach out and slap a bitch

1094
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
It's other people that are on

1095
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The Kinect

1096
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's like Halo, but it's slapping

1097
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Well they have a game like that for the Android

1098
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I believe, OS

1099
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
You could just sneak up behind somebody

1100
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Well they have something like that for the Android OS

1101
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And it's not as content controlled as

1102
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The app store for iPhone and Apple

1103
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's simpler

1104
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It's booty smack or booty slap

1105
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And you actually tap the phone or you slide your finger across

1106
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Your Android device and you

1107
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And you slap a bitch on her ass

1108
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So we're getting there

1109
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We're getting there, but we're not there yet for the Kinect

1110
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Once they released that development kit

1111
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I should say

1112
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Once they released that development kit for the indie marketplace

1113
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
There will be a slap a bitch

1114
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I guarantee it

1115
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Slap a ho, slap a bitch, slap a baby, it'll be all good

1116
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Slap that ass

1117
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We're so bad

1118
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Alright moving on, how about some more gaming news

1119
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm going over to Matt too tonight

1120
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Sure, so keeping with the whole Microsoft

1121
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Company discussion

1122
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Turns out those codes

1123
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
On the back of your Microsoft Live cards

1124
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Actually have a pattern to them

1125
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So a group of smart hackers

1126
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Decided to look at those codes

1127
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Take some old Xbox Live points cards

1128
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And Xbox Gold trial codes

1129
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And they figured out an algorithm

1130
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That actually allows them to

1131
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Anticipate the rest of the strings

1132
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
By doing so they started to exploit

1133
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Microsoft for Microsoft points

1134
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And in doing so, and of course you post

1135
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
These things on forums so everyone can do it

1136
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
They bled Microsoft

1137
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
For an estimated one million dollars worth of points

1138
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Space bucks

1139
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
One million space bucks

1140
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So of course Microsoft

1141
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Caught on to this and pulled the codes online

1142
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
But as I was reviewing

1143
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Some of the news

1144
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Tossed a question to me, the algorithm

1145
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Is still enforced to the cards on

1146
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Walmart and Target walls

1147
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm not understanding

1148
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Because they pull these codes that were posted online

1149
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But aren't they still sitting on shelves?

1150
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Correct, so my thinking

1151
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
My thoughts were when I was reading this

1152
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That's great you pulled the codes

1153
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
But the existing codes on store shelves are still

1154
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The same algorithm or maybe a set of algorithms

1155
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah there might be several algorithms

1156
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And so they must be in their

1157
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
New batch of product for that

1158
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
They've got to be redoing the algorithm

1159
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I wonder if there will be a recall

1160
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Maybe the algorithm, because I'm sure

1161
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
These codes

1162
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Probably not just tell

1163
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That it's a Microsoft code, but it probably

1164
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Actually tells Microsoft where the card was bought

1165
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I would imagine the GameStop chain

1166
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Probably all has similar digits

1167
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
In the beginning or something like that

1168
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But whatever algorithm was cracked

1169
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Is probably tied to one particular retail chain

1170
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And beyond points

1171
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I might sound like an idiot to the folks that did this

1172
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Because I don't profess to know how you crack an algorithm

1173
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
These aren't necessarily the 1600 point cards

1174
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
These are the 160 Microsoft point cards

1175
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That you get with some games

1176
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Right, the actual point value is 160

1177
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So we're not talking a lot

1178
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But they're able to refresh and then

1179
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Regenerate the algorithm and keep going

1180
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And even they were able to find the code

1181
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
For bringing in props to Halo Reach and things like that

1182
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So instead of digital tchotchkes and SpaceBucks

1183
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They were able to figure out the codes

1184
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Darktoygak has a really good question

1185
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Don't these things have to be activated?

1186
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Like when you buy the cards at the store

1187
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I always thought once they scan on the barcode

1188
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Then they're active or whatever

1189
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's just a piece of cardboard

1190
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That has a code underneath it

1191
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That's what makes me wonder

1192
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I can understand

1193
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
They did these 160 point cards

1194
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Those things

1195
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
But if they started doing 1600 point cards

1196
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
There'd be no way for them to track that

1197
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
How would they even be able to figure out

1198
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Which ones are sold and stuff

1199
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm sure those codes link to some type of serial number

1200
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Some type of, not product key

1201
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Some type of way to

1202
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
If Microsoft is smart

1203
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And we hope that they are

1204
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
They've got to have some type of inventory tracking methodology

1205
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They generate so many codes

1206
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
To so many locations

1207
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I could swear that you have to activate them at the register

1208
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Before they run

1209
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Because otherwise how easy is it to steal those cards?

1210
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Okay, well actually it wasn't from cards

1211
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
From what I'm looking up here real quick

1212
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's actually from a website that was

1213
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Generating these codes

1214
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Kind of like a promotion thing

1215
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So they figured out that you can go to this website

1216
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Because really you're only supposed to be able to go there once

1217
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can go to this website, change part of this URL

1218
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That's in there

1219
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And you can see if

1220
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The code's working or not

1221
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And then

1222
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Basically

1223
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You keep

1224
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The code is located

1225
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But again the algorithm stays

1226
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And if there are existing cards

1227
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't know

1228
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I always figure there's a pattern to it

1229
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
But someone found the exploit and they shared it with the community

1230
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And let them for about a million bucks

1231
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I gotta be honest

1232
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This news kind of sucks for Microsoft

1233
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen sooner

1234
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's true

1235
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Considering how long those types of cards have been around

1236
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm surprised

1237
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I guess it wasn't the cards

1238
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
To really rip the hole open

1239
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
To get these points

1240
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But I'm really surprised it didn't happen sooner

1241
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And I wonder if other gaming companies

1242
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Or consoles like this

1243
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I wonder if they are taking stock

1244
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In this

1245
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And how they procure their point cards and stuff

1246
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm really wondering what effect this might have

1247
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
On digital distribution down the line

1248
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I mean granted this is just one little

1249
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Well it's not really little

1250
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But it's one thing that happened

1251
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And maybe it wasn't the cards after all

1252
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But you have to think about

1253
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
What does digital distribution mean to our company

1254
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And you've seen the expansion happening

1255
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Kind of a GameStop where now

1256
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
One of their walls is no longer game

1257
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Boxes but it's those plastic cards

1258
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
For Playstation Network and so forth

1259
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So you gotta kind of be wondering

1260
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
If people are able to exploit that system

1261
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Is digital download

1262
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
As smart of an idea as we all thought?

1263
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Or does it need some time to get more secure?

1264
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Out of a little harder if they were exploiting

1265
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Those Facebook gift cards you can buy in the store

1266
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
For your true SpaceX

1267
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
There's no value in that

1268
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I'm curious if even one of those is sold yet

1269
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So that's been reported that Microsoft

1270
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
This week they started renting movies on Facebook

1271
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Oh lord

1272
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Yeah that's true

1273
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
That's something else for people to spend their SpaceX on

1274
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Give credit cards over to

1275
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Ironically enough the first movie that they started renting

1276
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Was The Dark Knight right?

1277
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
The Batman movie with Heath Ledger

1278
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And all I could think of in my mind was

1279
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And here we go

1280
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Maybe that was the joke

1281
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I don't know

1282
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So I will be avoiding that part of Facebook

1283
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I don't want them to have my credit card information

1284
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's for damn sure

1285
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So yeah a million bucks has been bled dry

1286
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
From the coffers of Microsoft

1287
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Quickly in their lesson and have to start changing

1288
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Their strategy on how to

1289
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Deal with codes perhaps

1290
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Be interesting to see the ramifications

1291
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Of this six months from now

1292
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well they can figure out who uses those codes

1293
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So they're gonna punish them

1294
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They'll be taken out back and flogged

1295
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Publicly

1296
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Drop the hammer or cut the rope

1297
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yes they'll be

1298
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Cutting the rope

1299
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Let's move on

1300
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Well as rumored the new firmware for the

1301
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
PlayStation 3 has come out

1302
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
With cloud saves

1303
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So yes now you can actually

1304
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Save your games

1305
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber

1306
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I was just about to ask, I'm like nah you have to be

1307
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
PlayStation Plus for that right?

1308
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So you can

1309
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Save some games

1310
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Or your game saves online

1311
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And also apparently

1312
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
According to one of the PlayStation 3 hackers

1313
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It has

1314
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Resecured the PlayStation 3

1315
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
For now

1316
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Cause obviously the

1317
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Keys are still in there but they've just

1318
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Moved them to someplace else

1319
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And they have another key in place

1320
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So for now

1321
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It's been secured but

1322
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's just a matter of time

1323
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Really you can't

1324
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Even calling it re-secured

1325
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That just doomed it for failure

1326
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Right there

1327
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Just say nope still broken

1328
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Nothing to see here

1329
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Keep on moving

1330
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
But it's hack proof Loki

1331
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
This new firmware is hacker proof

1332
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Nobody will hack it

1333
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Nothing is hacker proof

1334
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And no one's bothering to even

1335
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well here's the thing though

1336
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
The firmware right now because you can

1337
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Spoof it anyway so you can still

1338
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Connect to the PlayStation Network if you really want to

1339
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
But

1340
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Whatever

1341
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Is cloud saving something that interests anyone in this room?

1342
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I do think it's kind of neat

1343
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Because you know like

1344
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
If I go to visit friends like in the bay area

1345
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
You know or something I could

1346
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Connect to the cloud I guess and get my game saves

1347
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Especially for things like

1348
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I own this on the 360

1349
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So maybe it's a moot point but you don't know Jack

1350
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Like you remember when I was reviewing the game

1351
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I talked about you really want to make sure that save file

1352
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Goes with you otherwise you're going to be recycling games

1353
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Because of the dumb way

1354
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You have only five episodes at a time

1355
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Able to lock or whatever

1356
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
If you don't take that game save with you you're going to end up

1357
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Recycling games very quickly and that

1358
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So the cloud save would be very useful for that

1359
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Because I don't always think to copy my save file to a card

1360
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And so on

1361
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I was going to say thumb drives are fucking cheap

1362
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I mean why would I spend money

1363
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
On PlayStation Plus

1364
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I have two jump drives right here

1365
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Both of these cost me less than ten dollars

1366
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I mean why would I

1367
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And those are eight gigs

1368
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Why would I even waste my time

1369
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I think the cap was 150

1370
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't know if it's 150 saves

1371
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Or if it's 150 megabytes

1372
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I can't remember what it was

1373
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The honest thing I can say is that sometimes you just don't know

1374
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
When you're going to need a game save file

1375
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I have never ever

1376
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Gone to a person's house and go damn

1377
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I really wish I had my game save with me

1378
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Especially not for the PS3

1379
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Because people that now have a PS3

1380
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That I go to their houses

1381
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Regularly

1382
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I know one person

1383
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Alright

1384
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Well I feel the same way about cloud saving with

1385
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The whole rock band guitar hero things

1386
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Because I go to one of my buddy's houses

1387
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Who has played rock band extensively

1388
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And unlocked a lot of the games

1389
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I come back to my house and I haven't

1390
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Finished those parts of the tour to unlock the songs to play

1391
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So cloud saving would make a lot of sense

1392
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
When you do the all unlock

1393
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That would be cheating Rob

1394
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Here's the other problem too with the cloud saving thing

1395
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Don't you have to put your profile on their system anyways?

1396
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I mean you can't just dump the save off the internet

1397
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Well with Xbox

1398
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah it is profile centric

1399
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's true

1400
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Here's a better idea

1401
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
This is great and this will cost you

1402
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
No money so fuck Playstation Plus

1403
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You take that game save

1404
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's not very big

1405
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Email it to yourself

1406
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Boom it's on the cloud

1407
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Don't need to fucking pay them for shit

1408
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You want that download that save anywhere

1409
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Download the save just go to a PC

1410
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Download it

1411
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
But your friends don't have a PC I don't believe you

1412
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Because everybody has a PC nowadays

1413
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Seriously

1414
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Why am I going to pay

1415
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Boom it's on the cloud

1416
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
And he pointed up

1417
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
In the studio he pointed up towards the cloud

1418
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Just in case we didn't know

1419
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Boom headshot on the cloud

1420
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Alright

1421
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Gameguru in our chat

1422
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Says my USB drive is bigger than the cloud

1423
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Hot

1424
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Google mail

1425
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Gmail bigger than the cloud

1426
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
7.8 gigs right

1427
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And you know

1428
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
If I remember correctly

1429
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I believe you can download stuff

1430
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Through the web browser on

1431
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
The

1432
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Playstation 3 I think

1433
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I'm not sure what you can download if it's just

1434
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Images and stuff like that to save to your system

1435
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But you may very well be able to download game

1436
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Saves

1437
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Now here's a point from Spaznator PC

1438
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Can't wait to hear your response to this in our chat room

1439
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Low key most saves can be copied

1440
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
To jump drives external hard drives

1441
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But some are copy locked

1442
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
In those occasions cloud saving comes in handy

1443
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then the only person

1444
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Or the only people you can blame

1445
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
For that would be Sony for being dicks

1446
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
But maybe

1447
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
For a Playstation Plus member they'll give you the keys

1448
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
To unlock that save

1449
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Oh yeah how generous of them

1450
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I can have access to my saves

1451
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh thank you great master

1452
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I mean it's like

1453
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
What the hell

1454
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Sorry no you can't have your saved data

1455
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But you can pay for the privilege

1456
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
To access that data

1457
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Last week was Nintendo this week is Sony

1458
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I know you gotta love Loki

1459
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
One week it'll be Apple then it's Nintendo

1460
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Now this week it's Sony

1461
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Angry angsty

1462
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Man against iOS and iPad

1463
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And iPhone stuff

1464
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But he still is in many ways

1465
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
No I hate Apple

1466
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
The only reason he has that is he got it for free through a work

1467
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
No you have to understand I hate Apple

1468
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Because their computers are shit

1469
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
They're overpriced shit

1470
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And that's all it is

1471
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Who thought it was a fucking genius idea to have

1472
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
No ports whatsoever other than

1473
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
One USB slot that's awesome

1474
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's awesomely stupid

1475
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
I mean

1476
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But people buy that for like two grand

1477
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
When you can spend two grand on laptops

1478
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
I can get two fucking nice laptops

1479
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
For that same kind of price

1480
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But people go oh my god new Apple product

1481
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I gotta go buy it

1482
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
That's where I have my problems

1483
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'm still giving props for the

1484
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
The iPhone because it probably is the best

1485
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Smartphone out there right now

1486
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
And even like the iPod touch

1487
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Because it's probably the best

1488
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
MP3 player out there

1489
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's not my really MP3 player

1490
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's an iPhone without the phone

1491
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But

1492
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I'll be damned if I buy a fucking

1493
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Apple computer

1494
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Fuck that

1495
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Seriously that is a waste

1496
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You might as well just set fire to your money

1497
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Because you'd be doing yourself

1498
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
A great injustice to buy

1499
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
An Apple computer

1500
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh Loki

1501
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I think in a new segment Loki's angst

1502
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
That's the show

1503
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
But that's not a segment

1504
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
That's the show

1505
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And I still don't get the iPad

1506
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I don't get it

1507
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I guess it's better than having a

1508
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Netbook maybe

1509
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But

1510
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I can't put it in my pocket what good is that for me

1511
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm using mine, I'm planning a career in real estate

1512
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I'm using it to take pictures of listings and homes

1513
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And video so I'm putting it to a business use

1514
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Ok so yeah that's fine

1515
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
And I'll be able to watch porn on it

1516
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Hey that's a frame device that has a screen

1517
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I don't play the slideshow of porn

1518
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Versus the slideshow of listings

1519
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
You better have a big thing of Windex to clean that iPad with

1520
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
But um

1521
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Anyway so

1522
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
No no I just

1523
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Of course everybody's now putting out tablet

1524
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Right

1525
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
That worked really well back in the 90's

1526
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Because everybody wants to touch something

1527
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I remember when tablet PC

1528
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Fuck I remember when my uncle worked for like

1529
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Wacom and they were making tablet PC's

1530
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah that's old school shit

1531
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh my god you have to use a stylus

1532
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
On this

1533
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Alright anyway let's move on

1534
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
To some other stories going on here

1535
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And this is a follow up to something we were talking about

1536
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Last week remember that scandalous game

1537
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
We Dare

1538
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yes that was the one that's kind of like Truth or Dare

1539
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I guess but it was going to be a video game on the Wii

1540
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And the trailer video featured spanking

1541
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Which I guess was one of the mini games

1542
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well guess what happened

1543
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Thanks to the magic of the internet I guess somebody

1544
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Realized maybe um

1545
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
This game isn't really suitable for the

1546
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
12 plus rating that it originally got

1547
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And yes Ubisoft

1548
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Just spoke to the Daily Telegraph

1549
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
This week saying following the public

1550
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Reaction to the 12 plus rating of

1551
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
We Dare Ubisoft has made the decision

1552
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Not to sell the game in the United

1553
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Kingdom so uh

1554
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
This means that the game will not be sold anymore

1555
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
In the UK they will have to import it

1556
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
From some place where this game will be

1557
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Sold um

1558
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I don't know where that's going to end up being

1559
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Canada or Australia

1560
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Or what?

1561
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's stupid that they're even doing that

1562
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
How about download it on the internet because that's probably going to be the easiest place to get it sadly

1563
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I don't usually advocate piracy but

1564
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's just a

1565
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Fucking game I mean seriously

1566
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
First off the situation that

1567
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
They posed in the stupid trailer made

1568
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
No sense anyways there's first off never

1569
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Going to be two hot girls playing a game with you

1570
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And they're not going to go make out because they

1571
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Started playing you know a fucking

1572
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Wii game you know what's going to do that

1573
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Lots of alcohol

1574
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Lots of yeah that's really all you need

1575
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Lots of alcohol you know and

1576
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And uh slutty chicks

1577
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And then they'll go and make out and stuff

1578
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
A Wii game is not going to get them to do that

1579
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It will not get you you know laid

1580
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Um

1581
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And I trust you if you bought this game

1582
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You'd be very bored because who the hell

1583
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Are you going to play this with?

1584
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I mean seriously you're going to invite your friends over and play this

1585
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Play against the computer?

1586
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Play against the computer I mean

1587
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You want to fucking you know

1588
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I'm sorry Dave I cannot let you spank me

1589
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So they're not they're not selling it in the UK

1590
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Were they not selling Twister in the UK?

1591
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
They're not selling bottles in the UK because I mean

1592
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
That's all you need too for like fucking you know

1593
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Uh

1594
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Was it an erotic night with your friends or something

1595
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Like that I mean I just don't under

1596
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
This just proves that the UK

1597
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Is possibly more prudish than the Americans

1598
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
No they're just as prudish because we're not selling it over here either so

1599
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
By the way

1600
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Just real quick uh also

1601
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Ubisoft got a stern warning

1602
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
From the Europeans rating board

1603
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Peggy um not Bundy

1604
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
But P-E-G-I Peggy

1605
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Uh asking Ubisoft to basically

1606
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Remove the We Dare ads from the internet

1607
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh yeah because once something hits the internet

1608
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
It can totally be erased you guys

1609
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Whatever you know what I think it can

1610
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Try to find anything

1611
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
From uh being Bobby Brown on the internet

1612
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
You can't

1613
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It just doesn't exist I have an icon of Whitney Houston

1614
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Saying kiss my ass

1615
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
No you do I have looked

1616
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I have scoured the internet trying to find those episodes

1617
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
For my wife because that would be like

1618
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
They never released it on DVD?

1619
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
No she filed lawsuits to block that

1620
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It never came out on DVD

1621
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Really? Yes oh man

1622
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
That would be worth a lot if anyone's got that on VHS

1623
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That was an amazing fucking show

1624
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We need to send Sam Flynn to break into the headquarters

1625
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Of Bravo or whatever fucking network or air that show

1626
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And steal the master tapes because seriously

1627
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
That was an amazing piece of television

1628
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It was awesome

1629
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Anyhow speaking of Bobby

1630
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Uh Black Wolf is in the chat room

1631
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Saying please tell me you have in your show

1632
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Role the guy who actually recorded himself

1633
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Playing the game showing how tame it really is

1634
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Of course I don't

1635
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
But I believe it

1636
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I believe it's not as bad as that commercial makes it look

1637
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We saw you know the actual gameplay

1638
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm sure it's on YouTube somewhere

1639
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It's just

1640
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It's just a ploy to get people

1641
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
To buy that game because they're like oh it's so dirty

1642
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
No it's crap

1643
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Okay it's Ubisoft

1644
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
This is the same company that puts out you know

1645
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Uh the pets games

1646
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Or the imagine games

1647
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You know or you know all that stuff

1648
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Imagine sex party

1649
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I mean that's basically what this is

1650
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Well unfortunately I couldn't find

1651
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
The We Dare gameplay but I did find

1652
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
A trailer for We Dare Island

1653
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh he's cute

1654
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Oh she's spinning a tie

1655
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
In slow motion

1656
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Or is that a bra? I can't tell from back here

1657
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Ah yes

1658
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So the ladies are on the couch

1659
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Giggling at the boys and they're one pseudo stripping

1660
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And they're dancing and they're having a gay old time

1661
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The question is though

1662
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Is it going in reverse?

1663
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Oh oh now the girls spanking

1664
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The girls are laughing I think it is going in reverse

1665
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
God I love YouTube

1666
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm gonna link that in the chat

1667
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That's more like XTube going on right there

1668
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Alright

1669
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
MrBlackWolf is giving me the appropriate link

1670
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
That we should be looking at here

1671
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
If the game doesn't have full frontal it's not We Dare

1672
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I mean seriously

1673
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We can check it out

1674
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
There's us being all adventurous

1675
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Ooh I want that dress

1676
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
You do huh? Yes

1677
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Okay

1678
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh these guys are sassy

1679
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
You really like this song?

1680
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Yes

1681
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
How can you not like this song?

1682
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I guess it's okay but I'm just sick of hearing it

1683
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm sick of hearing you

1684
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Not to mention it's a cover

1685
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I guess they're just dancing it's kind of like Just Dance

1686
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Is that it?

1687
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Alright I'm bored of that video already

1688
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
What is that on Farmhouse media 3000

1689
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It has that little YouTube clip we were just playing

1690
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Anyhow

1691
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Let's move on

1692
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Matt2 what do you have for us?

1693
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Some more news so looks like that

1694
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
If you play Dragon Age 2 and you

1695
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Have some angst and you want to get unleashed

1696
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
In the forums watch what you say because

1697
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
If you call EA the devil

1698
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You might actually get shut off

1699
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So a player actually posted online

1700
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
On their forums and

1701
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
For whatever reason reference

1702
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
EA called them the devil you can have your opinion

1703
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
About that and

1704
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
EA not liking this bad PR

1705
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Decided to temporarily

1706
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Suspend the player's account on the

1707
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Forums because that's not

1708
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Unusual when you play WoW or other online

1709
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
If you go off and say some naughty things

1710
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
They'll do that but someone flipped the other master

1711
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Switch and temporarily

1712
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Suspended this guy's account for three days

1713
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So when he loaded the game and

1714
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Played the game could not

1715
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Actually play it all because he called

1716
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The exact quote from

1717
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
The forums was

1718
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Quote have you sold your souls to

1719
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
The EA devil?

1720
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Really?

1721
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
At Banfurth

1722
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's the Activision devil by the way

1723
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Exactly

1724
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
But the other part of it too

1725
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's not so bad

1726
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
If you've seen and read other forums

1727
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It's like don't come into my house and then call me

1728
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The devil

1729
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
So here's the thing

1730
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
We strictly enforce the community against profanity

1731
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
There's no profane

1732
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
El Diablo here

1733
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
It's a bad term

1734
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
But there really isn't anything profane about it

1735
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's just really kind of a nasty, spun comment

1736
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
So of course

1737
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
EA was like oh our bad, sorry about that

1738
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And they apologized as a glitch between

1739
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Suspending the user account for

1740
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Forums versus suspending the full blown

1741
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Account for the game

1742
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
They have since apologized to the player

1743
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And moved on after some gamer backlash

1744
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Isn't that ironic?

1745
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
They had to come back and apologize, sorry

1746
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
We're the devil and Banjuu

1747
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And Rob and I have posted and read

1748
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Some of the WoW forms and things like that

1749
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And there's some pretty angsty 12 year olds on there

1750
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But this is pretty bad

1751
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I kind of wish Blizzard did this

1752
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Like read the forum posts and was like

1753
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Oops, sorry we banned you

1754
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
My bad

1755
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Be careful what you say on the...

1756
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
We need to take that Ragnarok Online approach

1757
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You want to talk bad about our game? We ban you

1758
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
You can't play the game anymore

1759
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
How do you like that?

1760
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It just proves that you better watch or see on the internet

1761
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And this is obviously a mistake

1762
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
This is not what happens if you were to

1763
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Call EA the devil or go off with profane language on their website

1764
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So

1765
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Just something kind of funny

1766
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
But it just shows how much control

1767
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Video game distributors do have

1768
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
They can flip a switch and you're gone

1769
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Or you're banned or you're suspended

1770
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
That's right, so you guys think twice next time

1771
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
About calling EA the devil

1772
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Call them dirty come guzzlers instead

1773
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Hot

1774
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Let's travel the world and look at some release dates

1775
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Let's start with the US, Loki

1776
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
This week's not a lot of stuff coming out

1777
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
We got a few budget games and then

1778
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Some decent stuff

1779
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So starting off with the budget games

1780
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Maximum Racing Dragonstock and Maximum Racing

1781
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
GP Classic Racing

1782
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
These are very budget games coming out for the Wii

1783
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Let's see

1784
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
God's Eater Burst

1785
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Coming out on PSP this week

1786
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
From D3

1787
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Looks pretty awesome

1788
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Jakandia and the Timeless Land

1789
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
This is a game that's very similar to

1790
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
30 Second Hero

1791
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So I believe this is the one that actually lets you

1792
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Pick how much time you have

1793
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And then you can play the game for that long

1794
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And then of course

1795
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
On the Wii, Trackmania Build to Race

1796
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Awesome game on the PC

1797
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So I'm sure it would be pretty good on the Wii

1798
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Homefront

1799
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
The big game for this week

1800
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
On Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC

1801
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Kind of

1802
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
The first that we'll see

1803
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Of the Just Dance series

1804
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But a little bit of a spin-off

1805
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Dance on Broadway coming into Playstation 3

1806
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
For the move

1807
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Also on Playstation 3

1808
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yakuza 4

1809
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
With less stuff changed this time

1810
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
From the Japanese version

1811
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Artun Liko

1812
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Is it just me or was that kind of a fast turnaround this time?

1813
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It was a pretty fast turnaround

1814
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Artun Liko Koga

1815
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Nel of Arseal

1816
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
On Playstation 3 this week as well

1817
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Let's see

1818
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Also

1819
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

1820
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And I believe the Wii

1821
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Top Spin 4

1822
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Coming out this week as well

1823
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And then

1824
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Surprisingly enough

1825
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The Xbox 360 version of this got cancelled

1826
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But Warriors Legend of Troy

1827
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's a

1828
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Trojan version of Dynasty Warriors

1829
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
So check that out

1830
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And then finally

1831
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
We've got another Ubisoft

1832
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Fitness game

1833
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Fit in 6 on the Wii and Playstation 3

1834
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Of course Playstation 3

1835
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
With move support there

1836
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's kind of like their answer to the Arseal fitness

1837
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Since that never came out on other systems

1838
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Other than the 360

1839
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
That's

1840
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That's it for this week

1841
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yes, that's it

1842
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Alright, I'm gonna move on to Japanese release dates

1843
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I do realize things going on

1844
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Could have an effect on this

1845
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
On the Xbox 360

1846
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Dragon Age Origins Awakening

1847
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
That would be the expansion to the original Dragon Age

1848
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It's gonna be out on March 17th

1849
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Going on to the Playstation 3

1850
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And checking out some of the releases there

1851
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yakuza

1852
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'm sorry, that's a US release

1853
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Motorstorm 3 Apocalypse

1854
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Comes out in Japan

1855
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
As well as the Dragon Age Origins expansion

1856
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Ryu Ga Gotoku of the End

1857
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Comes out in Japan as well

1858
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I'm not sure what that

1859
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Game is, it's from Sega

1860
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And it's related to the Yakuza universe

1861
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But I think it's a bit more of the action adventure

1862
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Type of game, so there you go

1863
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Let's see

1864
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Coming out on some other systems

1865
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Want to see the Wii real quick

1866
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
If there's anything coming out there

1867
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I don't believe so

1868
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
No, nothing this week because of course

1869
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Nintendo's focused on the 3DS

1870
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And the recent launch that happened there

1871
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So you can check out Steel Diver this week in Japan

1872
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
And Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D

1873
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Is on the 3DS this week in Japan

1874
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
And lastly

1875
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
On the PSP

1876
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
We have

1877
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Where to go

1878
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
No, I guess

1879
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Is there anything on the PSP this week?

1880
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Doesn't look like it

1881
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
For some reason I'm not able to find the dates on my list

1882
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
There we go, never mind, there it is

1883
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
The Little Battlers is the big release

1884
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
On the PSP this week

1885
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Little Battlers

1886
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Is a game from level 5

1887
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It's an RPG coming out over there

1888
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Looks like you battle these

1889
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Little kind of polygonal

1890
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Types of things, it looks a little bit

1891
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Valkyria profile to me

1892
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Kind of mixed with traditional RPG mechanics

1893
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So that could be kind of neat

1894
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
So there you go, that's it for Japanese releases

1895
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
What about the UK?

1896
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Alright, so from our friends across the pond

1897
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Coming out on Ides of March

1898
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Is Total War Shotgun 2

1899
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Coming out on PC

1900
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And then for releases on the 18th Friday

1901
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on PC

1902
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We also have coming up God's Eater Burst

1903
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
On the PSP

1904
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I'm just intrigued by the title

1905
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Homefront is coming out on the 360

1906
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
PS3 and PC

1907
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Also again on Friday the 18th

1908
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
MotoGP coming out

1909
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Also on Friday, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions

1910
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on the PS3

1911
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Okimada and Chisaki Taio

1912
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
See, I could do Chinese

1913
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Japanese pretty well, huh?

1914
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I was worried about any

1915
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I was worried about any type of Japanese releases

1916
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I had in my read tonight

1917
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Coming out on DS

1918
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Also Topspin 4 for 360, PS3 and Wii

1919
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Coming out

1920
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And finally Yakuza 4 is mentioned before

1921
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Coming out on the 18th for PS3

1922
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I remember buying Topspin

1923
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Original for 360 and was not a fan

1924
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It made me frustrated

1925
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I did not like the original Topspin game

1926
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It was on 360 either

1927
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
That's it this week for the UK

1928
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alright

1929
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Just a few more news stories for you guys

1930
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And then we're going to get to the classic game of the week

1931
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
But first, something from Loki

1932
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm very distracted right now

1933
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
What was that?

1934
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
They finally released the Grand Theft Auto 4 texture editor

1935
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Remember the one that got ripped off for Trend to Buy?

1936
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah, someone finally released it

1937
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
All the things I can do

1938
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It's just so mind boggling

1939
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Anyways, let's talk about Pokémon

1940
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Apparently

1941
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
There was a rumor

1942
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And of course, you know there's always rumors for the stuff coming from Twitter

1943
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
There was a rumor

1944
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Back when this whole disaster

1945
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Went down in Japan

1946
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That the Pokémon creator died

1947
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That would have been tragic

1948
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Except it's not true

1949
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Basically

1950
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
The company tweeted back

1951
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
They said, false

1952
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Pokémon company and Game Freak is fine

1953
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So

1954
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
No one's dead

1955
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Some people are sick

1956
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
That's all

1957
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Sick

1958
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Maybe

1959
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
It was a very unfortunate case

1960
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
A mistaken identity or mistranslation

1961
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But unfortunately

1962
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
That probably was not the case

1963
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Sick people

1964
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Alright, moving on

1965
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
One other news story for you guys

1966
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Free Realms

1967
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't know if you've ever checked this game out

1968
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
It's a casual MMO

1969
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
The weird thing is it's free to play

1970
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's coming out on the Playstation 3

1971
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
The funny thing is

1972
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's coming out very soon

1973
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
March 29th

1974
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It was originally on the PC

1975
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And now it's going to be a free to play casual MMO

1976
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
On the Playstation Network

1977
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So it's not like DC Universe Online

1978
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Which is kind of the other big MMO on Playstation 3 right now

1979
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Free Realms

1980
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Is going to be different

1981
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
They say that they did take some things

1982
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
From DC Universe Online, Sony Online Entertainment

1983
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Of course in developing this

1984
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But basically

1985
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
This is kind of something basically new

1986
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
They had to port the rendering over from the

1987
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Old engine from the PC

1988
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
The PS3 version unfortunately

1989
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Will be independent of the PC version

1990
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You will not be able to play with your friends

1991
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
On the PC version

1992
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Being able to link the accounts unfortunately isn't possible

1993
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So it'll be interesting to see how this

1994
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Works on the Playstation 3

1995
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Again it's a free to play MMO

1996
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So I would assume that means on the PS3

1997
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's going to be that way as well

1998
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Maybe it's one of those things that's only open to Playstation Plus though

1999
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I don't know

2000
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
No word on that yet

2001
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
So we'll see when the game comes out in just a couple weeks

2002
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Alright for now

2003
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
It's that time of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane

2004
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And look at the classic game of the week

2005
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Every week here on the show

2006
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Dark Soccer likes to step into the vault of classic gaming

2007
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And pull out a game that she thinks you guys should be checking out this week

2008
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Unfortunately she's not here this week

2009
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So we all decided to run into the vault

2010
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And knock everything over

2011
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
And let everything kind of pile up on the floor

2012
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
In one big pile

2013
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
We jumped on in, pulled one game out

2014
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
And this is what we got

2015
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
After we smashed everything with the hammer

2016
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
And locked me in the vault for 24 hours

2017
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
No I'm kidding

2018
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
We decided since Matt 2 was good enough to step in

2019
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And fill in for Jamie tonight

2020
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Why doesn't he get to pick the classic game of the week

2021
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
What did you pick for the classic game of the week?

2022
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Well I'll never presume to take over for Jamie

2023
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But I'm honored to do this segment here

2024
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So after being locked in the vault for 24 hours

2025
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
And a dog pile ensued

2026
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I sifted through it and found

2027
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
This little gem on Super Nintendo

2028
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
One of my favorites

2029
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Actraiser

2030
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And Actraiser was produced

2031
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And distributed back in 1990

2032
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So 20 years ago

2033
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh my god I'm so old

2034
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Exclusive for Super Nintendo at the time

2035
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It was put out by Enix then

2036
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Now Squeenix as we know it

2037
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And the whole idea of this game was

2038
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
It was two fold

2039
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
You were a platform side scrolling

2040
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Action as well as

2041
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
City building almost like RTS

2042
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And the whole premise was that

2043
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You were god, or a god I should say

2044
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And you would have to run around

2045
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And kill stuff and defend the land

2046
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You then also

2047
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Once you completed the level which was

2048
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Again very basic side scrolling levels here

2049
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You would then turn into an angel

2050
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And fly around and protect the city

2051
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
From other monsters

2052
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And you could see his butt

2053
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
You could definitely see his ass

2054
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
You fly around in an angel form

2055
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And help defend the city

2056
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
You would also have to do things like

2057
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Help crops grow by being god

2058
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
You'd have to make it rain on the crops

2059
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And lightning to burn bushes

2060
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
So your city could grow and things like that

2061
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
At the time when I was playing it

2062
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I really enjoyed the music from the game

2063
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
The gameplay is pretty straight forward on the platform side

2064
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And the angel

2065
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Side scrolling or RTS side

2066
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
But

2067
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
So anywho, a little bit more background about the game

2068
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Again the idea that you were a god or a master

2069
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
And you take the form of

2070
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
The overseer in a cloud

2071
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Not cloud saves, but just cloud

2072
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And then when your citizens call upon you to help defend the land

2073
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
You would beam on down

2074
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
To the world and take over

2075
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
In a humanoid form

2076
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
The funny part is

2077
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
There was an Actraiser 2

2078
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Really a prequel to the game

2079
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But a lot of religious subtext

2080
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Was discovered about it

2081
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
People were concerned about the game

2082
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Because in the Japanese text for this prequel

2083
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
They actually called the main character god

2084
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
And the villain of the game Satan

2085
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So here we are talking about the devil again tonight Rob

2086
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
But it was a very

2087
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
It was a very

2088
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Engaging game because again it had two

2089
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Parts to it, you had to again defend the city

2090
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
And build your cities

2091
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
If you didn't do these certain tasks

2092
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Your citizens would die and you would lose the game

2093
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
One of my favorites

2094
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It later came out for Virtual Console

2095
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And also released on

2096
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Mobile phone devices

2097
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So this is out there to play

2098
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And I don't know

2099
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I just really enjoyed the music from this game

2100
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So your classic video game of the week

2101
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Is Actraiser

2102
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
On Super Nintendo and Virtual Console and Mobile Phone

2103
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
An excellent fucking choice

2104
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And I remember when

2105
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Matt too told me what game he wanted to do for the classic game of the week

2106
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I was like no Jamie had to have picked that at some point

2107
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Well I asked her about it. I was like go check the wiki

2108
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Jamie picked that right

2109
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And it hadn't been picked yet

2110
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Well I checked the wiki just to be certain

2111
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
And then I sent her a message

2112
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
And said hey these are the three games I

2113
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Would like to review

2114
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
And these are on the wiki that I want to run past you

2115
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
She goes oh I totally had Actraiser on my list to do

2116
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So yeah go ahead and take that

2117
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I also gave two other suggestions to Rob

2118
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I told him one of them

2119
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I think he was impressed on how far back

2120
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
My video gaming experience went

2121
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Do you remember the game I told you?

2122
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
But Congo Bongo?

2123
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I totally remember that game from the Atari 5200

2124
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
But anywho

2125
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So Actraiser

2126
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Is definitely a great game. Check it out

2127
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Let's not take attention away from Actraiser

2128
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Because this game is amazing

2129
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It's definitely in my top 10 video games ever

2130
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
The sequel doesn't hold a candle to it

2131
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And it actually bankrupt the series I think

2132
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
That's too bad

2133
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Like Enix made so many good freaking games

2134
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
On the Super Nintendo

2135
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm not even talking about Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior

2136
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That series. I'm talking about

2137
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
The Illusion of Gaia

2138
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
And that whole series

2139
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
That was in Soul Blazer

2140
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I think was one of the other games

2141
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
That whole series was awesome

2142
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And of course they were the ones that did Busta Move

2143
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
depending on what country you were in

2144
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
That was all Enix

2145
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And a lot of that has disappeared since the Square merger

2146
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Which is unfortunate

2147
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
One of the most graphic things about this game was

2148
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Whenever you had to warp down to the world to defend it

2149
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
The screen would spin around

2150
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And it was just high-tech

2151
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And it made you feel like you were falling

2152
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Into the earth

2153
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
So as your citizens

2154
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Gain power-ups and learn smarter

2155
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
They can learn how to build better

2156
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Buildings and better crops

2157
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And things like that

2158
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It definitely had a SimCities

2159
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And a platform feel to it

2160
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Definitely check it out

2161
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Thank you to the week for the Super Nintendo from Enix

2162
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Actraiser

2163
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
And for heaven's sake, at least just listen to this soundtrack

2164
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Because it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever

2165
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I believe it's Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack to that

2166
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Who's um, just

2167
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
No, no, what am I saying?

2168
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
She sang a song

2169
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
For like Evangelion or something

2170
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yuzo Koshiro did the music to that

2171
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And he did

2172
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
He did a DDR song back in the day

2173
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I believe he's the same guy that does Wangan Midnight

2174
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Maximum Tune, Streets of Rage

2175
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Lots of great stuff

2176
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
So, very cool

2177
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Alright, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio

2178
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
But fear not, there's plenty more of

2179
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
OLR to come when we get back

2180
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Including the mailbag, your tweets

2181
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
So get those in please, your Twitters

2182
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Twitter.com slash OLR to get in your tweets

2183
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And of course, more news, we're going to talk about those

2184
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Dance Hero rumors, some games being

2185
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Cancelled at Sony, and what's going to

2186
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Happen to NBA Jam

2187
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
We'll find out after this, a quick break with more

2188
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2189
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2190
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
We are live tonight with the

2191
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
405th episode of our show

2192
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
On this March 13th of 2011

2193
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
We are live at All Games Radio

2194
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
As we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific

2195
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

2196
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Obviously, it's been a crazy week

2197
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And if you are just joining us

2198
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I did make a plea in Part A

2199
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
And I'll say it again, please, please, please

2200
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
For those folks in Japan

2201
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
That have had to go through such a

2202
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Crazy, horrific thing going on

2203
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Right now, please consider donating to the

2204
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Red Cross, you can go to

2205
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Redcross.org, I'm really

2206
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Encouraging all of our listeners to part with

2207
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
$10, it's not that much

2208
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That's like less than the cost of one month

2209
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Of an MMO, that's an Xbox Live Arcade game

2210
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You can go without this week

2211
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And put the money to where it's really, really

2212
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Needed right now, anyhow

2213
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Moving on, we're gonna get back into some gaming news

2214
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
And some rapid fire news, and your Twitter

2215
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
All the tweets at twitter.com

2216
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Slash o-l-r, we'll read those on the show here in

2217
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Just a minute, so get those in, this is your last chance

2218
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Also, I gotta do a plug

2219
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
For the spin-off shows, unfortunately Dark

2220
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Sakura's not here tonight, but she does do a

2221
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Fun little show with Mara & Marvel

2222
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And Dan Shadow, it's called Comic Insanity

2223
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
But that's with no I, it's

2224
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Comic N-sanity, and you can find

2225
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That on Twitter, or you can also find it at

2226
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Infamous.net, again, just the letter

2227
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
N, Infamous.net

2228
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
If you like World of Warcraft, check out my

2229
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Spin-off show with X-Defer, the best little

2230
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Horde house in Azeroth, also known

2231
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
As Horde House for short

2232
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And all of that coming

2233
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
To a new website also this week

2234
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
That I'll be able to give out, and I'm very excited

2235
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So that's all on its way to being done

2236
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
In the meantime,

2237
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Some rapid fire news, some quick stories

2238
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
For you guys, let's start with Loki

2239
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
According to the

2240
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
New issue of the French gaming magazine

2241
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Joystick, Bethesda's next

2242
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Game in their, well, next

2243
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Announced game is gonna be Prey 2

2244
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
That's right, the sequel to the

2245
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
First person shooter game that came out from

2246
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
3D Realms and 2K games

2247
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Wow. Of course, 3D Realms is no

2248
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Longer around, and you know

2249
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Bethesda was purchased by

2250
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
ZeniMax

2251
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Which snatched up the

2252
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Company ID software

2253
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So it makes perfect sense that they're gonna be putting out

2254
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Shooter games

2255
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
No word exactly on when that's coming out

2256
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But probably something that we'll be

2257
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Hearing more about during E3 this year

2258
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I'm kind of surprised that Prey is getting a sequel

2259
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Because the first one didn't really do too hot

2260
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I mean, it was a good game

2261
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Especially for dummies

2262
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Like, it was a first person shooter for dummies

2263
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Because you can never die in Prey, and that's one of the things

2264
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I really liked about it, because I suck at first person shooters

2265
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
The story was pretty good too

2266
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Even though it totally cut off abruptly

2267
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Like, you play in the game and then it's over

2268
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It was weird

2269
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
For a sequel

2270
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah, kind of like that

2271
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
But not really

2272
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Without the journey

2273
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This is kind of a neat little Easter egg

2274
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I guess for the Google Chrome browser

2275
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
If you're using it

2276
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
There's actually a piece of JavaScript

2277
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You can paste into the Chrome's

2278
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Address

2279
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
And when you do that

2280
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
It activates a hack which reloads a page

2281
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And basically allows you to

2282
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Roll around a ball

2283
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
A katamari ball, to be exact

2284
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And pick up all the words

2285
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And images on the screen like you would a katamari

2286
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Awesome

2287
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
And you can find this piece of code

2288
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
At kathack.com

2289
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That's K-A-T

2290
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Hack.com

2291
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And check it out

2292
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
It's kind of a neat one

2293
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Does it play the music too?

2294
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I don't think it does

2295
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
But thanks to the advent of

2296
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
The MP3

2297
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
You would provide your own soundtrack

2298
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
For your web page rolling up

2299
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Adventures

2300
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It's just not the same

2301
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And then finally

2302
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
There's a company out of

2303
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
San Francisco that wants to make your life

2304
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
The RPG

2305
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
So basically it's life

2306
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
The RPG

2307
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
But it's you

2308
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It's coming from a company called

2309
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Green Goose

2310
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And basically what it is

2311
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Is this package that you get

2312
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It's packaged with a water bottle

2313
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Toothbrush and vitamin container

2314
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
And it says the Green Goose

2315
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Logs how many times a week

2316
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
That you say for example

2317
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Pick up their toothbrush or whatever

2318
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Awarding them points each time that they do

2319
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
There's sensors on the bottles

2320
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And on the toothbrush for tracking

2321
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
As well as a credit card size

2322
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Pedometer that communicates with the

2323
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Base station that's attached

2324
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
To a broadband router

2325
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
The points that the player earns

2326
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Will

2327
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Not really do anything

2328
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But it's meant

2329
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
To encourage a healthy

2330
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Lifestyle I guess

2331
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And clean teeth

2332
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Okie dokie

2333
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I don't know

2334
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Neat

2335
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
This is something I can see them selling

2336
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
At a dentist office or something like that

2337
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I remember all those toothbrushing

2338
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Games and stuff that you could play on

2339
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
With the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64

2340
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That were supposed to like you know

2341
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Teach the good habits and all that

2342
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
It would be kind of funny

2343
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Like a life of the game or something like that

2344
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Well they kind of have that

2345
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Like in the 3DS where you earn points for walking

2346
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Or shaking

2347
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The 3DS

2348
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And you award the same points

2349
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
For walking or throttling something

2350
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Alright

2351
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Let's move on here to some

2352
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Other news about the Legend of

2353
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Zelda the Ocarina of Time 3D

2354
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
There is some

2355
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
New things that are supposed to be in there

2356
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's not just a direct port

2357
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Of the 64 version

2358
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
The 3DS version is supposed to have some other

2359
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Stuff and this is in an interview that

2360
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Happened with Miyamoto

2361
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Talking about the 3DS version of Ocarina

2362
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Of Time. Apparently they've set up a new system

2363
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Where when you use the A, B and X, Y

2364
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Buttons there's also some special buttons in the

2365
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Touch screen that you can use to switch

2366
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Between the items right away

2367
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Between maps and menus and so forth

2368
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Also one other

2369
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Little teaser that's there

2370
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
From Satoru Iwata says

2371
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Of course the Nintendo 3DS version of

2372
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Ocarina of Time is crammed with interesting

2373
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Things that weren't in the Nintendo 64 version

2374
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
But we'll wait to talk about those

2375
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
To the release

2376
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
By the way

2377
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Quick follow up from SX in our chat room on the

2378
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Katamari Damacy add-in. It does play the music

2379
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Just so you know

2380
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Well that's good to know. That's coming from our chat

2381
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Some rumors about Grand Theft Auto 5

2382
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Is the code name Rush

2383
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
That could be what's going on

2384
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I guess that's some casting

2385
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Details that were done on a Google search

2386
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Apparently there's this project called Rush

2387
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And it has to do with Grand Theft Auto 5

2388
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Rush is tied to Take-Two Interactive

2389
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
They own Rockstar Games

2390
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Apparently it's a video game

2391
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Set in the Los Angeles area

2392
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So maybe they've gone from New York to L.A.

2393
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Who knows but that is apparently

2394
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Some of the rumors about the game

2395
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Some of the casting that is in the game

2396
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
There's a 38 year old FBI agent

2397
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
In grape shape

2398
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
A 25 year old young Mexican-American

2399
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
FBI agent

2400
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
23 year old moron

2401
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
White trash hillbilly named Clyde

2402
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And so on and so on

2403
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
So lots of parts that they're casting for

2404
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
That's either going to be a Grand Theft Auto game

2405
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Which I can only hope

2406
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Or it's going to be a sequel to Midnight

2407
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Club L.A.

2408
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And lastly, Valve is going to be

2409
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Bridging Portal and Portal 2

2410
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
With some type of surprise

2411
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
We don't exactly know what that is

2412
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But that was from

2413
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Coming out of PAX East

2414
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Something that will tie the story

2415
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Of the interim time between Portal and Portal 2

2416
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Is that a comic book?

2417
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Is that an arcade game?

2418
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Is that YouTube?

2419
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Who knows?

2420
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Apparently something will be coming to tie

2421
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
The two worlds together in the future

2422
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
So we'll see

2423
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Matt 2?

2424
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
This is Strong by Trapped

2425
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
That's just half of what's in that pack

2426
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
These are all those angsty

2427
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Boy frat bands that you like

2428
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yes, this is good music, Rob

2429
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It sounds like men with vaginas

2430
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
When I hear it

2431
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I'm sure a lot of our listeners

2432
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Are like, you're an asshole, Rob

2433
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
You like Lady Gaga

2434
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I heard she did a great song

2435
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That copied Madonna's song

2436
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Weren't you in the middle of some news?

2437
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yes sir, let me continue

2438
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So check that out if you're into rock music

2439
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Other stories that are coming up

2440
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
There it goes

2441
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Torchlight

2442
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Rob talked about this in his gaming week

2443
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
He's tried Torchlight, it mimics Diablo 2

2444
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
And all that's great

2445
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
But it was cancelled in Japan

2446
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Due to text bugs

2447
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And due to translation delays

2448
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
So basically Torchlight was there

2449
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
It was set to launch in the Xbox Live Arcade

2450
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And when it came down to it

2451
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
It was just abruptly cancelled

2452
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Due to some various

2453
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
It's a weird reason to cancel a game

2454
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
It's a very weird reason

2455
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Various reasons to go back and forth

2456
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
There must have been a dirty word

2457
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
In mistranslation or something

2458
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I don't know, there was a lot of debate

2459
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Whether it was a bug or a text issue

2460
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Everyone was pointing at each other's fingers

2461
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
But basically it was quoted saying

2462
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
We're not privy to the decision making process

2463
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
But it was due to bugs in the translation

2464
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Because the game has never been translated

2465
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
To Japanese

2466
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Since there was no existing Japanese version

2467
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Of the game, the complexity of a new translation

2468
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Combined with the randomly generated naming

2469
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Scheme for Torchlight

2470
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Made it beyond the scope of the project

2471
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You would think that if they were going to release something

2472
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
In two different countries

2473
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And countries had different languages

2474
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
They would include that in the scope of the project

2475
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It still just seems so abrupt

2476
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Too hard, I don't want to do this

2477
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I don't understand!

2478
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Google Translate won't work for this game

2479
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Rob, you made a point that the text

2480
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
On the screen was awfully small

2481
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Yeah, maybe you couldn't read it

2482
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
So maybe the Japanese videography of the characters

2483
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Didn't look right

2484
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So who knows

2485
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Maybe look for that in the future if they figure out how to translate it

2486
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Or maybe that's just wah wah wah

2487
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
So, unfortunately no Torchlight

2488
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
For the Xbox Live

2489
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
For the Japanese version

2490
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And

2491
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I really don't want to have to share this news

2492
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Because the first iteration of this was

2493
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Just so horrible

2494
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
There's work that a new

2495
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Doom movie is coming out

2496
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Yes

2497
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
We all remember in 2005 The Rock

2498
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Dwayne Johnson

2499
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Did a

2500
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Wonderful version of Doom

2501
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
In an attempt to

2502
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Do a movie on the first person shooter that

2503
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Got us in the early 90s

2504
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But there's a reboot in the works

2505
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
That's going to completely ignore Dwayne Johnson's

2506
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
First version, thank god

2507
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And of course, like everything else

2508
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
In this frickin' time and day

2509
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It'll be in 3D

2510
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Oh, of course

2511
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Will we have scenes with a gun in 3D?

2512
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Probably

2513
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Was that in the first movie?

2514
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It wasn't in 3D, but the perspective

2515
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
You were running around for parts

2516
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
The scene with a gun swinging back and forth

2517
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Like you were in the video game

2518
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I would be okay with this if they just

2519
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Took Doom 3D

2520
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Sorry, I'm just looking real quick

2521
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I'm trying to bring back some memories here

2522
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Oh god, please don't

2523
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
I saw this on

2524
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
USA Network or TNT or something like that

2525
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I think they cut out all the violence

2526
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Oh, they did, and the swearing

2527
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Swearing in violence would have made it better

2528
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Yeah, it was just bad

2529
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Doom is waiting

2530
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
So there's no release date, there's no nothing

2531
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It's just in the preliminary works and it's just

2532
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
A new project in the early stages

2533
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Yay, another Hollywood reboot, just what we needed

2534
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And in 3D, can't forget it's in 3D

2535
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
We've run out of ideas, completely

2536
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Exactly, so

2537
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Time to remake crap

2538
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Look for that, hopefully, in the near future

2539
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, can't wait

2540
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
There will be no hopefully looking forward to

2541
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Much anticipation, alright

2542
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I promised someone we'd do a quick phone call here

2543
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
At this point in the show, so we're gonna make a phone call real quick

2544
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
And try to get this all taken care of

2545
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I hope it's going through

2546
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I'm kind of relying on Skype tonight

2547
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And sometimes it can be a little

2548
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
There we go, one ringy dingy

2549
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Two ringy dingys

2550
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Hopefully there's an answer, that might be quite embarrassing

2551
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
What?

2552
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Hi, is this Dark Sakura?

2553
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Yes, this is

2554
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
How are you, did you make it to Disneyland in one piece?

2555
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Well we're not at Disneyland yet

2556
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
We're going tomorrow, but we

2557
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
We made it to the hotel room

2558
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
You're in that area, right?

2559
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I can look out of the window

2560
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
And see the parking structure

2561
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
There you go, now

2562
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Aren't you down there because you get to hang out with the official

2563
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
OLR lesbians this week, or at least one of them?

2564
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Well both of them on Tuesday

2565
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
We're going to Goofy's Kitchen together

2566
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yay, well be sure to tell them

2567
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
We all said hi and everything

2568
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Well, you know, I was gonna try to

2569
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Unfortunately it didn't work out, I was gonna have you plug

2570
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Your spin-off show, but I already did that for you

2571
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
The whole comic insanity

2572
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But do you want to tell us anything about your gaming week?

2573
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Or anything maybe you've been doing to pass the time in the car?

2574
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Like on the iOS games?

2575
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Well, I played a little solitaire

2576
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Mostly I was vlogging

2577
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And just singing along with us

2578
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And just singing along with us

2579
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Some classic rock that happened to come on

2580
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Awesome

2581
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
On a CD that I made so I knew it was on there

2582
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And played some Marvel vs Capcom 3 during the week

2583
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Nice

2584
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Wow

2585
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Looking forward to the new characters to be

2586
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Paid to unlock?

2587
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Well we're getting Shima Grass

2588
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Jill's not worth it

2589
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Jill's not worth it

2590
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
So I gotta say Matt 2 is doing a

2591
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Pretty good job filling in tonight

2592
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
His classic game of the week was very well received

2593
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But he totally set the vault

2594
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
On fire and I

2595
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Just want to apologize for that in advance

2596
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
That everything is on fire

2597
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
You realize Dan's going to

2598
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Castrate you before he kills you right?

2599
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
All of you

2600
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Dan scares Matt 2

2601
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Although I

2602
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Did admit

2603
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
The vault wasn't

2604
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
On fire it was a small

2605
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Ember burning and you

2606
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Overreacted and luckily they had a dry

2607
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Chem fire extinguisher under the sink and I put it out

2608
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
He was putting his cigarette out in there

2609
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And I'm kidding I'm totally kidding

2610
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
We haven't even gone in there

2611
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I know I know

2612
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Matt 2 brought me beer tonight and not you

2613
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Ha

2614
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Okay

2615
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
It wasn't true oh well for our fashion list

2616
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
One of the hosts was slightly intoxicated

2617
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I offered it to Loki

2618
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
In disbelief and then said err

2619
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
And handed it to Rob so

2620
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Alright so we're about to

2621
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
We're about to get into Twitter topics but is there

2622
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Anything you want to say to the listeners tonight?

2623
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I have the best husband ever

2624
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Why is that?

2625
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I just do

2626
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
He's pretty cool

2627
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
He's okay

2628
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Because he's awesome

2629
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And he likes

2630
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
The pita sandwiches at the place you took me to

2631
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
This week and that was pretty awesome alright

2632
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
That's what we had for breakfast

2633
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh no I just kicked

2634
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Shermie on accident I'm sorry Shermie

2635
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Did you notice what I did for you?

2636
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I washed her

2637
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Bed so it would not stink

2638
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
For you

2639
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
That is a big cat

2640
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I washed her

2641
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
I washed her butt for you

2642
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Thank you that's so kind

2643
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Because it would not stink

2644
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Because her butt stinks

2645
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
The great lengths you go to for

2646
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Okay so we

2647
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Got to get back into video gaming news but I

2648
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Wanted you to at least be able to say hello to the

2649
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Listeners so anything else before I let you go?

2650
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Listeners?

2651
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Why do I care? No hi

2652
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Hi everybody

2653
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I'm at Disneyland and you're not

2654
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You guys stay safe have tons of fun

2655
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
At the park tomorrow tell the OLR lesbians

2656
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We said hi and Marissa too

2657
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
If you end up seeing her and

2658
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Marissa has a disease

2659
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Aww how sad

2660
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
She's in bed with cold chills

2661
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And running fever disease

2662
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Aww sorry to hear it

2663
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So everyone send Marissa happy thoughts because we

2664
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Love Marissa

2665
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Alright well you have fun take care

2666
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Until then we said hey

01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Will do bye

2668
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And we only stole one game

2669
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
And we only stole one game

2670
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Okay it better be Gyromite

2671
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
We've got like three of them

2672
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Okay bye

2673
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
She totally just gave us permission to steal

2674
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Gyromite sweet alright

2675
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Is there Robbie back there too?

2676
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
There might be I don't know

2677
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Alright let's get to some Twitter topics

2678
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I've been messing around but I wanted

2679
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
You know she wanted to come on the show at some point

2680
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000

2684
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000

2685
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
No I'm kidding um

2686
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Spazinator starts us off tonight sending us some tweets

A rental of Ghost Rider and a few TV shows

01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And he actually linked us to a

2699
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Blog post I guess Sony

2700
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Is now actually blogging about this stuff

2701
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And some of the free movies there's some

2702
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000

Network so check that out also

2712
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Uh yeah they're blogging all about that on the official

2713
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
PlayStation Blog so

2714
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Poor Spazinator's gonna have to find something else to talk about

2715
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
On the show if I could just log into the PlayStation

2716
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Blog and see the video releases now

2717
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I'm kidding

2718
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Alright

2719
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Moving on a few folks talking

2720
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
To us from PAX East hopefully someone will

2721
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Call in when we get to the calls

2722
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Let's see ActDeaf wants to tell us about a new

2723
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Rhythm game coming to PlayStation Network

2724
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Called Dyad

2725
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Who was shown at PAX East

2726
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Linking us to a little trailer here

2727
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
On YouTube hold on let me uh

2728
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Let me stop the cute music here

2729
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
You're like zooming down this tunnel

2730
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's kinda like a Wipeout HD

2731
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Mixed with uh

2732
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Oh what was that frickin game

2733
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Audio Surf on uh

2734
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Steam

2735
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
That's what this looks like to me

2736
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
It's cute

2737
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I'm not sure how that's a music game

2738
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I like it, it's like Chiptunes or something

2739
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Is the music, I wonder if that's the whole deal

2740
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I will have to wait and see

2741
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
If that's the whole deal

2742
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I will have to research more about that

2743
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
A little later

2744
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Moving on to some more tweets

2745
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Reddertainment tweeting us saying

2746
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It's good to see Square issuing refunds

2747
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Over the Final Fantasy XI outage

2748
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Treats their customers better than the airlines

2749
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Would in the same situation

2750
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Oh snap good point, very good point

2751
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Tigerclaw wants to bring this up

2752
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
AT&T is going to be introducing a bandwidth cap

2753
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
For DSL and U-verse customers

2754
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
This May

2755
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Comcast folks have been dealing with this for some time

2756
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
But apparently now there is going to be

2757
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
A 150GB monthly usage cap

2758
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
For DSL customers and 250GB

2759
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Cap for U-verse users

2760
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Starting on May 2

2761
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
AT&T users from now through March 31

2762
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Are going to start receiving notices

2763
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Informing them of the change

2764
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
In the company's terms of service

2765
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
There will also be overage charges

2766
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
If you go over

2767
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I guess it's $10 for every 50GB

2768
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Over the 150 or 250GB limit

2769
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
That's actually not bad

2770
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Because Comcast has been doing this for a few months now

2771
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And they threaten to pull your coverage all together

2772
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
If you go over the 250GB cap

2773
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
It takes a lot to get over

2774
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
It takes a lot to get over 250GB

2775
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I was looking at my usage, I think in the month of January

2776
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I used 18GB

2777
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
And I play a lot of WoW y'all

2778
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I play a lot of WoW

2779
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I've never gone over 250GB

2780
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And I download a lot of

2781
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Porn

2782
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Not ISO's at all

2783
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
None of that

2784
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Never do that

2785
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But I could see with more and more

2786
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Streaming HD movies

2787
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Streaming HD movies is a couple gigs

2788
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So if you watch a

2789
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Streaming HD movie every day

2790
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
You might hit this cap

2791
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
It's a little bit unfortunate

2792
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Unlimited does not mean unlimited

2793
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Don't get me started on net neutrality

2794
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Oh my god

2795
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Can you believe if they started

2796
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Charging an extra $10 for Netflix

2797
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
At the top of what you already pay for Netflix

2798
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
It's ridiculous

2799
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
They'll just find a way around it

2800
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Now they said

2801
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
The whole net neutrality thing

2802
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
They can throttle bandwidth on different things

2803
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Because they have the right to do that now

2804
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Cable companies are going to destroy themselves

2805
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
With all this crap

2806
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Just watch

2807
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It's going to make piracy worse

2808
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
It's going to make piracy worse

2809
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
All the net neutrality stuff

2810
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Is going to make it worse

2811
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'm telling you

2812
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Just look at the behavior

2813
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Of the internet

2814
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And if you don't think that charging people extra money

2815
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
To access certain services is going to encourage people

2816
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
To get around that gate

2817
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Or for new services to start up to offer

2818
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
The same stuff in less legitimate ways

2819
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Just you wait

2820
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Tigerclaw

2821
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Sends us another tweet about

2822
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Voice acting in Portal 2

2823
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Announced at PAX

2824
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
JK Simmons will be doing a voice

2825
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
In Portal 2

2826
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
That is Juno's dad

2827
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
And from Spiderman

2828
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
J. Jonah Jameson

2829
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
JK Simmons will be doing this

2830
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Cave Johnson is the character

2831
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
The president and founder of Aperture Science

2832
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That's a pretty big role

2833
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
There you go

2834
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
That'll be fun

2835
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Was that demo at PAX East for Portal 2?

2836
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
That's pretty awesome if it was

2837
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Probably one of those behind closed doors things

2838
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Which is a little silly

2839
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Apparently a pro wrestler

2840
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Was one of the first to

2841
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Pitch a perfect MLB 2K11 game

2842
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Yeah here's the deal

2843
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Did you know that they're doing this

2844
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Contest right now for MLB 2K11

2845
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I saw a commercial for this the other day

2846
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
If you are the first to pitch a perfect game

2847
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
You can win a million dollars

2848
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
By being the first to

2849
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Pitch a perfect in this game

2850
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Kinda interesting

2851
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Perfect starting April 1st

2852
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Meaning that Mana

2853
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Who did this Michael Mana is the

2854
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Professional

2855
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Wrestler known as Stevie Richards

2856
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
He posted the video on YouTube

2857
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
But unfortunately this doesn't start

2858
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Until April 1st so the win doesn't actually

2859
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Count and it's supposed to be harder than it was

2860
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Last year because you can't

2861
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I think you have to actually use the

2862
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Legitimate rosters for players that are

2863
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Current up to that date

2864
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
You can't just power load

2865
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Your team or whatever

2866
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Like they did last year so

2867
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
It should be slightly harder

2868
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So it may take like

2869
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Two days instead of one day

2870
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
And lastly a tweet from

2871
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Blue Swim saying Dead or Alive

2872
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Announced for the

2873
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
3DS that there is going to be some

2874
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
DLC

2875
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So yes some DLC coming to the 3DS

2876
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And it's going to be

2877
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Let's see the series boss characters

2878
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Alpha 152, Alpha Kasumi

2879
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Genra and Tengu

2880
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I'm sorry they are not DLC they are just going to be

2881
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
A game which is pretty cool

2882
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
However free downloadable content

2883
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
28 additional costumes

2884
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Going to be free Cheerleader, Leifang

2885
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Ninja Outfit, Ayana

2886
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And so on and so on

2887
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
La Mera Posa in a white cat outfit

2888
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Indeed

2889
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
More information available in

2890
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Famitsu Magazine which broke the news

2891
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
This week that's pretty awesome

2892
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
That's going to do it for tweets

2893
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to show us your tweets

2894
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Next time

2895
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Let's go back into some news

2896
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Yes

2897
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
So

2898
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I don't know

2899
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I kind of

2900
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Ranted about this a little bit in the beginning

2901
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
But

2902
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Really Dance Hero

2903
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Apparently you know there were

2904
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Trademarks registered a while back

2905
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I remember we were talking about like a Tar villain

2906
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And Dance Hero and stuff like that

2907
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Oh no they are going to do something like DVR

2908
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Well now apparently

2909
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
There's some more

2910
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Info regarding it

2911
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Apparently they are saying that

2912
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
There are some artists

2913
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Working with

2914
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Activision on the franchise

2915
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Timbaland, J Sean

2916
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
The Prodigy and Afrojack all have

2917
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Songs I guess that are

2918
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Going to be in this

2919
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
It's

2920
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I don't know I mean I guess I could

2921
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
See them doing something similar like this

2922
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Like Dance Central because it's

2923
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
You know made money

2924
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
It's what's popular right now

2925
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And

2926
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I guess

2927
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
This is coming from I want to say

2928
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Some sort of

2929
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Like licensing

2930
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Thing or something I'm trying to see here real quick

2931
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I seem to remember some time

2932
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Ago we saw Activision licensing

2933
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
These things and we weren't sure what they were for

2934
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Wasn't some of it for DJ Hero

2935
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
But then some of it never really was explained

2936
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Yeah

2937
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Basically they're saying

2938
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
The songs that are licensed so far

2939
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
2012 by J Sean

2940
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Featuring Nicki Minaj

2941
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Out of Space by The Prodigy

2942
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
The Way I Are by Timbaland

2943
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Take Over Control by Afrojack

2944
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Yeah

2945
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I don't know what they're going to really do with this

2946
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I assume it's going to be something similar

2947
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Like Just Dance or

2948
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Dance Central

2949
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Trying to cash in

2950
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Thanks I hope

2951
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I hope they ruin this

2952
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Genre as well

2953
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Haven't you done enough

2954
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Bad

2955
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Interesting comment from Game Guru in our chatroom saying

2956
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't think Activision is following Dance Central

2957
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
They are following Just Dance

2958
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Okay

2959
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Those aren't that different

2960
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Well they aren't

2961
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But I also kind of see the point that

2962
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
He might be making there with the whole

2963
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Kind of the style of the games

2964
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
And the way they control

2965
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Is a little bit different

2966
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I guarantee this is probably going to be coming out in the fall

2967
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
This year

2968
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Because they're going to have to have something to fill

2969
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I mean what if they really announced

2970
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
That they're going to be putting out this year

2971
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Call of Duty

2972
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
My question is how is it going to be different

2973
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Because otherwise they're just setting themselves up for the same

2974
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Goddamn situation

2975
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
That got Guitar Hero canned

2976
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
If they come out at E3 and announce

2977
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
This fucking game

2978
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
They need to say and here's how it's different

2979
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
You better acknowledge your competition

2980
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
And tell us why it's better

2981
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Otherwise, fuck off

2982
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
For real

2983
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Our new Guitar Hero game is different because now it has drums

2984
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And singing

2985
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I don't care what it is

2986
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
You know Harmonix is bringing Dance Central 2 to E3 this year

2987
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
You know it

2988
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
That's got to be their thing that they're working on now

2989
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
You know that's going to be shown

2990
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So if you can walk down the hall

2991
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
And see Activision in their little game

2992
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
They better be prepared to say

2993
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
This is how our game is different

2994
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Otherwise I do not give a fuck

2995
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
And you better bet your ass that Ubisoft is bringing Just Dance

2996
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
To the other consoles this year as well

2997
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I mean that thing sold out like crazy

2998
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
On the Wii

2999
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Of course they're going to be bringing it to the connect and the move

3000
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So they've already got right there two competitors

3001
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
For this genre

3002
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And whatever Konami is going to just

3003
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Randomly show too

3004
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Could be involved in there too

3005
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Dance Masters exactly sold millions

3006
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
But you never know, Konami, bless their hearts

3007
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
They're still trying

3008
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
They got DDR

3009
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And props to them though for at least trying Dance Masters

3010
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
What I consider a very Japanese game

3011
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
You know what, you're right

3012
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Dance Masters is very

3013
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Different from Dance Central

3014
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
It really is

3015
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You're not really looking deep

3016
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
At the music game if you pass them both off

3017
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
As the same game

3018
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Because Dance Masters does function very different

3019
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
The thing that's kind of frustrating about it

3020
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Is the fact that it's so hard to really kind of

3021
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Get into, you know what I mean

3022
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It's just like

3023
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I guess it's very much like Para where you just

3024
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Do it

3025
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
And that's it

3026
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
If they had a little bit more structure

3027
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
If they had like an actual tutorial or something

3028
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
To it, it might be better

3029
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
But hey, you know, sequel

3030
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
That'd be kind of cool

3031
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Alright well Sony Europe

3032
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Has actually cancelled some games

3033
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Some of these were dance games

3034
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Like maybe SingStar, I don't know

3035
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
But unfortunately, I doubt that by the way

3036
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I'm just trolling

3037
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
But Sony Computer Entertainment Europe

3038
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Has mentioned to the staffs at Studio Liverpool

3039
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
London Studio, Evolution Studios

3040
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
That they are going to be streamlining

3041
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And closing various projects

3042
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
To move the development to other

3043
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Higher priority first party offerings

3044
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
So we're not talking layoffs or anything

3045
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
We're just talking about these little games you are making

3046
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Yeah, no, no, you need to come

3047
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But streamlining could lead to layoffs

3048
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Streamlines of corporate work for layoffs

3049
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
We don't know yet

3050
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The publisher went on to say

3051
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Quote, with the incredibly strong list of

3052
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Exclusive first party titles coming up both

3053
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
This year and in the near future

3054
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Resources should be reallocated to enhance those projects

3055
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Closer to completion

3056
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Maybe they're trying to rush to meet Christmas, I don't know

3057
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Sony exclusives?

3058
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Yeah, so who knows

3059
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Sony didn't say what projects were affected

3060
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
They didn't say anything about layoffs

3061
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
They did reiterate there is no impact

3062
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
In the role that the first party studios play

3063
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
It's just, I guess, moving the resources around

3064
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Maybe they didn't like that LittleBigPlanet 2

3065
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Didn't make Christmas because maybe it impacted

3066
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Sales, I bet it did

3067
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So maybe they're really stretching

3068
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
To make Christmas this year and they're really just

3069
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Bringing it home on some of the first party games

3070
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
They're really going to put it all behind

3071
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Which I could understand that

3072
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
And you know, there are some games

3073
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
When's that Twisted Metal game supposed to come out?

3074
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Is it this holiday? So they're going to show that again

3075
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
At E3, is it?

3076
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
They have a lot of stuff coming out

3077
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I mean, that's for sure

3078
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It's pre-packed first quarter for them

3079
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
And second quarter's starting off pretty strong

3080
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I mean, they've got

3081
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
First quarter so far, they've had LittleBigPlanet 2

3082
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
They're going to be having

3083
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Killzone 3

3084
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
DC Universe

3085
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
And PlayStation Move Heroes

3086
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Will be coming out

3087
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Possibly

3088
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Sorcery

3089
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I think the Eco and Shadow of the Colossus

3090
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Collection, although both of those

3091
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I think may have been delayed

3092
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
And then second quarter so far

3093
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
They've got SOCOM 4

3094
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Motorstorm Apocalypse

3095
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Infamous 2

3096
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
I mean, I wouldn't say

3097
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
They're definitely putting out their releases

3098
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
So who knows

3099
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I don't know what they're

3100
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Uncharted 3

3101
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
They have for the fourth quarter

3102
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Resistance 3

3103
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
And then

3104
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I guess

3105
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Twisted Metal, possibly

3106
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I wouldn't be surprised if that wouldn't be quarter one of next year

3107
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Alright

3108
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Well, let's move on with a couple more stories

3109
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
We'll get to the mailbag here in just a moment

3110
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But first, Matt2

3111
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Alright, so for those who are

3112
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
fans of NBA GM

3113
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Your time with that game might be coming

3114
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
to an end

3115
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
So EA Sports is kind of

3116
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Going out here and saying there will be no more

3117
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Roster updates or any type of post

3118
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Release support for NBA Jam

3119
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So it's kind of the

3120
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Up and coming news that

3121
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
NBA Jam is coming to

3122
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Coming to an end

3123
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
EA has been quoted here

3124
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The priority for Jam on the 360

3125
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
PS3 was to deliver HD graphics and online

3126
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Play to round out the

3127
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Great gameplay that defines the franchise

3128
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
For us to include roster and

3129
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Title update possibilities

3130
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Would have been a sacrifice of quality

3131
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
In those key areas and thus made the difficult decision

3132
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Not to include them

3133
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
So with NBA Jam

3134
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And their post game

3135
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Releases as well as roster updates looks like the

3136
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
The franchise is coming to an end

3137
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
This franchise was so badly

3138
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Mismanaged from the beginning and it's really

3139
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Sad because it was this whole like

3140
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Okay, it's only going to come out on the Wii

3141
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
No, just kidding, it's coming on the Playstation 3

3142
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
And the 360 but we're not going to do the

3143
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Obvious arcade thing and no, it's only

3144
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Going to be an exclusive

3145
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
With this sub-par basketball game

3146
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
To try and get it to sell extra copies

3147
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh fuck, this basketball game really sucks

3148
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
It's getting cancelled, well shit, now we better

3149
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Charge like $60 before this, I mean

3150
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
This franchise was horribly

3151
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Mismanaged from the start

3152
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Shame on whoever ran this thing

3153
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I mean, I guess they were trying to think of something outside

3154
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
The box, but you fucked up

3155
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Yeah, the marketing project manager on this

3156
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Was streamlined, probably out the door

3157
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
You know what, I hate to say it

3158
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
But they kind of deserve it

3159
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
This was a horribly

3160
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Mismanaged franchise, this game should have been huge

3161
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
And it should have been on arcade

3162
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Or it should have been a budget title

3163
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
If this game had been $30, it would have sold

3164
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Millions of people would have it

3165
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
But of course, you know, classic sport games

3166
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Like their Madden franchise will still continue to get roster updates

3167
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
And support, because that thing is still on fire

3168
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
And it's got a huge following

3169
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
For the Madden series, so

3170
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
They literally had to bring this game up

3171
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
They had to bump this from a B title

3172
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
To an A title to fill in the gap

3173
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Of a game that was so fucking terrible

3174
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
They had to can it

3175
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
This game was set up to fail

3176
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Absolutely set up to fail

3177
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
The time and energy spent to not release it

3178
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Is definitely a hit in the bottom line

3179
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So for those fans of NBA Jam

3180
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Looks like

3181
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Whatever last copy you have

3182
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
To own or to rent

3183
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Is the last iteration you're going to have

3184
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Sell the franchise to someone who knows what to do with it

3185
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Seriously

3186
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Konami? You never know

3187
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I remember playing Double Dribble back in the day

3188
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Which was pretty sweet

3189
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
We did Blades of Steel, was that Konami as well?

3190
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Konami knows how to do some pretty sweet sport games

3191
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
They're winning 11s

3192
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I mean, unfortunately, soccer is not

3193
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Big here in the US

3194
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
But it's huge everywhere else

3195
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
And that's a huge franchise

3196
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I just remember playing that game, Blades of Steel

3197
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
The only time that it had

3198
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Speech in an 8-bit NES game

3199
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And Ten Yard Rush

3200
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Ten Yard Dash

3201
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Ten Yard Rush was the first Nintendo title

3202
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That was another classic

3203
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
But anyway, NBA Jam

3204
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Coming to an end

3205
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Well, we don't know if it's dead

3206
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
They're stopping the roster

3207
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
They're not going to support NBA Jam

3208
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
It doesn't necessarily mean the death of it

3209
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
But it's

3210
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would say Outlook not good

3211
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Yeah

3212
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Definitely

3213
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
My gut says it's coming to an abrupt end

3214
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Sorry to the fans of that game

3215
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Spaznator in our chatroom at

3216
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
chat.orangelaundry.com says

3217
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
If NBA Jam was either Xbox Live Arcade or PSN

3218
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat, but no such luck

3219
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I would have done the same thing

3220
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Lots of people would

3221
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Where did NBA Jam get its start?

3222
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
In the arcade

3223
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Even if they had just buffed up

3224
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
The old version with new rosters

3225
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I would have been all over that

3226
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I guess maybe the troubling part is

3227
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Getting the rosters to match the

3228
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Look and feel of the players

3229
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Exploited heads and all that

3230
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
If you download something

3231
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
It's an awful lot of content to recreate

3232
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Visually to someone's exploited head

3233
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I don't know, it's sad

3234
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
But it's another sporting game that's kind of done

3235
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
TigerKlon, our chatroom says

3236
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Sell the franchise to Activision? They'll end up releasing

3237
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
New NBA Jams every year

3238
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
At least they'll get maintained, right?

3239
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
We'll see

3240
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Alright, moving on with some more news

3241
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Um

3242
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I don't know

3243
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
We talked a little bit about this

3244
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
How there was a temporary injunction

3245
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Where

3246
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
LG won against Sony

3247
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
And they got some of the PlayStation 3

3248
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Shipments held

3249
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
In Europe

3250
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Sony actually won

3251
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Overall

3252
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
This was due to a patent dispute

3253
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And now

3254
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I guess

3255
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
They're saying that all the C's PlayStations

3256
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Have been released

3257
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
So um

3258
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That was quick, and it actually

3259
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Only took about a day in the courts

3260
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
To settle everything

3261
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Well that was fast

3262
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
After all that news about like, oh my god

3263
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
It's gonna be a shortage of PlayStation 3

3264
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Nope, it's done

3265
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
And then on top of all that

3266
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
And here we stop

3267
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
And then on top of all that, LG had to pay legal fees

3268
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
And they got laughed out of court

3269
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
And also they're saying that for each day

3270
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
If LG failed to comply

3271
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
It would be fine

3272
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
The rate of 200,000 euros

3273
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Ouch

3274
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Which is still a buck and a half each

3275
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
That's a lot of money

3276
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
That's $275,000 in

3277
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
US dollars

3278
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I think we might

3279
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
We might actually have some audio from the

3280
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Proceedings of the trial, let's see here

3281
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Ah god dammit

3282
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Somebody bombing on YouTube

3283
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Never mind

3284
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I think I did a little bit

3285
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I was trying to find a clip here

3286
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Let me see if I can find this

3287
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Um

3288
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Okay I think we have a clip here from

3289
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
The trials proceedings here

3290
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Let's see if we can get this out here

3291
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
What kind of a reliable car are you gonna get

3292
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
For $1,000?

3293
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And I'm asking you, why didn't you

3294
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Finish paying your brother for the car?

3295
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Well judge, what I'm trying to say is

3296
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
That bitch scares me

3297
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Fucking love Judge Judy

3298
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
She's amazing

3299
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Did you see the episode with, um

3300
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
She's doing her usual, you know

3301
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Killing people with her eyes and her nose

3302
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And someone lit up a cigarette

3303
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
In the audience

3304
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Not a plaintiff or defendant but an actual audience member

3305
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Just chilling in the back

3306
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
And she's there going off in her

3307
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Diablo fire, spewing

3308
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
You want to smell smoke?

3309
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I smell smoke

3310
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
And some guy in the back

3311
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Actually pretty well dressed, looked like in a suit

3312
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Damn courtroom

3313
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
So what kind of cigarette on TV on Judge Judy

3314
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
How random is that

3315
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
She still scares me

3316
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I'm trying to see if I can find that in this

3317
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
It's not on YouTube

3318
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It was a random episode that I just had me watching

3319
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
When I was, you know

3320
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
There is this one though

3321
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
What kind of cigarettes did you buy?

3322
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Marlboro Reds

3323
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Marlboro Reds

3324
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Marlboro Reds

3325
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Marlboro Reds

3326
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It's my hearing or his speech

3327
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I'm not sure

3328
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette

3329
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I don't think I've ever seen the bailiff get sassy

3330
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Did you hear that? No, it's his speech

3331
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
The bailiff was getting a little sassy

3332
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette before

3333
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Going to court

3334
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Anyhow, moving on

3335
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
There is no overturning this ruling

3336
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
If you want to sell your Gameboy

3337
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Advanced craft to GameStop

3338
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
You better do it quick

3339
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
They're going to stop buying all of this in April

3340
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
So I think right now

3341
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
They will buy a Gameboy Advance

3342
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
For maybe like 20 bucks

3343
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But come April

3344
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
They will not be buying them anymore

3345
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
April 2nd supposedly is the date that's all happening

3346
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
You can probably blame

3347
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
The 3DS for this

3348
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Because now everything's kind of kicked back at Generations

3349
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
So there you go

3350
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
There's no new Advanced games

3351
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Being sold, this isn't really a big surprise anyway

3352
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Although I will say

3353
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I thought some GameStops still kind of specialized

3354
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
In selling old shit

3355
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Like usually in a big city there's at least one GameStop

3356
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
That does kind of still carry the old shit

3357
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Like the stockpile of NES games

3358
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I've seen regular GameBoy games for sale

3359
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
At GameStop

3360
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Are GameStops franchise or corporate owned?

3361
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Corporate? Corporate

3362
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
But it doesn't mean that you can't

3363
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Put your GBA up on eBay

3364
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Oh yeah

3365
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
There's GBA and there's indie stores as well

3366
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Which by the way the one by my house closed

3367
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Yeah there used to be an indie store by my house

3368
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
It closed

3369
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I know, sad

3370
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Anyhow

3371
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Let's go to the mailbag

3372
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Every week you guys send us emails at

3373
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3374
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
And we like to pick a few of our favorites

3375
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And read them here live on air

3376
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

3377
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
A very thin emailbag this week

3378
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I'm very disappointed in all of you

3379
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Because Loki doesn't look at me during the show

3380
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So anyway, he's too into his

3381
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Grand Theft Auto hacking thing

3382
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Which by the way doesn't seem to be working too well

3383
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
So we've got one email

3384
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
This week that I'm going to read for you guys

3385
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
But it's a good one because it's from Belgium

3386
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Ja? Ja

3387
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
So this is an email from Belgium

3388
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Hello good folks at OLR

3389
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
My TV is about to die on me

3390
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I'll have to buy a new one in the near future

3391
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Can you give me any advice on what makes a good TV for gaming

3392
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
And watching DVDs on a 360

3393
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
And watching analog cable TV

3394
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
How much milliseconds is good for gaming

3395
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Contrast, etc.

3396
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
You already seem to know

3397
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
What you're looking for because the delay

3398
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Is what you're going to want for gaming

3399
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
And the refresh rate on the screen

3400
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I believe for PC monitors

3401
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
You don't want to go any higher than 4

3402
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Most monitors now are like 2

3403
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
And I think the TVs are the same way aren't they?

3404
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
2 millisecond refresh

3405
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Something like that

3406
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Here's how nerdy I am

3407
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I use TV as my monitor from my office

3408
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
For my PC computer

3409
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Playing WoW on that thing is pretty fucking amazing

3410
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
It is slightly orgasmic

3411
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
And videos are nice on it too

3412
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
But definitely look at refresh rates

3413
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Definitely look at megahertz

3414
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Refresh rate as well

3415
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
60 or 120

3416
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
High refresh is also preferred as well

3417
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And keep in mind that the

3418
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Cheapie TVs right now

3419
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Only go as high as 720p in HD

3420
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
So definitely look at the pixelage

3421
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
On the TV. Mine only goes as high as

3422
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
1080i because I bought an HDTV

3423
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Kind of on the cheap when HD technology

3424
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Was still newish so they cut back

3425
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Kind of that way

3426
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
So double check that

3427
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Don't forget to look

3428
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
At the obvious because sometimes

3429
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
They will kind of brush that over

3430
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
To cut a couple hundred dollars. If it's cheap

3431
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
There's probably a reason. Always remember that

3432
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Definitely 1080p and refresh

3433
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Rates are probably your two

3434
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Pieces of information you want to hold up

3435
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
People will tell you though you can't tell the difference

3436
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Between 1080p and 1080i

3437
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I kind of beg to differ. I think I can see it a little bit

3438
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Especially in Blu-rays is where I can see it

3439
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
And also HDMI cables

3440
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Get the gold plated ones if you can

3441
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
There's a better strength to that

3442
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
At least I've noticed

3443
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Spaznator PC in our chat room says

3444
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Vizio is supposedly coming out with a

3445
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
$300 3D HDTV this year

3446
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
See, something's got to be wrong with it

3447
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Although I don't know. My main TV is Vizio

3448
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
And I've been relatively happy with it

3449
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
For the fact that it doesn't do 1080p

3450
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Well, I have to look at

3451
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I paid only $700 for it

3452
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Several years ago when HDTV

3453
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Was still kind of new-ish

3454
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So I can't complain too much

3455
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
My TV monitor in my room is an

3456
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
LG 46 inch

3457
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I forget the model number

3458
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
It's amazing. While on it plays very well

3459
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
It serves well

3460
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
For monitor use and all that

3461
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Don't skip

3462
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
On those two parts

3463
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
The resolution and the refresh rate

3464
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Well, moving on with our email from Belgium

3465
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
There's more to it

3466
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Also, I ripped the ligaments of my ankle a month ago

3467
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
During a soccer game

3468
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Yes, sports are healthy

3469
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Because of this, I'm unable to play any game on Kinect

3470
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
It made me think of the many disabled people

3471
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Who cannot play movement controlled games

3472
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Because of their condition

3473
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
When the future of gaming really is Kinect

3474
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Move, Wii, or whatever will be next

3475
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I hope there will be a proper alternative

3476
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
For them to play games

3477
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I think we've mentioned on the show before

3478
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Gaming can't always 100% be

3479
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
These technologies

3480
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's nice to have

3481
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
But it shouldn't always be a necessity

3482
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I think there will always be

3483
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Something for that core gamer

3484
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Who just wants that controller in their hand

3485
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
To play an RPG or a shoot-em-up

3486
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Whatever it is

3487
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
A good mix is a good thing

3488
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Or maybe even games that take

3489
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Disabilities into consideration

3490
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Would be a great thing

3491
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
There's many ways a person can be disabled

3492
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
And you can't always think of everything

3493
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
But it's always good to see game companies

3494
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Be at least considerate

3495
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Especially the big ones

3496
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
Definitely

3497
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Well, thanks again for making the show every week

3498
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
You guys are awesome

3499
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Greetings from Fabrice, Belgium

3500
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Thank you very much

3501
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Sounds like Febreze

3502
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Not Febreze, I believe is the name

3503
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I wonder if we can send the studio some waffles

3504
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Chocolate

3505
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Chocolate waffles with chicken

3506
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
And fries, oh my god, Belgian fries

3507
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Oh my god

3508
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Road trip

3509
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
No, there's a place in New York City I went to once

3510
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
And there was this restaurant in New York City

3511
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That just sold nothing but Belgian

3512
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Like the French fry type thing

3513
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
But like the Belgian big ones

3514
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
And like 20 different kinds of dips for the fries

3515
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
That's the only damn thing this store sold

3516
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Packed, packed, wall to wall

3517
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
There's actually a place like that in old Sacramento

3518
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Is there really?

3519
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
There's a lot of toppings or dips

3520
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Why has my fat ass not been to this place?

3521
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
It sounds amazing

3522
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Because old Sacramento is touristy and we live here and we don't go there

3523
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I guess

3524
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I've been to old SAC before, it's weird

3525
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
They're like Spanish with jalapenos and nacho cheese

3526
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
And they go to France

3527
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
They've got like blue cheese on them and crap like that

3528
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
The only problem I have, I can't believe this email is leading to talk about French fries

3529
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
But whatever, it's orange on the studio, deal with it

3530
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
The thing is that those restaurants

3531
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Usually like the fries with the dips

3532
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Half of them are always mayo based

3533
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Nope, those are out

3534
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I won't do mayo based things

3535
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
French fries with mayonnaise, disgusting

3536
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Anything with mayonnaise, disgusting

3537
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
If you've known me for any length of time

3538
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I hate, hate mayonnaise

3539
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Good to know

3540
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I won't be making any type of chicken salad for you for lunch

3541
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Or put a honey mustard dip in it or something

3542
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That's not frickin' mayonnaise

3543
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Anyhow

3544
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Aw, the chat room's all, you guys are making me hungry

3545
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Sorry

3546
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Alright, well I guess maybe

3547
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
The hunger might lead to a little bit of angst

3548
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Cause I know when I don't eat, I get mad

3549
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
So, uh, it's time for the FUs of the week

3550
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Moji, start us off tonight

3551
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Uh, fuck you too

3552
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
The stupid Grant Without a Texture editor

3553
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
It's out there

3554
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
But it doesn't seem to do anything

3555
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Working or whatever

3556
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Hate that crap

3557
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And then, uh

3558
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Yeah, that's basically it

3559
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Screw that

3560
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I waited all this time and it doesn't open anything

3561
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Well, I'm sure there's something wrong

3562
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Or it's bugging or something, but I'll figure it out

3563
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Uh, Matt2?

3564
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Uh, I'm gonna give you

3565
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Fuck you to midterms, I've got two of them this week

3566
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
And, uh

3567
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Yeah, not looking forward to finishing those

3568
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
FU2 income taxes, I'll have to be

3569
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Finishing those up here soon so I can

3570
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Mail the check to Uncle Sam and

3571
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Governor Brown, although it's really good

3572
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
To not say Governorator anymore

3573
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I will yield to that

3574
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Um, and FU2Loki's

3575
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Texture editor thing that I don't understand

3576
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
That he seems pretty angsty about

3577
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Um, FU to natural disasters

3578
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Um, because

3579
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
FU Mother Nature

3580
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Uh, seriously, because, um, yeah, it's just

3581
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Oh my gosh, I'm really glad that everybody I know

3582
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Is kinda safe, but unfortunately I know like

3583
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Thousands of people aren't safe, and that's just

3584
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
It's just really hard to read

3585
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Because that could really happen anywhere

3586
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So I just, ugh, very sad

3587
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
So anyway, um

3588
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
There's an FU to that, and I would also say

3589
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
FU to, um, money

3590
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I don't have enough of it

3591
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I never do

3592
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Banks have a lot of issues, kind of go in

3593
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
And ask for it nicely

3594
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Well, if you put one of those Richard Nixon masks over your face

3595
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Yes, and offer them a chocolate gun

3596
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Maybe I could get some money

3597
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
And then they'll give it to you magically

3598
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Although the pursuing, um,

3599
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Might go to jail for many years for that

3600
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
The tie-in's something that Loki does often

3601
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
If you get five stars after that bank chase

3602
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
You're fucked

3603
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Alright, couple more stories for you guys

3604
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line

3605
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
At 1877 Game OLR

3606
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3607
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
That's not opened yet, but it will be in a moment

3608
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Yes, um, in case you're wondering why Activision

3609
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Does what Activision does

3610
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
They pull out year after year

3611
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
It's because they're only encouraged by people

3612
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
That buy those games

3613
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And this isn't gonna help

3614
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
If you're hoping for the Call of Duty franchise

3615
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
To go away

3616
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Call of Duty Black Ops is the

3617
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
US's best selling game ever

3618
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
It has beaten everything

3619
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
In only about four months

3620
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And, uh,

3621
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
That includes also

3622
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
The sales of Wii Play

3623
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Which Nintendo claims is around 13 million copies

3624
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I thought this was a down economy

3625
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Oh my gosh

3626
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
13 million copies of Wii Play

3627
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Is way too many of that freaking game

3628
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
But even, oh my gosh

3629
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
See, I don't really play the Call of Duty games

3630
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I can't really hate on them

3631
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I've seen them played

3632
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I understand why dudes like them

3633
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
But not a series I personally get into

3634
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
So this is now the best selling game of all time?

3635
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
All time

3636
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Oh my gosh, that's crazy

3637
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
It really is

3638
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
It really is

3639
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Halo

3640
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
They sold 5.6 million units day one

3641
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Bigger than WoW?

3642
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I guess so

3643
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Bigger than everything

3644
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Well, are you counting subscription based

3645
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Or are you counting true sales of the original and expansions?

3646
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Well, I don't think you get to combine original and expansions

3647
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
I think you just have to count original, I suppose

3648
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Yeah, but still

3649
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It's pretty hot

3650
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Alright, one more story for you guys

3651
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And it has to do with rumors

3652
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
What a freaking shock

3653
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
That the rumors are already starting about an

3654
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Xbox 720 and a Wii 2 announcement

3655
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
At E3

3656
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Well, it has to do

3657
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
And here's where they're coming from

3658
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
It has to do with some tech demos

3659
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
That Epic is showing about the next gen graphics

3660
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Because their whole Unreal

3661
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Engine upgrade and all that

3662
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
The Guardian in the UK

3663
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Is reporting that there is going to be

3664
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
A Wii 2 that will include a Blu-ray

3665
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Drive, a quad-core

3666
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
processor, and a built-in LED projector

3667
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
The projector will display

3668
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
gameplay. Isn't this

3669
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Weren't these the early rumors of the revolution

3670
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
That the 3D was going to be projected

3671
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Although, funny enough

3672
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Isn't it funny that we did end up getting

3673
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
3D from Nintendo, it just wasn't

3674
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
The Wii, it was the 3DS

3675
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
The Guardian should not be a source for

3676
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Anything when it comes to, like, consoles

3677
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Duh, there's gonna

3678
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Sequel to successful console?

3679
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Really? There's gonna be

3680
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
A new console for Nintendo?

3681
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Woah, I do not see that coming at all

3682
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I love this too, it's also the

3683
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Right time because Nintendo does

3684
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Console announcements every five years

3685
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
The Nintendo 64 in

3686
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
96, the GameCube

3687
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
In 2001, and the Wii

3688
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
In 2006, so surely

3689
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Loki, surely the time is

3690
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Right for Wii 2

3691
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
You know, we didn't become the

3692
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Super game analysts of the world

3693
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
For nothing, so let me just tell you

3694
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
How it's actually done, The Guardian

3695
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
First off

3696
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
They're trying to extend their console

3697
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Cycles now because, well

3698
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It sucks making a new console

3699
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Every few years, and honestly, you know

3700
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Technology does get better, but I mean

3701
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Graphics-wise, what are you gonna really push now?

3702
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
And they don't really care about graphics

3703
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Because they're Nintendo

3704
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
And that would make the price

3705
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Of their console go up quite a bit

3706
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Now, not to say that we're not gonna

3707
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
See another Nintendo console

3708
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
That's the Wii, you know, we may see something

3709
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Like we were saying before, that's kind of a

3710
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Next step, like, um, you know

3711
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Like people are saying the Wii HD

3712
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Or something that may be a little bit

3713
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
More souped up, is it gonna have an

3714
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
LCD projector in it?

3715
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Probably not, because that's

3716
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
That's stupid, I mean

3717
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
That's just kind of weird

3718
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
It's just ridiculous

3719
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Why would I need a projector on my console?

3720
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Project things onto my naked body

3721
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,000
That's a horrible, horrible thought

3722
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I have no words

3723
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Mario could jump up and down on my wang

3724
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
That's one platform-based game right there

3725
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Oh my god, can you think about the YouTubes

3726
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
That are gonna come from a projected Wii game

3727
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
I mean, it's not like it's that hard

3728
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
To hook up a console to a projector

3729
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
I mean, you can walk into Fry's and buy a projector

3730
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
My buddy's done it before with an Xbox original

3731
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
He had Mario jump on his wang?

3732
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
No, he's hooking up an L

3733
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
He took an LCD projector

3734
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
And respective cables and components

3735
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And was able to project the image

3736
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Of the game on a blank wall

3737
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
But that's because we had to take down posters

3738
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
So a projector is gonna need space

3739
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Blank canvas to work on

3740
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
It's not gonna happen

3741
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
No, that's dumb

3742
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I'm sorry

3743
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
No, they're not gonna do that

3744
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
And a quad-core processor

3745
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Or something like that

3746
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Really? Really?

3747
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
A quad-core processor?

3748
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Is that what you think

3749
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
The fastest thing is out there?

3750
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I mean, shit

3751
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
The fucking 360 has more cores than that

3752
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Nintendo's main release

3753
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I think this year is not the Wii 2

3754
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Or the Wii Squared, it is the 3DS

3755
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And that's what they're gonna stick to

3756
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
They don't need to

3757
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
They don't need to even think about a new console

3758
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Until their system starts becoming number one

3759
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
The Wii is still popular

3760
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
It's releasing decent games

3761
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
They're still playing it

3762
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
The 3DS is gonna continue that

3763
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Now the thought is, of course, that they may want to try to get the jump

3764
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
On the next generation

3765
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Because the 360 did have that jump

3766
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
And they did pretty well

3767
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I don't know

3768
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
They're just not gonna do some sort of Blu-ray

3769
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Crazy

3770
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
They don't need to

3771
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
For one, Sony owns Blu-rays

3772
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
That'd be kinda weird

3773
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Well, I still think that the next-gen consoles

3774
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Especially on the 360

3775
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Or you're gonna see something that's not a DVD drive

3776
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
They have to because of the capacity

3777
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah, because you just can't

3778
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Did they always say

3779
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Never to use projectors with games

3780
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
It was always the first line in the various instruction manuals

3781
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Yeah, because of burn-in

3782
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
But that's just old-school projectors

3783
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
And even still

3784
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
You're not gonna want to do that

3785
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Because old-school projectors

3786
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Nowadays, there's still some latency for that

3787
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
But no

3788
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Why would you even have a fucking projector

3789
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
On a console? That makes no sense

3790
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Like I said

3791
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
To project Mario onto my naked body

3792
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
It's seriously some guy making a story

3793
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
The cell tabloid

3794
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
The guardian

3795
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Spaznator in our chatroom says

3796
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Sky, that's a mental picture I seriously didn't need

3797
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Thank you

3798
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Is it possible to bleach a mental picture out of one's mind?

3799
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Yes, just pour the bleach into your ears

3800
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
I don't know, let me ask you here

3801
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Hold on

3802
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
And now I present a little bit of Mario

3803
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Jumping on my wang

3804
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Hold on, let's see if I can

3805
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Project Mario here

3806
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Jumping on my wang

3807
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Really don't

3808
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Ow!

3809
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Did he jump on a ball?

3810
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
That was like the shittiest NES rip of a game

3811
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
It really was

3812
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
No, but seriously

3813
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
If they're gonna do something with their next

3814
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Or Wii

3815
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
The next Wii or whatever

3816
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
It's gonna be just kind of an HD upgrade

3817
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I don't even think it would need to be necessarily

3818
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
On

3819
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
You know, non-DVD

3820
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Platform, because right now

3821
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Fuck, they are not even really using dual layer

3822
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
There's like two games that use dual layer DVDs

3823
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
For the Wii

3824
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
There's no real need to do that

3825
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
In order for the Wii to be competitive

3826
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Like for like, you need to

3827
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Throw in blu-ray capacity and some type of

3828
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Body-sensing motion device

3829
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Because that's what the two consoles have right now

3830
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
As Rob Giggles, like a little school girl

3831
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
So, what is the Wii

3832
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Squared to, whatever

3833
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Maybe it's not a projector, maybe it's like a

3834
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
A wang

3835
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Well, then they're already on par with

3836
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Their competition, they'd have to exceed

3837
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Their competition

3838
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Now, this is getting off of Star Trek for me

3839
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
But if they did some type of holography or hologram

3840
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Or something like that instead of a projection

3841
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Then they'd have something, but again, what would you use it for?

3842
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
No, it's The Guardian

3843
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
They're not really newsworthy

3844
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
It's entertaining, although if they named the Xbox

3845
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Second iteration the 720

3846
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Really?

3847
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
No, it's what everybody wants to call it

3848
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
They're gonna call it something cool and hip

3849
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Well, I'll tell you what an awesome name would be, The Bacon

3850
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
They just call it The Xbox Bacon

3851
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Who doesn't love bacon?

3852
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Want to come over and play with bacon? Fuck yeah!

3853
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I don't know if they should really call

3854
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
The sequel of a console that had issues with heat

3855
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Baking

3856
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Not a good thing

3857
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
They called a

3858
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
The most popular console in America right now

3859
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Is called The Wii

3860
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
That's what little girls do when they sit on the toilet

3861
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
They Wii

3862
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I remember the commercials when it came out

3863
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Those two creepy HD guys would come up

3864
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
We would like to play? I'm like, whoa

3865
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
This game's for pedophiles or something like that

3866
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
This console's a little bit weird

3867
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And then it was motion controlled

3868
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
And hilarity ensued

3869
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
What would you call the red ring of death

3870
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
On a console called bacon?

3871
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I don't know, there's got to be some type of

3872
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Joke there someplace, it's not coming to me

3873
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
There would never be a ring or red

3874
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
On any Microsoft console

3875
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Going forward

3876
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
A Jewish Xbox

3877
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
This Xbox is kosher

3878
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
It's made by Jewish monks

3879
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I tease because I love, come on people

3880
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I guess I could say something about

3881
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
There is job postings at Microsoft

3882
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Looking for hardware engineers

3883
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
To quote, define and deliver next

3884
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Generation console architectures

3885
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Well, no shit they're making a new Xbox

3886
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Doesn't mean it's coming out of E3 this year

3887
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
These things are going to be like

3888
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Four years out, you know, it'll be a while

3889
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
So

3890
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Do you think Apple is rumored to

3891
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Release some type of a gaming console?

3892
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
That's a lot of buzz in the whole Apple world

3893
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
What I think they're going to do is

3894
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Yes, it's called the iPad

3895
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
The gaming console, come on people

3896
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
That's retarded, first off

3897
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Oh goody, I get to plug an HDMI cable

3898
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Into my iPad and be tethered to my TV

3899
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
No thanks

3900
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Oh, and I'm sure that

3901
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Cable cost you $40 to make

3902
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Fuckers

3903
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Oh, my mistake, $30

3904
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Well that totally makes sense, a piece of cable

3905
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
That's like a few

3906
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Feet long, what, like six

3907
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Six feet?

3908
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I remember the size, it was $29.99 for the

3909
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
HD adapter thing to send

3910
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
And 1080p

3911
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
From the pad

3912
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
To a compatible

3913
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
TV

3914
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
So I'm going to credit AkumaJP in our chatroom for this comment

3915
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
But perhaps this could be the sequel to

3916
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
The Nintendo Wii, could be this

3917
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Sitting on the toilet

3918
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Sitting on the toilet

3919
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Sitting on the toilet

3920
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Sitting on the toilet

3921
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Sitting on the toilet

3922
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Sitting on the toilet

3923
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Sitting on the toilet

3924
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Sitting on the toilet

3925
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Sitting on the toilet

3926
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
She's an awfully jolly lady

3927
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Sitting on the toilet

3928
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Wait, best part's coming out

3929
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Flushing? Yep

3930
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
You're joking right, I've never seen this before

3931
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Here comes the punchline

3932
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Wait for it

3933
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Sitting on the toilet

3934
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Sitting on the toilet

3935
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Sitting on the toilet

3936
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Yeah, FLUSH!

3937
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
The Nintendo Flush, this year at E3.

3938
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
It's videos like that that keep me gay.

3939
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Rob, why do you do this to me? I thought we were friends.

3940
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It was the chatters! The chatters said it!

3941
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
But you played it!

3942
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
It's every gamer has a voice, even that lady.

3943
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Now she's one of those challenge people that probably couldn't use the Kinect.

3944
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Yeah, the Kinect.

3945
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Because she'd be sitting on the toilet and have minimal body movement for the Kinect.

3946
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Oh lord.

3947
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I have to go home and favorite that now.

3948
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
It's pretty awesome.

3949
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Spread it around.

3950
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
You gotta admit.

3951
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:11,000
I was trying to find the 8-bit remix of that song to prove that she plays video games, but I don't know.

3952
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I guess it's not on YouTube anymore. Whatever.

3953
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Anyhow, I guess we can open up the Skype line now and take some calls.

3954
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,000
1-877-GAMO-L-R. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3955
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Give us a call. We'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.

3956
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Hopefully it's gaming-related, but if you want to talk about sitting on the toilet, then more power to you.

3957
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
So the phones are open right now. Let's take some calls.

3958
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
We'd rather you didn't talk about sitting on the toilet.

3959
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
That's true. So let's go to some calls.

3960
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

3961
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,000
This is that one, Akke Ripper from Sweden.

3962
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
What's up, Akke Ripper? I haven't heard from you in a while. How you doing?

3963
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Yeah, well, I have been away. Oh, no, I haven't been away. I've just been sleeping like when you're on.

3964
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Unfortunately.

3965
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
No worries. What's on your mind tonight?

3966
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:01,000
What was I going to say? Well, I could talk about Dragon Age 2, which I have already finished.

3967
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Ah, what do you think?

3968
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
It's marvelous.

3969
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Once again, to the minor story behind it, well, I got it on Wednesday, and I got it pretty early because it locked up.

3970
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:21,000
It was unlocked at midnight to Thursday, my time.

3971
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:30,000
So what is it? At 3 o'clock Wednesday, your time, I think it is, and got unlocked.

3972
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And like 40 or 50 hours later, I beat it. It was quite nice, really. It's thumbs up.

3973
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Do you recommend it?

3974
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I do recommend it highly.

3975
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
How was the lovemaking?

3976
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
How was the lovemaking?

3977
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It was quite nice, I do say.

3978
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,000
It was quite nice, from what I see.

3979
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,000
It's a nice.

3980
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
It's quite a nice.

3981
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
But here's the other thing though. Since really I almost, but here's the other thing.

3982
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Well, I did make love to one of the characters, but here's the other thing though.

3983
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Since really, really, really, these love scenes in both Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins and Origins 1 is awkward beyond fucking awkward.

3984
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:39,000
It's like, I don't even want to see, I close my eyes.

3985
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:50,000
No! No! Really? Really? What the hell?

3986
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Just no, no.

3987
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
This is the best video game review we've ever had on this show.

3988
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,000
I'm glad to be here, present for this.

3989
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:09,000
But other than that, it really is a kick-ass game.

3990
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Unfortunately a bit shorter than the first Origins, but it's on par with Mass Effect 2.

3991
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And maybe even longer than Mass Effect 2 on second thought.

3992
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Well, I would say really bi. And most of the, and also, it really makes up for one of the, yeah, how the fuck will they continue this?

3993
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Even though, one of the comments that I found on Twitter is that the whole story in Dragon Age 2 is like a origin story, if that makes sense.

3994
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Overall, yeah, so thumbs up.

3995
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Also, Tactics Orger has finally been released, and that's quite funny.

3996
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Also, on side notes, as usual, I play as a girl character, because I don't, because here's the other thing though.

3997
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I don't even like playing as a male character, because, well, hello, I'm one of those trannies, whatever, that's not, that, if I even would choose.

3998
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I don't even want to be a man, and I don't want to be a girl, either.

3999
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:31,000
That doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with it though, because I like to play, like all of my characters in World of Warcraft are women,

4000
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:36,000
and that's just because people are nicer to you, because they think you have big boobs sitting there behind the monitor.

4001
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I just, it's totally like selfish reasons, like, you know.

4002
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Yeah, well, in a way. Also, in a kind of way, there are, I should point out also, I play, as usual, I play, I was on the difficulty settings of casual,

4003
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
which means that I, in one way, breezed it through, and was all like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

4004
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:13,000
But here's the other thing though, even though if you play on casual, you will actually have minor problems on two places though.

4005
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Which I did have problems on two places, but after all I did some thoughts on two things, and was like, yeah, it's not that hard, really.

4006
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But it will be kind of hard in some places.

4007
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Well, I don't blame you for playing on the easiest level. I've been playing Torchlight on the easiest level, because I just want to, you know, jam through the game and kind of see everything that's there.

4008
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,000
But, you know, sometimes you just want to kind of take in the story, or in some cases, get straight to the lovemaking.

4009
02:27:47,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Yeah, but also, since I've seen the ending to Dragon Age 2, it makes me actually want to replay origins, so my warden can make love to a certain character,

4010
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:18,000
so to set up certain things in Origins 2.

4011
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:22,000
You have to go back and get the right characters to fall in love so that the lovemaking can continue in 2 now.

4012
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Or the STDs.

4013
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yeah, can you pass the STDs from one game to another? Alright, forget it.

4014
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Alright, Ate Ripper, to be quite honest, I don't ever want this call to end, but I've got people...

4015
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Yeah, also, before I go, there has been released a new trailer for apparently two expansions on Sims games.

4016
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Ah, yes.

4017
02:28:44,000 --> 02:29:02,000
One apparently animal expansion for the console version, and then we have, like, what is it, Sims 3 Pets or something, and then you have some Sims 3 Generations, which is apparently for the PC version.

4018
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Unfortunately, though, there has been no signs of weather effects, which is a bit sad, because I do want weather effects.

4019
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:22,000
But here's the other thing, though. It makes interesting, because, well, raising kids in Sims is quite fun, and with this expansion, it will expand that.

4020
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Do you think there will be a Sims 4 anytime soon?

4021
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Not likely. Not that it seems so.

4022
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Also, side note, they don't say any date for the Generations 1, but for the animal expansion on console, it's at November 2011.

4023
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Alright.

4024
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
So, um...

4025
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Yeah.

4026
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Alright. Well, Ate Ripper, I gotta let you go so I can get to some of the calls, because I got people from PAX East that are just dying to get through.

4027
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Yeah, well...

4028
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Honestly, you need to have a video game review podcast. You need to think about it.

4029
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Oh, well, well. Oh, well.

4030
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Later on! Take care, buddy!

4031
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Yeah, later.

4032
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Bye.

4033
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Where is he from again?

4034
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Sweden.

4035
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I'm going to Sweden.

4036
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:15,000
You know, and here's the thing. He hasn't called us in quite a long time, because, you know, it's like, freaking what? Like, they're eight, nine hours ahead of us right now?

4037
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
At least nine.

4038
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I don't know how Daylight Savings kind of plays that. So it's like four or five o'clock in the morning over there right now, so I can't blame him for not staying up every week to listen to OLR.

4039
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Word.

4040
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:27,000
God damn, that was worth it. Alright, that was worth the wait.

4041
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Alright, I'm going to do a rare outbound call, because I promised these guys they could get through, and it's about PAX East, so I want to do this call real quick if I can.

4042
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Sorry to those folks trying to get through right now, but I did promise this call, because I want to talk to at least one person that went to PAX East this week.

4043
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
We'll do some more incoming calls in a minute. Just hold on. Hold on, guys.

4044
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:58,000
By the way, a question in the chatroom if I've played Mortal Kombat. Hey, hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio.

4045
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4046
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Hey, it's DJ Rama S and DDR Dollar Bill.

4047
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Hey, you guys. Some of our regular callers here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know you guys went to PAX East, right?

4048
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Yeah.

4049
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
So fucking tell us about it. What happened? What'd you see?

4050
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
It was great, but Rob, before we continue, there's one thing you need to know.

4051
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
What?

4052
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Yeah. The anime title, FLCL, is called Fully Coolie.

4053
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Oh, my bad. I'm just, I'm not, you know, cultured enough to know these things. I'm sorry.

4054
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I knew that.

4055
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
It's okay, we forgive you.

4056
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Alright.

4057
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:46,000
I've learned something here on the show tonight. Tell me about PAX East already. I don't care about that damn anime.

4058
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Okay, Rob.

4059
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Yes.

4060
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I played the 3DS.

4061
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Yes.

4062
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
It's fucking awesome. Yes.

4063
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Even though, okay, let me ask this question now, because I've been, you know, I said ever since E3, I was like, dude, the minute you play one, it will sell you one.

4064
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Like, it almost violates that golden rule of gaming, that the system is only as good as the games that are on it, because seriously, does it even matter that the games are subpar right now?

4065
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Nope. Doesn't matter at all.

4066
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:19,000
It's the technology, right? The first time you see it, it's kind of, did you do that thing where you looked at it and then you went, whoa, whoa, this is like real.

4067
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Yeah. And the funny thing is, back where I used to live, when I used to get my monthly bus passes, they actually had a 3D effect similar to the 3DS screen, so I was automatically used to it.

4068
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Right. So what did you get to play on it?

4069
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,000
The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

4070
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
And what did you think?

4071
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:56,000
It was great. Now, here's something, I don't know if you've covered it, because the stream was dropping for us as we were traveling, but when you play with, when you grab the slingshot, you can actually move the 3DS around for targeting in the game.

4072
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Oh, see, these are some of like the new features from this entire game.

4073
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Oh, well, that's it. I have to totally buy this rehash of a 64 game, because they have motion controls now.

4074
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Oh.

4075
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
It's different.

4076
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Damn, Loki. Who put the hater in your tree today, man? Dang, oh.

4077
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:25,000
He's been hating for a couple of weeks now. It's all right. But yet, did you hear the part where he's ordered both a Japanese and an American 3DS?

4078
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I don't blame him because of region locking, so you know.

4079
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Yeah. So, what else was there? I heard Children of Eden was there, and I hear it's like amazing. Did you guys play it?

4080
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I didn't, but Alpha Kanabran, he was like, it was amazing. Yeah.

4081
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:44,000
And that look was like fucking orgasm.

4082
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I want to know more about it. Well, how did the show compare to last year?

4083
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:58,000
It was, in a way, kind of felt like last year was a little bit better, but on the same token, it was just oh so much to see, you know?

4084
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Yeah.

4085
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:05,000
It was like, Exo Hall was twice as large, tabletop gaming was twice as huge, you know?

4086
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Wow.

4087
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:15,000
And it was a lot more, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3, the number one horned out game at this con.

4088
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Of course.

4089
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Of course. Of course everybody's going to be playing that. Did you check out the classic gaming room while you were there?

4090
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Yeah, I got in there for a little bit. It had all of your favorite games in there, too.

4091
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Awesome. What about panels? Did you spend any time going to a panel or anything?

4092
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I went to the video game music panels. I went to one about OC Remix, where two of the composers did live the opening to Final Fantasy VI.

4093
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Oh, that's hot.

4094
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Yeah.

4095
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Was that as awesome as it sounds?

4096
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Say what?

4097
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Was that as awesome as it sounds?

4098
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Much better. I recorded it. Instead of getting a chance, I'm going to throw it up on YouTube.

4099
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Nice. Very cool. Alright, so what was the best thing about PAX East altogether?

4100
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Oh, man. That's a lot.

4101
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:11,000
That's a lot. I mean, I went just for two things. The 3DS and Duke Nukem Forever. Got my play. It was great.

4102
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:15,000
What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

4103
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
What was what?

4104
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

4105
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:28,000
It was fucking win. I mean, you start out in a football field punching people so you get the weapon and you start blowing shit up.

4106
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Was there titties?

4107
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Real life titties, yes. Oh, yeah.

4108
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Wait, are we talking about Duke Nukem Forever still, or are we talking about like you just saw titties in the expo hall, like randomly?

4109
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I'm talking about the booth babes, my brother. The booth babes.

4110
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Of course, the booth babes. Nice.

4111
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Well, anything else you want to get out about PAX East before I get to more calls?

4112
02:35:54,000 --> 02:36:04,000
It was fun. It's worth it to come because as we were hanging out Saturday night, the way it was laid out, it was like not really stressful.

4113
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:13,000
This kind of revitalizes the reason why I go to conventions and also there was no appointment per se set up for demos.

4114
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:21,000
You could email them and they will email you back if you want a time to come in to check out particular products and games.

4115
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:29,000
But even though I was pressed, you had to wait just like everybody else except on Saturday where you're allowed in an hour early.

4116
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Alright, that's cool. That's cool. I'm glad to hear it because we were getting a little worried on some of the things we heard, but I guess they were just rumors.

4117
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Last I could have heard was not exactly true. That's the problem.

4118
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Alright. Well, one other thing I want to ask. Did you guys catch, what was the last Omegathon game this year? I haven't heard yet.

4119
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:54,000
We couldn't do that because we had to drop off Misty and Alpha Kinanagram at the train station and the airports.

4120
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Aw, bummer. Alright. Well, maybe somebody in chat will yell it out. I'm sure it's going to hit the internet somewhere.

4121
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
O-L-R invasion next year.

4122
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Next year, PAX East 2012, O-L-R-Con. It's going to be you, me, Dark Sakura, Loki, TDR Dollar Bill, Misty, Alpha Kinanagram, Zaku, the whole crew.

4123
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:22,000
We're getting a suite. We're getting some alcohol. We're bringing the 360s. We're going to jury rig the TV. We're going to get our gaming on.

4124
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,000
And boobs. Hell yeah.

4125
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:32,000
Alright. Well, you guys have fun. Be safe on your drive back and thanks for letting me bug you even though you're on the show every week anyway, Rama.

4126
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Hahahaha. Love you too, man.

4127
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Later, DDR Dollar Bill. Drive safe. I said later, DDR Dollar Bill too. Drive safe, you guys. Later.

4128
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Awesome. Let's get some more calls.

4129
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? It's Zaku here. Hey, Zaku, buddy. What's on your mind?

4130
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Yup. I, too, also went to PAX with Adam. Awesome. Also known as Rama.

4131
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I mean, yeah, sure, it was my first PAX, but at least I was able to pull off a decent trip to Boston.

4132
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Even though it was like, the way I see it is, what the fuck?

4133
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,000
It's all good. What did you think of PAX East? What did you play?

4134
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Yeah, I mean, I did try to partake in most of the things on the show floor, but the lines were too long.

4135
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:35,000
There was no way I was going to spend two hours waiting to see what's inside the LA Nor booth, let alone the Battlefield 3 one.

4136
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:45,000
By the way, just quickly, I know Adam for a fact that he endured whatever he did to see the 3DS, but it was almost E3-like.

4137
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Where the lines would just stretch literally around the booth.

4138
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:56,000
That's the only turn off, and I guess it's part of the fact that PAX is pretty much like a poor man's E3.

4139
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Was there just too damn many people?

4140
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Pretty much. Compared to all the other cons I've been to, even the ones I've been to in the Javits Center in New York, this was by far one of the largest I've ever been to.

4141
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Well, the East Coast sadly doesn't get a lot, so I'm not surprised at all that everybody comes in.

4142
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:36,000
PAX does fill that void for folks that can't actually make it out to E3, so it's creating that whole experience, that experience itself, without having to go on the other side of the country.

4143
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:45,000
But more to my point, I did cosplay on Saturday, and I'm just trying to upload the picture I took personally.

4144
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I mean, I post for several pictures, some for media, but I didn't make Kotaku's roll. But I'll upload mine.

4145
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Well, let me ask you quickly, I want to take it back to the games a little bit. Even though the lines were long, I'm assuming you got your hands on some things, right?

4146
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Yeah, some. I wouldn't say a lot, but it's like, I was just hanging, you know, just going from some booths.

4147
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
What did you play that's worth talking about right now?

4148
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Oh man, I can't even think off the top of my head. Homefront. Homefront, yeah.

4149
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
And how was that?

4150
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Pretty much, that's definitely one thing I'm going to buy on Tuesday. Well, for PC that is, but the 360 version is just as good.

4151
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:31,000
That was what I was able to get my hands on without having to wait hours in line.

4152
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Most of the major titles there, they were, you know, it's like, you're going to spend hours just going through two or three of them, and that's going to cut into most of your day on the show floor.

4153
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Did you get to do any other of the sights and sounds of E3 that wasn't just the...

4154
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Yeah, I went to the harmonics panel.

4155
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Oh, how was that?

4156
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Saturday. It was pretty good, I mean, you know, I managed that.

4157
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Did they comment on the whole sale from MTV and all that?

4158
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:11,000
No, it was just like, well, what they did was like a reverse Q&A where they actually, you know, where the panel asked questions to, you know, the fans that lined up to speak.

4159
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:25,000
So, I was basically asked a question on, you know, how to deal with like asshole, you know, fans that complain about some of the most obvious and like unrealistic things about the game.

4160
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:32,000
And so I had to, you know, I was basically asked my opinion on those, you know, on that particular subject.

4161
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:33,000
What did you say?

4162
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:42,000
So, I managed to relate it to the DDR scene, well, my local DDR scene, and I pretty much like got a pretty good ovation out of it.

4163
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Props to you, buddy.

4164
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I know, if it was recorded live, I'm pretty sure my comment was up there.

4165
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:53,000
You know, if the panel, you know, mentions a military zombie, that was me.

4166
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
So, are you going back to PAX next year?

4167
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Yeah, I mean, this time I have to stay in, you know, I have to stay in the hotel right next to the con, but yeah, I'll definitely do it.

4168
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:12,000
It's just that I may have to like go, I may have to take that day off, you know, that Friday off just to get my hands on the show early.

4169
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:18,000
I'd take a whole week off to go to E3, although I'm probably not going this year, but yeah, it's a lot, so.

4170
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Alright, well, Zacko, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show, even if you can get your hands on all the good stuff.

4171
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Sounds like you found a few gems in there somewhere, so.

4172
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Yep, sure did.

4173
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Alright, well, hopefully, see you next year.

4174
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Definitely.

4175
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Alright, later.

4176
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Bye.

4177
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
I need to make a whole to-do of it and just go out to the East Coast.

4178
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
You're a fan of New York City, right, Matt, too?

4179
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I know you love to go out to New York City and all that.

4180
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Absolutely.

4181
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:47,000
We have a lot of listeners out in New York City, and I've gone out there a couple times and done like meetups, and we had some nice like Dave and Buster's fun, and did some random things out in the city, it's cool.

4182
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Yeah, New York is good, and it's expensive.

4183
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
We'll go to PAX East next year, don't you want to go to Boston and play some games?

4184
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Baston?

4185
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Baston?

4186
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I have never been to Baston before, to walk in the park.

4187
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Baston is fun.

4188
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I went to Baston, I went with somebody who went to college there, say did some schooling there, so he knew the area pretty well, and we had fun.

4189
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Boston's actually on one of my lists of cities to see in the East, but yeah, New York is a lot of fun.

4190
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:15,000
1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype is OrangeLawninsRadio, what the hell, we usually only do three, but I'm feeling generous tonight, let's do one more call.

4191
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:21,000
While we wait for a call, oh, call's coming in right now, I guess we'll go to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLawninsRadio, who's this?

4192
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Hi, this is Baston here.

4193
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Hey buddy, what's on your mind?

4194
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Just to be different this week, rather than talking about videos, I'll be touching on MMOs this time.

4195
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Alright, MMOs.

4196
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yeah, specifically two of them, DC Universe Online and Final Fantasy XI, mainly because you guys kind of touched on them earlier.

4197
02:43:48,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Well, one thing that wasn't mentioned that is kind of interesting is that supposedly, at least with DC Universe Online, sometime within the near future, I think within the next month or two, there's going to be a digital download version appearing on the PSN store.

4198
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:28,000
And I had heard of that, that they're going to do a full digital download, which wouldn't be too unrealistic. I mean, Xbox 360 does something similar already with some of the games, and I believe PlayStation has a handful of games you can buy.

4199
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I want to say one of them was day and date of Street Release.

4200
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:36,000
World of Warcraft's latest expansion was full digital download as well, which was awesome.

4201
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Hell, PC thrives on digital download. Hello Steam. I mean, Steam is like PC gaming right now. It's a big chunk of it, so I'm kind of not surprised all PS3 is going in that direction.

4202
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:56,000
DC Universe Online is a Sony online entertainment, so it's another branch of the same company, same family, so not surprised at all by that news, but neat.

4203
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Yeah, well, some doing that has its ups and downs depending on how you look at it. On one hand, yeah, there's the convenience factor, no doubt about that.

4204
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:29,000
At least with the beta that went on, granted, it was beta not the full retail releases, obviously there's going to be differences, but at least with the beta, that was a pretty freaking huge file.

4205
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I mean, it was like, what, ballpark figure of 15 gigabytes?

4206
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
It was huge.

4207
02:45:36,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Yeah, and even if you got a pretty hefty hard drive inside your system, there's still a good chunk of your hard drive dedicated to one game, but hopefully most PS3 owners have already, at least at $1.40, already upgraded their hard drive at least once.

4208
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:04,000
So what did you want to say on Final Fantasy XIV?

4209
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Well, actually 11, not 14.

4210
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Oops, sorry, 11.

4211
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Yeah, well, you know how you were mentioning that, at least temporarily speaking, that they're going to be shutting down the servers for the game because of the recent earthquake?

4212
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Right.

4213
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Well, just prior to that earthquake hitting, they had made an announcement that they're already going to be consolidating some of the servers.

4214
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Uh oh, that's usually the sign for the MMO that things are going downhill, but you know what though, come on, Final Fantasy XI's had a good run, and Sony did kind of probably siphon some of the players with a release of 14, kind of cannibalized 11 a little bit.

4215
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Yeah, well, I hate to mention a rival podcast, but this is where I got the information from.

4216
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:32,000
There's a podcast that's dedicated to Final Fantasy XI called Limit Break Radio, and they had a very small podcast, their most recent entry for that show on their website.

4217
02:47:32,000 --> 02:48:01,000
The main host had mentioned that the first time they consolidate the servers, there was a need for it, then yeah, they could see what they did, but the second round of consolidation of servers, they don't see what the logic behind that was because once this new round of consolidation goes through,

4218
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:18,000
the servers would probably actually be overpopulated, and for those trying to do the end game kind of thing, it's going to be a lot more difficult for those people because the competition for the mobs and...

4219
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:30,000
They might be worried that they're going to hemorrhage more users because of some of the other MMOs that are out, just with Rift and DC Universe and so on, maybe they're just worried, they're kind of being proactive, I suppose.

4220
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Well, it's kind of sad to see Final Fantasy XI going this route for the reasons that you just mentioned, because it's kind of foreboding.

4221
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Granted, I haven't played the game in a year or two now because of financial reasons, but I was always hoping that eventually once I was able to, I could get back into the game because I love the game so much.

4222
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:17,000
There'll always be at least one server up, it's a Final Fantasy game, it'll never die completely. I want to ask you real quick before I let you go, since you brought up MMOs and I know you're big on Sony products and Sony fanboy and all that, and you like free things, what do you think about the announcement of Free Realms coming to PlayStation 3?

4223
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Well, I really haven't formed an opinion as of yet, because obviously I haven't played Free Realms, either on PS3 because it hasn't come out yet for it, and I just got my computer not even two months ago and it just barely runs some games, albeit poorly.

4224
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:55,000
So, until I actually play something, I can't really form a decent opinion about it, but I'm willing to at least give it a try.

4225
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:17,000
I'll tell you what, once I give it a try, let's say for a multitude, I'll either send an email or call in and essentially give a mini review of it. That way I can be a little bit more fair and balanced about it.

4226
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Alright, we'll be looking to hear from you.

4227
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Alright, but for now we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one buddy!

4228
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Yep, you too, take care.

4229
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Alright, later!

4230
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight, thank you guys so much for calling, sorry to those who didn't get through, if you didn't get through tonight, you can always send us an email, our mailbag had like one email in it tonight you guys, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, type out your thoughts and we'll read them next week on the show.

4231
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:47,000
But for now, last minute stories, I forgot to ask Loki, we had some back to back calls tonight, Loki did you have any last minute stories?

4232
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Not too much actually, this is kind of stupid, you know, same thing with DJ Hero, I care about that, I don't really care about this.

4233
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:06,000
But Guitar Hero, hey look, there's more DLC coming out, now I know we said that we weren't going to put anything out because we're done with that series, but the phones asked for it so we're putting out more DLC.

4234
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Well thank you for graciously giving us DLC for your game that you've decided to discontinue, whatever.

4235
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Anyway, so those tracks coming to Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, they're from the artist Trapped, and you get modern...

4236
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Didn't you read this earlier in the show?

4237
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I already did.

4238
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Sorry!

4239
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
We were trying to design textures for GTA.

4240
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I was the only one, Matt.

4241
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I didn't read the story with any angst, so I was trying to do a little bit of journalistic...

4242
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:43,000
It's still stupid though because they say, oh well we're just continuing the series, ah just kidding we're going to put it out because the fans want it.

4243
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:46,000
Who listens to the fans?

4244
02:51:46,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Um, there's apparently the guy that Dan Fortin from Midway, who's now a part of NetherRealm I guess, you may remember him as the Toasty guy.

4245
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:03,000
He's coming back in the new Mortal Kombat game.

4246
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Toasty!

4247
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Yes.

4248
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Alright.

4249
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Well, that's going to do it, I guess if that's it for the last minute stories.

4250
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:14,000
I believe it is.

4251
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Another episode of Orange Launch Radio has come to a close, but not before we say goodnight to everybody.

4252
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Starting off with Matt too, thank you for being here tonight and filling in for Dark Sakura.

4253
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Thanks for the invite, I appreciate it.

4254
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
You did a good job with the news tonight.

4255
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Well, thank you very much.

4256
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Alright, so we'll have to have you back again sometime.

4257
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Hopefully not to fill in for someone.

4258
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Exactly.

4259
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Maybe just to be the fourth wheel at another point.

4260
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Fifth, you've got the chat room.

4261
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
That's true, we do have the chat room.

4262
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Always present fourth guest on the show.

4263
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
I'll be the spare tire.

4264
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
The fifth wheel.

4265
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I'll be the spare tire in the back.

4266
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Excellent.

4267
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I'll be the junk in your trunk.

4268
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Well, we'll see you again, don't wait two years before coming back.

4269
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

4270
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Um, Nutrisystem sucks.

4271
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Although it's working, it sucks.

4272
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:57,000
I did have dinner tonight consisting of Buffalo Wing Pretzel Bites and macaroni and cheese in a cup.

4273
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Delicious.

4274
02:52:58,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Yes.

4275
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Not.

4276
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I'm going to go eat something else when I get home.

4277
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Final thoughts?

4278
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
No, really great to be here.

4279
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Hopefully I'll be invited back on your other podcast in the future so I can be the Deckard Cain of your show and stay a while and listen.

4280
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Of course.

4281
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:15,000
But no, thank you for having me.

4282
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Look, it was a pleasure seeing you and I will work on my angst next time.

4283
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:20,000
And thanks for the beer.

4284
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Did it work?

4285
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Maybe.

4286
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Maybe.

4287
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I've got two more at home.

4288
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:26,000
Awesome.

4289
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Alright, I want to say a final thought, headaches suck.

4290
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
Beer doesn't make headaches better either.

4291
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:34,000
It's too bad.

4292
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

4293
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
I am tracking my 3DS.

4294
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:41,000
It's coming out of Oakland right now so I will have that tomorrow for sure.

4295
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Alright.

4296
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,000
It must get stolen first.

4297
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Unless the plane crashes or they lose it.

4298
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Or it doesn't get stolen in Oakland.

4299
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

4300
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

4301
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
We really appreciate it.

4302
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
You know, we don't ask for anything to do this show except tonight we do ask you to

4303
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:03,000
donate at least $10 to the Red Cross for a game and donate to those in need this week.

4304
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,000
It's very important.

4305
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:08,000
However, outside of that, the way you can help promote this show and continue what we

4306
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,000
do here, just tell a friend.

4307
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Tell a friend about the show.

4308
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Even if you like, I don't know who to tell about the show, leave a nice 5 star review

4309
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:17,000
on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast at.

4310
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Forums.

4311
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I actually get the little emails from Google and see people talk about it on forums and

4312
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
I just really appreciate you guys that say nice things about the show.

4313
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
It doesn't go unnoticed.

4314
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
I really appreciate it.

4315
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:31,000
So, until next time, we'll be back with Dark Soccer to do it all again next week.

4316
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:35,000
I hope you all have a wonderful night and until then, bye bye.

4317
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
Be safe this week.

4318
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:40,000
