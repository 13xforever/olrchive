00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:24,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight, March 13th, 2011, Microsoft shatters sales records, EA bans a player from Dragon Age 2 unintentionally, and despite what's happened to Guitar Hero, could Dance Hero be a reality?

2
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:36,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:46,150
[SPEAKER_02]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at allgames.com, www.allgames.com.

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:53,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host, not here tonight sadly, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,652
[SPEAKER_02]: She is out of town.

8
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel too bad for her though.

9
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,093
[SPEAKER_02]: She's on her way to Disneyland.

10
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:02,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, how can you feel sorry for her when she's going to the happiest freaking place on Earth?

11
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:04,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're stuck here doing the show in her place.

12
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:05,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well.

13
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so she might be joining us a little later for a call.

14
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:09,537
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

15
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: But joining us here, as always, say hello at least to Tech Master Loki is here.

16
00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:14,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Matt2

17
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Rob No.

18
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:36,047
1.

19
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:36,887
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Matt 2?

20
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:37,587
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing well.

21
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yourself?

22
00:01:38,248 --> 00:01:39,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good.

23
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:41,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we just had this conversation.

24
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:45,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like deja vu, but we're not in the Matrix or anything, so it can't be.

25
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:52,956
[SPEAKER_02]: For the podcast listeners, this is take two of the live show because we had a little screw up, but just pretend I didn't ask you these questions just five minutes ago.

26
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:58,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, Matt number two has been here in about two years and five studios ago.

27
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:02,246
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've had like five studios throughout all of OLR.

28
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:03,928
[SPEAKER_02]: You were in the last one that we did.

29
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been a little while.

30
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:11,196
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the folks that listen to Horde House, my Warcraft show, might know you as Grandpa Warcraft.

31
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:12,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

32
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I am the Deckard Cain of your show.

33
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:14,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

34
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,114
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so what types of video games do you play?

35
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:17,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Just tell us generally.

36
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:22,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask you about your gaming week in a little bit, but generally, what types of video games do you like to play and what consoles do you own?

37
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:25,458
[SPEAKER_09]: It's mainly MMOs for the moment and a lot of iOS games.

38
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:29,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing a lot of games on the iPhone 4 and soon my iPad 2, if it ever gets here.

39
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:33,383
[SPEAKER_09]: But I own a 360 and I'm still debating whether getting a Kinect.

40
00:02:34,183 --> 00:03:03,537
[SPEAKER_09]: and uh but my console history goes way back to Atari 5200 and every NES system and then made the transition to PC games when uh games like Descent and Duke Nukem 3D were uber back in the day so is that really like where you like to game the most is PC it kind of fell into PC I got the 360 because of uh Halo I was definitely a fan of the Halo series until recently and other first-person shooters but um oh you say that a little like stinging like I did not like a certain Halo game that really ruined it for me is that what's going on

41
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:11,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I bought Reach, and I beat it on hard, not legendary, within the first few hours.

42
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I went, oh, this is going to be focusing on the multiplayer side, isn't it?

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure enough, it does.

44
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:23,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I'm an okay fan of, but I do like a lot of story, and I was really disappointed in how quick the first person went through.

45
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:28,865
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, there's other first person shooters out there, Call of Duty, Gears of War, things like that, but

46
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:35,380
[SPEAKER_09]: For the time being, it's 360, debating on the Kinect, and a lot of Warcraft on the PC and iOS 4 games.

47
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You do anything else on the PC besides Warcraft?

48
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:38,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Not as of recent.

49
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried Star Trek Online.

50
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie Summers convinced me to give it a try.

51
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:43,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

52
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:46,609
[SPEAKER_09]: As a huge, huge, huge Trekkie, tried it.

53
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,811
[SPEAKER_02]: All your WoW characters are named after Star Trek characters.

54
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:49,832
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to be.

55
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you had one named, like, B'Elanna, and I'm like, I know who that is.

56
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:54,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

57
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the other guy that watched Voyager.

58
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:57,318
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first...

59
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,660
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

60
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:19,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I never leveled her up, she's a rogue sitting there collecting dust, obviously.

61
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:25,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they're all Latin names, because now I'm a lion, so it's much more formal on that side of the... Yeah, exactly.

62
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:31,398
[SPEAKER_09]: But PC games-wise, A Fable, I played a lot of Fable back in the day, and stuff like that.

63
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,542
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so it sounds like you've played quite a variety of different things.

64
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:35,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to.

65
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do the iOS stuff now?

66
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where gaming seems to be going in some ways.

67
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:39,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

68
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,430
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's casual.

69
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I confess I downloaded Angry Birds Seasons today because I figured it's appropriate.

70
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:45,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's St.

71
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Patrick's Day on Thursday.

72
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, okay.

73
00:04:47,759 --> 00:05:16,524
[SPEAKER_09]: they play Irish music in the background and there's shamrocks everywhere and pots of gold if you hit you get bonus points so yeah that's my new addiction I did download reluctantly or regretfully Mega Man 2 and it doesn't work when you don't have an actual tactile controller don't get me started I know and I listened to your podcast about it and it made sense but I love Mega Man it's a huge huge favorite series of mine so I wanted to get it because I'm a supporter and I can't get through the air stage because I can't manipulate the buttons so

74
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:27,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Well they have those little stickers that you can put on your iPad or iPods or whatever to create tactile controls for the touchpad stuff.

75
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:33,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I might invest in that with my iPad 2 because little buttons like on my phone and you got to take them off and put it back on.

76
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

77
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,568
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually have some pretty sweet ones.

78
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:39,792
[SPEAKER_14]: There's ones that were through like ThinkGeek or whatever.

79
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:45,436
[SPEAKER_14]: They had actual, looks like an arcade joystick that plugs on there, which is kind of cool.

80
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:49,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they had some that just kind of stick to the side suction cup wise.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,062
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently they're pretty decent.

82
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:55,665
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, but really they just need to come out with something better.

83
00:05:55,985 --> 00:06:02,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, when it comes to the iPhone 4, and my iPhone 4 and iOS games is kind of my main focus right now.

84
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not on WoW or the PC games.

85
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,810
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good bathroom games.

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the Rope is a great potty game, actually.

87
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,032
[SPEAKER_09]: For cutting the rope?

88
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:12,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

89
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:13,972
[SPEAKER_09]: For pinching the loaf?

90
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:18,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Out on the iStore coming soon.

91
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, speaking of St.

92
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick's Day, since you brought up St.

93
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick's Day, you were kind enough.

94
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:23,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this.

95
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,958
[SPEAKER_02]: When we invite you to the show, you do bribe us a little bit.

96
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:32,320
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought this gigantic beer in a green can thing.

97
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It's imported from Canada.

98
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Canada.

99
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,082
[SPEAKER_02]: America's hat.

100
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,686
[SPEAKER_02]: America's big liberal loving hat.

101
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:42,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's America's suburb.

102
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, no, obviously I'm just giving him a hard time.

103
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:47,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to drink this beer.

104
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you drove tonight, I can drink a beer.

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,150
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

106
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get drunk in Jamie's house when she's not here.

107
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:53,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

108
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:54,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it for Loki.

109
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to go pass out in the vault and watch Dan murder me.

110
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:59,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to drive and I don't like beer, so sorry.

111
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, let's start the celebrating a little early.

112
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:03,537
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

113
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:05,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so hoping that would explode in your face.

114
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's not nice.

115
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it would ruin his microphone.

116
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Ruin the microphone and the keyboard.

117
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:17,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what the audience doesn't know is it's not your average Budweiser 12-ounce can of beer.

118
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:18,503
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a 40.

119
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:19,804
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and it's not 40.

120
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 18 ounces, I believe, or 20.

121
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:25,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a Pilsner with a mild aftertaste, and it's very hoppy.

122
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,006
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, Rob?

123
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad for beer.

124
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:28,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good.

125
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:30,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I can drink one of those.

126
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:31,809
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, usually I don't screw around with beer.

127
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't?

128
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,930
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

129
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, let's fill the glass with vodka, splash a cranberry, I'm good.

130
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:37,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And a twist of lime.

131
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

132
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:45,344
[SPEAKER_09]: But after one of those, Rob, I do get a little tipsy, so I can only imagine what my driving you home is going to be like in a couple hours.

133
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:48,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, this will be, I guess you could say in some ways, my gift to the listeners.

134
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

135
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:49,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been...

136
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a crazy week in the world.

137
00:07:52,170 --> 00:08:11,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been a crazy week in the world, and I realize some people play video games to escape sometimes the crazy things that are going on in the world, and I like this show to kind of be like that too, that if we can give you a few lulls tonight to take your mind off of some of the not-so-lullsy things going on in the world, then I think mission accomplished.

138
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:12,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like a plan.

139
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:13,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Share some.

140
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the type of video games that you've been playing this week since we do always start off the show that way.

141
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

142
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,003
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing?

143
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't play much.

144
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:23,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Grand Theft Auto at work.

145
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:30,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Naughty Bear for like a few minutes, which the game is really low budget.

146
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:36,889
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's kind of funny because they have this British guy who yells out these...

147
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Defluffication is a really low-budget game.

148
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:54,729
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

149
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,618
[SPEAKER_14]: The only downside to it.

150
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And then mainly just working on Grand Theft Auto edits at home.

151
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:29,106
[SPEAKER_14]: And I finally finished, I think, some of the stuff that I got to burn my new discs that we're going to be playing at work now.

152
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is incredibly bloody now because I made the blood effects really huge.

153
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,470
[SPEAKER_14]: But it serves two purposes.

154
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Needs more blood!

155
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,092
[SPEAKER_14]: It serves two purposes.

156
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:44,416
[SPEAKER_14]: One, people are always saying, well, I swear I hit you with the minigun or something like that.

157
00:09:44,556 --> 00:09:45,757
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm like, no, you didn't.

158
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:53,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this way you'll know if you hit somebody because the blood effect is just so huge that you'll see that bullet spray from pretty far away.

159
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:55,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And because it looks fucking awesome.

160
00:09:55,823 --> 00:10:00,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you shoot somebody and it's just hilarious because there's all this blood everywhere.

161
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:02,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

162
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:22,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking she should have her own video game.

163
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, there's something about Lil' Kim.

164
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,101
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.

165
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you wouldn't play a Lil' Kim video game?

166
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,241
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I would not play a Lil' Kim video game.

167
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:49,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, I'm sorry, she thinks she's some sort of sexy samurai there?

168
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, that is not happening.

169
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:52,523
[SPEAKER_14]: She's got big old boobies.

170
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:57,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well in that case, she has all the requirements to fill the samurai position.

171
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Big tits, done.

172
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,326
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a samurai now.

173
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:04,769
[SPEAKER_02]: If there were a video game called Big Titted Samurai, you would check it out.

174
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You would at least kind of look... You would pick up the box and look at the back.

175
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:14,557
[SPEAKER_14]: I would look at that, but, you know... I'm just saying, though, it... Only feels rated M. It's just... It's stupid.

176
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:15,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It's stupid.

177
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:18,281
[SPEAKER_14]: It's stupid that artists have feuds.

178
00:11:18,701 --> 00:11:19,922
[SPEAKER_14]: No one cares.

179
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:23,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, this artist doesn't like this artist.

180
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, no, who cares?

181
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:26,287
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just...

182
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:28,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Westside Rap and East Coast Rap.

183
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:29,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

184
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So stupid.

185
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're all gangsters.

186
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:33,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

187
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:35,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, such the feud.

188
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:38,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's terrible.

189
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to derail the conversation, but I don't know.

190
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about Grand Theft Auto and blood splattering everywhere, I was thinking about that album cover I saw, and I was like, I would play her in a game.

191
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:47,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, exactly.

192
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with Kitsune.

193
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I would play a Robo Geisha video game.

194
00:11:52,278 --> 00:12:01,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd play anything from that company because Robo Geisha is really weird, as many of the other movies that they put out.

195
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm very rude and the second take made me derail a little bit, I forgot to introduce the chat room tonight.

196
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:12,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat.orangeontradio.com If you are listening live at All Games Radio on this Sunday, March the 13th, you should hop on over to our chat room and join us live.

197
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:18,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat.orangeontradio.com And besides, a big tit samurai game, that's just basically the last Ninja Gaiden game.

198
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:25,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Could they just take Dead or Alive 4 and all those big titty characters and give them swords?

199
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,942
[SPEAKER_09]: They already got the basic code down for that.

200
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of Soul Calibur.

201
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:30,625
[SPEAKER_09]: or Soul Calibur.

202
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they already kind of did that though.

203
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:41,754
[SPEAKER_14]: With the last Ninja Gaiden game, they had bonus characters from Dead or Alive and from the other DS, Dragon Sword game and that kind of stuff.

204
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:48,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But once again, I don't think we should really give a rap star a video game.

205
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:49,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Have we not learned from 50 Cent?

206
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,197
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 Cent Blood in the Sand was amazing.

207
00:12:53,378 --> 00:13:02,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I do give you the fact that it is so ridiculous that it is awesome, but I just don't think Lil' Kim has that same appeal.

208
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:03,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, rap stars have their own games, and I would...

209
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Rapstar, Rap Hero

210
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,723
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the only ones that are really doing something new and exciting is Def Jam Rap Star.

211
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:34,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite if you're into the music or not.

212
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,846
[SPEAKER_14]: With their community features, that's really amazing that they have all that.

213
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:39,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And they didn't put it into anything else.

214
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:45,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, we have this cool dancing game that has camera support that people dance in front of a camera.

215
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:47,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Could we have community support for that?

216
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:48,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

217
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:49,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

218
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:51,094
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be forward thinking, of course.

219
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Or how about...

220
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Now's the time.

221
00:13:56,068 --> 00:14:02,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, Guitar Freaks, you know, Drum Mania, maybe you give it another go and not make a crappy game this time.

222
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:02,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

223
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:03,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it be.

224
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it be.

225
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it out to pasture.

226
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:06,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Moo.

227
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:07,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

228
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I bet we'll get another Guitar Hero game.

229
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

230
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:14,404
[SPEAKER_14]: They know the money's there.

231
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:19,928
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just waiting for, you know, they've milked the cow dry, they just have to wait for the milk to come back.

232
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:23,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not saying, like, we're having a Guitar Hero game, like, this year or next year?

233
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, no, they announced it's done, but you think there'll be that renaissance in, like, three years' time?

234
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,016
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't say that they've dissolved the franchise completely.

235
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,978
[SPEAKER_14]: They said there's no Guitar Hero, no Tony Hawk game this year.

236
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, alright, that's very tinfoil hat of you, but we'll see.

237
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:42,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, come on, they think money's there.

238
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:57,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we were talking with Bobby beforehand, and it's going to be a story we're going to be covering later on, talking about a trademark that they had a long time ago, remember, with Drum Villain and Dance Hero, and everyone's like, oh no, here they go, copying DDR.

239
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:02,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what, I mean, seriously, they're just like, okay, what's Marnix doing that...

240
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems profitable.

241
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see what that whole guitar villain idea was all about.

242
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I always envisioned that that was just to protect someone else from doing it.

243
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,544
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be dumb.

244
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:22,247
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, they're basically just going to look at whatever Harmonix is doing that's profitable, then they're going to copy it.

245
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:24,788
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going to happen?

246
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:32,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, if Rock Band 3 continues to be profitable, granted the game didn't sell as well as maybe 2 did, but

247
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:33,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

248
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:03,187
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, our wonderful hero franchise that we support greatly.

249
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:06,192
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we didn't kill off the hero franchise.

250
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,815
[SPEAKER_14]: We're bringing it back with Dance Hero.

251
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:10,949
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

252
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,447
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll do whatever has money behind it.

253
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,328
[SPEAKER_14]: If they can make money doing it, they're going to do it.

254
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:41,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like there's going to be another Call of Duty game because it's Call of Duty.

255
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:42,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes money.

256
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:47,086
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, somewhere in there we were talking about Loki's gaming week, and I get the feeling he's done.

257
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:50,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Matt, too, do you want to share your gaming week and what you've been playing?

258
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm afraid.

259
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,912
[SPEAKER_09]: No, my gaming week, again, I do play Warcraft semi-regularly.

260
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in class right now, so that inhibits some things.

261
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:07,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got different characters I work on there and part of a guild with some IRL friends, so that helps pass the time with WoW.

262
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:10,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming week, you know, Angry Birds is really addicting.

263
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going through all of them, trying to get three stars and everything.

264
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:13,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

265
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I... For me, it's all about the physics, the math behind it.

266
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,568
[SPEAKER_09]: If I get the right angle and the right... I don't know.

267
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:20,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'm... You know what?

268
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:21,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel for him.

269
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to cut the rope, but I do.

270
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:23,891
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

271
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:25,192
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

272
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:31,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand the physics part of it and that's kind of cool and stuff, but... I promise I only play when I poop.

273
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not play when I poop.

274
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:37,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes I play in bed.

275
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I have played in bed, actually.

276
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:46,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I have tried to give Angry Birds... I gave Angry Birds a try, because this is one of the games I bought, and I'm like, oh, everybody likes it, so I'm going to buy it.

277
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:47,542
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 99 cents.

278
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:47,922
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?

279
00:17:48,183 --> 00:17:54,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And I didn't play it for the longest time, and then I actually played it, and it's okay, but I just...

280
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:57,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see how everybody's so obsessed about this game.

281
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,133
[SPEAKER_14]: If it was Scorched Earth, there's no discussion.

282
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:06,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And that has physics and angle calculation and all that fun stuff.

283
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:07,136
[SPEAKER_14]: And tanks.

284
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:10,177
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that's what really Angry Birds needs is Scorched Earth.

285
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:17,322
[SPEAKER_09]: If you played Angry Birds and they released an ad, maybe another 99 cents, and every time you killed a pig it would explode bloody, would you then play it?

286
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:21,444
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I wouldn't because it's a cheap cash-in, just like all these holiday add-ons.

287
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,585
[SPEAKER_14]: are cheap cashes.

288
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:22,985
[SPEAKER_14]: They are.

289
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: What if the pig exploded and then bacon comes out the USB slot on your phone?

290
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,510
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's okay.

291
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, it's all right.

292
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep your protein to yourself.

293
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:36,636
[SPEAKER_14]: See, the thing about... Oh, I forgot to mention it because it wasn't really part of my gaming week, but I made bacon ice cream this week.

294
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:38,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

295
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually breakfast ice cream.

296
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Breakfast ice cream?

297
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's because there's waffle cone in there and maple syrup.

298
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, bacon, waffles.

299
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you cover it in chocolate?

300
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:52,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like something you'd order at IHOP where you can get dessert for breakfast.

301
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, seriously.

302
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That French toast that's fucking stuffed with cream cheese and all that shit, that is not breakfast!

303
00:18:57,415 --> 00:19:00,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I had chicken and waffles for breakfast today from the IHOP.

304
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:02,479
[SPEAKER_09]: That's better than bacon-flavored ice cream.

305
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, any way to think about getting chicken and waffles at IHOP, don't.

306
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,005
[SPEAKER_14]: It's alright, but it's not good.

307
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,728
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's not like, mmm, that's really yummy.

308
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:14,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of, yeah, I'm full now.

309
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:15,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how's your food week?

310
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in here was Angry Birds and Ayas, and now we're talking about frying the birds and serving them with waffles.

311
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:21,734
[SPEAKER_02]: You said bacon!

312
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:22,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all your fault.

313
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,515
[SPEAKER_09]: You did say bacon.

314
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,417
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but anyway, so I did make bacon ice cream.

315
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:29,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I put too much bacon in it, and I know how... Nonsense!

316
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly!

317
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Nonsense.

318
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:40,747
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just... You have to really be in the mood for bacon ice cream, because if you're eating it, it's ice creamy, and then all of a sudden salty.

319
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just like, huh?

320
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is there salt in there?

321
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's a little strange.

322
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,469
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife likes it, actually, though.

323
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:50,170
[SPEAKER_14]: She likes the bacon ice cream.

324
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,710
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a horrible Jew.

325
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible, horrible.

326
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,211
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

327
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:56,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I love her.

328
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:57,472
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

329
00:19:58,152 --> 00:19:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, so yeah, Angry Birds, right?

330
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:04,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a lot of iOS games on my iPhone 4.

331
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, as I mentioned, I'm getting an iPad 2.

332
00:20:05,674 --> 00:20:07,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, a week's end.

333
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:10,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to wait in lines and get it, so I ordered it online and

334
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:16,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I have that, I'll sink in and play Angry Birds in huge, huge, what is that, 9.7 inch?

335
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Angry Birds HD.

336
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:18,261
[SPEAKER_09]: HD.

337
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:23,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not retina display, unfortunately, but it is HD because it's 9.7 inch diagonal screen, whatever.

338
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap, that's a game that's really going to utilize HD graphics.

339
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:26,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

340
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: You see those pigs, beady eyes, winking at you?

341
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:33,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Aside from that, I... The pig is saying no.

342
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:34,595
[SPEAKER_09]: The pig is saying no.

343
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:35,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

344
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: DLC content.

345
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked the DLC content.

346
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:57,014
[SPEAKER_09]: I was disappointed that it was very out of chronological order.

347
00:20:57,954 --> 00:21:05,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you pass the game, you download some DLC, it pretty much says, oh, just pretend that you didn't end the game and this is extra stuff.

348
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,462
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm curious about Dragon Age 2, getting reviews.

349
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:12,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing mostly good, but I defer to your chat room if anyone's bought it.

350
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:18,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate your opinions and I might be picking up that and detoxing from WoW for a bit and then going over to my Xbox.

351
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:29,677
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have a normal life Not be tied down to a fugitive with no future But I don't ever want to leave you Don't ever leave Do you mean that?

352
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have me here, living with you?

353
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:53,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's why I have a problem with Bioware.

354
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,406
[SPEAKER_14]: There's such fucking teases.

355
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:59,027
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no nudity, and there's definitely no sex scenes.

356
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's implied stuff.

357
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:02,688
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of, like, jump on the bed.

358
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:07,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to this.

359
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:11,210
[SPEAKER_09]: See, look at that.

360
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,790
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tongue right there.

361
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That was some tongue, some big gay kissing.

362
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:19,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's woman on woman and man on woman too, whatever you want.

363
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:24,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if we can have boobs in God of War, why can't we have boobs in, you know, Dragon Age or Mass Effect?

364
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it just wouldn't be classy.

365
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, who cares?

366
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,740
[SPEAKER_02]: If you listen to that dialogue, it was classy.

367
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,721
[SPEAKER_02]: The British are classy folk.

368
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I would rather die than spend a moment not here with you.

369
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:33,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, then fine.

370
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:39,322
[SPEAKER_14]: They need to, you know, consult with Hugh Hefner to make a classy, you know, topless woman game, okay?

371
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:42,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, I don't understand why they can't do this.

372
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:43,944
[SPEAKER_14]: and you know what?

373
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,046
[SPEAKER_14]: They can do full frontal for guys on there.

374
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:49,730
[SPEAKER_14]: They did it in Grand Theft Auto in the Lost in Damn expansion.

375
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So if they can do it classy there, then why can't they?

376
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But the important thing is classy.

377
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,779
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your video game to be classy, topless women.

378
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think of a classy penis.

379
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:01,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think there really is one.

380
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, why yes, Guinevere, this tea tastes rather lovely.

381
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:10,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm quite enjoying this little tea and crumpets that we're having today.

382
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, but I seem to have lost my bra.

383
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you seen my bra?

384
00:23:16,035 --> 00:23:17,576
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the game that Loki wants to play.

385
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:18,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Classy, topless woman.

386
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:19,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds very boring.

387
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That would conclude my gaming week because we're moving on to another topic that I think is probably a different podcast.

388
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:31,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Then moving on, my gaming week.

389
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:35,571
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the same old stuff, Warcraft, You Don't Know Jack, and a lot of those fun games.

390
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,193
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did play one new game this week that I wanted to talk about.

391
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:43,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've been listening over the past couple weeks, you know I've been very excited about Torchlight coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

392
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,120
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

393
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:05,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a nutshell, Torchlight is very much inspired by Diablo 2.

394
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:08,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously we've gone through a huge drought.

395
00:24:08,617 --> 00:24:10,638
[SPEAKER_02]: There hasn't been a Diablo game in many, many years.

396
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,819
[SPEAKER_02]: The last Diablo game was, what, 99, 2000?

397
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there's one coming out, but that doesn't help me now.

398
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,121
[SPEAKER_02]: So Torchlight was really there to fill the void.

399
00:24:20,381 --> 00:24:26,023
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like those dungeon-crawling games where you kind of get the items and socket the items, have your talent trees, all that stuff.

400
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:29,444
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing it lacked, unfortunately, multiplayer.

401
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

402
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

403
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:09,682
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

404
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very interesting to kind of see that style of game now on the Xbox because this isn't really the type of game we see a lot on Xbox, I think.

405
00:25:35,746 --> 00:25:39,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not an action-y game like Tomb Raider.

406
00:25:39,228 --> 00:25:42,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an intense role-playing game like Final Fantasy.

407
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of somewhere in between.

408
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:49,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's neat to see something like this on Xbox, but they had to change some things.

409
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:50,852
[SPEAKER_02]: There's less pointing and clicking.

410
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:52,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You attack with the X button.

411
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:58,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Your menus are totally different now because you don't really have the bag that you have everything in.

412
00:25:58,414 --> 00:25:59,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just straight up.

413
00:25:59,114 --> 00:26:01,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You have 50 slots and different tabs.

414
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,595
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird to navigate.

415
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little overwhelming at first.

416
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gotta be honest.

417
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Torchlight's biggest drawback for me on the Xbox 360 is what they had to do to convert it to console I think in some ways the text is very small so if you don't have a big TV you might be in a little bit of trouble

418
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:22,816
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

419
00:26:37,982 --> 00:27:02,790
[SPEAKER_02]: um and uh you know just the weird having so many buttons like to send your pet to town you have to bring up your menu with start hit the back button to bring up the pet menu and then hit the y button to send him to town like it's just you know there's a lot to it which I understand that's what they have to do to make a PC game work on the Xbox 360 with minimal um you know kind of loss you know you don't want the game to lose anything and the good news is it doesn't

420
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

421
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:47,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're good like you really only need this if you insist like I've got to have something to play on the TV or I really want to have this on console I want to go for the achievements those are all really good reasons I suppose you know but I would say if you've never played the game before and you're kind of trying to decide like do I want to play this go check out the PC demo not the Xbox 360 one because I think the PC demo is a little bit better representative of what Torchlight really is so that would be my recommendation but it's not a

422
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad game.

423
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:52,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like it lost a little something when it came over from the PC.

424
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The PC version is really superior.

425
00:27:56,726 --> 00:27:58,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out on the PC.

426
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:04,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you must, if you don't have a computer good enough or something, I guess you could always use the Xbox 360 One as a substitute.

427
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:05,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.

428
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not, again, that same level as the PC.

429
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was pretty much my gaming week.

430
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping.

431
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot in housekeeping I want to talk about right now.

432
00:28:16,674 --> 00:28:18,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about something after this first story here.

433
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:21,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say, of course, our Twitter.

434
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:24,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to add us on Twitter.

435
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can always add us on Facebook as well.

436
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

437
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:31,764
[SPEAKER_02]: A good way to always follow us and see what the latest and greatest is about our show.

438
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Forgot to mention my game week.

439
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:33,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

440
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Since I'm not really playing it yet, but I will be tomorrow.

441
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,209
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting a Japanese 3DS.

442
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:39,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming tomorrow.

443
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:39,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

444
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

445
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,852
[SPEAKER_02]: What made you decide to take the plunge and get the Japanese 3DS?

446
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like everything early.

447
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Even his ice cream for breakfast.

448
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:56,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a problem with needing to have things early.

449
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:05,465
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm getting a Japanese 3DS with Nintendogs and then Ridge Racer.

450
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:09,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Only because Pilotwings wasn't out yet, right?

451
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise we would have gotten Pilotwings.

452
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:15,590
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to bring that to the studio next week because I got to see one a while ago, but I want to kind of see what that finished product looks like.

453
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Jamie would love to check it out too.

454
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:25,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but it would be fun too if they have good import games later on because sometimes Japan gets stuff before we do, like Smash Brothers and stuff.

455
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:29,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm still getting a US one when that comes out with Street Fighter 4.

456
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:31,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you have an addiction.

457
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so funny, too, because just last week, you were all... Last week was a really good Loki hating on Nintendo show, and now he's sitting here going, yeah, I'm buying 2DS, 3DSes.

458
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really funny.

459
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I never said I wasn't buying the 3DS.

460
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,168
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, I know.

461
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes you mad that they don't reach their full potential.

462
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

463
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:51,274
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a problem with Nintendo as far as making hardware and stuff.

464
00:29:51,474 --> 00:29:52,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a problem with them not...

465
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:55,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like you said, reaching their full potential.

466
00:29:56,298 --> 00:29:57,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Remaking games, come on.

467
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,485
[SPEAKER_14]: These Nintendo 64 ports to the 3DS, that's just some cheap shit right there.

468
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:09,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Going into our chatroom at chat.orange.com, DarkToagak says, Loki is going to make 3D porn on it, no doubt.

469
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,415
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm not.

470
00:30:11,997 --> 00:30:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

471
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's the old adage about new hardware coming out?

472
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:19,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to penis is the whole, like, how long before somebody tries to put their penis on it?

473
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, Loki bought Nintendogs.

474
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,170
[SPEAKER_02]: He's part of the problem.

475
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:24,395
[SPEAKER_02]: You are part of the problem.

476
00:30:24,596 --> 00:30:25,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I am part of the problem.

477
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,199
[SPEAKER_14]: But, okay, here's why I bought Nintendogs, okay?

478
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:33,261
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a completely weird reason for it.

479
00:30:33,481 --> 00:30:34,702
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason I wanted it.

480
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:35,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, not the cats, too.

481
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a cat that's already annoying.

482
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:48,832
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the reason I bought Nintendogs plus cats is because I think that shows off the 3D pretty well, and this is something I'm really going to be kind of showing to my coworkers to kind of say, hey, look, check out the thing.

483
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:49,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Research purposes.

484
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:50,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

485
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:50,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

486
00:30:52,856 --> 00:30:55,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I, yeah, whatever.

487
00:30:55,497 --> 00:30:57,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, fair enough.

488
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:02,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It was, okay, it was either that or Professor Layton, because I can't read Japanese, so that's not going to do me any good.

489
00:31:03,158 --> 00:31:09,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Or there's like some cube puzzle game, no thanks, and then the rest of the games are coming out over here anyways.

490
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, it would have been, if they had Pilotwings, I would have bought Pilotwings, I will get Pilotwings when it comes out in the US.

491
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well we'll be hearing more about the 3DS next week then for sure.

492
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:20,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.

493
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

494
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's get into the news tonight.

495
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:26,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's going to start us off with some news.

496
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:32,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I mentioned a bit ago, a lot of stuff going on in the world and some of it reaching into video games for all of us.

497
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,691
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

498
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:26,327
[SPEAKER_14]: um so because of that uh Square Enix has decided to shut off the servers for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy 11 for at least one week and um also other companies affected by this as well Konami um they're shutting off the servers for Metal Gear Online which to be honest until I read that I forgot that Metal Gear Online even existed so uh yeah I'm sure lots of people playing that um

499
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:32,444
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, those are the two companies so far that are included in part of that.

500
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:36,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows what other companies will be having that.

501
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:41,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still pretty big, though, because you're talking about two major MMOs, for better or for worse.

502
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know we've given Final Fantasy XIV a hard time on the show.

503
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:44,508
[SPEAKER_02]: One major MMO.

504
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:46,210
[SPEAKER_02]: One major pile of crap.

505
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,336
[SPEAKER_02]: But you and I spent many years on Final Fantasy XI and it still certainly has its fans.

506
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:59,569
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of not something we hear a lot in the gaming world where it's like an MMO literally gets put on hold because of real life.

507
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:00,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just kind of...

508
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:08,753
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an old adage, especially in Warcraft, and I'm sure the other MMOs have this too, is that RL greater than wow, or whatever your game of choice is.

509
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:14,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that especially is kind of what's coming into play this week, and I can't see how really anyone can complain about this.

510
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:18,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious if they're going to shut down for that week, if they're going to issue credits to all those customers for that week.

511
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:21,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's on their bad, and their decision to shut it down.

512
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:22,396
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're going to.

513
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're going to do like a free month or something like that.

514
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:30,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they will, and I think I read somewhere it is confirmed they're going to gift them the month of April.

515
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's awfully generous.

516
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:38,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly, in a situation like this, I really don't think they would necessarily owe them anything.

517
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people would understand, but you would always have that one person who's like,

518
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:46,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure all of us have probably seen the pictures and the damage, and if you haven't, definitely take a moment to look at that.

519
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:53,964
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't... My gut tells me the extensive damage they have, one week, them shutting down, I think it's going to be the first of many weeks or rotating weeks off.

520
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:55,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why I said at least a week.

521
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:55,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

522
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:55,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

523
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:56,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

524
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:58,550
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

525
00:34:16,751 --> 00:34:17,492
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no words.

526
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:21,635
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no words for what is happening and what we're seeing on the television.

527
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:27,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't imagine that scale of what a tsunami can do.

528
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I really would challenge you all, our listeners.

529
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:34,364
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this show for nine plus years.

530
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:37,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Never once have we ever asked you for money.

531
00:34:37,706 --> 00:34:54,191
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight I'm going to ask you for money and I'm going to say you need to buy one less game this month or one less arcade game, Xbox Live Arcade game or maybe not pay for an MMO for a month take the money that you're saving on Final Fantasy XI or Final Fantasy XIV

532
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:01,796
[SPEAKER_02]: and go to RedCross.org R-E-D-C-R-O-S-S.org and please make a donation.

533
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:04,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody should try to do at least $10.

534
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:13,864
[SPEAKER_02]: If all the OLR listeners could donate $10, that, you know, it's still a little bit for what they're really going to need in the big picture, but it's a start.

535
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:18,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, just whatever you guys can give would be so appreciated.

536
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:23,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So please consider cutting back on a game this month and giving money to

537
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:23,930
[SPEAKER_02]: RedCross.org

538
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: because even if you strap for cash, there's probably a lot of other volunteer types of things you could do to help, and that would all go a long way as well.

539
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So I needed to get that out there.

540
00:35:56,379 --> 00:36:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I talked about our show being an escape, but there is the reality that, well, there's people that need help.

541
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's move on with some other gaming news.

542
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to do with the Microsoft Kinect.

543
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:16,608
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of big news this week about the Kinect and some of the sales figures.

544
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:21,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Some reports coming out there that 10 million Kinect units

545
00:36:22,091 --> 00:36:23,631
[SPEAKER_02]: have been sold.

546
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:30,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That is from Aaron Greenberg, who is one of the executives at Xbox, wrote a tweet.

547
00:36:31,853 --> 00:36:41,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently this is so fast and so reaching that Guinness World Records actually went out and said that the Kinect is the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time.

548
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:48,036
[SPEAKER_02]: 133,000 plus units each day for the first 60 days.

549
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:50,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's faster than the iPhone or the iPad.

550
00:36:51,457 --> 00:37:01,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really surprising to me because I thought with all this iPad abaloo last year and everything, I would have thought for sure the iPad sold faster, but I guess not.

551
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:08,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to Microsoft for that, but seriously, Guinness, you need to find some different types of records to put in your book.

552
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:14,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Look for some tall people or people that are fat or people that can eat dog food or something like that.

553
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:17,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, just not like Consumer Electronics.

554
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:21,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, the gamer edition of the Guinness Book of World Records is just retarded.

555
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,301
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just most popular character.

556
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:26,861
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, ugh.

557
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, something else to follow that up with is that Microsoft also apparently had the biggest non-holiday month ever.

558
00:37:36,023 --> 00:38:04,994
[SPEAKER_02]: February 2011 they sold over half a million Xbox 360s 535,000 to be exact the biggest non-holiday month ever 27% up over last year that's pretty significant considering nothing's really coming out for them it's all this Kinect momentum because obviously it's these bundles with the Kinect and Kinect Adventures and now that people are starting to play them at friends houses and see them on shows and hear about it in school and so forth I think the word is really starting to spread about this and I think that's what's kind of keeping it going

559
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, very interesting.

560
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Not hearing a lot about the move.

561
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:13,815
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, though, Sony didn't have a bad month.

562
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:15,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sony sold quite a few units, too.

563
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,918
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting closer to Nintendo.

564
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:21,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's about to slip into third place, which is really big news.

565
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:24,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is not even going to slip into third place or first place.

566
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,589
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I believe they sold more 360s than Wiis last month, didn't they?

567
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:29,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, last month.

568
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, they're in first place.

569
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they've got a lot of catching up to do before they're in third place.

571
00:38:39,555 --> 00:38:49,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, though, I think with the move, it's kind of funny because from a retail standpoint, they're treating it like there's still shortages on the move stuff.

572
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:54,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Which makes no sense because there's no demand for the move stuff at all.

573
00:38:55,426 --> 00:38:58,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet, you know, this stuff is hard to get for some reason.

574
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:05,429
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah, I mean, they're doing some stuff with the move now that people are actually interested in.

575
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:14,091
[SPEAKER_14]: You'd be surprised, like, the SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3 stuff with the, you know, their stupid move gun that they have.

576
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:16,492
[SPEAKER_14]: People are actually interested in that.

577
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:17,332
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just...

578
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:28,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Never would have guessed, it seems really stupid, but the actual peripherals that they've made for it aren't just shells like the Zapper.

579
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:38,040
[SPEAKER_14]: These are actual things that do have integrated buttons and triggers and stuff like that that aren't just, okay, I pull this trigger and it pulls a lever that pushes this button.

580
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,221
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not anything like that.

581
00:39:39,321 --> 00:39:44,463
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actual, some special stuff that they're adding to these, so it's a little bit

582
00:39:45,303 --> 00:39:46,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Better, but still kind of ridiculous.

583
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:50,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think the play of first-person shooter that way, but people are interested.

584
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,106
[SPEAKER_14]: So that may help.

585
00:39:52,326 --> 00:39:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so curious about this year's E3 and where the Kinect goes.

586
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:06,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Props to Sony, though, for at least allowing the move to be supported by their big tentpole titles that they're putting out.

587
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the Kinect, not really having that.

588
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:10,473
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you have the Kinect games, and that's it.

589
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:14,535
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to see Kinect support for Gears of War, at least not Gears of War 3.

590
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:15,816
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

591
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:34,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's funny.

592
00:40:34,657 --> 00:40:44,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there are no first part Microsoft titles right now for a while, probably the fourth quarter, but we're not seeing anything like Patches of the Fable or something like that.

593
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:46,508
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no Kinect support for that stuff.

594
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,212
[SPEAKER_14]: They haven't really embraced it yet, I guess.

595
00:40:50,832 --> 00:41:13,137
[SPEAKER_02]: well I mean they have their first party Kinect games that they made but there's no like you know core games that are part of that again E3 I think is going to really be telling as to what their strategical direction is for you know phase two of the software you know so and possibly integrating that into their core lineup especially didn't we have a story a couple weeks ago about the whole Halo remake happening that now the rumor is it could be Kinect

596
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:33,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, I don't think, once again, I mean, they should have it be optional, obviously, and then the other thing is I think they should have a couple different levels that you go with it where, you know, not necessarily everything's motion controlled, but maybe head tracking, once again, I think head tracking added to a first-person shooter is just no-brainer.

597
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:37,970
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be doing this anyways for, you know, just having that part Kinect-enabled.

598
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,551
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need to be running around with Kinect for everything, just...

599
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:59,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like it shouldn't be like mass arm flailing all over the place, like that's what I fear, but it might be kind of cool, like okay, you have the controller or whatever, and maybe like to lob a bomb or something, you would like throw your hand up or something, like you know, like lob a bomb, like something very subtle, where you know, you're not kind of breaking out of that controller thing, but I don't know.

600
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:00,151
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

601
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,324
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't want to move your head around, fine, then don't.

602
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:25,264
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to.

603
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:27,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can just turn that off.

604
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:30,225
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of support would be awesome.

605
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:32,165
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a ton of first-person shooters coming out.

606
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:33,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

607
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:34,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, you should be able to do that.

608
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:44,207
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to find a way to keep reinventing or adding to FPSs because, at least for me, the allure has kind of died away, like I mentioned earlier with Halo and just kind of, eh.

609
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:46,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Medal of Honor and stuff like that.

610
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:48,549
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

611
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:05,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

612
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:24,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Crysis

613
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,263
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be good thinking about it, thinking forward with Kinect.

614
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:46,105
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an unknown game that maybe people don't remember.

615
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,366
[SPEAKER_09]: PsyOps came out for Xbox a while back.

616
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:52,230
[SPEAKER_09]: You gain telekinesis power and can move things with your mind.

617
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a puzzle, first person shooter.

618
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Third person if you readjust the video settings right.

619
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:58,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can see that having a lot of fun with Kinect.

620
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:02,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You move your arm to move a box out of the way and then you go back to your controller and shoot things.

621
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,422
[SPEAKER_09]: You could throw a box at enemies and knock them around.

622
00:44:06,442 --> 00:44:07,963
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be pretty freaking amazing.

623
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: How about an Xbox Live Arcade game that's Kinect-enabled called Slap-a-Bitch?

624
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:18,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you would do is just, you know, you walk around with a controller or whatever, and then you can just reach out and slap a bitch.

625
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:22,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and it's other people that are on the Kinect.

626
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like Halo, but it's slapping.

627
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:25,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a slap fight

628
00:44:50,985 --> 00:44:58,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Once they release that development kit, or I should say the software development kit for the indie marketplace, there will be a slap a bitch.

629
00:44:58,756 --> 00:44:59,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I guarantee it.

630
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:01,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Slap a hoe, slap a bitch, slap a baby.

631
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Slap that ass.

632
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:05,425
[SPEAKER_09]: We're so bad.

633
00:45:05,665 --> 00:45:05,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

634
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

635
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,203
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some more gaming news?

636
00:45:08,443 --> 00:45:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going over to Matt, too, tonight.

637
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:10,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

638
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:20,011
[SPEAKER_09]: So keeping with the whole Microsoft company discussion, turns out those codes on the back of your Microsoft Live cards actually have a pattern to them.

639
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:31,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So a group of smart hackers decided to look at those codes, take some old Xbox Live Points cards and Xbox Gold trial codes, and they figured out an algorithm that

640
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:31,719
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

641
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:48,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Spacebucks.

642
00:45:48,973 --> 00:45:49,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Spacebucks.

643
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:51,135
[SPEAKER_09]: One million Spacebucks.

644
00:45:51,736 --> 00:45:55,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, Microsoft caught on to this and pulled the codes online.

645
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,283
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I was reviewing some of the news, it tossed a question to me.

646
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:04,588
[SPEAKER_09]: The algorithm is still enforced to the cards on Walmart and Target walls.

647
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:04,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

648
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:11,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not understanding, because, okay, they pull these codes that were posted online, but aren't they still sitting on shelves somewhere?

649
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:11,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

650
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:20,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So my thinking, or my thoughts were, when I was reading this, like, okay, cool, that's great, you pulled the codes, but the existing codes on store shelves are still probably the same algorithm, or maybe a set of algorithms.

651
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:22,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there might be several.

652
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and so they must be in their new batch of product for that.

653
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:29,394
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to be redoing the algorithm on that.

654
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there'll be a recall.

655
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the algorithm... Because I'm sure these codes probably not just tell that it's a Microsoft code, but it probably actually tells Microsoft where the card was bought.

656
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

657
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:45,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine the GameStop chain probably all has similar digits in the beginning or something like that.

658
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:50,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever algorithm was cracked is probably tied to one particular retail chain.

659
00:46:50,326 --> 00:46:50,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

660
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:52,387
[SPEAKER_02]: and Beyond Points.

661
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:56,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I might sound like an idiot to the folks that did this because I don't profess to know how you crack an algorithm.

662
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,271
[SPEAKER_14]: These aren't necessarily like the 1600 point cards.

663
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:03,474
[SPEAKER_14]: These are like the 160 Microsoft point cards that you get with some games and stuff.

664
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:10,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, the actual point value is 160, so we're not talking a lot, but they were able to refresh and then regenerate the algorithm and keep going.

665
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:14,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And even they were able to find the code for bringing in props to Halo Reach and things like that.

666
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So on top of digital tchotchkes and...

667
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:17,403
[SPEAKER_09]: and Spacebucks.

668
00:47:17,803 --> 00:47:19,385
[SPEAKER_09]: They were able to figure out the codes and the patterns.

669
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:20,606
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkToyGag has a really good question.

670
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:21,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't these things have to be activated?

671
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you buy the cards at the store?

672
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:27,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought once they scan on the barcode then they're active or whatever.

673
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:27,432
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

674
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:28,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

675
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:32,857
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a piece of cardboard that has a code underneath it.

676
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:48,413
[SPEAKER_14]: that's what makes me wonder I can understand they did the 160 point cards those things but if they started doing 1600 point cards there would be no way for them to track that how would they even be able to figure out which ones are sold and stuff

677
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,521
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

678
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:14,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well actually it wasn't from cards from what I'm looking up here real quick.

679
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:18,820
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually from a website that was generating these codes.

680
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,140
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like a promotion thing.

681
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,781
[SPEAKER_14]: So they figured out that you can go to this website.

682
00:48:23,202 --> 00:48:25,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Because really you're only supposed to be able to go there once.

683
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:32,366
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go to this website, change part of this URL that's in there, and you can see if the code's working or not.

684
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:37,148
[SPEAKER_14]: And then basically you keep...

685
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:39,389
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like the forum where it's located.

686
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,851
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, the algorithm stays.

687
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they're existing cards, I don't know.

688
00:48:46,614 --> 00:48:47,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I always figured there's a pattern to it.

689
00:48:47,835 --> 00:48:52,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But someone found the exploit and they shared it with the community and bought them for about a million bucks.

690
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta be honest, I mean, this news kind of sucks for Microsoft, but I'm kind of surprised it didn't happen sooner.

691
00:48:59,278 --> 00:48:59,578
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

692
00:48:59,598 --> 00:49:02,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering how long those types of cards have been around, I'm surprised.

693
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, again, I guess it wasn't the cards, and maybe it took this website flaw or whatever to really rip the hole open to get these points, but I'm really surprised it didn't happen sooner, to be honest.

694
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:16,782
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wonder if other gaming companies or consoles like this, Sony, we...

695
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:22,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they are taking stock in this and how they procure their point cards and stuff.

696
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:26,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really wondering what effect this might have on digital distribution down the line.

697
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,881
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta kind of be wondering if people are able to exploit that system.

698
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:56,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Is digital download as smart of an idea as we all thought?

699
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does it need some time to get more secure?

700
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:05,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have lulled harder if they were exploiting those Facebook gift cards you can buy in the stores.

701
00:50:05,145 --> 00:50:06,265
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no value in that.

702
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:08,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious if even one of those is sold yet.

703
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:09,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's been reported.

704
00:50:10,066 --> 00:50:13,147
[SPEAKER_14]: You saw this week though, they started renting movies on Facebook.

705
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:14,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh lord.

706
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:15,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.

707
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:20,015
[SPEAKER_09]: and something else for people to spend their space bucks on or give credit cards over to.

708
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:23,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically enough, the first movie that they started renting was The Dark Knight, right?

709
00:50:23,618 --> 00:50:29,642
[SPEAKER_02]: The Batman movie with Heath Ledger and all I could think of in my mind was and here we go.

710
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:33,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that was the joke, I don't know.

711
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:37,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will be avoiding that part of Facebook.

712
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:39,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want them to have my credit card information, that's for damn sure.

713
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:50,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, a million bucks has been bled dry from the coffers of Microsoft, and they've quickly in their lesson have to start changing their strategy on how to deal with codes, perhaps.

714
00:50:51,624 --> 00:50:54,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Be interesting to see the ramifications of this six months from now.

715
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:57,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they can figure out who uses those codes, so they're going to punish them.

716
00:50:59,209 --> 00:50:59,449
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura,

717
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:22,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Your PlayStation Plus subscriber.

718
00:51:22,265 --> 00:51:22,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just about to ask.

719
00:51:22,845 --> 00:51:25,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, you have to be PlayStation Plus for that, right?

720
00:51:25,467 --> 00:51:25,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

721
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:31,651
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're PlayStation Plus, you can save some games or your game saves online.

722
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:40,517
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, apparently, according to one of the PlayStation 3 hackers, it has re-secured the PlayStation 3.

723
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:50,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Because obviously the keys are still in there, but they've just moved them to someplace else and they have another key in place.

724
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:56,066
[SPEAKER_14]: So, for now, it's been secured, but it's just a matter of time.

725
00:51:56,467 --> 00:52:03,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, you can't... Even calling it re-secured, that just doomed it for failure right there.

726
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:06,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Just saying, nope, still broken.

727
00:52:07,433 --> 00:52:08,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing to see here.

728
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:10,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep on moving.

729
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,536
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's hack-proof, Loki.

730
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: This new firmware is hacker-proof.

731
00:52:15,438 --> 00:52:15,959
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not hacker-proof.

732
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody will hack it.

733
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing is hacker-proof.

734
00:52:18,623 --> 00:52:29,538
[SPEAKER_14]: And no one's bothering to even... Well, here's the thing, though, is no one's bothering to update their firmware right now because you can spoof it anyway, so you can still connect to the PlayStation Network if you really want to, but...

735
00:52:32,466 --> 00:52:34,689
[SPEAKER_02]: is cloud saving something that interests anyone in this room?

736
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:46,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's kind of neat because if I go to visit friends in the Bay Area or something I could connect to the cloud I guess and get my game saves especially for things like

737
00:52:48,026 --> 00:53:11,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I own this on the 360 so maybe it's a moot point but you don't know Jack like you remember when I was reviewing the game I talked about you really want to make sure that save file goes with you otherwise you're going to be recycling games because of the dumb way you have only five episodes at a time able to lock or whatever if you don't take that game save with you you're going to end up recycling games very quickly in that so the cloud save would be very useful for that because I don't always think to copy my save file to a card and so on

738
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,241
[SPEAKER_14]: I was gonna say, yeah, you just... I mean, thumb drives are fucking cheap.

739
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:21,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, why would I spend money on PlayStation Plus to... I have two jump drives right here.

740
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of these cost me less than $10.

741
00:53:23,046 --> 00:53:25,447
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, why would I... And those are 8 gigs.

742
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:33,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would I even waste my time with... I think they have... I think the cap was 150... I don't know if it's 150 saves or if it's 150 megabytes.

743
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:34,613
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember what it was.

744
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The honest thing I can say is that sometimes you just don't know when you're gonna need a game save file.

745
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:41,658
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

746
00:53:56,536 --> 00:53:57,236
[SPEAKER_14]: I know one person.

747
00:53:58,377 --> 00:54:07,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I feel the same way about cloud saving with the whole Rock Band Guitar Hero things because I go to one of my buddy's houses who has played Rock Band extensively and unlocked a lot of the games.

748
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:11,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I come back to my house and I haven't finished those parts of the tours and unlocked the songs to play.

749
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:13,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So cloud saving would make a lot of sense.

750
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:15,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you could just go in the menu and do the all unlock.

751
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:18,650
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be cheating, Rob.

752
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but here's the other problem too with the cloud saving thing is don't you have to put your profile on their system anyways?

753
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:27,541
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can't just dump the save off the internet.

754
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:31,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with Xbox, yeah, it is profile-centric.

755
00:54:31,965 --> 00:54:32,306
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

756
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a better idea, okay?

757
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:39,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is great, and this will cost you no money, so fuck PlayStation Plus.

758
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:41,117
[SPEAKER_14]: You take that game save.

759
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:42,298
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not very big.

760
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:43,999
[SPEAKER_14]: You email it to yourself.

761
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom!

762
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,180
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on the cloud!

763
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:46,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't need to fucking pay them for shit.

764
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:47,783
[SPEAKER_14]: You want that?

765
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Download that save anywhere.

766
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:50,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Download the save.

767
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:51,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Just go to a PC, download it.

768
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:56,310
[SPEAKER_14]: But your friends who don't have a PC, I don't believe you, because everybody has a PC nowadays.

769
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And seriously, why am I going to pay?

770
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:00,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's on the cloud.

771
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

772
00:55:03,353 --> 00:55:04,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Emeril Lagasse.

773
00:55:04,614 --> 00:55:06,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And he pointed up, you know, let us know in the studio.

774
00:55:06,575 --> 00:55:08,557
[SPEAKER_09]: He pointed up towards the cloud in case we were confused.

775
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:10,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case we didn't know, he pointed up at the cloud.

776
00:55:10,518 --> 00:55:11,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the cloud.

777
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:12,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom, headshot on the cloud.

778
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

779
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,823
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, my USB drive is bigger than the cloud.

780
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:20,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

781
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:25,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Google Mail, Gmail, bigger than the cloud.

782
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:25,947
[SPEAKER_14]: 7.8 gigs, right?

783
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:45,592
[SPEAKER_14]: and you know if I remember correctly I believe you can download stuff through the web browser on the PlayStation 3 I think I'm not sure what you can download if it's just images and stuff like that to save to your system but you may very well be able to download game saves

784
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's a point from SpazinatorPC, can't wait to hear your response to this in our chatroom.

785
00:55:51,154 --> 00:55:55,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, most saves can be copied to jump drives, external hard drives, but some are copy locked.

786
00:55:56,158 --> 00:55:58,220
[SPEAKER_02]: In those occasions, cloud saving comes in handy.

787
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:05,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the only person you can, or the only people you can blame for that would be Sony for being dicks.

788
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:06,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

789
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:09,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe for a PlayStation Plus member, they'll give you the keys to unlock that.

790
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:10,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

791
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:11,289
[SPEAKER_02]: How generous of them.

792
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I can have access to my saves?

793
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:14,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you, great master!

794
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:17,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's like, what the hell?

795
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:20,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, no, you can't have your saved data.

796
00:56:20,434 --> 00:56:24,476
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can pay for the privilege to access that data.

797
00:56:24,556 --> 00:56:25,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week was Nintendo, this week is Sony.

798
00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:27,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you gotta love Loki.

799
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: One week it'll be Apple, then it's Nintendo, now this week it's Sony, Microsoft, you're on notice.

800
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,141
[SPEAKER_09]: But back in the day, wasn't Loki a staunch, uh...

801
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:39,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Angry, angsty man against iOS and iPad and iPhone stuff.

802
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:41,248
[SPEAKER_09]: But he still is in many ways.

803
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:43,170
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I hate Apple.

804
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason he has it, he got it for free through a work pension.

805
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:51,359
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to understand, I hate Apple because their computers are shit.

806
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:52,940
[SPEAKER_14]: They're overpriced shit.

807
00:56:53,741 --> 00:57:15,275
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's all it is who thought it was a fucking genius idea to have a computer with no ports whatsoever other than one USB slot that's awesome that's awesomely stupid I mean but people buy that for like two grand when you can spend two grand on a laptop you get a fucking nice laptop I can get two fucking nice laptops for that same kind of price but people go oh my god new Apple product I gotta go buy it

808
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:18,356
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where I have my problems.

809
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:23,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still giving props for the iPhone because it probably is the best smartphone out there right now.

810
00:57:26,098 --> 00:57:30,079
[SPEAKER_14]: And even the iPod Touch because it's probably the best MP3 player out there.

811
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:31,939
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even really an MP3 player.

812
00:57:31,959 --> 00:57:33,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an iPhone without the phone.

813
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but I'll be damned if I buy a fucking Apple computer.

814
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:41,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that.

815
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:43,242
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, that is a waste.

816
00:57:43,703 --> 00:57:45,343
[SPEAKER_14]: You might as well just set fire to your money.

817
00:57:45,383 --> 00:57:52,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, cause that, you'd be doing yourself a great injustice to buy an Apple computer.

818
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:52,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Loki.

819
00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:55,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in a new segment, Loki's angst.

820
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the show.

821
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've listened to OLR before, but that's not a segment.

822
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:02,031
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the show.

823
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,053
[SPEAKER_14]: And I still don't get the iPad.

824
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:06,236
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I still don't get it.

825
00:58:06,536 --> 00:58:11,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess it's better than having a netbook, maybe, but...

826
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't put it in my pocket.

827
00:58:14,063 --> 00:58:14,983
[SPEAKER_14]: What good is that for me?

828
00:58:35,993 --> 00:58:44,680
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, I just, and of course everybody's now putting out tablet PCs because that worked really well back in the 90s.

829
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody wants to touch something.

830
00:58:46,704 --> 00:58:52,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I remember when tablet PC... Fuck, I remember when my uncle worked for Wattcom and they were making tablet PCs.

831
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's old school shit.

832
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:57,471
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh my god, you have to use a stylus on this.

833
00:58:58,852 --> 00:58:59,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

834
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:02,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to some other stories going on here.

835
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:05,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

836
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:07,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that scandalous game, We Dare?

837
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:08,979
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

838
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Ubisoft just spoke to the Daily Telegraph this week saying, following the public reaction to the 12 plus rating of We Dare, Ubisoft has made the decision not to sell the game in the United Kingdom.

839
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So this means that the game will not be sold anymore in the UK.

840
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:47,399
[SPEAKER_02]: They will have to import it from someplace where this game will be sold.

841
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that's going to end up being.

842
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:53,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like Canada or Australia or what?

843
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:54,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stupid.

844
00:59:54,684 --> 00:59:55,224
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

845
01:00:21,627 --> 01:00:26,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's really all you need is lots of alcohol and slutty chicks.

846
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:29,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they'll go and make out and stuff.

847
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:31,317
[SPEAKER_14]: A Wii game is not going to get them to do that.

848
01:00:31,437 --> 01:00:33,238
[SPEAKER_14]: It will not get you laid.

849
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And I trust you, if you bought this game, you'd be very bored.

850
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:40,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Because who the hell are you going to play this with?

851
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:41,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

852
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,148
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to invite your friends over and play this?

853
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:43,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Play against the computer?

854
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:45,549
[SPEAKER_14]: playing against the computer.

855
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,471
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to fucking... I'm sorry, Dave.

856
01:00:49,651 --> 01:00:51,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot let you spank me.

857
01:00:51,191 --> 01:00:52,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're not selling it in the UK.

858
01:00:52,752 --> 01:00:54,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Were they not selling Twister in the UK?

859
01:00:54,632 --> 01:00:56,293
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not selling bottles in the UK?

860
01:00:56,313 --> 01:00:58,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's all you need, too, for fucking...

861
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it an erotic night with your friends or something like that?

862
01:01:03,337 --> 01:01:05,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I just don't understand.

863
01:01:05,439 --> 01:01:08,461
[SPEAKER_09]: This just proves that the UK is possibly more prudish than the Americans.

864
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:11,204
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're just as prudish because we're not selling it over here either.

865
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, just real quick.

866
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:19,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ubisoft got a stern warning from the Europeans rating board, PEGI.

867
01:01:20,413 --> 01:01:22,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Bundy, but P-E-G-I, PEGI.

868
01:01:23,396 --> 01:01:27,081
[SPEAKER_02]: asking Ubisoft to basically remove the We Dare ads from the internet.

869
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:30,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because once something hits the internet, it can totally be erased, you guys.

870
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:31,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

871
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:31,908
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

872
01:01:32,369 --> 01:01:33,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it can.

873
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:37,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Try to find anything from Bean Bobby Brown on the internet.

874
01:01:37,657 --> 01:01:38,137
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't.

875
01:01:38,978 --> 01:01:39,778
[SPEAKER_14]: It just doesn't exist.

876
01:01:39,879 --> 01:01:43,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an icon of Whitney Houston saying, I know you do.

877
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I have looked.

878
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I have scoured the internet trying to find those episodes for my wife because that would be like... They never released it on DVD?

879
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,784
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she filed lawsuits to block that.

880
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:54,184
[SPEAKER_14]: It never came out on DVD.

881
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:54,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

882
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:55,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, oh man.

883
01:01:56,265 --> 01:01:57,085
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be worth a lot.

884
01:01:57,105 --> 01:01:59,366
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone's got that on VHS... That was an amazing fucking show.

885
01:01:59,726 --> 01:02:06,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to send Sam Flynn to break into the headquarters of Bravo or whatever fucking network or air that show and steal the master tapes because seriously...

886
01:02:06,909 --> 01:02:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

887
01:02:32,994 --> 01:02:37,276
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a ploy to get people to buy that game because they're like, oh, it's so dirty.

888
01:02:38,136 --> 01:02:39,477
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's crap, okay?

889
01:02:39,617 --> 01:02:40,377
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Ubisoft.

890
01:02:40,397 --> 01:02:49,620
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the same company that puts out the Pets games or the Imagine games or all that stuff.

891
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine Sex Party.

892
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,402
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's basically what this is.

893
01:02:53,522 --> 01:02:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, unfortunately, I couldn't find the We Dare gameplay, but I did find a trailer for We Dare Island.

894
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:01,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's cute.

895
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,862
[SPEAKER_09]: She's spinning a tie in slow motion.

896
01:03:09,463 --> 01:03:10,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that a bra?

897
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:11,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell from back here.

898
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:19,028
[SPEAKER_09]: So the ladies are on the couch giggling at the boys and they're one pseudo stripping and they're dancing and they're having a gay old time.

899
01:03:20,703 --> 01:03:24,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Question is though, is it going in reverse?

900
01:03:24,185 --> 01:03:25,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, now the girl's spanking the girl in her lap.

901
01:03:25,745 --> 01:03:27,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is going in reverse.

902
01:03:31,648 --> 01:03:32,588
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love YouTube.

903
01:03:33,308 --> 01:03:34,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to link that in the chat.

904
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like Xtube going on right there.

905
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so MrBlackWolf has given me the appropriate link that we should be looking at here.

906
01:03:42,392 --> 01:03:45,176
[SPEAKER_14]: If the game doesn't have full frontal, it's not We Dare.

907
01:03:45,276 --> 01:03:46,197
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously.

908
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:50,043
[SPEAKER_15]: We can check it out.

909
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:52,586
[SPEAKER_15]: There's us being all adventurous.

910
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:54,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I want that dress.

911
01:03:55,489 --> 01:03:55,969
[SPEAKER_15]: You do, huh?

912
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:56,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

913
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:57,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

914
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, these guys are sassy.

915
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:01,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

916
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:03,152
[SPEAKER_15]: You really like this song?

917
01:04:03,613 --> 01:04:04,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

918
01:04:04,913 --> 01:04:06,614
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you not like this song?

919
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:09,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it's okay, but I'm just sick of hearing it.

920
01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:11,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sick of hearing you.

921
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:13,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to mention it's a cover.

922
01:04:13,637 --> 01:04:14,938
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of like Just Dance.

923
01:04:15,178 --> 01:04:15,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

924
01:04:16,298 --> 01:04:18,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm bored of that video already.

925
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:21,581
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that on Farmhouse Media 3000?

926
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:23,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It has that little YouTube clip we were just playing.

927
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on.

928
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:32,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt2, what do you have for us?

929
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:33,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more news.

930
01:04:33,104 --> 01:04:44,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So it looks like that if you play Dragon Age 2 and you have some angst and you want to get unleashed in the forums, watch what you say because if you call EA the devil, you might actually get shut off.

931
01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:52,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So a player actually posted online on their forums and for whatever reason referenced EA and called them the devil.

932
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You can have your opinion about that.

933
01:04:54,089 --> 01:05:04,795
[SPEAKER_09]: and EA, not liking this bad PR, decided to temporarily suspend the player's account on the forums because that's not unusual whether you play WoW or other onlines.

934
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:07,476
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go off and say some naughty things, they'll do that.

935
01:05:07,856 --> 01:05:13,039
[SPEAKER_09]: But someone flipped the other master switch and temporarily suspended this guy's account for three days.

936
01:05:13,579 --> 01:05:26,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So when he loaded the game and played the game, could not actually play it, all because he called the exact quote from the forums was, quote, have you sold your souls to the EA devil?

937
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:27,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

938
01:05:27,935 --> 01:05:28,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

939
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:28,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

940
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:29,697
[SPEAKER_09]: A ban for...

941
01:05:30,057 --> 01:05:31,638
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the Activision devil, by the way.

942
01:05:31,658 --> 01:05:33,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

943
01:05:34,379 --> 01:05:37,460
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other part of it, too, so that's not so bad.

944
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if you've seen and read other forums, then you've probably seen some pretty dirty stuff.

945
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:42,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, don't come into my house and then call me the devil.

946
01:05:43,102 --> 01:05:43,302
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

947
01:05:43,642 --> 01:05:44,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing.

948
01:05:44,763 --> 01:05:48,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So EA's like, we strictly enforce the community against profanity.

949
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,540
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no profane, well, you know, El Diablo here.

950
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's a bad term.

951
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,802
[SPEAKER_09]: But there really isn't anything profane about it.

952
01:05:55,822 --> 01:05:58,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just really kind of a nasty spun comment.

953
01:05:58,483 --> 01:06:02,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, EA was like, oh, our bad.

954
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:02,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

955
01:06:02,785 --> 01:06:03,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And they apologized.

956
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:04,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a glitch between...

957
01:06:05,226 --> 01:06:05,546
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

958
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob and I have posted and read some of the WoW forms and things like that.

959
01:06:25,143 --> 01:06:29,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some pretty angsty 12-year-olds on there, but this is pretty bad.

960
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I kind of wish Blizzard did this.

961
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:31,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, huh?

962
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Like read the forum post and then was like, oops, sorry, we banned you.

963
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:34,954
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

964
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:39,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful what you say on the... We need to take that Ragnarok online approach.

965
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:41,381
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk bad about our game?

966
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:42,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We ban you.

967
01:06:42,362 --> 01:06:43,563
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't play the game anymore.

968
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:44,484
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you like that?

969
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:48,585
[SPEAKER_09]: It just proves that you better watch what you see on the internet because people are watching.

970
01:06:48,886 --> 01:06:50,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is obviously a mistake.

971
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:55,448
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not what happens if you were to call EA the devil or go off with profane language on their website.

972
01:06:55,468 --> 01:06:57,789
[SPEAKER_09]: So just something kind of funny.

973
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:02,151
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just shows how much control video game distributors do have.

974
01:07:02,191 --> 01:07:05,833
[SPEAKER_09]: They can flip a switch and you're gone or you're banned or you're suspended.

975
01:07:06,152 --> 01:07:06,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

976
01:07:06,532 --> 01:07:09,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys think twice next time about calling EA the devil.

977
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:11,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Call them dirty cum guzzlers instead.

978
01:07:11,596 --> 01:07:11,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

979
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:13,498
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving on.

980
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:16,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's travel the world and look at some release dates.

981
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:18,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the U.S., Loki.

982
01:07:19,245 --> 01:07:21,026
[SPEAKER_14]: This week's not a lot of stuff coming out.

983
01:07:21,506 --> 01:07:23,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a few budget games and then some decent stuff.

984
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:29,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So starting off with the budget games, Maximum Racing, Dragon Stock, and Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing.

985
01:07:29,908 --> 01:07:32,889
[SPEAKER_14]: These are very budget games coming out for the Wii.

986
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

987
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:40,392
[SPEAKER_14]: God's Eater Burst coming out on PSP this week from D3.

988
01:07:40,692 --> 01:07:41,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks pretty awesome.

989
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Jakondia and the Timeless Land.

990
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:49,279
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the game that's very similar to, um, uh, 32nd Hero.

991
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:55,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe this is the one that actually lets you, uh, pick how much time you have and then you can play the game for that long.

992
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and then of course, uh, on the Wii, Trackmania Build to Race.

993
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, awesome, awesome game on the PC.

994
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:04,993
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm sure it'd be pretty good on the Wii.

995
01:08:05,814 --> 01:08:10,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Homefront, the big game for this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

996
01:08:12,295 --> 01:08:17,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of the first that we'll see of the Just Dance series, but a little bit of a spin-off of it.

997
01:08:17,236 --> 01:08:20,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance on Broadway coming to the PlayStation 3 for the move.

998
01:08:21,757 --> 01:08:27,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on PlayStation 3, Yakuza 4, with less stuff changed this time from the Japanese version.

999
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:32,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just me, or was that kind of a fast turnaround this time?

1000
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:33,920
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a pretty fast turnaround.

1001
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job.

1002
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:40,764
[SPEAKER_14]: R. Tonalico, Koga, Nell of Arceal on PlayStation 3 this week as well.

1003
01:08:43,505 --> 01:08:44,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1004
01:08:44,646 --> 01:08:49,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and I believe the Wii.

1005
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:53,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Top Spin 4 coming out this week as well.

1006
01:08:54,691 --> 01:09:00,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, surprisingly enough, the Xbox 360 version of this got canceled, but Warriors Legend of Troy.

1007
01:09:00,815 --> 01:09:01,315
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a...

1008
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:05,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Trojan version of Dynasty Warriors.

1009
01:09:05,846 --> 01:09:06,866
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, check that out.

1010
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:14,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, yet another Ubisoft fitness game, Fit'n 6 on the Wii and PlayStation 3.

1011
01:09:14,829 --> 01:09:17,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, PlayStation 3 with move support there.

1012
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:23,271
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like their answer to the Yourself Fitness since that never came out on other systems other than 360.

1013
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:28,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for this week.

1014
01:09:28,993 --> 01:09:29,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's it.

1015
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:31,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I'm going to move on to Japanese release dates.

1016
01:09:32,655 --> 01:09:35,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I do realize things going on could have an effect on this.

1017
01:09:36,157 --> 01:09:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to read them as I see them.

1018
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:44,142
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox 360, Dragon Age Origins Awakening, that would be the expansion to the original Dragon Age, is going to be out on March 17th.

1019
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:49,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Going on to the PlayStation 3 and checking out some of the releases there.

1020
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yakuza, I'm sorry, that's a US release.

1021
01:09:53,429 --> 01:09:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Motostorm 3 Apocalypse comes out in Japan, as well as the Dragon Age Origins expansion.

1022
01:09:59,093 --> 01:10:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryu Ga Gotoku of the End comes out in Japan as well.

1023
01:10:03,937 --> 01:10:05,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what that game is.

1024
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:11,823
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Sega, and it's related to the Yakuza universe, but I think it's a bit more of the action-adventure type of game.

1025
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,023
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1026
01:10:14,124 --> 01:10:14,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1027
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:16,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on some other systems.

1028
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the Wii real quick if there's anything coming out there.

1029
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe so.

1030
01:10:22,367 --> 01:10:27,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nothing this week because, of course, Nintendo's focused on the 3DS and the recent launch that happened there.

1031
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:34,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check out Steel Diver this week in Japan and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D, both of those getting released on the 3DS this week in Japan.

1032
01:10:35,893 --> 01:10:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly on the PSP...

1033
01:10:40,713 --> 01:10:42,755
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, oh, where'd it go?

1034
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:49,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I guess, is there anything on the PSP this week?

1035
01:10:52,303 --> 01:10:53,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't look like it.

1036
01:10:54,965 --> 01:10:57,427
[SPEAKER_02]: For some reason, I'm not able to find the dates on my list.

1037
01:10:57,447 --> 01:10:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1038
01:10:58,328 --> 01:10:58,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind, there it is.

1039
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:02,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The Little Battlers is the big release on the PSP this week.

1040
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:22,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Little Battlers is a game from level 5 it's a RPG coming out over there looks like you battle these little kind of polygonal types of things it looks a little bit Valkyria profile to me kind of mixed with traditional RPG mechanics so that could be kind of neat so there you go that's it for Japanese releases what about the UK?

1041
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:31,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so from our friends across the pond, coming out on Ides of March, that's March 15th for those who are not Shakespearean buffs, is Total War Shotgun 2, coming out on PC.

1042
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And then for releases on the 18th, Friday, we have Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on PC.

1043
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:40,239
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have coming up God's Eater Burst on the PSP.

1044
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I am just intrigued by the title.

1045
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Homefront is coming out on the 360, PS3, and PC, also again on Friday the 18th.

1046
01:11:49,365 --> 01:11:53,908
[SPEAKER_09]: MotoGP coming out also on Friday, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.

1047
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:57,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Motorstorm Apocalypse coming out on the PS3.

1048
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Okimaden Chisaki Taiyo.

1049
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,394
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I can do Japanese pretty well, huh?

1050
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:03,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh, Rob?

1051
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:05,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I was worried about any type of Japanese releases I might read tonight.

1052
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:37,774
[SPEAKER_09]: coming out on DS also Topspin 4 for 360 PS3 and Wii coming out and finally Yakuza 4 as mentioned before coming out on the 18th for PS3 I remember buying Topspin original for 360 and was not a fan it made me frustrated yeah I did not like the original Topspin game that was on 360 either that's it this week for the UK alright just a few more news stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week but first something from Loki

1053
01:12:39,533 --> 01:12:41,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I'm very distracted right now.

1054
01:12:42,016 --> 01:12:42,497
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that?

1055
01:12:42,998 --> 01:12:46,903
[SPEAKER_14]: They finally released the Grand Theft Auto 4 texture editor.

1056
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:48,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember the one they got ripped off for trying to buy?

1057
01:12:48,945 --> 01:12:51,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, someone finally released it.

1058
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:54,653
[SPEAKER_14]: All the things I can do, it's just so mind-boggling.

1059
01:12:54,873 --> 01:12:56,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, let's talk about Pokemon.

1060
01:12:58,116 --> 01:13:03,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, there was a rumor, and of course, you know there's always rumors when the stuff's coming from Twitter.

1061
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:10,948
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a rumor back when this whole disaster went down in Japan that the Pokemon creator died.

1062
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:12,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1063
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,791
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been tragic, except it's not true.

1064
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:20,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, the company tweeted back and said, False.

1065
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:23,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone at Pokemon Company and Game Freak is fine.

1066
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,815
[SPEAKER_14]: So, no one's dead.

1067
01:13:26,716 --> 01:13:28,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people are sick.

1068
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:29,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1069
01:13:30,277 --> 01:13:30,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1070
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:31,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.

1071
01:13:34,259 --> 01:13:42,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was a very unfortunate case, a mistaken identity or mistranslation, but unfortunately that probably was not the case.

1072
01:13:43,946 --> 01:13:45,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick people.

1073
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, one other news story for you guys.

1074
01:13:47,809 --> 01:13:50,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with the MMO Free Realms.

1075
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've ever checked this game out.

1076
01:13:52,032 --> 01:13:53,974
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a casual MMO.

1077
01:13:54,354 --> 01:13:55,975
[SPEAKER_02]: The weird thing is it's free to play.

1078
01:13:56,776 --> 01:13:58,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

1079
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:01,798
[SPEAKER_02]: The funny thing is, it's coming out very soon.

1080
01:14:02,659 --> 01:14:03,619
[SPEAKER_02]: March 29th.

1081
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:10,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally on the PC, and now it's going to be a free-to-play casual MMO on the PlayStation Network.

1082
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like DC Universe Online, which is kind of the other big MMO on PlayStation 3 right now.

1083
01:14:16,502 --> 01:14:18,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Free Realms is going to be different.

1084
01:14:19,102 --> 01:14:23,423
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that they did take some things from DC Universe Online, Sony Online Entertainment of course,

1085
01:14:23,923 --> 01:14:25,344
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1086
01:14:52,465 --> 01:14:54,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's one of those things that's only open to PlayStation Plus though.

1087
01:14:56,008 --> 01:14:56,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1088
01:14:56,508 --> 01:14:57,348
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on that yet.

1089
01:14:57,408 --> 01:15:00,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see when the game comes out in just a couple weeks.

1090
01:15:01,171 --> 01:15:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, for now, it's that time of the show where we like to take a trip down memory lane and look at the classic game of the week.

1091
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:10,384
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1092
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:34,696
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1093
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:40,238
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided since Matt 2 was good enough to step in and fill in for Jamie tonight, why doesn't he get to pick the Classic Game of the Week?

1094
01:15:40,258 --> 01:15:42,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Matt 2, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week?

1095
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well I'll never presume to take over for Jamie, but I'm honored to do this segment here.

1096
01:15:47,062 --> 01:15:55,346
[SPEAKER_09]: So, after being locked in the vault for 24 hours and a dog pile ensued, I sifted through it and found this little gem on Super Nintendo.

1097
01:15:56,046 --> 01:15:57,987
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my favorites, Actraiser.

1098
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: and Actraiser was produced and distributed back in 1990, so 20 years ago.

1099
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:04,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine that.

1100
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:06,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I'm so old.

1101
01:16:06,211 --> 01:16:06,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we are old.

1102
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:09,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusive for Super Nintendo at the time.

1103
01:16:09,413 --> 01:16:12,235
[SPEAKER_09]: It was put out by Enix then, now Squeenix as we know it.

1104
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:15,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And the whole idea of this game was it was two-fold.

1105
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:22,680
[SPEAKER_09]: You were a platform side-scrolling action as well as city-building, almost like RTS.

1106
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:23,561
[SPEAKER_09]: And

1107
01:16:24,181 --> 01:16:31,547
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole premise was that you were God, or a God, I should say, and you would have to run around and kill stuff and defend the land.

1108
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:42,397
[SPEAKER_09]: You then also, once you completed the level, which was, again, very basic side-scrolling levels here, you would then turn into an angel and fly around and protect the city from other monsters.

1109
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:43,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could see his butt.

1110
01:16:43,658 --> 01:16:44,519
[SPEAKER_09]: You can definitely see his ass.

1111
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:48,543
[SPEAKER_09]: You fly around in an angel form and help defend the city.

1112
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:52,067
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd also have to do things like help crops grow by being God.

1113
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:57,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have to make it rain on the crops and lightning to burn bushes so your city could grow and things like that.

1114
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:01,898
[SPEAKER_09]: At the time, when I was playing it, I really enjoyed the music from the game.

1115
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:04,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was pretty top-notch, honestly, for the time.

1116
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:12,386
[SPEAKER_09]: The gameplay is pretty straightforward on the platform side and the RTS side.

1117
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:14,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So anywho, a little bit more background about the game.

1118
01:17:14,928 --> 01:17:20,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, the idea that you are a god or a master and you take the form of the overseer in a cloud.

1119
01:17:20,471 --> 01:17:21,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Not cloud saves, but just cloud.

1120
01:17:22,132 --> 01:17:29,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when your citizens call upon you to help defend the land, you would beam on down to the world and take over in a humanoid form.

1121
01:17:31,299 --> 01:17:40,590
[SPEAKER_09]: The funny part is, there was an Actraiser 2 prequel to the game, but a lot of religious subtext was discovered about it.

1122
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:48,700
[SPEAKER_09]: People were concerned about the game because in the Japanese text for this prequel, they actually call the main character God and the villain of the game Satan.

1123
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:51,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we got to talk about the devil again tonight, Rob.

1124
01:17:52,223 --> 01:17:57,686
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was a very engaging game because, again, it had two parts to it.

1125
01:17:57,726 --> 01:18:00,008
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to, again, defend the city and build your cities.

1126
01:18:00,688 --> 01:18:04,751
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you didn't do these certain tasks, your citizens would die and you would lose the game.

1127
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:06,912
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my favorites.

1128
01:18:07,112 --> 01:18:12,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It later came out for Virtual Console and also released on mobile phone devices.

1129
01:18:12,756 --> 01:18:14,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is out there to play.

1130
01:18:15,777 --> 01:18:16,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know.

1131
01:18:17,018 --> 01:18:19,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I just really enjoyed the music from this game at the time.

1132
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:24,883
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Classic Video Game of the Week is ActRaiser on Super Nintendo and Virtual Console and mobile phones.

1133
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,764
[SPEAKER_02]: An excellent fucking choice.

1134
01:18:26,825 --> 01:18:32,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember when Matt2 told me what game he wanted to do for the Classic Game of the Week, I was like, no, Jamie had to have picked that at some point.

1135
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:33,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked about it.

1136
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:34,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check the wiki.

1137
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:35,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie picked that, right?

1138
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:38,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hadn't been picked yet.

1139
01:18:38,454 --> 01:18:45,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I checked the wiki just to be certain, and then I sent her a message and said, hey, these are the three games I would like to review.

1140
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,581
[SPEAKER_09]: and these are on the wiki but I want to run past you.

1141
01:18:48,601 --> 01:18:51,881
[SPEAKER_09]: She goes, oh, I totally had Actraiser on my list to do so yeah, go ahead and take that.

1142
01:18:52,921 --> 01:19:00,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I also gave two other suggestions to Rob and I told him one of them and I think he was impressed on how far back my video gaming experience went.

1143
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:01,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you remember the game I told you?

1144
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:02,604
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1145
01:19:03,084 --> 01:19:04,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But Congo Bongo?

1146
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right, that's right.

1147
01:19:05,344 --> 01:19:12,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally remember that game from the Atari 5200 but anywho, so Actraiser is definitely a great game.

1148
01:19:12,446 --> 01:19:12,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.

1149
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:16,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so let's not take attention away from ActRaiser because this game is amazing.

1150
01:19:16,412 --> 01:19:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely in my top ten video games ever.

1151
01:19:18,897 --> 01:19:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

1152
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:20,640
[SPEAKER_02]: The sequel doesn't hold a candle to it.

1153
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,343
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and it actually bankrupted the series, I think.

1154
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:23,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

1155
01:19:23,952 --> 01:19:25,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Enix made great games.

1156
01:19:25,653 --> 01:19:28,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Enix made so many good freaking games on the Super Nintendo.

1157
01:19:28,856 --> 01:19:31,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even talking about Dragon Quest, Dragon Warrior, that series.

1158
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.

1159
01:19:36,982 --> 01:19:39,944
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in Soul Blazer, I think was one of the other games.

1160
01:19:41,185 --> 01:19:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole series was awesome.

1161
01:19:42,306 --> 01:19:46,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they were the ones that did Busta Move slash Busta Groove, depending on what country you were in.

1162
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:47,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all Enix.

1163
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that's disappeared since the Square merger, which is unfortunate.

1164
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:51,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is sad.

1165
01:19:52,233 --> 01:20:03,615
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the high-tech graphic things about this game was whenever you had to warp down to the world to defend it, the screen would spin around, and it was just high-tech, and it made you feel like you were falling into the earth.

1166
01:20:03,655 --> 01:20:13,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So as your citizens gain power-ups and learn smarter, they can learn how to build better buildings and better crops and things like that.

1167
01:20:13,797 --> 01:20:19,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely had a SimCities and a platform feel to it, so definitely check it out.

1168
01:20:20,256 --> 01:20:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, your classic of the week for the Super Nintendo from Enix, ActRaiser.

1169
01:20:24,461 --> 01:20:28,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And for heaven's sake, at least just listen to the soundtrack, because it's one of the greatest soundtracks ever.

1170
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:34,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's Yoko Kanno who did the soundtrack to that, who's just... No, no, what am I saying?

1171
01:20:34,832 --> 01:20:35,313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

1172
01:20:36,454 --> 01:20:38,456
[SPEAKER_02]: She sang a song for Evangelion or something.

1173
01:20:38,736 --> 01:20:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuzo Koshiro did the music to that, and he did a DDR song back in the day.

1174
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:50,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he's the same guy that does Wine Game, Midnight Maximum Tune, Streets of Rage, lots of great stuff.

1175
01:20:50,768 --> 01:20:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So, very cool.

1176
01:20:52,509 --> 01:21:00,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but fear not, there's plenty more of OLR to come when we get back, including the mailbag, your tweets!

1177
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So get those in, please, your Twitters.

1178
01:21:02,378 --> 01:21:05,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR to get in your tweets, and of course, more news.

1179
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:12,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about those Dance Hero rumors, some games being cancelled at Sony, and what's going to happen to NBA Jam.

1180
01:21:12,847 --> 01:21:16,631
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out after this, a quick break, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1181
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:25,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1182
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live tonight with the 405th episode of our show on this March 13th of 2011.

1183
01:21:31,913 --> 01:21:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live at All Games Radio, as we are every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

1184
01:21:38,535 --> 01:21:43,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's been a crazy week, and if you are just joining us, I did make a plea in Part A, and I'll say it again.

1185
01:21:43,777 --> 01:21:44,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please...

1186
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:53,585
[SPEAKER_02]: For those folks in Japan that have had to go through such a crazy, horrific thing going on right now, please consider donating to the Red Cross.

1187
01:21:54,486 --> 01:21:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to redcross.org.

1188
01:21:56,748 --> 01:21:58,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really encouraging all of our listeners to part with $10.

1189
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:01,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that much.

1190
01:22:01,393 --> 01:22:03,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like less than the cost of one month of an MMO.

1191
01:22:03,895 --> 01:22:05,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

1192
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:09,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go without this week and put the money to where it's really, really needed right now.

1193
01:22:10,502 --> 01:22:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, moving on, we're going to get back into some gaming news and some rapid fire news.

1194
01:22:14,026 --> 01:22:17,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And your Twitter, all the tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

1195
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,392
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll read those on the show here in just a minute.

1196
01:22:19,972 --> 01:22:20,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So get those in.

1197
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your last chance.

1198
01:22:22,195 --> 01:22:23,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I got to do a plug for the spinoff shows.

1199
01:22:24,437 --> 01:22:29,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but she does do a fun little show with Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1200
01:22:29,643 --> 01:22:31,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Comic Insanity.

1201
01:22:31,605 --> 01:22:57,477
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's with no I it's Comic N Sanity and you can find that on Twitter or you can also find it at Infamous.net again just the letter N Infamous.net if you like World of Warcraft check out my spin-off show with Extifer The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth also known as Horde House for short and all of that coming to a new website also this week that I'll be able to give out and I'm very excited so that's all on its way to being done

1202
01:22:58,357 --> 01:23:01,699
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, some rapid fire news, some quick stories for you guys.

1203
01:23:02,059 --> 01:23:02,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with Loki.

1204
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:12,905
[SPEAKER_14]: According to the new issue of the French gaming magazine Joystick, Bethesda's next game in their, well, next announced game is going to be Prey 2.

1205
01:23:13,445 --> 01:23:18,728
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, the sequel to the first person shooter game that came out from 3D Realms and 2K Games.

1206
01:23:18,948 --> 01:23:19,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1207
01:23:19,448 --> 01:23:34,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, 3D Realms is no longer around, and Bethesda was purchased by ZeniMax, which snatched up the company id Software, so it makes perfect sense that they're going to be putting out shooter games.

1208
01:23:35,723 --> 01:23:40,107
[SPEAKER_14]: No word exactly on when that's coming out, but probably something that we'll be hearing more about during E3 this year.

1209
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:44,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of surprised that Prey is getting a sequel because the first one didn't really do too hot.

1210
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:48,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was a good game, especially for dummies.

1211
01:23:48,892 --> 01:23:52,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it was a first-person shooter for dummies because you could never die in Prey.

1212
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:54,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things I really liked about it because I suck at first-person shooters.

1213
01:23:55,516 --> 01:23:58,618
[SPEAKER_02]: The story was pretty good, too, even though it, like, totally cut off abruptly.

1214
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:01,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you're playing the game and then just it's over.

1215
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:02,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

1216
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's set up for a sequel.

1217
01:24:03,681 --> 01:24:04,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Like The Sopranos.

1218
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:06,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of like that, but not really.

1219
01:24:07,423 --> 01:24:07,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the journey.

1220
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:11,302
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of neat.

1221
01:24:11,322 --> 01:24:15,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little Easter egg, I guess, for the Google Chrome browser.

1222
01:24:15,903 --> 01:24:21,945
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're using it, there's actually a piece of JavaScript you can paste into the Chrome's address.

1223
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:29,748
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you do that, it activates a hack which reloads a page and basically allows you to roll around a ball.

1224
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:32,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Katamari Ball, to be exact.

1225
01:24:33,089 --> 01:24:37,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And pick up all the words and images on the screen like you would at Katamari.

1226
01:24:37,752 --> 01:24:38,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1227
01:24:38,692 --> 01:24:43,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can find this piece of code at kathack.com.

1228
01:24:43,535 --> 01:24:46,057
[SPEAKER_14]: That's K-A-T-H-A-C-K-D-O-T-C-O-M.

1229
01:24:46,877 --> 01:24:48,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can check it out.

1230
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:49,679
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a neat one.

1231
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:50,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it play the music too?

1232
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it does.

1233
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:54,781
[SPEAKER_14]: But thanks to the...

1234
01:24:55,942 --> 01:25:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Advent of the MP3, you could provide your own soundtrack for your webpage rolling up adventures.

1235
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not the same.

1236
01:25:05,663 --> 01:25:05,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1237
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:14,753
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, there's a company out of San Francisco that wants to make your life the RPG.

1238
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:17,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So basically it's life the RPG.

1239
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:18,895
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's you!

1240
01:25:19,736 --> 01:25:20,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's you.

1241
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:23,397
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming from a company called Green Goose.

1242
01:25:24,378 --> 01:25:28,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And basically what it is, it's this package that you get.

1243
01:25:28,179 --> 01:25:32,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It's packaged with a water bottle, toothbrush, and vitamin container.

1244
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:36,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And it says the Green Goose logs how many times a week...

1245
01:25:36,443 --> 01:25:37,423
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1246
01:25:54,751 --> 01:26:07,436
[SPEAKER_14]: The points that the player earns will not really do anything, but it's meant to encourage a healthy lifestyle, I guess, and clean teeth.

1247
01:26:09,897 --> 01:26:10,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Okie dokie.

1248
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:12,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1249
01:26:12,738 --> 01:26:14,399
[SPEAKER_14]: It's neat.

1250
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,921
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something I could see them selling at a dentist office or something like that.

1251
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:28,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember all those like toothbrushing games and stuff that you could play on like the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 that were supposed to like, you know, teach the good habits and all that.

1252
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:33,024
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be kind of funny like a life of the game or something like that.

1253
01:26:33,704 --> 01:26:44,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they kind of have that like in the 3DS where you earn points for walking or shaking the 3DS, you know, and you award the same points for walking or throttling something.

1254
01:26:45,839 --> 01:26:46,119
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1255
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:53,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on here to some other news about The Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time 3D.

1256
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,623
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some new things that are supposed to be in there.

1257
01:26:56,663 --> 01:27:01,164
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a direct port of the 64 version.

1258
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:03,305
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3DS version is supposed to have some other stuff.

1259
01:27:03,725 --> 01:27:09,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in an interview that happened with Miyamoto talking about the 3DS version of Ocarina of Time.

1260
01:27:09,807 --> 01:27:10,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1261
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1262
01:27:38,361 --> 01:27:41,984
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, quick follow-up from Essex in our chatroom on the Katamari Damacy add-in.

1263
01:27:42,265 --> 01:27:44,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It does play the music, just so you know.

1264
01:27:44,206 --> 01:27:44,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1265
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1266
01:27:44,867 --> 01:27:45,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's good to know.

1267
01:27:46,008 --> 01:27:46,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming from our chat.

1268
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Some rumors about Grand Theft Auto V is the codename Rush.

1269
01:27:52,381 --> 01:27:53,802
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be what's going on.

1270
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's some casting details that were done on a Google search.

1271
01:27:57,943 --> 01:28:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there's this project called Rush and it has to do with Grand Theft Auto V. Rush is tied to Take-Two Interactive.

1272
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:06,326
[SPEAKER_02]: They own Rockstar Games.

1273
01:28:06,986 --> 01:28:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently it's a video game set in the Los Angeles area.

1274
01:28:10,007 --> 01:28:11,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they've gone from New York to L.A.,

1275
01:28:12,608 --> 01:28:15,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows, but that is apparently some of the rumors about the game.

1276
01:28:15,509 --> 01:28:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the casting that is in the game, there's a 38-year-old FBI agent in grape shape, a 25-year-old young Mexican-American FBI agent, a 23-year-old moron, white trash hillbilly named Clyde, and so on and so on.

1277
01:28:29,752 --> 01:28:31,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of parts that they're casting for.

1278
01:28:31,832 --> 01:28:39,674
[SPEAKER_14]: That's either going to be a Grand Theft Auto game, which I can only hope, or it's going to be a sequel to Midnight Club LA.

1279
01:28:41,054 --> 01:28:47,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, Valve is going to be bridging Portal and Portal 2 with some type of surprise.

1280
01:28:48,418 --> 01:28:52,560
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't exactly know what that is, but that was from coming out of PAX East.

1281
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that will tie the story of the interim time between Portal and Portal 2.

1282
01:28:58,623 --> 01:28:59,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a comic book?

1283
01:28:59,583 --> 01:29:00,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that an arcade game?

1284
01:29:00,804 --> 01:29:02,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that YouTube?

1285
01:29:03,265 --> 01:29:03,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1286
01:29:04,286 --> 01:29:09,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently something will be coming to tie the two worlds together in the future.

1287
01:29:09,789 --> 01:29:10,269
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1288
01:29:11,029 --> 01:29:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt 2 Alright, so there is some DLC content coming out for Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock You can pick them up as the Modern Rock Mega Pack In your respective WePoints or Microsoft Live download content These are some of my favorite bands here So I'm excited about this I wish I had Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band 2 Just a smathering of what's on that pack You've got Sorrow by Bad Religion She's a Genius by Jet Psycho by Puddle of Mud

1289
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:41,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Saliva's song Always, and Headstrong by Trapped.

1290
01:29:42,236 --> 01:29:44,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just half of what's in that pack.

1291
01:29:45,037 --> 01:29:49,078
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all those angsty boy frat bands that you like, huh?

1292
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:50,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is good music, Rob.

1293
01:29:50,899 --> 01:29:51,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1294
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:53,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like men with vaginas when I hear it.

1295
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that's how I feel.

1296
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of our listeners are like, you're an asshole, Rob.

1297
01:29:58,422 --> 01:29:59,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You like Lady Gaga.

1298
01:30:00,703 --> 01:30:02,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard she did a great song, a copy of Madonna's song?

1299
01:30:04,345 --> 01:30:05,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Weren't you in the middle of some news?

1300
01:30:06,219 --> 01:30:07,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes sir, let me continue.

1301
01:30:07,721 --> 01:30:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, those are for respective points on Microsoft or Wii.

1302
01:30:11,446 --> 01:30:12,988
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out if you're into rock music.

1303
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Other stories that are coming up?

1304
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:19,146
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX Live Arcade

1305
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:46,537
[SPEAKER_09]: and when it came down to it, it was just abruptly cancelled due to some various... It's a weird reason to cancel a game.

1306
01:30:46,617 --> 01:30:47,598
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very weird reason.

1307
01:30:47,618 --> 01:30:52,581
[SPEAKER_02]: There must have been like a dirty word in mistranslation or something.

1308
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:53,161
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1309
01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:56,063
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of debate whether it was a bug or a text issue.

1310
01:30:56,103 --> 01:31:07,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's kind of pointing each other's fingers but basically it was quoted saying we're not privy to the decision making process providing the game but it was due to bugs in the translation because the game has never been translated to Japanese.

1311
01:31:09,611 --> 01:31:18,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Since there was no existing Japanese version of the game, the complexity of a new translation combined with the randomly generated naming scheme for Torchlight made it beyond the scope of the project.

1312
01:31:31,554 --> 01:31:32,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand.

1313
01:31:32,454 --> 01:31:33,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Google Translate won't work for this game.

1314
01:31:34,575 --> 01:31:38,616
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and, you know, Robbie made a point that the text on the screen was awfully small.

1315
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:39,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe he couldn't read it.

1316
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:44,697
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe the Japanese ideography of the characters didn't look right.

1317
01:31:44,737 --> 01:31:45,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, who knows?

1318
01:31:45,558 --> 01:31:50,839
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe look for that in the future if they figure out how to translate it, or maybe that's just a wah-wah-wah.

1319
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:57,541
[SPEAKER_09]: So unfortunately no Torchlight for the Xbox Live for the Japanese version.

1320
01:31:58,181 --> 01:32:04,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really don't want to have to share this news because the first iteration of this was just so horrible.

1321
01:32:05,223 --> 01:32:09,024
[SPEAKER_09]: There's work that a new Doom movie is coming out.

1322
01:32:10,086 --> 01:32:24,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we all remember in 2005, The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, did a, me being sarcastic here, wonderful version of Doom, in an attempt to do a movie on the first person shooter that got us in the early 90s.

1323
01:32:25,021 --> 01:32:30,087
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a reboot in the works that's going to completely ignore Dwayne Johnson's first version, thank God.

1324
01:32:31,447 --> 01:32:39,691
[SPEAKER_09]: and of course like everything else in this freaking time and day it'll be in 3D oh of course will we have scenes with the gun in 3D?

1325
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:59,220
[SPEAKER_09]: probably or acid splatterings or bullets coming at you it wasn't in 3D but the perspective you were running around for parts of the scene with the gun swinging back and forth like you were in the video game I would be okay with this if they just struck Doom and made it Duke Nukem 3D sorry I'm just looking real quick I'm trying to bring back some memories here

1326
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, please don't.

1327
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:05,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw this on USA Network or TNT or something like that.

1328
01:33:05,104 --> 01:33:09,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, then they cut out all the violence.

1329
01:33:09,848 --> 01:33:11,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they did, and the swearing, and it was still horrible.

1330
01:33:11,989 --> 01:33:14,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Swearing and violence would have made it better.

1331
01:33:29,262 --> 01:33:31,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was just bad people.

1332
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Doom is waiting.

1333
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:34,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no release date.

1334
01:33:34,168 --> 01:33:34,769
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no nothing.

1335
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:38,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just in the preliminary works and it's just a new project in the early stages.

1336
01:33:38,794 --> 01:33:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, another Hollywood reboot.

1337
01:33:40,095 --> 01:33:40,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Just what we needed.

1338
01:33:40,911 --> 01:34:07,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 3D, can't forget it's in 3D Oh my gosh We've run out of ideas completely Exactly, so Time to remake crap Look for that, hopefully, in the near future Oh yeah, can't wait There will be no hopefully looking forward to Much anticipation Alright, I promised someone we'd do a quick phone call here at this point in the show So we're going to make a phone call real quick And try to get this all taken care of I hope it's going through, I'm kind of relying on Skype tonight

1339
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:10,161
[SPEAKER_02]: and sometimes it can be a little... There we go.

1340
01:34:10,301 --> 01:34:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: One ringy dingy.

1341
01:34:12,722 --> 01:34:13,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Two ringy dingys.

1342
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:18,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully there's an answer.

1343
01:34:18,523 --> 01:34:19,443
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be quite embarrassing.

1344
01:34:19,483 --> 01:34:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1345
01:34:20,303 --> 01:34:20,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

1346
01:34:20,983 --> 01:34:22,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this DarkSakura?

1347
01:34:23,564 --> 01:34:24,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, this is.

1348
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,404
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

1349
01:34:25,424 --> 01:34:26,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you make it to Disneyland in one piece?

1350
01:34:28,105 --> 01:34:29,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're not at Disneyland yet.

1351
01:34:29,245 --> 01:34:32,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going tomorrow, but we made it to the hotel room.

1352
01:34:33,646 --> 01:34:35,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in that area, right?

1353
01:34:35,226 --> 01:34:35,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1354
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:38,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I can look out of the window and see the parking structure.

1355
01:34:38,915 --> 01:34:39,496
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1356
01:34:39,736 --> 01:34:45,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, aren't you down there because you get to hang out with the official OLR lesbians this week, or at least one of them?

1357
01:34:46,363 --> 01:34:47,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, both of them on Tuesday.

1358
01:34:47,704 --> 01:34:49,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to Goofy's Kitchen together.

1359
01:34:49,425 --> 01:34:50,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played a little solitaire.

1360
01:34:50,725 --> 01:34:51,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly I was vlogging.

1361
01:34:51,486 --> 01:34:51,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh...

1362
01:35:15,313 --> 01:35:21,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Just singing along with some classic rock that happened to come on on a CD that I made so I knew it was on there.

1363
01:35:23,478 --> 01:35:27,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And played some Marvel vs. Capcom 3 during the week.

1364
01:35:31,102 --> 01:35:34,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to the new characters to be paid to unlock?

1365
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're getting to McGrath.

1366
01:35:37,759 --> 01:35:38,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Jill's not worth it.

1367
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:39,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Jill's not worth it.

1368
01:35:41,341 --> 01:35:44,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gotta say, Matt2's doing a pretty good job filling in tonight.

1369
01:35:44,982 --> 01:35:46,943
[SPEAKER_02]: His classic game of the week was very well received.

1370
01:35:47,624 --> 01:35:49,785
[SPEAKER_02]: But he totally set the vault on fire.

1371
01:35:50,405 --> 01:35:54,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to apologize for that in advance, that everything is on fire.

1372
01:35:56,008 --> 01:35:58,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You realize Dan's going to castrate you before he kills you, right?

1373
01:36:00,510 --> 01:36:01,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan scares Matt2.

1374
01:36:04,494 --> 01:36:09,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I did admit, yeah, the vault wasn't on fire.

1375
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:13,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a small ember burning, and you overreacted.

1376
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:17,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, they had a dry cam fire extinguisher under the sink, and I put it out.

1377
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: He was putting his cigarette out in there, and I'm kidding.

1378
01:36:19,462 --> 01:36:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally kidding.

1379
01:36:20,622 --> 01:36:21,563
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even gone in there.

1380
01:36:21,783 --> 01:36:22,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1381
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:23,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

1382
01:36:24,344 --> 01:36:26,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt 2 brought me beer tonight, and not you.

1383
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:27,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

1384
01:36:29,156 --> 01:36:29,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1385
01:36:29,937 --> 01:36:31,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't true, OLL Fashion List.

1386
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:35,681
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the hosts was slightly intoxicated, so I offered it to Loki.

1387
01:36:35,741 --> 01:36:40,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki looked at me in disbelief and then said, er, and he handed it to Rob.

1388
01:36:41,146 --> 01:36:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're about to get into Twitter topics, but is there anything you wanted to say to the listeners tonight?

1389
01:36:48,492 --> 01:36:49,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the best husband ever.

1390
01:36:50,794 --> 01:36:51,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

1391
01:36:53,226 --> 01:36:53,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I just do.

1392
01:36:54,526 --> 01:36:55,247
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pretty cool.

1393
01:36:55,807 --> 01:36:56,367
[SPEAKER_02]: He's okay.

1394
01:36:56,447 --> 01:36:56,807
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a keeper.

1395
01:36:56,827 --> 01:36:57,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's awesome.

1396
01:36:57,767 --> 01:36:58,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's awesome.

1397
01:37:00,188 --> 01:37:04,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And he likes the pita sandwiches at the place you took me to this week, and that was pretty awesome.

1398
01:37:04,589 --> 01:37:04,849
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1399
01:37:04,869 --> 01:37:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we had for breakfast.

1400
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:06,950
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1401
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:09,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I just kicked Shermie on accident.

1402
01:37:09,751 --> 01:37:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Shermie.

1403
01:37:11,571 --> 01:37:13,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice what I did for you?

1404
01:37:14,531 --> 01:37:18,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I washed her bed so it would not stink for you.

1405
01:37:18,752 --> 01:37:19,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a big cat.

1406
01:37:20,193 --> 01:37:20,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1407
01:37:21,053 --> 01:37:24,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I washed her butt for you.

1408
01:37:24,935 --> 01:37:25,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, that's so kind.

1409
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:26,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So that it would not stink.

1410
01:37:28,116 --> 01:37:31,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Because her butt stinks.

1411
01:37:31,237 --> 01:37:33,257
[SPEAKER_02]: The great lengths you go to for OLR.

1412
01:37:33,718 --> 01:37:39,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we've got to get back into video gaming news, but I wanted you to at least be able to say hello to the listeners.

1413
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything else before I let you go?

1414
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners?

1415
01:37:43,043 --> 01:37:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I care?

1416
01:37:43,664 --> 01:37:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: No, hi.

1417
01:37:44,785 --> 01:37:46,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everybody.

1418
01:37:47,146 --> 01:37:49,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Disneyland and you're not.

1419
01:37:49,228 --> 01:37:50,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys stay safe.

1420
01:37:50,508 --> 01:37:52,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Have tons of fun at the park tomorrow.

1421
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the OLR lesbians we said hi.

1422
01:37:54,391 --> 01:37:56,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And Marissa, too, if you end up seeing her.

1423
01:37:57,353 --> 01:37:58,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Marissa has a disease.

1424
01:37:59,615 --> 01:38:00,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how sad.

1425
01:38:00,595 --> 01:38:04,798
[SPEAKER_04]: She has the in-bed-with-cold-chills-and-running-fever disease.

1426
01:38:05,218 --> 01:38:06,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry to hear it.

1427
01:38:06,199 --> 01:38:09,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone send Marissa happy thoughts because we love Marissa.

1428
01:38:09,861 --> 01:38:10,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

1429
01:38:10,142 --> 01:38:10,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

1430
01:38:11,181 --> 01:38:11,521
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1431
01:38:11,781 --> 01:38:12,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have fun.

1432
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:12,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1433
01:38:12,982 --> 01:38:13,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Until then, we said hey.

1434
01:38:14,942 --> 01:38:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Will do.

1435
01:38:15,202 --> 01:38:15,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1436
01:38:15,462 --> 01:38:16,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only stole one game.

1437
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:18,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

1438
01:38:18,463 --> 01:38:18,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1439
01:38:18,983 --> 01:38:20,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only stole one game.

1440
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:21,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

1441
01:38:21,804 --> 01:38:22,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1442
01:38:22,044 --> 01:38:22,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It better be Gyromite.

1443
01:38:23,005 --> 01:38:23,865
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got like three of them.

1444
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:24,385
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1445
01:38:24,485 --> 01:38:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

1446
01:38:26,246 --> 01:38:26,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1447
01:38:27,106 --> 01:38:29,407
[SPEAKER_02]: She totally just gave us permission to steal Gyromite.

1448
01:38:29,607 --> 01:38:30,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

1449
01:38:30,427 --> 01:38:30,707
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1450
01:38:31,347 --> 01:38:32,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there Robbie back there too?

1451
01:38:32,928 --> 01:38:33,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be.

1452
01:38:33,528 --> 01:38:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1453
01:38:34,448 --> 01:38:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1454
01:38:34,848 --> 01:38:36,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to some Twitter topics.

1455
01:38:36,529 --> 01:38:40,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been messing around, but she wanted to come on the show at some point.

1456
01:38:40,663 --> 01:38:41,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the tweets.

1457
01:38:41,503 --> 01:38:47,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR Every week you guys send us your tweets and we sometimes read them on the show.

1458
01:38:47,504 --> 01:38:49,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends if we feel like it or not.

1459
01:38:49,325 --> 01:38:49,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1460
01:38:49,685 --> 01:38:49,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1461
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:50,845
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

1462
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator starts us off tonight sending us some tweets.

1463
01:38:55,426 --> 01:38:58,526
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a few new free videos on the PSM Video Store.

1464
01:38:59,946 --> 01:39:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1465
01:39:00,566 --> 01:39:01,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like beer burps tonight.

1466
01:39:01,867 --> 01:39:03,047
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not good for radio.

1467
01:39:04,867 --> 01:39:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to this happy music while I cough up beer.

1468
01:39:06,988 --> 01:39:07,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Pets!

1469
01:39:10,578 --> 01:39:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Spazinator says there's a few new free videos on the PSN Video Store, such as a rental of Ghost Rider and a few TV shows.

1470
01:39:17,721 --> 01:39:19,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually linked us to a blog post.

1471
01:39:20,142 --> 01:39:24,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Sony is now actually blogging about this stuff in some of the free movies.

1472
01:39:24,524 --> 01:39:25,764
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some anime episodes.

1473
01:39:26,184 --> 01:39:31,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So like right now, Full Metal Alchemist Brother and Afro Samurai are free right now.

1474
01:39:31,566 --> 01:39:35,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, FLCL and Trigun, Death Note, Kakaishi...

1475
01:39:36,329 --> 01:39:56,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Naruto Shippuden and Vampire Knight Inuyasha, Bleach lots of free shit right now on PlayStation Network so check that out also yeah they're blogging all about that on the official PlayStation blog so poor Spazinator's gonna have to find something else to talk about on the show if I could just log into the PlayStation blog and see the video releases now I'm kidding alright

1476
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:02,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, a few folks talking to us from PAX East.

1477
01:40:02,276 --> 01:40:04,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some of them will call in when we get to the calls.

1478
01:40:04,919 --> 01:40:10,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Actdeft wants to tell us about a new rhythm game coming to PlayStation Network called Dyad.

1479
01:40:10,605 --> 01:40:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It was shown at PAX East.

1480
01:40:13,348 --> 01:40:15,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Linking us to a little trailer here on YouTube.

1481
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:18,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me stop the cute music here.

1482
01:40:21,944 --> 01:40:23,706
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like zooming down this tunnel.

1483
01:40:23,806 --> 01:40:29,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a Wipeout HD mixed with... Oh, what was that freaking game?

1484
01:40:30,072 --> 01:40:32,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Audio Surf on Steam.

1485
01:40:32,795 --> 01:40:33,736
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what this looks like to me.

1486
01:40:33,756 --> 01:40:35,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

1487
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:38,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how that's a music game.

1488
01:40:44,089 --> 01:40:46,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like chiptunes or something is the music.

1489
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:48,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's the whole deal.

1490
01:40:48,633 --> 01:40:50,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have to research more about that a little later.

1491
01:40:51,935 --> 01:40:54,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to some more tweets.

1492
01:40:54,137 --> 01:40:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment tweeting us saying, It's good to see Square issuing refunds over the Final Fantasy XI outage.

1493
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:03,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Treats their customers better than the airlines would in the same situation.

1494
01:41:03,824 --> 01:41:04,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

1495
01:41:04,345 --> 01:41:04,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1496
01:41:05,245 --> 01:41:05,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good point.

1497
01:41:06,686 --> 01:41:08,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw wants to bring this up.

1498
01:41:08,206 --> 01:41:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: AT&T is going to be introducing a bandwidth cap for DSL and U-verse customers this May.

1499
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:17,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Comcast folks have been dealing with this for some time.

1500
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:26,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently now there is going to be a 150 gigabyte monthly usage cap for DSL customers and 250 gigabyte cap for U-verse users starting on May 2nd.

1501
01:41:27,111 --> 01:41:34,473
[SPEAKER_02]: AT&T users from now through March 31st are going to start receiving notices informing them of the change in the company's terms of service.

1502
01:41:35,193 --> 01:41:43,800
[SPEAKER_02]: There will also be overage charges if you go over, I guess it's $10 for every 50 gigabytes over the 150 or 250 gigabyte limit.

1503
01:41:44,061 --> 01:41:51,086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually not bad because Comcast has been doing this for a few months now and they threaten to pull your coverage all together if you go over the 250 cap.

1504
01:41:51,407 --> 01:41:53,108
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes a lot to go over.

1505
01:41:53,188 --> 01:41:54,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot to get over 250.

1506
01:41:54,369 --> 01:41:55,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at my usage.

1507
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the month of January I used 18 gigs.

1508
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,473
[SPEAKER_02]: and I play a lot of WoW.

1509
01:41:59,493 --> 01:42:00,153
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my question.

1510
01:42:00,173 --> 01:42:03,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say MMOs would be the suck off that.

1511
01:42:03,455 --> 01:42:08,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never gone over 250 gigs and I download a lot of porn video.

1512
01:42:09,638 --> 01:42:09,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1513
01:42:10,962 --> 01:42:12,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Not ISOs at all.

1514
01:42:31,249 --> 01:42:32,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me started on net neutrality.

1515
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Cable companies are going to destroy themselves with all this crap.

1516
01:42:56,494 --> 01:42:57,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Just watch.

1517
01:42:57,135 --> 01:43:00,180
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to make piracy worse.

1518
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:00,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch.

1519
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:03,325
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make piracy worse.

1520
01:43:03,986 --> 01:43:07,251
[SPEAKER_02]: All the net neutrality stuff is going to make it worse.

1521
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:08,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.

1522
01:43:10,339 --> 01:43:11,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the behavior of the internet.

1523
01:43:12,022 --> 01:43:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't think that charging people extra money to access certain services is going to encourage people to get around that gate or for new services to start up to offer the same stuff in less legitimate ways, just you wait.

1524
01:43:26,883 --> 01:43:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw sends us another tweet about voice acting in Portal 2.

1525
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:33,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Announced at PAX, J.K.

1526
01:43:33,628 --> 01:43:35,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Simmons will be doing a voice in Portal 2.

1527
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Juno's dad from Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson.

1528
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: J.K.

1529
01:43:42,915 --> 01:43:44,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Simmons will be doing this.

1530
01:43:45,437 --> 01:43:49,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Cave Johnson is the character, the president and founder of Aperture Science.

1531
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:50,200
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty big role.

1532
01:43:51,041 --> 01:43:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1533
01:43:52,582 --> 01:43:53,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be fun.

1534
01:43:53,763 --> 01:43:55,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that demo at PAX East for Portal 2?

1535
01:43:55,624 --> 01:43:56,724
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome if it was.

1536
01:43:56,865 --> 01:43:59,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one of those behind closed doors thing, which is a little silly.

1537
01:44:00,726 --> 01:44:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Swim sends us a tweet.

1538
01:44:02,807 --> 01:44:10,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently a pro wrestler was one of the first to pitch a perfect MLB 2K11 game.

1539
01:44:10,731 --> 01:44:11,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's the deal.

1540
01:44:11,611 --> 01:44:15,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that they're doing this contest right now for MLB 2K11?

1541
01:44:15,233 --> 01:44:16,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a commercial for this the other day.

1542
01:44:16,794 --> 01:44:20,896
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are the first to pitch a perfect game, you can win a million dollars.

1543
01:44:21,816 --> 01:44:22,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael Manna, Stevie Richards,

1544
01:44:43,712 --> 01:45:01,905
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's supposed to be harder than it was last year because you can't I think you have to actually use the legitimate rosters for players that are current up to that date you can't just you know power load your team or whatever like they did last year so it should be slightly harder so it may take like

1545
01:45:02,782 --> 01:45:04,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Two days instead of one day.

1546
01:45:05,783 --> 01:45:13,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, a tweet from Blue Swim saying Dead or Alive announced for the 3DS that there is going to be some DLC.

1547
01:45:14,548 --> 01:45:17,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, some DLC coming to the 3DS.

1548
01:45:17,429 --> 01:45:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be, let's see, the series boss characters, Alpha 152, Alpha Kasumi, Genra, and Tengu.

1549
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:25,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, they are not DLC.

1550
01:45:26,013 --> 01:45:27,874
[SPEAKER_02]: They are just going to be in the game, which is pretty cool.

1551
01:45:28,534 --> 01:45:32,878
[SPEAKER_02]: However, free downloadable content, 28 additional costumes.

1552
01:45:33,058 --> 01:45:33,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be free.

1553
01:45:34,059 --> 01:45:38,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheerleader, Leifang, Ninja outfit, Ayana, and so on and so on.

1554
01:45:38,382 --> 01:45:40,644
[SPEAKER_02]: La Mariposa in a white cat outfit.

1555
01:45:42,385 --> 01:45:42,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

1556
01:45:43,646 --> 01:45:47,289
[SPEAKER_02]: More information available in Famitsu Magazine, which broke the news this week.

1557
01:45:47,349 --> 01:45:48,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

1558
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:50,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for tweets.

1559
01:45:50,232 --> 01:45:53,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to show us your tweets next time.

1560
01:45:54,555 --> 01:45:56,537
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime, let's go back into some news.

1561
01:45:58,291 --> 01:45:59,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1562
01:46:00,212 --> 01:46:02,453
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

1563
01:46:04,955 --> 01:46:07,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of ranted about this a little bit in the beginning.

1564
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:15,180
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, Dance Hero, apparently there were trademarks registered a while back.

1565
01:46:15,220 --> 01:46:18,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember we were talking about Guitar Villain and Dance Hero and stuff like that.

1566
01:46:18,702 --> 01:46:21,144
[SPEAKER_14]: We're like, oh no, they're going to do something like DDR.

1567
01:46:22,285 --> 01:46:26,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now apparently there's some more info regarding it.

1568
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:29,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, they're saying that...

1569
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:34,553
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some artists working with Activision on the franchise.

1570
01:46:34,573 --> 01:46:42,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Timbaland, Jay Sean, The Prodigy, and Afrojack all have songs, I guess, that are going to be in this.

1571
01:46:43,418 --> 01:46:45,539
[SPEAKER_14]: It's... I don't know.

1572
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:52,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I guess I could see them doing something similar like this, like Dance Central, because it's made money.

1573
01:46:52,704 --> 01:46:53,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It's what's popular right now.

1574
01:46:53,844 --> 01:46:53,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And...

1575
01:46:58,578 --> 01:46:58,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, um...

1576
01:47:19,659 --> 01:47:44,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, they're saying the songs that are licensed so far 2012 by Jay Sean Featuring Nicki Minaj Out of Space by The Prodigy The Way I Are by Timbaland Take Over Control by Afrojack I don't know what they're going to really do with this I assume it's going to be something similar to Just Dance or Dance Central

1577
01:47:46,829 --> 01:47:53,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, I hope they ruin this genre as well.

1578
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:56,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't you done enough bad?

1579
01:47:56,611 --> 01:48:03,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting comment from GameGuru in our chatroom saying, I don't think Activision is following Dance Central, they are following just dance.

1580
01:48:05,433 --> 01:48:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, those aren't that different.

1581
01:48:09,659 --> 01:48:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they aren't, but I also kind of see the point that he might be making there with the whole kind of the style of the games and the way they control is a little bit different.

1582
01:48:20,241 --> 01:48:30,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I guarantee this is probably coming out in the fall this year, you might guess, because they're going to have to have something to fill, I mean, what have they really announced that they're going to be putting out this year?

1583
01:48:30,464 --> 01:48:30,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty.

1584
01:48:31,693 --> 01:48:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, how is it going to be different?

1585
01:48:34,114 --> 01:48:40,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, they're just setting themselves up for the same goddamn situation that got Guitar Hero canned.

1586
01:48:40,937 --> 01:48:46,640
[SPEAKER_02]: If they come out at E3 and announce this fucking game, they need to say, and here's how it's different.

1587
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,202
[SPEAKER_02]: You better acknowledge your competition and tell us why it's better.

1588
01:48:50,782 --> 01:48:52,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, fuck off.

1589
01:48:53,745 --> 01:48:58,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Our new Guitar Hero game is different because now it has drums and singing in it.

1590
01:48:58,654 --> 01:49:03,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what it is, but you know Harmonix is bringing Dance Central 2 to E3 this year.

1591
01:49:03,503 --> 01:49:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it.

1592
01:49:04,953 --> 01:49:06,994
[SPEAKER_02]: That's gotta be their thing that they're working on now.

1593
01:49:07,034 --> 01:49:08,175
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's gonna be shown.

1594
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:15,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can walk down the hall and see Activision and their little game, they better be prepared to say, this is how our game's different.

1595
01:49:16,019 --> 01:49:17,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I do not give a fuck.

1596
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And you better bet your ass that Ubisoft's bringing Just Dance to the other consoles this year as well.

1597
01:49:22,143 --> 01:49:25,284
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that thing sold out like crazy on the Wii.

1598
01:49:25,665 --> 01:49:27,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course they're gonna be bringing it to the Kinect and the Move.

1599
01:49:28,346 --> 01:49:32,709
[SPEAKER_14]: So they've already got right there two competitors for this, you know, genre.

1600
01:49:33,009 --> 01:49:37,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever Konami's gonna just randomly show, too, could be involved in there, too.

1601
01:49:38,312 --> 01:49:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think Dance Masters exactly sold millions, but you never know.

1602
01:49:41,254 --> 01:49:43,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami, bless their hearts, they're still trying.

1603
01:49:44,356 --> 01:49:45,016
[SPEAKER_02]: They got DDR.

1604
01:49:45,136 --> 01:49:51,040
[SPEAKER_14]: And props to them, though, for at least trying Dance Masters, what I consider a very Japanese game.

1605
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:52,861
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1606
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:56,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Masters is very different from Dance Central.

1607
01:49:57,064 --> 01:49:57,684
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1608
01:49:57,984 --> 01:50:03,648
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not really looking deep at the music game if you pass them both off as the same game.

1609
01:50:03,768 --> 01:50:05,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Dance Masters does function very different.

1610
01:50:05,869 --> 01:50:11,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the only thing that's kind of frustrating about it is the fact that it's so hard to really kind of get into, you know what I mean?

1611
01:50:12,113 --> 01:50:16,996
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like, I guess it's very much like Para where you just do it.

1612
01:50:17,959 --> 01:50:18,580
[SPEAKER_14]: and that's it.

1613
01:50:19,882 --> 01:50:26,189
[SPEAKER_14]: If they had a little bit more structure, if they had an actual tutorial or something to it, it might be better.

1614
01:50:27,050 --> 01:50:28,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, you know, sequel.

1615
01:50:28,913 --> 01:50:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of cool.

1616
01:50:31,215 --> 01:50:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, Sony Europe has actually cancelled some games.

1617
01:50:34,436 --> 01:50:37,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of these were dance games, like maybe SingStar, I don't know.

1618
01:50:37,858 --> 01:50:41,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, I doubt that, by the way, I'm just trolling.

1619
01:50:41,819 --> 01:50:56,185
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has mentioned to the staffs at Studio Liverpool, London Studio, Evolution Studios, that they are going to be streamlining and closing various projects to move the development to other higher priority first party offerings.

1620
01:50:56,505 --> 01:51:00,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not talking layoffs or anything, we're just talking about these little games you are making?

1621
01:51:00,127 --> 01:51:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1622
01:51:00,447 --> 01:51:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Exclusives?

1623
01:51:23,925 --> 01:51:25,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

1624
01:51:25,785 --> 01:51:26,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?

1625
01:51:26,485 --> 01:51:28,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony didn't say what projects were affected.

1626
01:51:28,806 --> 01:51:30,286
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't say anything about layoffs.

1627
01:51:30,626 --> 01:51:34,667
[SPEAKER_02]: They did reiterate there is no impact in the role that the first party studios play.

1628
01:51:35,207 --> 01:51:37,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I guess, moving the resources around.

1629
01:51:37,707 --> 01:51:41,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't like that LittleBigPlanet 2 didn't make Christmas because maybe it impacted sales.

1630
01:51:42,248 --> 01:51:42,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it did.

1631
01:51:43,308 --> 01:51:48,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they're really stretching to make Christmas this year and they're really just kind of bringing it home on some of the first party games.

1632
01:51:48,789 --> 01:51:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really going to put it all behind, which I could understand that.

1633
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I could understand that.

1634
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1635
01:52:09,867 --> 01:52:32,089
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they've got, what, first quarter so far, they've had LittleBigPlanet 2, they're gonna be having, well, Killzone 3, DC Universe, and PlayStation Move Heroes will be coming out, and then possibly Sorcery, and I think the Ico and Shadow of the Colossus collection, although both of those, I think, may have been delayed.

1636
01:52:32,569 --> 01:52:39,435
[SPEAKER_14]: And then second quarter so far, they've got SOCOM 4, Motorstorm Apocalypse, Infamous 2.

1637
01:52:40,696 --> 01:52:44,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I wouldn't say they're definitely putting out the releases.

1638
01:52:46,581 --> 01:52:47,201
[SPEAKER_14]: So who knows?

1639
01:52:47,281 --> 01:52:51,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what they're... I mean, Uncharted 3, they have for the fourth quarter.

1640
01:52:52,045 --> 01:52:53,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that'll be the big thing they show you.

1641
01:52:53,526 --> 01:52:53,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Resistance 3.

1642
01:52:53,947 --> 01:52:54,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

1643
01:52:58,450 --> 01:53:00,171
[SPEAKER_14]: and I guess Twisted Metal possibly.

1644
01:53:00,251 --> 01:53:02,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't be surprised if that wouldn't be quarter one of next year.

1645
01:53:05,074 --> 01:53:05,414
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1646
01:53:05,814 --> 01:53:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move on with a couple more stories.

1647
01:53:07,295 --> 01:53:08,936
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to the mailbag here in just a moment.

1648
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:09,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, Matt Tu.

1649
01:53:10,817 --> 01:53:11,137
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1650
01:53:11,197 --> 01:53:19,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those who are fans of NBA Jam, your time with that game might be coming to an end.

1651
01:53:19,582 --> 01:53:20,883
[SPEAKER_09]: So EA Sports is kind of a...

1652
01:53:21,403 --> 01:53:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1653
01:53:41,997 --> 01:54:02,565
[SPEAKER_09]: to round out the great gameplay that defines a franchise for us to include roster and title update possibilities would have been a sacrifice of quality in those key areas and thus made the difficult decision not to include them so with NBA Jam and their post game releases as well as roster updates looks like the franchise is coming to an end

1654
01:54:03,345 --> 01:54:06,006
[SPEAKER_02]: This franchise was so badly mismanaged from the beginning.

1655
01:54:06,106 --> 01:54:06,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1656
01:54:06,346 --> 01:54:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really sad because it was this whole like, okay, it's only going to come out on the Wii.

1657
01:54:11,168 --> 01:54:11,889
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

1658
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:13,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming on the PlayStation 3 and the 360.

1659
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:16,090
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to do the obvious arcade thing.

1660
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:22,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it's only going to be an exclusive with this subpar basketball game to try and get it to sell extra copies.

1661
01:54:23,113 --> 01:54:23,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.

1662
01:54:23,633 --> 01:54:25,074
[SPEAKER_02]: This basketball game really sucks.

1663
01:54:25,114 --> 01:54:25,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting canceled.

1664
01:54:26,134 --> 01:54:26,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, shit.

1665
01:54:26,595 --> 01:54:28,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we better charge like $60 for four of these.

1666
01:54:28,455 --> 01:54:30,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this franchise was horrible.

1667
01:54:30,516 --> 01:54:44,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Horribly mismanaged from the start Shame on whoever ran this thing I mean, I guess they were trying to think of something outside the box But you fucked up Yeah, the marketing project manager on this was streamlined Probably out the door You know what?

1668
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it, but they kind of deserve it This was a horribly mismanaged franchise This game should have been huge And it should have been on arcade Or it should have been a budget title If this game had been $30...

1669
01:54:56,363 --> 01:54:57,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It would have sold.

1670
01:54:57,244 --> 01:54:58,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Millions of people would have it.

1671
01:54:58,585 --> 01:55:07,911
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, classic sport games like their Madden franchise will still continue to get roster updates and support because that thing is still on fire and it's got a huge following for the Madden series.

1672
01:55:08,393 --> 01:55:11,094
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally had to bring this game up.

1673
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:17,498
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to bump this from a B title to an A title to fill in the gap of a game that was so fucking terrible they had to can it.

1674
01:55:17,998 --> 01:55:20,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this game was set up to fail.

1675
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:22,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely set up to fail.

1676
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:27,803
[SPEAKER_09]: The time, money, energy spent to not release it is definitely a hit in their bottom line.

1677
01:55:27,843 --> 01:55:31,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those fans of NBA Jam, looks like...

1678
01:55:32,545 --> 01:55:36,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever last copy you have to own or rent is the last iteration you're going to have.

1679
01:55:36,106 --> 01:55:38,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Sell the franchise to someone who knows what to do with it.

1680
01:55:38,446 --> 01:55:38,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1681
01:55:39,267 --> 01:55:39,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami?

1682
01:55:41,187 --> 01:55:41,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

1683
01:55:41,767 --> 01:55:42,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1684
01:55:42,187 --> 01:55:44,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Konami did make Double Dribble back in the day, which is pretty sweet.

1685
01:55:44,908 --> 01:55:45,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Double Dribble.

1686
01:55:46,748 --> 01:55:47,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Who did Blades of Steel?

1687
01:55:47,428 --> 01:55:48,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that Konami as well?

1688
01:55:48,729 --> 01:55:49,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1689
01:55:49,269 --> 01:55:51,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami knows how to do some pretty sweet sport games.

1690
01:55:51,509 --> 01:55:53,650
[SPEAKER_02]: They're winning 11s.

1691
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:59,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, soccer is not big here in the U.S., but it's huge everywhere else, and that's a huge franchise.

1692
01:55:59,531 --> 01:56:00,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I just remember playing that game.

1693
01:56:00,351 --> 01:56:01,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Blades of Steel!

1694
01:56:01,732 --> 01:56:05,874
[SPEAKER_09]: The only time that it had speech in an 8-bit NES game.

1695
01:56:06,594 --> 01:56:08,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And Ten Yard Rush?

1696
01:56:08,775 --> 01:56:09,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten Yard Dash?

1697
01:56:10,095 --> 01:56:13,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ten Yard Rush was the first party Nintendo title, I think.

1698
01:56:13,436 --> 01:56:14,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That was another classic.

1699
01:56:14,097 --> 01:56:15,137
[SPEAKER_09]: An old school game.

1700
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:16,778
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, so NBA Jam.

1701
01:56:18,839 --> 01:56:19,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming to an end.

1702
01:56:19,519 --> 01:56:23,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, well, we don't know if it's dead for... I mean, they're stopping the roster updates.

1703
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to support NBA Jam.

1704
01:56:25,021 --> 01:56:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily mean the death of it, but it's...

1705
01:56:28,797 --> 01:56:31,220
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a Magic 8-Ball, it would say, Outlook not good.

1706
01:56:33,623 --> 01:56:34,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1707
01:56:34,484 --> 01:56:36,586
[SPEAKER_09]: My gut says it's coming to an abrupt end.

1708
01:56:37,667 --> 01:56:39,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to the fans of that game.

1709
01:56:39,693 --> 01:56:46,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, if NBA Jam was either Xbox Live Arcade or PSN, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat, but no such luck.

1710
01:56:46,682 --> 01:56:47,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have done the same thing.

1711
01:56:47,903 --> 01:56:48,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1712
01:56:48,924 --> 01:56:50,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people would.

1713
01:56:50,847 --> 01:56:52,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did NBA Jam get its start?

1714
01:56:52,469 --> 01:56:53,490
[SPEAKER_02]: In the arcade.

1715
01:56:54,651 --> 01:56:54,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1716
01:56:55,893 --> 01:56:59,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they had just buffed up the old version with new rosters, I would have been all over that.

1717
01:56:59,597 --> 01:57:07,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess maybe the troubling part is getting the rosters to match the look and feel of the players of the animated heads and all that.

1718
01:57:07,805 --> 01:57:08,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1719
01:57:08,785 --> 01:57:14,030
[SPEAKER_09]: If you download something, it's an awful lot of content recreated visually to someone's exploited head.

1720
01:57:14,591 --> 01:57:14,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1721
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:16,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sad.

1722
01:57:16,332 --> 01:57:18,134
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's another sporting game that's kind of dying.

1723
01:57:18,314 --> 01:57:20,917
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, sell the franchise to Activision?

1724
01:57:20,998 --> 01:57:23,120
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll end up releasing new NBA jams every year.

1725
01:57:24,202 --> 01:57:25,884
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they'll get maintained, right?

1726
01:57:26,925 --> 01:57:27,386
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1727
01:57:28,287 --> 01:57:29,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, moving on with some more news.

1728
01:57:33,987 --> 01:57:34,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1729
01:57:35,487 --> 01:57:47,611
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked a little bit about this, how there was a temporary injunction where LG won against Sony and they got some of the PlayStation 3 shipments held in Europe.

1730
01:57:48,071 --> 01:57:54,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Sony actually won overall and this was due to a patent dispute.

1731
01:57:55,553 --> 01:58:02,214
[SPEAKER_14]: and now it's C, I guess they're saying that all the C's PlayStations have been released.

1732
01:58:03,175 --> 01:58:05,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was quick.

1733
01:58:05,975 --> 01:58:11,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And they actually only took about a day in the courts to settle everything.

1734
01:58:12,977 --> 01:58:13,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was fast.

1735
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:14,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1736
01:58:14,137 --> 01:58:17,918
[SPEAKER_02]: After all that news about like, oh my God, it's going to be a shortage of PlayStation 3.

1737
01:58:17,958 --> 01:58:17,998
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1738
01:58:19,284 --> 01:58:20,125
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's done.

1739
01:58:20,325 --> 01:58:21,466
[SPEAKER_14]: And then on top of all that.

1740
01:58:21,486 --> 01:58:23,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we stop.

1741
01:58:23,788 --> 01:58:26,450
[SPEAKER_14]: And then on top of all that, LG had to pay legal fees.

1742
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:28,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they got laughed out of court.

1743
01:58:28,792 --> 01:58:37,659
[SPEAKER_14]: And also they're saying that for each day that LG failed to comply, it would be fined the rate of 200,000 euros.

1744
01:58:38,459 --> 01:58:38,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

1745
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:41,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is still a buck and a half each.

1746
01:58:41,322 --> 01:58:41,862
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of money.

1747
01:58:41,882 --> 01:58:42,522
[SPEAKER_14]: That's $275,000 in U.S.

1748
01:58:42,542 --> 01:58:42,683
[SPEAKER_14]: dollars.

1749
01:58:48,222 --> 01:58:51,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we might actually have some audio from the proceedings of the trial.

1750
01:58:51,965 --> 01:58:52,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1751
01:58:52,685 --> 01:58:53,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I got ripped!

1752
01:58:53,626 --> 01:58:54,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, goddammit.

1753
01:58:54,547 --> 01:58:56,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody bombing on YouTube.

1754
01:58:56,828 --> 01:58:57,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1755
01:58:57,909 --> 01:58:58,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you just get Rickrolled?

1756
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:00,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I did a little bit.

1757
01:59:00,110 --> 01:59:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to find a clip here.

1758
01:59:01,731 --> 01:59:04,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can find this.

1759
01:59:07,035 --> 01:59:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think we have a clip here from the trial's proceedings here.

1760
01:59:10,957 --> 01:59:13,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if we can get this out here.

1761
01:59:14,465 --> 01:59:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That bitch scares me.

1762
01:59:15,046 --> 01:59:16,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking love Judge Judy.

1763
01:59:16,187 --> 01:59:16,728
[SPEAKER_06]: You would.

1764
01:59:16,748 --> 01:59:17,509
[SPEAKER_06]: She's amazing.

1765
01:59:28,462 --> 01:59:47,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the episode with, she's doing her usual, you know, killing people with her eyes and her nose, and someone lit up a cigarette in the audience, not a plaintiff or defendant, but an actual audience member just chilling in the back, and she's there, you know, going off in her, you know, Diablo fire, spewing, and, who's, anyone smell smoke?

1766
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:48,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I smell smoke!

1767
01:59:49,221 --> 01:59:53,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And some guy in the back, like, actually pretty well dressed, looked like in a suit, or at least in a sport coat,

1768
01:59:53,365 --> 01:59:54,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you smoking, sir?

1769
01:59:54,546 --> 01:59:55,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out of my damn courtroom!

1770
01:59:56,547 --> 01:59:58,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Smoking a cigarette on TV on Judge Judy.

1771
01:59:59,889 --> 02:00:00,609
[SPEAKER_09]: How random is that?

1772
02:00:02,630 --> 02:00:03,350
[SPEAKER_09]: She still scares me.

1773
02:00:06,752 --> 02:00:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if I can find that in this.

1774
02:00:08,693 --> 02:00:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not on YouTube.

1775
02:00:10,274 --> 02:00:14,837
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a random episode that I just had me watching when I was, you know... There is this one, though.

1776
02:00:14,857 --> 02:00:16,237
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of cigarettes did you buy?

1777
02:00:16,537 --> 02:00:17,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro Reds.

1778
02:00:17,778 --> 02:00:17,998
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1779
02:00:18,478 --> 02:00:19,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro Reds.

1780
02:00:19,739 --> 02:00:20,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro Reds?

1781
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1782
02:00:22,739 --> 02:00:23,139
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

1783
02:00:23,339 --> 02:00:24,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Marlboro Reds.

1784
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:26,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro Reds.

1785
02:00:28,942 --> 02:00:31,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my hearing or his speech.

1786
02:00:31,103 --> 02:00:31,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's his speech.

1787
02:00:31,943 --> 02:00:33,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

1788
02:00:33,083 --> 02:00:34,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette.

1789
02:00:34,584 --> 02:00:36,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever seen the bailiff get sassy.

1790
02:00:36,685 --> 02:00:37,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear that?

1791
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:38,005
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1792
02:00:38,025 --> 02:00:38,766
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's his speech.

1793
02:00:39,526 --> 02:00:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: The bailiff is getting a little sassy.

1794
02:00:41,387 --> 02:00:43,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he smoked a certain type of cigarette before going to court.

1795
02:00:45,422 --> 02:00:46,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, moving on.

1796
02:00:47,623 --> 02:00:49,684
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no overturning this ruling.

1797
02:00:50,004 --> 02:00:57,467
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to sell your Game Boy Advance crap to GameStop, you better do it quick because they're going to stop buying all of this in April.

1798
02:00:58,247 --> 02:01:01,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think right now they will buy a Game Boy Advance for maybe like $20.

1799
02:01:02,449 --> 02:01:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1800
02:01:21,889 --> 02:01:25,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say I thought some GameStop still kind of specialized in selling old shit.

1801
02:01:26,092 --> 02:01:30,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Like usually in a big city there's at least one GameStop that does kind of still carry the old shit.

1802
02:01:30,596 --> 02:01:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the stockpile of NES games or I've seen regular Game Boy games for sale at GameStop.

1803
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Are GameStops franchised or corporate owned?

1804
02:01:38,703 --> 02:01:39,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Corporate.

1805
02:01:39,523 --> 02:01:41,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Then probably they conform to corporate doctrine.

1806
02:01:41,605 --> 02:01:44,988
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't mean that you can't put your GBA up on eBay.

1807
02:01:45,768 --> 02:01:46,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1808
02:01:46,329 --> 02:01:48,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course there's always eBay and there's indie stores as well.

1809
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Which by the way the one by my house closed.

1810
02:01:50,893 --> 02:01:52,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there used to be an indie store by my house.

1811
02:01:52,642 --> 02:01:53,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It closed.

1812
02:01:53,465 --> 02:01:53,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the time.

1813
02:01:53,847 --> 02:01:54,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like arcades.

1814
02:01:54,992 --> 02:01:55,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1815
02:01:55,434 --> 02:01:55,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

1816
02:01:57,202 --> 02:02:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

1817
02:02:00,645 --> 02:02:03,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1818
02:02:04,908 --> 02:02:07,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like to pick a few of our favorites and read them here live on air.

1819
02:02:08,051 --> 02:02:10,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1820
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:11,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Very thin email bag this week.

1821
02:02:11,774 --> 02:02:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very disappointed in all of you.

1822
02:02:13,135 --> 02:02:14,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Why look at me when you say that?

1823
02:02:14,316 --> 02:02:15,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, because you're here.

1824
02:02:15,617 --> 02:02:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Loki doesn't look at me during the show.

1825
02:02:17,558 --> 02:02:20,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, he's too into his Grand Theft Auto hacking thing, so...

1826
02:02:21,241 --> 02:02:23,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Which by the way doesn't seem to be working too well.

1827
02:02:23,603 --> 02:02:26,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got one email this week that I'm going to read for you guys.

1828
02:02:27,546 --> 02:02:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a good one because it's from Belgium.

1829
02:02:29,868 --> 02:02:30,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

1830
02:02:30,368 --> 02:02:30,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1831
02:02:30,989 --> 02:02:32,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an email from Belgium.

1832
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,670
[SPEAKER_02]: They make good waffles.

1833
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:34,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello good folks at OLR.

1834
02:02:34,992 --> 02:02:36,313
[SPEAKER_02]: My TV is about to die on me.

1835
02:02:36,653 --> 02:02:38,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to buy a new one in the near future.

1836
02:02:38,274 --> 02:02:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me any advice on what makes a good TV for gaming and watching DVDs on a 360 and watching analog cable TV?

1837
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:48,502
[SPEAKER_02]: How much milliseconds is good for gaming, contrast, etc.? ?

1838
02:02:50,104 --> 02:03:07,127
[SPEAKER_02]: you already seem to know what you're looking for because the delay is what you're going to want for gaming and the refresh rate on the screen I believe for like PC monitors you don't want to go any higher than four most monitors now are like two and I think the TVs are the same way aren't they two millisecond refresh something like that

1839
02:03:07,327 --> 02:03:07,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that.

1840
02:03:07,867 --> 02:03:10,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I have a... Here's how nerdy I am.

1841
02:03:10,148 --> 02:03:13,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a 46-inch TV as my monitor for my office, for my PC computer.

1842
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:16,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing WoW on that thing is pretty fucking amazing.

1843
02:03:16,691 --> 02:03:20,492
[SPEAKER_09]: It is slightly orgasmic and videos, quote-unquote, are nice on it too.

1844
02:03:20,853 --> 02:03:23,294
[SPEAKER_09]: But definitely look at refresh rates.

1845
02:03:23,314 --> 02:03:26,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely look at megahertz refresh rate as well.

1846
02:03:28,055 --> 02:03:28,336
[SPEAKER_09]: 60 or 120.

1847
02:03:29,316 --> 02:03:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: High refresh is also preferred as well.

1848
02:03:31,917 --> 02:03:36,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind that the cheapy TVs right now only go as high as 720p in HD.

1849
02:03:36,918 --> 02:03:39,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely look at the pixelage on the TV.

1850
02:03:40,019 --> 02:03:46,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine only goes as high as 1080i because I bought an HD TV kind of on the cheap when HD technology was still newish.

1851
02:03:46,221 --> 02:03:47,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So they cut back kind of that way.

1852
02:03:48,762 --> 02:03:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So double check that.

1853
02:03:50,322 --> 02:03:51,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to look...

1854
02:03:53,303 --> 02:03:58,024
[SPEAKER_02]: at the obvious because sometimes they will kind of brush that over to cut a couple hundred dollars.

1855
02:03:58,404 --> 02:04:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's cheap, there's probably a reason.

1856
02:04:00,244 --> 02:04:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Always remember that.

1857
02:04:00,865 --> 02:04:06,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely 1080p and refresh rates are probably your two pieces of information you want to hold up.

1858
02:04:06,706 --> 02:04:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people will tell you, though, you can't tell the difference between 1080p and 1080i.

1859
02:04:10,787 --> 02:04:11,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of beg to differ.

1860
02:04:11,687 --> 02:04:14,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can see it a little bit, especially in Blu-rays is where I can see it.

1861
02:04:14,927 --> 02:04:17,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And also HDMI cables.

1862
02:04:17,608 --> 02:04:18,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the gold-plated ones if you can.

1863
02:04:19,368 --> 02:04:21,449
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a better strength to that, at least I've noticed.

1864
02:04:21,789 --> 02:04:22,009
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1865
02:04:23,927 --> 02:04:28,952
[SPEAKER_02]: SpazinatorPC in our chatroom says, Vizio's supposedly coming out with a $300 3D HD TV this year.

1866
02:04:29,052 --> 02:04:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: See, something's got to be wrong with it.

1867
02:04:30,873 --> 02:04:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I don't know, my main TV is a Vizio, and I've been relatively happy with it, except for the fact that it doesn't do 1080p.

1868
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:44,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have to look at, I paid only, what, $700 for it several years ago when HD TV was still kind of newish.

1869
02:04:44,526 --> 02:04:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I...

1870
02:04:45,667 --> 02:04:46,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't complain too much.

1871
02:04:46,928 --> 02:04:51,189
[SPEAKER_09]: My TV monitor in my room is a LG 46-inch.

1872
02:04:51,470 --> 02:04:52,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget the model number.

1873
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:53,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

1874
02:04:53,731 --> 02:04:55,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, while on, it plays very well.

1875
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:58,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It serves well for monitor use and all that.

1876
02:04:58,993 --> 02:05:04,495
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, don't skip on those two parts, the resolution and the refresh rate.

1877
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:06,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on with our email from Belgium, there's more to it.

1878
02:05:07,535 --> 02:05:10,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I ripped the ligaments of my ankle a month ago during a soccer game.

1879
02:05:10,959 --> 02:05:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sports are healthy.

1880
02:05:12,321 --> 02:05:14,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of this, I'm unable to play any game on Kinect.

1881
02:05:15,725 --> 02:05:20,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me think of the many disabled people who cannot play movement controlled games because of their condition.

1882
02:05:20,651 --> 02:05:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: When the future of gaming really is Kinect, Move, Wii, or whatever will be next, I hope there will be a proper alternative for them to play games.

1883
02:05:27,819 --> 02:05:28,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1884
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1885
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1886
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.

1887
02:05:30,321 --> 02:05:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something I think we've mentioned on the show before is that gaming can't always 100% be these technologies.

1888
02:05:37,987 --> 02:05:41,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have, but it shouldn't always be a necessity.

1889
02:05:41,671 --> 02:05:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there will always be something for that core gamer who just wants that controller in their hand to play an RPG or a shoot-em-up, whatever it is.

1890
02:05:48,877 --> 02:05:50,118
[SPEAKER_02]: There will always be something for us.

1891
02:05:50,678 --> 02:05:51,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1892
02:05:51,619 --> 02:05:52,860
[SPEAKER_02]: A good mix is a good thing.

1893
02:05:53,340 --> 02:06:09,110
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe even games that take disabilities into consideration would be a great thing I mean unfortunately there's many ways a person can be disabled and you can't always think of everything but it's always good to see game companies be at least considerate of you know especially the big ones definitely

1894
02:06:10,691 --> 02:06:12,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks again for making the show every week.

1895
02:06:12,892 --> 02:06:13,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are awesome.

1896
02:06:14,253 --> 02:06:16,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Greetings from Febreze, Belgium.

1897
02:06:17,274 --> 02:06:17,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1898
02:06:17,994 --> 02:06:18,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1899
02:06:18,655 --> 02:06:19,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like Febreze.

1900
02:06:19,995 --> 02:06:21,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Febreze, I believe is the name.

1901
02:06:21,856 --> 02:06:23,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if we can send the studio some waffles.

1902
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1903
02:06:25,558 --> 02:06:26,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And chocolate.

1904
02:06:27,338 --> 02:06:28,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocolate waffles with chicken.

1905
02:06:28,559 --> 02:06:29,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And fries.

1906
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:30,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Belgian fries.

1907
02:06:31,561 --> 02:06:32,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1908
02:06:32,882 --> 02:06:33,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Road trip.

1909
02:06:33,682 --> 02:06:34,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1910
02:06:34,363 --> 02:06:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a place in New York City I went to once and there was this restaurant in New York City that just sold nothing but Belgian, like the French fry type thing, but like the Belgian big ones and like 20 different kinds of dips for the fries.

1911
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:47,931
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only damn thing the store sold.

1912
02:06:48,112 --> 02:06:48,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Packed.

1913
02:06:48,992 --> 02:06:49,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Packed.

1914
02:06:49,452 --> 02:06:49,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Wall to wall.

1915
02:06:50,433 --> 02:06:51,874
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually a place like that in Old Sacramento.

1916
02:06:52,374 --> 02:06:52,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there really?

1917
02:06:52,874 --> 02:06:53,375
[SPEAKER_09]: But not Belgium.

1918
02:06:53,775 --> 02:06:56,156
[SPEAKER_09]: They do fries with different toppings or dips to represent another world.

1919
02:06:56,176 --> 02:06:58,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Why has my fat ass not been to this place?

1920
02:06:58,117 --> 02:06:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: This sounds amazing.

1921
02:06:58,837 --> 02:07:01,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Old Sacramento is touristy and we live here and we don't go there.

1922
02:07:01,399 --> 02:07:01,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1923
02:07:02,239 --> 02:07:04,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been to Old Sac before.

1924
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:04,640
[SPEAKER_09]: It's weird.

1925
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:11,183
[SPEAKER_09]: They have Spanish with jalapenos and nacho cheese and they go to France and they've got blue cheese on them and crap like that.

1926
02:07:11,244 --> 02:07:14,805
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem I have, I can't believe this email is leading to talk about French fries, but whatever.

1927
02:07:14,825 --> 02:07:15,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Orange Launch Foodio.

1928
02:07:15,686 --> 02:07:16,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal with it.

1929
02:07:17,367 --> 02:07:23,971
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is that those restaurants usually, like the fries or the dips, like half of them are always mayo based and I, nope, those are out.

1930
02:07:24,372 --> 02:07:25,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do mayo based things.

1931
02:07:25,713 --> 02:07:27,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Like french fries with mayonnaise, disgusting.

1932
02:07:28,134 --> 02:07:29,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with mayonnaise, disgusting.

1933
02:07:29,455 --> 02:07:33,478
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've known me for any length of time, I hate, hate mayonnaise.

1934
02:07:33,858 --> 02:07:34,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to know.

1935
02:07:35,039 --> 02:07:35,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1936
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't be making any type of chicken salad for you for lunch today.

1937
02:07:38,181 --> 02:07:42,143
[SPEAKER_02]: or put a honey mustard dip in it or something that's not freaking mayonnaise.

1938
02:07:43,043 --> 02:07:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

1939
02:07:44,964 --> 02:07:46,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, the chat room's all, you guys are making me hungry.

1940
02:07:47,105 --> 02:07:47,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1941
02:07:48,226 --> 02:07:48,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1942
02:07:49,146 --> 02:07:49,507
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1943
02:07:49,807 --> 02:07:54,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess maybe the hunger might lead to a little bit of angst because I know when I don't eat, I get mad.

1944
02:07:54,929 --> 02:07:56,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's time for the FUs of the week.

1945
02:08:11,656 --> 02:08:12,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, start us off tonight.

1946
02:08:14,058 --> 02:08:17,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, fuck you to the stupid Grand Theft Auto texture editor.

1947
02:08:18,162 --> 02:08:22,526
[SPEAKER_14]: It's out there, but it doesn't seem to do anything that's working or whatever.

1948
02:08:24,087 --> 02:08:24,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Hate that crap.

1949
02:08:25,228 --> 02:08:29,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, um... Yeah, that's basically it.

1950
02:08:29,512 --> 02:08:29,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Screw that.

1951
02:08:30,573 --> 02:08:32,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I waited all this time and it doesn't open anything.

1952
02:08:33,075 --> 02:08:36,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm sure there's something wrong or it's buggy or something, but I'll figure it out.

1953
02:08:38,861 --> 02:09:04,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt Tu Fuck you to midterms, I've got two of them this week And I'm looking forward to finishing those And fuck you to income taxes, I'll have to be finishing those up here soon So I can mail out a check to Uncle Sam and Governor Brown Although it's really good to not say Governator anymore I will yield to that And F you to Loki's text your editor thing that I don't understand That he seemed pretty angsty about

1954
02:09:06,103 --> 02:09:33,523
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to natural disasters because F you mother nature seriously because I'm really glad that everybody I know over in Japan is safe but unfortunately I know like thousands of people aren't safe and that's just it's just really hard to read because that could really happen anywhere so I just very sad so anyway there's an F you to that and I would also say F you to money I don't have enough of it I never do

1955
02:09:33,871 --> 02:09:34,291
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

1956
02:09:55,413 --> 02:10:02,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1957
02:10:02,417 --> 02:10:03,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not open yet, but it will be in a moment.

1958
02:10:04,958 --> 02:10:21,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, in case you're wondering why Activision does what Activision does, that is put game sequel out year after year, it's because they're only encouraged by people that buy those games and this isn't going to help if you're hoping for the Call of Duty franchise to go away.

1959
02:10:22,768 --> 02:10:27,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Call of Duty Black Ops is the US's best selling game ever.

1960
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:31,892
[SPEAKER_14]: It has beaten everything in only about four months.

1961
02:10:32,792 --> 02:10:40,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And that includes also the sales of Wii Play, which Nintendo claims is around 13 million copies.

1962
02:10:42,136 --> 02:10:43,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this was a down economy.

1963
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:49,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, 13 million copies of Wii Play is way too many of that freaking game.

1964
02:10:50,002 --> 02:10:51,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But even, oh my gosh.

1965
02:10:52,023 --> 02:10:53,504
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I don't really play the Call of Duty games.

1966
02:10:53,544 --> 02:10:54,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really hate on them.

1967
02:10:54,985 --> 02:10:56,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them played.

1968
02:10:57,166 --> 02:11:01,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why dudes like them, but not a series I personally get into.

1969
02:11:01,568 --> 02:11:04,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is now the best selling game of all time?

1970
02:11:04,270 --> 02:11:04,630
[SPEAKER_02]: All time.

1971
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:06,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, that's crazy.

1972
02:11:07,433 --> 02:11:07,853
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1973
02:11:07,893 --> 02:11:09,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigger than Mario 3.

1974
02:11:09,896 --> 02:11:10,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Halo.

1975
02:11:10,256 --> 02:11:13,199
[SPEAKER_14]: They sold 5.6 million units day one.

1976
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:15,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Bigger than WoW?

1977
02:11:15,181 --> 02:11:16,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

1978
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:17,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Bigger than everything.

1979
02:11:17,704 --> 02:11:22,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, are you counting subscription base or are you counting true sales of the original expansions?

1980
02:11:23,406 --> 02:11:24,367
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 720 and a Wii 2 announcement at E3.

1981
02:11:43,366 --> 02:11:54,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has to do, and here's where they're coming from, it has to do with some tech demos that Epic is showing about the next-gen graphics because their whole Unreal Engine upgrade and all that.

1982
02:11:54,877 --> 02:12:05,427
[SPEAKER_02]: The Guardian in the UK is reporting that there is going to be a Wii 2 that will include a Blu-ray drive, a quad-core processor, and a built-in LED projector.

1983
02:12:05,847 --> 02:12:07,729
[SPEAKER_02]: The projector will display gameplay.

1984
02:12:08,789 --> 02:12:11,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't these the early rumors of the revolution?

1985
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:13,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That the 3D was going to be projected?

1986
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:17,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, funny enough, isn't it funny that we did end up getting 3D from Nintendo?

1987
02:12:17,931 --> 02:12:20,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't the Wii, it was the 3DS.

1988
02:12:20,512 --> 02:12:24,973
[SPEAKER_14]: The Guardian should not be a source for anything when it comes to consoles.

1989
02:12:25,313 --> 02:12:28,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Duh, there's going to... Sequel to successful console?

1990
02:12:29,174 --> 02:12:30,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

1991
02:12:30,335 --> 02:12:32,275
[SPEAKER_14]: There's going to be a new console for Nintendo?

1992
02:12:32,635 --> 02:12:34,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoa, I did not see that coming at all.

1993
02:12:34,896 --> 02:12:35,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this too.

1994
02:12:36,136 --> 02:12:51,634
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also the right time because Nintendo does console announcements every five years The Nintendo 64 in 96, the GameCube in 2001, and the Wii in 2006 So surely, Loki, surely the time is right for Wii 2

1995
02:12:52,495 --> 02:13:00,842
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we didn't become the super game analysts of the world for nothing, so let me just tell you how it's actually done, The Guardian.

1996
02:13:02,323 --> 02:13:09,730
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, they're trying to extend their console cycles now because, well, it sucks making a new console every few years.

1997
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:15,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, technology does get better, but graphics-wise, what are you going to really push now anyways?

1998
02:13:15,254 --> 02:13:18,517
[SPEAKER_14]: and they don't really care about graphics because they're Nintendo.

1999
02:13:19,838 --> 02:13:22,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would make the price of their console go up quite a bit.

2000
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:28,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, not to say that we're not going to see another Nintendo console that's the Wii.

2001
02:13:28,204 --> 02:13:37,692
[SPEAKER_14]: We may see something like we were seeing before that's kind of a next step like people were saying the Wii HD or something that may be a little bit more souped up.

2002
02:13:37,852 --> 02:13:40,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it going to have an LCD projector in it?

2003
02:13:41,014 --> 02:13:41,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

2004
02:13:41,935 --> 02:13:42,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's...

2005
02:13:43,436 --> 02:13:44,156
[SPEAKER_14]: That's stupid.

2006
02:13:45,137 --> 02:13:46,397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's just kind of weird.

2007
02:13:46,517 --> 02:13:48,178
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just ridiculous.

2008
02:13:48,618 --> 02:13:51,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would I need a projector on my console?

2009
02:13:51,239 --> 02:13:53,180
[SPEAKER_02]: To project things onto my naked body.

2010
02:13:56,721 --> 02:13:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a horrible, horrible thought.

2011
02:13:59,403 --> 02:14:00,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no words.

2012
02:14:01,410 --> 02:14:03,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario could jump up and down on my wang

2013
02:14:21,380 --> 02:14:30,262
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he took an LCD projector and respective cables and components and was able to project the image of the game on a blank wall.

2014
02:14:30,302 --> 02:14:32,543
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's because we had to take down posters.

2015
02:14:32,583 --> 02:14:36,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So a projector is going to need space, blank canvas to work on?

2016
02:14:36,664 --> 02:14:36,804
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2017
02:14:36,984 --> 02:14:37,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to happen.

2018
02:14:38,825 --> 02:14:40,025
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's dumb.

2019
02:14:40,325 --> 02:14:40,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2020
02:14:42,266 --> 02:14:43,406
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're not going to do that.

2021
02:14:44,026 --> 02:14:47,769
[SPEAKER_14]: and, you know, quad core processor or something like that.

2022
02:14:48,289 --> 02:14:48,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

2023
02:14:48,990 --> 02:14:49,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

2024
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:50,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Quad core processor?

2025
02:14:51,772 --> 02:14:54,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what you think the fastest thing is out there?

2026
02:14:54,333 --> 02:14:59,297
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, I mean, shit, the fucking 360 has more cores than that.

2027
02:14:59,631 --> 02:15:03,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo's main release, I think, this year is not the Wii 2 or the Wii Squared.

2028
02:15:03,334 --> 02:15:04,595
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the 3DS.

2029
02:15:05,016 --> 02:15:07,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what they're going to stick to.

2030
02:15:07,438 --> 02:15:12,842
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't need to even think about a new console until their system starts becoming number one.

2031
02:15:13,223 --> 02:15:14,164
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii is still popular.

2032
02:15:14,224 --> 02:15:15,765
[SPEAKER_09]: It's releasing still decent games.

2033
02:15:16,125 --> 02:15:16,806
[SPEAKER_09]: People are still buying it.

2034
02:15:16,846 --> 02:15:17,606
[SPEAKER_09]: People are still playing it.

2035
02:15:18,327 --> 02:15:19,388
[SPEAKER_09]: The 3DS is going to continue that.

2036
02:15:19,548 --> 02:15:26,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Now the thought is, of course, that they may want to try to get the jump on the next generation because 360 did have that jump and they did pretty well.

2037
02:15:28,813 --> 02:15:29,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2038
02:15:30,154 --> 02:15:33,996
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just not going to do some sort of Blu-ray crazy.

2039
02:15:34,276 --> 02:15:34,977
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't need to.

2040
02:15:34,997 --> 02:15:35,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

2041
02:15:35,217 --> 02:15:36,358
[SPEAKER_14]: For one, Sony owns Blu-rays.

2042
02:15:36,398 --> 02:15:37,358
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of weird.

2043
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:47,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I still think that the next gen of consoles, especially on the 360s, you're going to see a Blu-ray drive or you're going to see something that's not a DVD drive.

2044
02:15:47,525 --> 02:15:48,545
[SPEAKER_14]: They have to because of the capacity.

2045
02:15:48,666 --> 02:15:49,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because you just can't.

2046
02:15:50,347 --> 02:15:54,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Essex says, didn't they always say never to use projectors with games?

2047
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:57,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always the first line in the various instruction manuals.

2048
02:15:57,211 --> 02:16:00,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because of burn-in, but that's just old school projectors, I think.

2049
02:16:01,694 --> 02:16:09,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And even still, you're not going to want to do that because old school, even projectors nowadays, there's still some latency for that.

2050
02:16:10,882 --> 02:16:13,785
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, why would you even have a fucking projector on a console?

2051
02:16:13,805 --> 02:16:14,786
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes no sense.

2052
02:16:15,546 --> 02:16:18,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, to project Mario onto my naked body.

2053
02:16:18,989 --> 02:16:22,870
[SPEAKER_14]: It's seriously some guy making a story that, you know.

2054
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:23,511
[SPEAKER_14]: The cell tabloid.

2055
02:16:23,531 --> 02:16:24,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, seriously, the guardian.

2056
02:16:24,891 --> 02:16:25,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, come on.

2057
02:16:25,591 --> 02:16:29,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator in our chatroom says, Sky, that's a mental picture I seriously didn't need.

2058
02:16:29,653 --> 02:16:30,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2059
02:16:30,493 --> 02:16:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to bleach a mental picture out of one's mind?

2060
02:16:34,114 --> 02:16:35,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, just pour the bleach into your ears.

2061
02:16:35,695 --> 02:16:36,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2062
02:16:36,355 --> 02:16:37,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask you here.

2063
02:16:37,215 --> 02:16:37,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

2064
02:16:38,236 --> 02:16:42,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I present a little bit of Mario jumping on my wang.

2065
02:16:43,738 --> 02:16:43,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

2066
02:16:44,038 --> 02:16:45,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can get this.

2067
02:16:45,838 --> 02:16:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Project Mario here jumping on my wang.

2068
02:16:51,092 --> 02:16:51,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Really don't.

2069
02:16:51,654 --> 02:16:51,875
[SPEAKER_09]: OW!

2070
02:16:59,145 --> 02:16:59,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he jump on a ball?

2071
02:17:00,165 --> 02:17:04,026
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the shittiest NES rip of a game I've ever seen.

2072
02:17:04,126 --> 02:17:05,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking YouTube.

2073
02:17:06,667 --> 02:17:13,948
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but seriously, if they're going to do something with their next console or Wii, the next Wii or whatever, it's going to be just kind of an HD upgrade.

2074
02:17:14,008 --> 02:17:28,391
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be... I don't even think it would need to be necessarily on non-DVD platform because right now, I mean, fuck, they're not even really using dual-layer... There's like two games that have used dual-layer DVDs for the Wii.

2075
02:17:29,171 --> 02:17:31,533
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no real need to do that.

2076
02:17:31,593 --> 02:17:40,498
[SPEAKER_09]: In order for the Wii to be competitive, like for like, you need to throw in Blu-ray capacity and some type of body sensing motion device because that's what the two consoles have right now.

2077
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:42,980
[SPEAKER_09]: As Rob giggles like a little schoolgirl.

2078
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:45,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is the Wii squared to?

2079
02:17:45,982 --> 02:17:46,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not a projector.

2080
02:17:47,003 --> 02:17:49,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's like a connect thing.

2081
02:17:50,965 --> 02:17:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then they're already on par with their competition.

2082
02:17:54,427 --> 02:17:56,548
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd have to exceed their competition.

2083
02:17:56,728 --> 02:18:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is getting off of Star Trek in me, but if they did some type of holography or hologram or something like that instead of a projection, then they'd have something.

2084
02:18:03,351 --> 02:18:04,352
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, what would you use it for?

2085
02:18:04,852 --> 02:18:06,473
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, it's The Guardian.

2086
02:18:06,733 --> 02:18:07,773
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not really newsworthy.

2087
02:18:08,734 --> 02:18:09,254
[SPEAKER_09]: It's entertaining.

2088
02:18:09,514 --> 02:18:10,315
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2089
02:18:35,177 --> 02:18:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: They called the most popular console in America right now is called the Wii.

2090
02:18:41,393 --> 02:18:43,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what little girls do when they sit on the toilet.

2091
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:44,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They Wii.

2092
02:18:47,245 --> 02:18:48,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the commercials when it came out.

2093
02:18:48,406 --> 02:18:50,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Those two creepy Asian guys would come up.

2094
02:18:50,667 --> 02:18:51,567
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to play.

2095
02:18:51,587 --> 02:18:54,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, whoa, this game's for pedophiles or something like that.

2096
02:18:55,129 --> 02:18:56,570
[SPEAKER_09]: This console's a little bit weird.

2097
02:18:57,230 --> 02:19:00,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it was motion controlled and hilarity ensued.

2098
02:19:01,973 --> 02:19:04,914
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you call the red ring of death on a console called Bacon?

2099
02:19:04,994 --> 02:19:06,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2100
02:19:06,595 --> 02:19:08,516
[SPEAKER_09]: There's got to be some type of joke there someplace.

2101
02:19:08,576 --> 02:19:09,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not coming to me.

2102
02:19:09,316 --> 02:19:13,899
[SPEAKER_14]: There would never be a ring or red on any Microsoft console going forward.

2103
02:19:13,919 --> 02:19:14,999
[SPEAKER_02]: A Jewish Xbox?

2104
02:19:17,655 --> 02:19:18,836
[SPEAKER_09]: This Xbox is kosher!

2105
02:19:23,119 --> 02:19:24,059
[SPEAKER_09]: It's made by Jewish monks.

2106
02:19:24,179 --> 02:19:25,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I tease because I love.

2107
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:26,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, people.

2108
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:26,681
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2109
02:19:27,401 --> 02:19:36,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could say something about, well, there is job postings at Microsoft looking for hardware engineers to, quote, define and deliver next-generation console architectures.

2110
02:19:36,947 --> 02:19:38,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no shit they're making a new Xbox.

2111
02:19:39,048 --> 02:19:40,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't mean it's coming out at E3 this year.

2112
02:19:41,590 --> 02:19:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: These things are going to be, like, four years out, you know?

2113
02:19:44,272 --> 02:19:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a while.

2114
02:19:45,652 --> 02:19:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

2115
02:19:47,253 --> 02:19:50,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think Apple is rumored to release some type of a gaming console?

2116
02:19:50,634 --> 02:19:53,795
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of buzz in the whole Apple world.

2117
02:19:53,855 --> 02:19:56,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's called the iPad.

2118
02:19:56,376 --> 02:19:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their gaming console.

2119
02:19:57,997 --> 02:19:58,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, people.

2120
02:19:58,717 --> 02:20:00,578
[SPEAKER_14]: That's retarded, first off.

2121
02:20:00,698 --> 02:20:04,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, goody, I get to plug an HDMI cable into my iPad and be tethered to my TV.

2122
02:20:06,843 --> 02:20:07,203
[SPEAKER_14]: No thanks.

2123
02:20:07,744 --> 02:20:11,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and I'm sure that cable cost you $40 to make, fuckers.

2124
02:20:12,346 --> 02:20:11,646
$30.

2125
02:20:13,067 --> 02:20:14,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my mistake, $30.

2126
02:20:14,448 --> 02:20:15,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that totally makes sense.

2127
02:20:15,688 --> 02:20:16,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I bought one.

2128
02:20:16,189 --> 02:20:19,811
[SPEAKER_14]: A piece of cable that's like a few feet long.

2129
02:20:19,851 --> 02:20:21,792
[SPEAKER_14]: What, like six feet?

2130
02:20:22,312 --> 02:20:22,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the size.

2131
02:20:22,952 --> 02:20:33,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $29.99 for the HD adapter thing to send in 1080p from the pad to a compatible TV.

2132
02:20:34,184 --> 02:20:40,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to credit AkumaJP in our chatroom for this comment, but perhaps this could be the sequel to the Nintendo Wii, could be this.

2133
02:20:42,868 --> 02:20:43,848
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an awfully jolly lady.

2134
02:21:01,897 --> 02:21:08,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting on a toilet, sitting on a toilet, sitting on a toilet, now flush The Nintendo Flush, this year at E3 It's videos like that that keep me gay

2135
02:21:34,116 --> 02:21:35,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, why do you do this to me?

2136
02:21:35,777 --> 02:21:36,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we were friends.

2137
02:21:36,497 --> 02:21:37,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the chatters.

2138
02:21:37,437 --> 02:21:38,397
[SPEAKER_02]: The chatters said it.

2139
02:21:38,798 --> 02:21:39,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But you played it.

2140
02:21:39,778 --> 02:21:42,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every gamer has a voice, even that lady.

2141
02:21:43,239 --> 02:21:53,063
[SPEAKER_09]: She's one of those challenge people that probably couldn't use the Kinect because she'd be sitting on the toilet and have minimal body movement for the Kinect.

2142
02:21:54,923 --> 02:21:55,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Lord.

2143
02:21:57,784 --> 02:21:59,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to go home and favorite that now.

2144
02:22:00,445 --> 02:22:00,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty awesome.

2145
02:22:00,965 --> 02:22:01,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Spread it around.

2146
02:22:02,626 --> 02:22:03,106
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta admit.

2147
02:22:05,989 --> 02:22:09,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to find the 8-bit remix of that song to prove that she plays video games, but...

2148
02:22:10,370 --> 02:22:12,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I guess it's not on YouTube anymore, whatever.

2149
02:22:12,751 --> 02:22:16,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, I guess we can open up the Skype line now and take some calls.

2150
02:22:16,053 --> 02:22:19,756
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2151
02:22:20,756 --> 02:22:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a call, we'll talk about whatever it is you want to talk about tonight.

2152
02:22:24,258 --> 02:22:28,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's gaming related, but if you want to talk about sitting on the toilet, then more power to you.

2153
02:22:28,481 --> 02:22:30,202
[SPEAKER_14]: So the phones are open right now, let's take some calls.

2154
02:22:30,482 --> 02:22:32,383
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd rather you didn't talk about sitting on the toilet.

2155
02:22:32,443 --> 02:22:34,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, so let's go to some calls.

2156
02:22:34,985 --> 02:22:36,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2157
02:22:37,065 --> 02:22:40,087
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that one, Ake Ripper from Sweden.

2158
02:22:40,327 --> 02:22:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Ake Ripper?

2159
02:22:41,447 --> 02:22:42,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard from you in a while.

2160
02:22:42,468 --> 02:22:42,948
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

2161
02:22:43,648 --> 02:22:47,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I have been away or... Oh, no, I haven't been away.

2162
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:50,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I've just been sleeping like when you're on.

2163
02:22:51,652 --> 02:22:53,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, so... No worries.

2164
02:22:53,893 --> 02:22:54,534
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind tonight?

2165
02:22:55,478 --> 02:22:56,318
[SPEAKER_11]: What was I going to say?

2166
02:22:56,398 --> 02:23:00,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I could talk about Dragon Age 2, which I have already finished.

2167
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:01,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, what did you think?

2168
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:04,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It's marvelous.

2169
02:23:04,761 --> 02:23:09,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, the minor story behind it, well, I got it on, what was it, Wednesday?

2170
02:23:11,863 --> 02:23:16,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday, and I got it pretty early, because it locked up.

2171
02:23:17,805 --> 02:23:21,186
[SPEAKER_11]: It was unlocked at midnight to Thursday, my time.

2172
02:23:21,826 --> 02:23:24,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So, like, what is it, at 3 o'clock

2173
02:23:25,627 --> 02:23:51,236
[SPEAKER_11]: on Wednesday your time I think it is uh-huh and uh get on lock yeah yeah yada yada uh and like well well it's like 40 or 50 hours later I beat it and it was quite nice yeah really it's thumbs up do you recommend it um I do recommend it highly how was the lovemaking huh how was the lovemaking

2174
02:23:52,827 --> 02:23:55,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite nice, I do say.

2175
02:23:56,389 --> 02:23:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite nice.

2176
02:23:58,450 --> 02:24:00,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a nice.

2177
02:24:00,951 --> 02:24:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite a nice.

2178
02:24:03,693 --> 02:24:05,494
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the other thing, though.

2179
02:24:06,074 --> 02:24:09,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Since, really, I almost... But here's the other thing.

2180
02:24:11,077 --> 02:24:16,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I did make love to one of the characters, but here's the other thing, though.

2181
02:24:16,661 --> 02:24:16,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I...

2182
02:24:17,561 --> 02:24:31,866
[SPEAKER_11]: What, I, since really, really, really, these love scenes in both Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins and Origins 1 is awkward beyond fucking awkward!

2183
02:24:33,926 --> 02:24:38,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't even want to see, I close my eyes!

2184
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:45,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2185
02:24:45,742 --> 02:24:46,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2186
02:24:46,403 --> 02:24:52,048
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell?

2187
02:24:52,408 --> 02:24:55,171
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best video game review we've ever had on this show.

2188
02:24:56,392 --> 02:24:57,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to be here present for this.

2189
02:25:02,577 --> 02:25:07,382
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, it really is a kick-assing ass game.

2190
02:25:08,920 --> 02:25:23,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, a bit shorter than the first Origins, but it's on par with Mass Effect 2, and maybe even longer than Mass Effect 2 on second thought, so...

2191
02:25:25,444 --> 02:25:27,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would say really bye.

2192
02:25:27,806 --> 02:25:35,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, it really makes up for wondering, yeah, how the fuck will they continue this?

2193
02:25:35,915 --> 02:25:47,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though, one of the comments that I found on Twitter is that the whole story in Dragon Age 2 is like an origin story, if that makes sense.

2194
02:25:49,989 --> 02:25:51,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Overall, yeah, so thumbs up.

2195
02:25:52,490 --> 02:25:58,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Tactics Orger has finally been released, and that's quite funny.

2196
02:25:59,493 --> 02:26:06,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, on side notes, as usual, I play as a girl character because...

2197
02:26:07,357 --> 02:26:09,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't... Because here's the other thing, though.

2198
02:26:09,478 --> 02:26:25,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even like playing as a male character because, well, hello, I'm one of those trannies, whatever, that's not... If I even would choose... I don't even want to be a man, and I don't want to be a girl, either.

2199
02:26:25,245 --> 02:26:35,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't even necessarily have anything to do with it, though, because I like to play... All of my characters in World of Warcraft are women, and that's just because people are nicer to you because they think you have big boobs sitting there behind the monitor.

2200
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:39,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally like selfish reasons, like, you know.

2201
02:26:41,152 --> 02:26:41,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in a way.

2202
02:26:42,612 --> 02:26:45,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, yeah, and yeah.

2203
02:26:45,874 --> 02:27:02,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, in a kind of way, there are, I should point out also, I play as usual, I play, I was on the difficulty settings of casual, which means that I in one way breeze it through and was all like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

2204
02:27:03,683 --> 02:27:04,544
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the other thing, though.

2205
02:27:04,844 --> 02:27:11,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though if you play on casual, you will actually have minor problems.

2206
02:27:11,847 --> 02:27:13,668
[SPEAKER_11]: On two places, though.

2207
02:27:15,589 --> 02:27:29,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I did have problems on two places, but after all I did some thoughts on two things, and was like, yeah, it's not that hard, really.

2208
02:27:29,756 --> 02:27:33,418
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will be kind of hard in some places.

2209
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:36,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't blame you for playing on the easiest level.

2210
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:41,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Torchlight on the easiest level, because I just want to jam through the game and kind of see everything that's there.

2211
02:27:41,606 --> 02:27:46,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes you just want to kind of take in the story, or in some cases, get straight to the lovemaking.

2212
02:27:47,653 --> 02:27:49,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but also...

2213
02:27:51,477 --> 02:28:09,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, since I've seen the ending to Dragon Age 2, it makes me wonder, it makes me actually want to replay Origins, so my warden can make love to a certain character.

2214
02:28:11,202 --> 02:28:17,584
[SPEAKER_11]: So to set up certain things in Origins 2.

2215
02:28:17,904 --> 02:28:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go back and get the right characters to fall in love so that the lovemaking can continue in 2 now.

2216
02:28:22,425 --> 02:28:23,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the STDs.

2217
02:28:23,206 --> 02:28:26,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, can you pass STDs from one game to another?

2218
02:28:26,226 --> 02:28:30,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Aki Ripper, to be quite honest, I don't ever want this call to end.

2219
02:28:31,248 --> 02:28:32,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, before I go, also...

2220
02:28:36,970 --> 02:28:42,635
[SPEAKER_11]: There has been released a new trailer for apparently two expansions on Sims games.

2221
02:28:43,255 --> 02:28:43,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, yes.

2222
02:28:44,336 --> 02:28:54,225
[SPEAKER_11]: One apparently animal expansion for the console version, and then we have called, like, what is it, Sims 3 Pets or something?

2223
02:28:54,385 --> 02:28:54,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2224
02:28:54,745 --> 02:28:58,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have some Sims 3 Generations.

2225
02:28:58,688 --> 02:28:59,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2226
02:28:59,676 --> 02:29:01,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is apparently for the PC version.

2227
02:29:02,698 --> 02:29:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, though, there has been no signs of weather effects.

2228
02:29:06,821 --> 02:29:10,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a bit sad, because I do want weather effects.

2229
02:29:10,323 --> 02:29:11,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's the other thing, though.

2230
02:29:12,044 --> 02:29:17,488
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes interesting, because, well, raising kids in Sims is quite fun.

2231
02:29:18,268 --> 02:29:21,611
[SPEAKER_11]: And with this expansion, it will expand that.

2232
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:24,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think there'll be a Sims 4 anytime soon?

2233
02:29:26,627 --> 02:29:27,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Not likely.

2234
02:29:28,708 --> 02:29:29,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that it seems so.

2235
02:29:30,788 --> 02:29:43,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, side note, they don't say any date for the Generations 1, but for the Animal Expansion on console, it said November 2011.

2236
02:29:43,832 --> 02:29:44,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

2237
02:29:47,972 --> 02:29:48,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2238
02:29:48,573 --> 02:29:53,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I gotta let you go so I can get to some of the calls because I got people from PAX East that are just dying to get through.

2239
02:29:53,379 --> 02:29:57,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you need to have a video game review podcast.

2240
02:29:57,224 --> 02:29:59,627
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to think about it.

2241
02:30:00,508 --> 02:30:01,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on!

2242
02:30:01,209 --> 02:30:01,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care, buddy.

2243
02:30:02,410 --> 02:30:03,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, later.

2244
02:30:03,191 --> 02:30:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2245
02:30:05,751 --> 02:30:06,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is he from again?

2246
02:30:06,752 --> 02:30:07,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweden.

2247
02:30:07,433 --> 02:30:08,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Sweden.

2248
02:30:27,533 --> 02:30:47,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do a rare outbound call because I promised these guys they could get through and it's about PAX East so I want to do this call real quick if I can sorry to those folks trying to get through right now but I did promise this call because I want to talk to at least one person that went to PAX East this week we'll do some more incoming calls in a minute just hold on hold on guys

2249
02:30:53,056 --> 02:31:04,442
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, a question in the chat room if I've played Mortal Kombat Hey, it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio Hello It's Rob from Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2250
02:31:05,363 --> 02:31:13,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's DJ Ranma S and DDR Gollum Bill Hey you guys, some of our regular callers here at Orange Launch Radio But I know you guys went to PAX East, right?

2251
02:31:15,809 --> 02:31:18,030
[SPEAKER_02]: So fucking tell us about it, what happened, what'd you see?

2252
02:31:19,272 --> 02:31:23,514
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great, but Rob, before we continue, there's one thing you need to know.

2253
02:31:23,614 --> 02:31:23,854
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2254
02:31:24,295 --> 02:31:24,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2255
02:31:25,415 --> 02:31:29,557
[SPEAKER_03]: The anime title, SLCL, it's called Fuli Kuli.

2256
02:31:30,478 --> 02:31:31,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my bad.

2257
02:31:32,299 --> 02:31:36,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm not, you know, cultured enough to know these things.

2258
02:31:36,581 --> 02:31:37,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

2259
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:37,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that.

2260
02:31:39,062 --> 02:31:39,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

2261
02:31:39,623 --> 02:31:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgive you.

2262
02:31:40,723 --> 02:31:41,143
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2263
02:31:42,344 --> 02:31:43,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned something here on the show tonight.

2264
02:31:43,725 --> 02:31:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about PAX East already.

2265
02:31:44,845 --> 02:31:45,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about that damn anime.

2266
02:31:47,352 --> 02:31:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Rob, I played the 3DS, it's fucking awesome, yeah

2267
02:32:09,734 --> 02:32:11,155
[SPEAKER_03]: No, doesn't matter at all.

2268
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:12,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the technology, right?

2269
02:32:12,656 --> 02:32:19,161
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time you see it, it's kind of, did you do that thing where you looked at it and then you went, whoa, whoa, this is like real.

2270
02:32:20,802 --> 02:32:33,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and the funny thing is, back where I used to live, where I used to get my monthly bus passes, they actually had a 3D effect similar to the 3D screen, so I was automatically used to it.

2271
02:32:34,131 --> 02:32:34,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2272
02:32:34,991 --> 02:32:35,912
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you get to play on it?

2273
02:32:37,148 --> 02:32:39,629
[SPEAKER_03]: The Legend of Zelda The Ocarina of Time And what did you think?

2274
02:32:41,050 --> 02:33:06,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great Now here's something I don't know if you've covered it Because the stream was dropping As we were traveling But when you play with When you grab the slingshot You can actually move the 3DS around For targeting in the game See these are some of the new features Oh that's it I have to totally buy this Rehash of a 64 game Because they have motion controls now Oh It's different

2275
02:33:07,685 --> 02:33:11,669
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been hatin' for a couple weeks now, it's alright.

2276
02:33:11,689 --> 02:33:15,012
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, did you hear the part where he's ordered both a Japanese and an American 3DS?

2277
02:33:26,175 --> 02:33:28,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, but Alpha Conagrin, he was, he was like, it was amazing.

2278
02:33:28,677 --> 02:33:28,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

2279
02:33:28,837 --> 02:33:29,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that look of like, fucking orgasm.

2280
02:33:29,878 --> 02:33:30,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

2281
02:33:50,873 --> 02:33:51,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course!

2282
02:34:17,390 --> 02:34:17,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2283
02:34:18,210 --> 02:34:19,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course everybody's going to be playing that.

2284
02:34:19,491 --> 02:34:21,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check out the Classic Gaming Room while you were there?

2285
02:34:22,452 --> 02:34:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got in there for a little bit.

2286
02:34:23,872 --> 02:34:25,773
[SPEAKER_03]: It had all of your favorite games in there too.

2287
02:34:26,653 --> 02:34:26,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2288
02:34:27,573 --> 02:34:28,294
[SPEAKER_02]: What about panels?

2289
02:34:28,334 --> 02:34:30,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you spend any time going to a panel or anything?

2290
02:34:31,275 --> 02:34:33,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the video game music panels.

2291
02:34:34,035 --> 02:34:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to one about OC Remix where two of the composers did live the opening to Final Fantasy VI.

2292
02:34:41,698 --> 02:34:42,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's hot.

2293
02:34:43,478 --> 02:34:43,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2294
02:34:43,859 --> 02:34:45,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that as awesome as it sounds?

2295
02:34:47,093 --> 02:34:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that as awesome as it sounds?

2296
02:34:53,499 --> 02:34:53,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2297
02:34:54,279 --> 02:34:55,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

2298
02:34:55,440 --> 02:34:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so what was like the best thing about PAX East altogether?

2299
02:34:59,603 --> 02:35:03,386
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

2300
02:35:17,064 --> 02:35:18,966
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the demo for Duke Nukem Forever like?

2301
02:35:20,228 --> 02:35:21,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there titties?

2302
02:35:33,459 --> 02:35:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Real life titties, yes.

2303
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:35,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2304
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:37,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, wait.

2305
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:42,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking about Duke Nukem Forever still or are we talking about like you just saw titties in the expo hall like randomly?

2306
02:35:42,482 --> 02:35:44,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the booth babes, my brother.

2307
02:35:44,982 --> 02:35:46,022
[SPEAKER_02]: The booth babes.

2308
02:35:46,182 --> 02:35:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the booth babes.

2309
02:35:48,543 --> 02:35:48,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2310
02:35:50,684 --> 02:35:53,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anything else you want to get out about PAX East before I get to more calls?

2311
02:35:54,505 --> 02:35:55,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

2312
02:35:56,185 --> 02:35:59,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it to come because as we were hanging out Saturday night,

2313
02:36:00,509 --> 02:36:03,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it was laid out, it was not really stressful.

2314
02:36:03,930 --> 02:36:06,871
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of revitalized the reason why I go to conventions.

2315
02:36:07,431 --> 02:36:12,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, there was no appointment per se set up for demos.

2316
02:36:13,093 --> 02:36:20,535
[SPEAKER_03]: You could email them, and they would email you back if you wanted time to come in to check out particular products and games.

2317
02:36:20,955 --> 02:36:28,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But even though I was pressed, you had to wait just like everybody else, except on Saturday, where you were allowed in an hour early.

2318
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:32,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't do that because we had to drop off Misty and Alpha Cananagram at the train station and the airport.

2319
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:55,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, bummer.

2320
02:36:56,122 --> 02:36:58,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, maybe somebody in chat will yell it out.

2321
02:36:58,266 --> 02:36:59,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's hit the internet somewhere.

2322
02:37:00,835 --> 02:37:02,516
[SPEAKER_03]: and OLR Invasion next year.

2323
02:37:02,556 --> 02:37:06,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, PAX East 2012, OLRCon.

2324
02:37:06,278 --> 02:37:14,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be you, me, DarkSakura, Loki, DDR Dollar Bill, Misty, Alpha Cananogram, Zaku, the whole crew.

2325
02:37:14,743 --> 02:37:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting a suite.

2326
02:37:15,984 --> 02:37:17,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting some alcohol.

2327
02:37:17,404 --> 02:37:18,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bringing the 360s.

2328
02:37:18,505 --> 02:37:20,086
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to jury rig the TV.

2329
02:37:20,266 --> 02:37:22,327
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get our gaming on.

2330
02:37:22,467 --> 02:37:22,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And boobs.

2331
02:37:22,968 --> 02:37:23,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

2332
02:37:23,688 --> 02:37:24,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2333
02:37:26,277 --> 02:37:27,517
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, you guys have fun.

2334
02:37:27,557 --> 02:37:32,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe on your drive back, and thanks for letting me bug you, even though you're on the show every week anyway, Ranma.

2335
02:37:33,059 --> 02:37:34,980
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, later, guys.

2336
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:36,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, DDR Dollar Bill.

2337
02:37:37,261 --> 02:37:37,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive safe.

2338
02:37:38,601 --> 02:37:39,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I said later, DDR Dollar Bill, too.

2339
02:37:39,961 --> 02:37:40,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive safe, you guys.

2340
02:37:42,522 --> 02:37:42,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2341
02:37:44,663 --> 02:37:44,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2342
02:37:44,903 --> 02:37:45,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some more calls.

2343
02:37:46,764 --> 02:37:47,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2344
02:37:47,584 --> 02:37:47,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2345
02:37:48,564 --> 02:37:49,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Zaku here.

2346
02:37:49,444 --> 02:37:50,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Zaku, buddy.

2347
02:37:50,345 --> 02:37:50,925
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2348
02:37:52,045 --> 02:37:55,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, I also, I too also went to PAX with Adam.

2349
02:37:55,926 --> 02:37:56,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome!

2350
02:37:56,546 --> 02:37:57,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Also known as Rama.

2351
02:37:57,646 --> 02:38:06,548
[SPEAKER_10]: You were also, uh... Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure, it was my first PAX, but at least, at least I was able to, you know, to pull off a decent trip to Boston.

2352
02:38:08,269 --> 02:38:12,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though it was like, the way I see it is this, what the fuck?

2353
02:38:15,441 --> 02:38:15,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

2354
02:38:15,941 --> 02:38:17,182
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of PAX East?

2355
02:38:17,202 --> 02:38:17,862
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you play?

2356
02:38:17,882 --> 02:38:26,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I was saying is that, yeah, I mean, you know, I did try to partake in most of the things, you know, on the show floor, but they were just like, the lines were too long.

2357
02:38:26,845 --> 02:38:32,247
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, there was no way I was going to spend two hours waiting to see what's inside the L.A.

2358
02:38:32,267 --> 02:38:34,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Knorr booth, let alone the Battlefield 3 one.

2359
02:38:35,247 --> 02:38:42,910
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, just quickly, I know Adam Perfect, he endured whatever he did to see the 3DS, but it was just like,

2360
02:38:43,470 --> 02:38:44,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Pax is a poor man's E3

2361
02:38:59,212 --> 02:38:59,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

2362
02:38:59,812 --> 02:39:12,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, compared to all the other cons I've been to, you know, even the ones I've been to in the Javits Center in New York, this was by far one of the largest I've ever been to.

2363
02:39:12,975 --> 02:39:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I gotta say, you know, the East Coast sadly doesn't get a lot.

2364
02:39:16,116 --> 02:39:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not surprised at all that everybody comes in.

2365
02:39:19,136 --> 02:39:23,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So PAX does fill that void for folks that can't actually make it out to E3.

2366
02:39:24,538 --> 02:39:25,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like...

2367
02:39:26,638 --> 02:39:36,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It's creating that whole experience, that experience itself, without having to go on the other side of the country.

2368
02:39:36,641 --> 02:39:44,463
[SPEAKER_10]: But more to my point, I did cosplay on Saturday, and I'm just trying to upload the picture I took personally.

2369
02:39:45,063 --> 02:39:49,264
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I post for several pictures, some for media, but I didn't make Kotaku's role.

2370
02:39:49,865 --> 02:39:50,965
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll upload mine.

2371
02:39:51,445 --> 02:39:52,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me ask you quickly.

2372
02:39:52,546 --> 02:39:54,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take it back to the games a little bit.

2373
02:39:54,967 --> 02:39:58,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the lines were long, I'm assuming you got your hands on some things, right?

2374
02:39:58,528 --> 02:39:59,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, some.

2375
02:39:59,389 --> 02:40:05,412
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't say a lot, but it's like I was just going from some booths.

2376
02:40:05,752 --> 02:40:08,113
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you play that's worth talking about right now?

2377
02:40:08,733 --> 02:40:09,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.

2378
02:40:09,374 --> 02:40:11,855
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even think off the top of my head.

2379
02:40:11,895 --> 02:40:12,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Homefront.

2380
02:40:12,415 --> 02:40:12,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Homefront, yeah.

2381
02:40:14,585 --> 02:40:19,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much, that's definitely one thing I'm going to buy on Tuesday.

2382
02:40:20,113 --> 02:40:23,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for PC that is, but the 360 version is just as good.

2383
02:40:26,124 --> 02:40:30,588
[SPEAKER_10]: That was what I was able to get my hands on without having to wait hours in line.

2384
02:40:31,649 --> 02:40:39,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the major titles there, you're going to spend hours just going through two or three of them.

2385
02:40:39,957 --> 02:40:42,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to cut into most of your day on the show floor.

2386
02:40:42,940 --> 02:40:44,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get to do any other of the sights and sounds of E3?

2387
02:40:44,942 --> 02:40:47,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I went to the harmonics panel.

2388
02:40:47,624 --> 02:40:48,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, how was that?

2389
02:40:48,325 --> 02:40:48,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Saturday.

2390
02:40:50,176 --> 02:40:55,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they comment on the whole sale from MTV and all that?

2391
02:40:56,759 --> 02:41:10,326
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was just like, well, what they did was like a reverse Q&A where they actually, you know, where the panel asked questions to, you know, the fans that lined up to speak.

2392
02:41:10,946 --> 02:41:15,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was basically asked a question on, you know, how to deal with, like, asshole...

2393
02:41:16,909 --> 02:41:24,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, fans that complain about some of the most obvious and unrealistic things about the game.

2394
02:41:25,117 --> 02:41:31,763
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I was basically asked my opinion on that particular subject.

2395
02:41:31,783 --> 02:41:32,323
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you say?

2396
02:41:32,343 --> 02:41:36,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I managed to relate it to the DDR scene.

2397
02:41:36,647 --> 02:41:38,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my local DDR scene.

2398
02:41:38,049 --> 02:41:41,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pretty much got a pretty good ovation out of it.

2399
02:41:41,412 --> 02:41:41,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

2400
02:41:42,655 --> 02:41:47,557
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was recorded live, I'm pretty sure my comment was up there.

2401
02:41:49,438 --> 02:41:52,899
[SPEAKER_10]: If the panel mentions a military zombie, that was me.

2402
02:41:53,519 --> 02:41:55,120
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you going back to PAX next year?

2403
02:41:55,940 --> 02:42:02,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, this time I have to stay in the hotel right next to the con.

2404
02:42:02,743 --> 02:42:04,083
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'll definitely do it.

2405
02:42:04,143 --> 02:42:10,066
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that I may have to take that day off, that Friday off, just to get...

2406
02:42:10,746 --> 02:42:12,267
[SPEAKER_10]: just to get my hands on the show early.

2407
02:42:12,287 --> 02:42:15,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a whole week off to go to E3, although I'm probably not going this year.

2408
02:42:15,568 --> 02:42:17,188
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, it's a lot.

2409
02:42:18,129 --> 02:42:21,550
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, Zacho, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but I'm glad to hear you had a good time at the show.

2410
02:42:21,970 --> 02:42:25,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you can get your hands on all the good stuff, sounds like you found a few gems in there somewhere.

2411
02:42:25,991 --> 02:42:26,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, sure did.

2412
02:42:26,791 --> 02:42:28,372
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, hopefully see you next year.

2413
02:42:29,332 --> 02:42:30,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely Alright, later Bye

2414
02:42:47,586 --> 02:42:48,227
[SPEAKER_09]: New York is a lot of fun

2415
02:43:08,562 --> 02:43:11,623
[SPEAKER_02]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2416
02:43:11,643 --> 02:43:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

2417
02:43:12,023 --> 02:43:13,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually only do three, but I'm feeling generous tonight.

2418
02:43:13,944 --> 02:43:14,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do one more call.

2419
02:43:16,225 --> 02:43:17,985
[SPEAKER_02]: While we wait for a call... Oh, call's coming in right now.

2420
02:43:18,405 --> 02:43:19,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll go to it.

2421
02:43:19,266 --> 02:43:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2422
02:43:20,166 --> 02:43:20,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

2423
02:43:21,546 --> 02:43:22,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is Baz in here.

2424
02:43:23,127 --> 02:43:23,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, buddy.

2425
02:43:23,487 --> 02:43:24,027
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

2426
02:43:25,808 --> 02:43:33,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to be different this week, rather than talking about videos, I'll be touching on MMOs this time.

2427
02:43:33,450 --> 02:43:34,271
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, MMOs.

2428
02:43:35,391 --> 02:43:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, specifically two of them.

2429
02:43:38,921 --> 02:44:08,020
[SPEAKER_08]: DC Universe Online and Final Fantasy XI yeah mainly because you guys kind of touched on them earlier so well one thing that wasn't mentioned that is kind of interesting if not is that supposedly at least with DC Universe Online sometime within the near future I think within the next month or two

2430
02:44:08,820 --> 02:44:35,941
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a digital download version appearing on the PSN store I had heard of that, that they're going to do a full digital download Which wouldn't be too unrealistic I mean, Xbox 360 does something similar already with some of the games I believe PlayStation has a handful of games you can buy I want to say one of them was day and date of Street Release War of Warcraft, the latest expansion was full digital download as well Which was awesome

2431
02:44:36,021 --> 02:44:39,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, some doing that has ups and downs depending on how you look at it.

2432
02:44:39,102 --> 02:44:40,182
[SPEAKER_02]: On one hand, yeah, there's...

2433
02:45:05,854 --> 02:45:09,197
[SPEAKER_08]: The convenience factor, no doubt about that.

2434
02:45:12,519 --> 02:45:23,468
[SPEAKER_08]: At least with the beta that went on, granted it was beta, not the full retail releases, obviously there's going to be differences.

2435
02:45:24,168 --> 02:45:29,332
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least with the beta, that was a pretty freaking huge file.

2436
02:45:29,512 --> 02:45:33,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was like, what, ballpark figure of 15 gigabytes?

2437
02:45:35,016 --> 02:45:35,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It was huge.

2438
02:45:36,717 --> 02:45:47,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and even if you got a pretty hefty hard drive inside your system, there's still a good chunk of your hard drive dedicated to one game.

2439
02:45:50,963 --> 02:46:00,447
[SPEAKER_08]: But hopefully most PS3 owners have already, at least at one point or another, already upgraded their hard drive at least once.

2440
02:46:00,467 --> 02:46:02,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you want to say about Final Fantasy XIV?

2441
02:46:03,951 --> 02:46:05,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, actually 11, not 14.

2442
02:46:05,372 --> 02:46:05,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, 11.

2443
02:46:06,673 --> 02:46:22,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but, well, you know how you were mentioning that, at least temporarily speaking, that they're going to be shutting down the servers for the game because of the recent earthquake?

2444
02:46:23,107 --> 02:46:24,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2445
02:46:24,609 --> 02:46:32,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, just prior to that earthquake hitting, they had made an announcement saying,

2446
02:46:33,191 --> 02:46:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're already going to be like consolidating some of the servers.

2447
02:46:39,175 --> 02:46:39,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

2448
02:46:40,015 --> 02:46:44,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually the sign for the MMO that things are going downhill.

2449
02:46:44,197 --> 02:46:46,659
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what, though?

2450
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:47,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

2451
02:46:47,179 --> 02:46:55,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI's had a good run and Sony did kind of probably siphon some of the players with the release of XIV.

2452
02:46:55,623 --> 02:46:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of cannibalized XI a little bit.

2453
02:46:59,165 --> 02:46:59,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well...

2454
02:47:01,266 --> 02:47:09,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I hate to mention a rival podcast, but this is where I got the information from.

2455
02:47:10,249 --> 02:47:18,351
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a podcast that's dedicated to Final Fantasy XI called Limit Break Radio.

2456
02:47:18,911 --> 02:47:20,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard of that show.

2457
02:47:20,752 --> 02:47:28,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had a very small podcast, their most recent entry was

2458
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:31,761
[SPEAKER_08]: for that show on their website.

2459
02:47:33,342 --> 02:47:44,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The main host had mentioned that the first time they consolidated the servers, there was a need for it then.

2460
02:47:44,831 --> 02:47:51,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they could see what they did, but the second round of consolidation of servers, they

2461
02:47:52,659 --> 02:48:14,810
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't see what the logic behind that was, because once this new round of consolidation goes through, the servers would probably actually be overpopulated, and for those trying to do the endgame kind of thing, it's going to be a lot more difficult for those people, because the competition for the...

2462
02:48:17,912 --> 02:48:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be worried that they're going to hemorrhage more users because of some of the other MMOs that are out, you know, just with Rift and DC Universe and so on.

2463
02:48:26,278 --> 02:48:27,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're just worried.

2464
02:48:27,298 --> 02:48:28,819
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of being proactive, I suppose.

2465
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:42,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it's kind of sad to see Final Fantasy XI going to throat for the reasons that you just mentioned, because

2466
02:48:43,126 --> 02:48:45,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like foreboding.

2467
02:48:46,170 --> 02:48:50,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, I haven't played the game in a year or two now because of financial reasons.

2468
02:48:51,587 --> 02:48:59,454
[SPEAKER_08]: but I was always hoping that eventually once I was able to I could get back into the game because I love the game so much.

2469
02:48:59,615 --> 02:49:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll always be at least one server up.

2470
02:49:01,556 --> 02:49:02,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Final Fantasy game.

2471
02:49:02,798 --> 02:49:03,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll never die completely.

2472
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:12,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to ask you real quick before I let you go since you brought up MMOs and I know you're big on Sony products and Sony fanboy and all that and you like free things.

2473
02:49:12,887 --> 02:49:16,591
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the announcement of Free Realms coming to PlayStation 3?

2474
02:49:18,464 --> 02:49:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I really haven't formed an opinion as of yet because, honestly, I haven't played three rounds either on the PS3 because it hasn't come out yet for it.

2475
02:49:31,346 --> 02:49:41,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just got my computer not even two months ago and it just barely runs some games, albeit poorly.

2476
02:49:43,328 --> 02:49:46,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So until I actually play something, I can't really...

2477
02:49:48,157 --> 02:49:50,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm willing to at least give it a try.

2478
02:49:50,538 --> 02:49:56,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what, once I give it a try, let's see, for a multitude, I'll either send an email or call in and

2479
02:50:10,655 --> 02:50:12,557
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially give a mini review of it.

2480
02:50:12,837 --> 02:50:13,177
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2481
02:50:13,557 --> 02:50:16,540
[SPEAKER_08]: That way I can be a little bit more fair and be honest about it.

2482
02:50:16,860 --> 02:50:17,220
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2483
02:50:17,461 --> 02:50:18,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be looking to hear from you.

2484
02:50:19,202 --> 02:50:19,422
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2485
02:50:19,442 --> 02:50:21,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2486
02:50:21,904 --> 02:50:22,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But have a good one, buddy.

2487
02:50:23,726 --> 02:50:23,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2488
02:50:23,926 --> 02:50:24,306
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

2489
02:50:24,346 --> 02:50:24,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.

2490
02:50:24,847 --> 02:50:25,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

2491
02:50:26,682 --> 02:50:28,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2492
02:50:28,744 --> 02:50:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for calling.

2493
02:50:30,365 --> 02:50:31,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to those that didn't get through.

2494
02:50:31,627 --> 02:50:34,089
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through tonight, you know, you can always send us an email.

2495
02:50:34,189 --> 02:50:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mailbag had like one email in it tonight, you guys.

2496
02:50:36,311 --> 02:50:41,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Type out your thoughts and we'll read them next week on the show.

2497
02:50:41,515 --> 02:50:43,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, last minute stories.

2498
02:50:43,277 --> 02:50:44,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to ask Loki.

2499
02:50:44,398 --> 02:50:45,639
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some back-to-back calls tonight.

2500
02:50:45,679 --> 02:50:46,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

2501
02:50:47,572 --> 02:50:48,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Not too much, actually.

2502
02:50:49,453 --> 02:50:53,277
[SPEAKER_14]: This is kind of stupid considering DJ Hero.

2503
02:50:53,477 --> 02:50:54,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I care about that.

2504
02:50:54,178 --> 02:50:54,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really care about this.

2505
02:50:55,379 --> 02:50:59,723
[SPEAKER_14]: But Guitar Hero, hey, look, there's more DLC coming out.

2506
02:50:59,763 --> 02:51:06,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we said that we weren't going to put anything out because we're done with that series, but the fans asked for it, so we're putting out more DLC.

2507
02:51:06,429 --> 02:51:11,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you for graciously giving us DLC for your game that you've decided to discontinue.

2508
02:51:12,655 --> 02:51:12,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

2509
02:51:13,475 --> 02:51:24,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, so those tracks coming to Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, they're from the artist Trapped, and you get modern... Didn't you read this earlier in the show?

2510
02:51:24,664 --> 02:51:25,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I already did.

2511
02:51:25,224 --> 02:51:26,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Shame on you, Loki.

2512
02:51:26,225 --> 02:51:26,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry!

2513
02:51:26,405 --> 02:51:28,526
[SPEAKER_09]: You were trying to design textures for GTA.

2514
02:51:28,546 --> 02:51:30,248
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be only one Matt.

2515
02:51:31,471 --> 02:51:33,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't read the story with any angst.

2516
02:51:33,713 --> 02:51:39,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to do a little bit of a journalistic... It's still stupid, though, because they say... Oh, well, we're just continuing the series.

2517
02:51:39,517 --> 02:51:40,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, just kidding.

2518
02:51:40,078 --> 02:51:41,839
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to put it out because the fans want it.

2519
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:44,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Who listens to the fans?

2520
02:51:47,043 --> 02:51:47,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

2521
02:51:48,948 --> 02:51:49,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Toastie!

2522
02:52:07,242 --> 02:52:07,542
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2523
02:52:09,143 --> 02:52:10,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's going to do it.

2524
02:52:10,985 --> 02:52:12,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess if that's it for the last minute stories.

2525
02:52:13,166 --> 02:52:13,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is.

2526
02:52:14,147 --> 02:52:18,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Another episode of Orange Lounge Radio has come to a close, but not before we say goodnight to everybody.

2527
02:52:18,990 --> 02:52:19,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with Matt, too.

2528
02:52:20,011 --> 02:52:22,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here tonight and filling in for DarkSakura.

2529
02:52:22,152 --> 02:52:22,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the invite.

2530
02:52:22,753 --> 02:52:23,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

2531
02:52:23,313 --> 02:52:24,594
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a good job with the news tonight.

2532
02:52:24,894 --> 02:52:25,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.

2533
02:52:26,275 --> 02:52:26,596
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2534
02:52:26,656 --> 02:52:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to have you back again sometime.

2535
02:52:28,803 --> 02:52:30,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully not to fill in for someone.

2536
02:52:30,384 --> 02:52:30,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2537
02:52:31,345 --> 02:52:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be the fourth wheel at another point.

2538
02:52:33,586 --> 02:52:33,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth.

2539
02:52:33,946 --> 02:52:34,527
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got the chat room.

2540
02:52:34,547 --> 02:52:34,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2541
02:52:34,827 --> 02:52:35,567
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the chat room.

2542
02:52:35,827 --> 02:52:37,709
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the always present fourth guest on the show.

2543
02:52:37,749 --> 02:52:38,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the spare tire.

2544
02:52:38,529 --> 02:52:39,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The fifth wheel.

2545
02:52:39,170 --> 02:52:40,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be the spare tire in the back.

2546
02:52:40,410 --> 02:52:40,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

2547
02:52:40,771 --> 02:52:41,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be the junk in your trunk.

2548
02:52:41,951 --> 02:52:43,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see you again.

2549
02:52:43,672 --> 02:52:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wait two years before coming back.

2550
02:52:44,993 --> 02:52:46,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

2551
02:52:46,836 --> 02:52:48,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Nutrisystem sucks.

2552
02:52:49,618 --> 02:52:50,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Although it's working, it sucks.

2553
02:52:51,140 --> 02:52:57,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have dinner tonight consisting of buffalo wing pretzel bites and macaroni and cheese in a cup.

2554
02:52:58,065 --> 02:52:58,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Delicious.

2555
02:52:58,806 --> 02:52:59,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2556
02:52:59,266 --> 02:52:59,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Not.

2557
02:52:59,707 --> 02:53:01,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go eat something else when I get home.

2558
02:53:02,489 --> 02:53:05,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thoughts, no, really great to be here.

2559
02:53:05,391 --> 02:53:11,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I'll be invited back on your other podcast in the future so I can be the Deckard Cain of your show and

2560
02:53:11,778 --> 02:53:13,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay a while and listen.

2561
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:13,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

2562
02:53:14,142 --> 02:53:15,203
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, thank you for having me, Loki.

2563
02:53:15,243 --> 02:53:16,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Always a pleasure seeing you.

2564
02:53:16,705 --> 02:53:18,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will work on my angst next time.

2565
02:53:18,708 --> 02:53:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for the beer!

2566
02:53:19,990 --> 02:53:20,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it work?

2567
02:53:21,292 --> 02:53:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

2568
02:53:22,113 --> 02:53:22,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

2569
02:53:23,035 --> 02:53:23,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got two more at home.

2570
02:53:25,214 --> 02:53:25,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2571
02:53:26,415 --> 02:53:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I want to say a final thought.

2572
02:53:29,697 --> 02:53:30,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Headaches suck.

2573
02:53:31,358 --> 02:53:32,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer doesn't make headaches better either.

2574
02:53:32,879 --> 02:53:33,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.

2575
02:53:34,040 --> 02:53:35,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2576
02:53:35,361 --> 02:53:36,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I am tracking my 3DS.

2577
02:53:37,122 --> 02:53:42,286
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming out of Oakland right now, so I will have that tomorrow for sure.

2578
02:53:42,346 --> 02:53:45,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless the plane crashes or they lose it.

2579
02:53:45,988 --> 02:53:47,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Or it doesn't get stolen in Oakland.

2580
02:53:47,850 --> 02:53:50,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2581
02:53:50,631 --> 02:53:52,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show.

2582
02:53:52,973 --> 02:53:54,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

2583
02:53:54,713 --> 02:54:02,778
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't ask for anything to do this show except tonight we do ask you to donate at least $10 to the Red Cross, forego a game, and donate to those in need this week.

2584
02:54:02,818 --> 02:54:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important.

2585
02:54:04,058 --> 02:54:09,341
[SPEAKER_02]: However, outside of that, the way you can help promote this show and continue what we do here, just tell a friend.

2586
02:54:09,461 --> 02:54:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a friend about the show.

2587
02:54:10,902 --> 02:54:17,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you like, I don't know who to tell about the show, leave a nice five-star review on iTunes or wherever it is you found this podcast at, forums,

2588
02:54:18,145 --> 02:54:24,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually get the little emails from Google and see people talk about it on forums and I just really appreciate you guys that say nice things about the show.

2589
02:54:24,850 --> 02:54:26,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't go unnoticed.

2590
02:54:26,131 --> 02:54:26,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.

2591
02:54:27,272 --> 02:54:31,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So until next time, we'll be back with DarkSakura to do it all again next week.

2592
02:54:31,595 --> 02:54:35,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all have a wonderful night and until then, bye-bye.

2593
02:54:35,398 --> 02:54:36,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe this week.

2594
02:54:37,358 --> 02:54:40,139
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2595
02:54:40,659 --> 02:54:43,900
