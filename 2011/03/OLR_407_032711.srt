00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Tonight, March 27, 2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:31,440
some 3DS titles already been cancelled?

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,860
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,680
Lounge Radio, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,160
It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,620
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,680
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
Woo!

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
Woo!

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Ugh!

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Yeah.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smooshage.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Smooshage.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,520
It looks like boob smash.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,440
You think maybe we'll get a video game out of this new series if it does well?

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
Probably.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,440
It'd do well if they...

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Okay.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,220
Of course there's DC Universe, that is kind of a Wonder Woman game.

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,480
There was this one outfit that they had her in that was sort of this Xena looking loin

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,200
cloth-y thing that looked cool.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Why didn't they stick with that?

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I don't know.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,720
It was leathery and hardcore and cool.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Actually the hell with this Wonder Woman stuff, let's get Xena back on TV.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,560
No, but AKA Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Alright.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,120
But of course we can't do a show without Tech Master Loki!

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,760
See, the reason they cancelled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Did she?

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
No.

35
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,520
She very well could have.

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,040
No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
I don't know.

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
I can't explain it.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
So how you doing, Loki?

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
What's new with you?

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
Oh, no.

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
You're right, you're right.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I'm confusing her with China.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
My mistake.

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
That...

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
I should never do that.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
That's because China did enough steroids.

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Not the country, but the wrestler.

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
No, the wrestler.

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Yes.

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Yes.

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I should never...

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
I apologize, Lucy Lawless.

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Lucy Lawless could play China.

56
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,560
She's awesome.

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
No, she's awesome.

58
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
In like a lifetime movie.

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,560
China is a man beast, okay?

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
So...

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
No.

62
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Well, it's...

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
It's because of steroids.

64
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,040
I understand it's because of steroids, but...

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Yes.

66
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Oh, man.

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
I...

68
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Do I feel bad?

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,500
Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange

70
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Lawn Radio.

71
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Say hello to Salacious Pop.

72
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
What up?

73
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,500
How you doing?

74
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Doing good.

75
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Yeah?

76
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,840
You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?

77
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,080
Do you watch any TV at all?

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
No.

79
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,940
I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.

80
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,680
There's no like Hulu that you watch.

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,520
Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.

82
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
You watch Archer.

83
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
You got me hooked on that show.

84
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
That show's funny.

85
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,120
I like that show on FX.

86
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Really?

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
You think it's funny?

88
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah.

89
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
I thought...

90
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,960
I tried watching a few episodes of that to see it, because it looked really funny, and

91
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
it was terrible.

92
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Really?

93
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,960
It was just terrible.

94
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
No, I love Archer.

95
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
It's funny.

96
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,040
I mean, I got to go back and watch it, but like the first few episodes just annoyed me

97
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,100
because it wasn't funny enough.

98
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes.

99
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
I don't know.

100
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Maybe.

101
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
I don't know.

102
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
But I don't know.

103
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.

104
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
It's very dark.

105
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,360
The secretary that wants to bang everybody, and then when she...

106
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,800
Because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise

107
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,160
marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.

108
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Just like really like, wow.

109
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Yeah.

110
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
A lot of awesome stuff.

111
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
All right.

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
Anyhow, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?

113
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
We always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week?

114
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,500
But I need to introduce, of course, the chat room.

115
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,660
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

116
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,480
after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,920
And if you want to join us live in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, where you

118
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,160
can join us in the live chat room where we do interact with the audience.

119
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,640
For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, why is the State Theater near my house

120
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,960
doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week, WTF?

121
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,040
People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff, and I'm kind of like, I'm so

122
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
over it.

123
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Just like Rebecca Black.

124
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,880
You know, like Rebecca Black was cool like a week ago and now, now I think I'm finally

125
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
getting over it.

126
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,560
Like now, now it's become a parody of itself in a way.

127
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,660
And Charlie Sheen, like this whole, is he doing like a live tour or something?

128
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
No thanks.

129
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,460
I'll go watch Hot Shots again.

130
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,160
I never actually watched the interview or heard anything.

131
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,120
I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.

132
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,360
Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?

133
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Either of them.

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Either of them.

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Oh, sorry.

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,040
I've watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.

137
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,200
What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?

138
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
That was, yeah.

139
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
That was Alan.

140
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
What was that you posted on my walls?

141
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
I got it.

142
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,280
There's a group called, uh, I don't want to get their name wrong.

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Bad Lip Sync?

144
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Bad, Bad Lip Reading?

145
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,440
Yeah, that was it.

146
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,480
So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's

147
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth.

148
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,280
And then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how,

149
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,440
and then if you look at her, look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what

150
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
it looks like she's saying.

151
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,200
And it's pretty awesome.

152
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
As you're queuing up the video.

153
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,700
I would try to play some of it here, but I don't, it's YouTube's, YouTube's acting ignorant

154
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
right now.

155
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,800
It's terrible.

156
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,000
It's very ignorant right now.

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,280
I can't believe this, such ignorance.

158
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,840
There it goes.

159
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Let's see if I can play some of this here.

160
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,720
That should be the theme song to River City Ransom part two, which we were talking about

161
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,880
last week.

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,280
We got party hats, Barney, Barney.

163
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,040
I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.

164
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,080
It's actually much, I could listen to that.

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
I would buy that on iTunes.

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,460
It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, ear worm than the original is.

167
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Cause I'll be in the shower.

168
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Gang, fight, gang.

169
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
It's like, stop it.

170
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,240
I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
All right, let's talk about actual video games.

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,320
I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen, Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes

173
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
of our show.

174
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
Thank you so much.

175
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Let's talk about actual video games.

176
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
And how was your gaming week?

177
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Ladies first, Dark Soccer.

178
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,440
How was your gaming week?

179
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,680
My gaming week was, um, epic.

180
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,780
Well, in the terms of RPGs, cause Dan and I are playing, well, more like Dan's playing

181
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,840
through it and I'm watching him while I crochet, um, playing through Final Fantasy and we're

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,640
halfway through the first game and when we're done with that, we're going to go to two.

183
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,640
And then since we don't have a home version of three, you know, that's like, that we can

184
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,520
play on the TV, we're going to skip onto four and then we're going to do five, which we've

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:10,640
got a couple of versions of now, um, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 10 to 11 was crap

186
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
and not really a game.

187
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,360
I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while cause of that whole, you know, I don't

188
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,640
know, 12 years and never got to level cap.

189
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
I know.

190
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,400
Well, like it's not going to be, well, you know, I'm just saying.

191
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,400
And then we're going to play 12 and I guess I'll get your 13 back from you again.

192
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Cause I should, I should probably give that to you today.

193
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,640
What about 12, two, uh, 12, two was on the DS, but then there's, well, and it wasn't

194
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
really 12, two.

195
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
It was like a side story.

196
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,080
There's a 12, two that we saw the, um, 13, two, 13, two that was too damn many games.

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Now are you going to be playing, um, the, uh, was it the Final Fantasy four?

198
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Was it the after years or whatever we, it may be out by the time we get to it, we just

199
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
might hook up the SNES.

200
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I don't know.

201
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, you can put it on the Wii cause it's, uh, we loaned out our Wii, our Wii's on loan.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,160
If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.

203
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,280
I don't know, but we've got like anthology versions and I have one if you need to borrow

204
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
one.

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,440
Well, we've, we've got anthology versions, we've got the super Nintendo versions.

206
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,600
I mean, really we've got, I think three different versions of that game that we could play.

207
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
And let me back up a little bit.

208
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,080
Why are you doing this?

209
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,280
Because this is romantic.

210
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,320
Well, back in the day, like I say that like it was like so long ago, but Dan and Dan will

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,480
play it through, um, Resident Evil two and I would be his navigator.

212
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,160
It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because

213
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,480
it's been a long time since I've played the first one.

214
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,280
And when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.

215
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm a wondrous one.

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,480
So are you doing like purist?

217
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,800
Are you doing the NES version or are you playing like the remade one on PlayStation one or

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
something?

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
This is the remade PlayStation one.

220
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
The, was it origins or?

221
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Yeah.

222
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Yeah.

223
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
And, um, which is really just like the wondrous one one in terms of the graphics.

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
But with the souped up music.

225
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Yeah.

226
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
It's not, it's nice.

227
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
It's very super Nintendo-y.

228
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:24,560
And, um, our party is, uh, the warrior, the monk or black belt of the thief and red mage.

229
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
So we have, we're offensive.

230
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,440
We know they go out and tell bad jokes and then, you know, get experience for it, I guess.

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
But Dan likes to name, um, the party after people that he knows.

232
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,920
So the warrior is Dan and I'm the red mage because hi, I'm versatile and can cast fire

233
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
three.

234
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,400
Um, then, uh, our friend Becky, he's named, uh, our, uh, monk because Becky kicks ass

235
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,280
and then, uh, mystique is the thief because it's mystique and the thief is always asleep

236
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
or dead.

237
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,960
So, which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what mystique is like

238
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,040
whenever we have work to do, um, and she's been on the show.

239
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
People have heard her.

240
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Um, so it's pretty fun.

241
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,240
And like I was yelling at the husband the other day, I'm playing a little bit of final

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,280
fantasy three, mostly at school, like before class when I get a chance to and, uh, playing

243
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
well.

244
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:30,360
And, um, I made a new character, Rebecca black, just because I thought it would be funny.

245
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,400
And I like, now you're stuck with it.

246
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,200
I, well, I like going, running through stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,920
And I'm like, yeah, just because it's fun.

248
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,240
It's my own version of trolling.

249
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,080
No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.

250
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,440
I brought this chicken for us to eat.

251
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,600
Anything else for your gaming week?

252
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,140
Uh, pinball, I actually played some pinball.

253
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
Good times.

254
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,940
I played some world cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I

255
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,360
apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.

256
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
And then I like drained them on my last two balls.

257
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,720
It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

258
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,520
That was what my game was like.

259
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
And Dan's my witness.

260
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,320
He can vouch for me.

261
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
That was, that's my gaming week.

262
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Awesome.

263
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
And I crocheted.

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,640
How about you and your gaming week?

265
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Motorstorm apocalypse.

266
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,560
I finished the rookie story mode thing, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
It's really hard as it is.

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,440
So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
kind of an Archer type intro for.

270
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,400
So I'm interested to see where that goes.

271
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,800
And then what else did I play?

272
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,920
I played more Ridge Racer because it's fun.

273
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.

274
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,680
I got my, you know, my US 3DS now and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it

275
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,080
should be sold this week.

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,320
And got some pilot wings in Super Street Fighter IV.

277
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,680
So those are kind of the, kind of the games to get I guess.

278
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,200
That's really what I'm getting for a while.

279
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I mean the only other game that kind of looked interesting was that Dream Trigger, but beyond

280
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,440
that, I don't see anything until like the fourth quarter.

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,980
So I don't know.

282
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,840
And just from my experience today, it is not difficult to find a 3DS, at least in the first

283
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
few days.

284
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,200
When I talked to somebody at Gamestop, they had a couple left and they said they were

285
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
getting more on Friday.

286
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,840
And then there was a Toys R Us, they had at least seven left, you know, quite a few.

287
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,960
And no one was even interested, there was no one there.

288
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,200
So maybe just because no one thinks of Toys R Us anymore for games.

289
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,920
I still kind of sort of want one.

290
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,200
There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.

291
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,840
A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.

292
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,920
Beyond that, might as well wait.

293
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,760
I mean seriously, it's not a Wii situation right now.

294
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,640
And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.

295
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,400
And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.

296
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,100
You know I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo

297
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,320
really seemed hell bent on getting this thing out in March.

298
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,600
And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we

299
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,720
really start ramping up for the holiday season?

300
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,140
Like part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had

301
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,440
the Kid Icarus and some of these other games, maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many

302
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,840
third parties on board.

303
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,960
Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is like the movies,

304
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,680
the entertainment package and everything.

305
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,360
If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the

306
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,440
summer, kids graduation presents and things like that.

307
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
You know, let's say they sell a million of these if not more by summertime, then there's

308
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,280
already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey,

309
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,180
how about putting out that, you know, Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?

310
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.

311
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,560
I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.

312
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,000
And by putting it out just before, you know, the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,320
gonna sell all their, you know, first batch of systems probably within the first week.

314
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,480
And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their

315
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
investors.

316
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,600
That's all I really think the reason why that they did it.

317
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here, actually it's out

318
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,820
in all regions now, yet not everything's done yet.

319
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,600
Like they don't have the internet browser yet.

320
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,080
They don't have like the store up yet.

321
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
That's coming in May.

322
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,460
Because it's not done yet!

323
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,600
So they just put it out to get it out there for people, and it'll be like saying, hey,

324
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,160
that's an awesome car that you bought.

325
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Tires!

326
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Those are coming in May!

327
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
It's awesome!

328
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean, you could drive around in it now, it sparks a lot, but man, once those tires

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,840
hit in, that's gonna be awesome.

330
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,120
That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.

331
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,040
But yet you still bought one like a lamb to the slaughter.

332
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,080
You were in line.

333
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't care about their crappy web browser.

334
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Or their store!

335
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,960
Because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.

336
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,920
Although I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had.

337
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,440
And they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music.

338
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,440
But it's totally what I expected that, I have a feeling that's exactly what their 3D remakes

339
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,880
of these classic games are gonna look like.

340
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,760
It's basically taking the sprite layers and just kind of offsetting them a little bit.

341
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,480
So when you have a background layer 4 or whatever, it's back further.

342
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,320
So they're just gonna build an emulator.

343
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,760
One of the games that I played at E3 last year I think was Xevious, the old school 8-bit

344
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,240
game, which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.

345
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,160
All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer, and then the background

346
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
was on the back layer.

347
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,760
I mean, but I'm not gonna lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming

348
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
to get done?

349
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Probably not.

350
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,600
You build an emulator and it runs ROMs, and that's it, you're done.

351
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,760
Question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom, I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they

352
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,480
are gonna do on the 3DS browser.

353
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,580
You think any at all?

354
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,760
Probably not, if anything it'll be- Maybe something in Flash?

355
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,760
I don't know.

356
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Um...

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,980
Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit,

358
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,440
they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.

359
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,640
They supported Flash- No, they didn't support Flash- I can't remember what they supported.

360
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,480
They supported something with it.

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
It was very basic.

362
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,760
It was just like the PSP was, where it supported- It used basic.

363
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,560
It supports Flash, but very little Flash, because of the kits that they had.

364
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,340
But I think, if anything, what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that

365
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,800
those 3D pictures are in.

366
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,760
So, like, say if I post that on my, you know, wall or something like that, you know, somewhere

367
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,240
in a webpage, it would be in 3D on yours.

368
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,120
Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing

369
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,080
Nintendo games in Flash, on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games

370
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,280
on my 3D- It would be very meta.

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,900
No, you couldn't.

372
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,800
And the reason why you couldn't is because, just, it doesn't have the processing power

373
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,000
to handle that, something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that either.

375
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,800
So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP, you'd never be able to build something like

376
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
that.

377
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwell from the chatroom.

378
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,200
The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.

379
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
I did hear about that.

380
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah, that looks- That's interesting.

381
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,800
It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know-

382
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,360
It's more of a show-off thing, right?

383
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,280
It's like, it's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D, ooh!

384
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,240
Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.

385
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,900
Okay.

386
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Go ahead.

387
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,080
For the record, OK Go is a good band.

388
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,040
No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.

389
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,200
Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in

390
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Rock Band.

391
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,160
All their videos since then have been amazing.

392
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,480
Oh yeah, and that one, there was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing

393
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
video.

394
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Well, there's the one with the dogs, one with them in the park, with the stop motion.

395
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,400
The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there, yeah.

396
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Okay.

397
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,560
So, it's like, they're on the cutting edge of music videos.

398
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,520
It's like them and Lady Gaga, right there.

399
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Yeah.

400
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Alright.

401
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
They should collaborate.

402
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,640
I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.

403
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Really?

404
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Good show.

405
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Oh, good times.

406
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Another good band.

407
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
Alright, so is that it for your gaming week, Loki?

408
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Some 3DS rants and so forth?

409
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,480
Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday,

410
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,080
which, I don't know why all the hate, really, everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever,

411
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,360
this is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.

412
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
It was entertaining.

413
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,400
Oh, damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertaining movies?

414
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I don't understand.

415
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,440
See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really, it's what

416
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
you want to see.

417
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
It's alright.

418
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Let me put it this way.

419
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,040
It's kind of funny because it's, a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of

420
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
different games.

421
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,680
Like, they have this one scene that you probably see in there where they're in a mech and stuff

422
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,200
and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from

423
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Killzone.

424
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,720
It's, it's pretty much that.

425
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,200
It looks so much like it.

426
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's ridiculous.

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Are there lots of boobs?

428
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.

429
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
It's PG-13.

430
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh, come on!

431
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,360
No, but it's got, it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train,

432
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,760
and it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy 13 where they're, like, fighting soldiers

433
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,040
and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.

434
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
It's badass, but, uh, and it's, like, seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?

435
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,400
This would be really awesome as a game.

436
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,560
Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.

437
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,480
I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.

438
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.

439
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.

440
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,280
The 300, problematic, but awesome.

441
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,600
Then Watchmen, I love the novel, but eh, now, now this, so.

442
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
So Superman's gonna be great.

443
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,080
It was cool, but, like, I see people's complaints, they're like, well, the first part of the

444
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,240
movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.

445
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,420
So what?

446
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,920
So it didn't have dialogue in it.

447
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,440
Neither did Wall-E, so that argument's null and void, because Wall-E's one of the greatest

448
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
movies of the past ten years.

449
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,680
So did the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001, so.

450
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,600
But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution

451
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,080
as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.

452
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,400
And whatever, who cares?

453
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,440
It doesn't matter, because if it was just, like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution

454
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,720
and stuff.

455
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,640
It's basically her coping with whatever is going on, because apparently, you know, there's

456
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,080
stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as, like, a, you know, a burlesque type

457
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
place.

458
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,660
Um, the way she copes with it is kind of goes into this imaginary world thing, where she's

459
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,760
solving how she's gonna escape.

460
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,720
And you see how she's gonna figure that out right in the very beginning.

461
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,920
She figured it all out, but this is just all, like, very quick, like, uh, kind of like Inception

462
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,400
where, you know, there's a lot stuff taking place in a very short period of time.

463
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,960
Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.

464
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,040
Boobies in 3D.

465
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,560
Is there any porn in 3D?

466
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,880
Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and

467
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,160
you can download it to your flashcard.

468
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,560
It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.

469
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,880
It would not be difficult to do that.

470
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,200
I would say otherwise, your biggest hope would be, uh, Netflix when it comes out, if they

471
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,040
start doing the 3D movies, uh, and then, like, Piranha 3D is gonna be, like, your boobies

472
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,120
in 3D or whatever else.

473
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,560
Well, once they have it where you can, say, take video with your 3DS and stuff, they'll

474
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:31,160
find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and, ta-da, you know, they'll be done.

475
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,880
But then again, I don't know, it'd be hard to do 3D.

476
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,840
There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet,

477
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,220
so, I don't know, it might be a while.

478
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
But boobies in 3D.

479
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,320
I mean, that's a great use of 3D.

480
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,440
But once again, though, that's just to get people in the seats for, like, Piranha 3D.

481
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,880
I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's... it is interesting.

482
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,160
Like, you know, I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and

483
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,440
it's got a lot of gore in it.

484
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,120
I mean, that sounds awesome.

485
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Alright, whatever.

486
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
But it's a terrible movie.

487
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,640
You're part of the problem!

488
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,360
No, no, okay, there is something, I can't remember, I'm trying to think if we're actually

489
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,200
going to get into it tonight, um, God, I had a Nintendo thing.

490
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,600
I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something.

491
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Alright, you will come back to that after the gaming week.

492
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
I have to refresh my memory why I was pissed off.

493
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
Let me go over to Salacious Pop and check in with him.

494
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,280
How was your gaming week, Salacious Pop?

495
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,920
It was pretty good.

496
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,960
I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2, because I have to revisit

497
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
that game every couple months.

498
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is, you know, the very beginning when

499
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,640
you're on the train, play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm,

500
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,680
which is the very scary, gory, Resident Evil inspired, and I think the developers of Valve

501
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,400
said that this very Resident Evil influenced that zone.

502
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.

503
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's where I'm at right now.

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,600
I played some Warcraft 3, the RTS from 2003.

505
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,440
I'm starting to use cheat codes now, just so I can see the story.

506
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,800
And uh, wow, World of Warcraft.

507
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
That's about it.

508
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Alright.

509
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,800
When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?

510
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,840
Yet, Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some

511
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,880
sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.

512
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.

513
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,080
You might want to get a diaper, just in case.

514
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Alright.

515
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,000
I know Loki's dying to get to his ramp, but I'm going to make him wait through my gaming

516
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
week.

517
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
That's fine.

518
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's not a bad big deal.

519
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.

520
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,920
Um, I played a lot of repeats.

521
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,160
I played You Don't Know Jack, which was fun.

522
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Speaking of diapers, we got the best dissertat ever.

523
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
It was, what was it?

524
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,800
It was, uh, boy band or adult diaper?

525
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Something like that?

526
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,120
I don't remember what it was.

527
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,960
No, it was inspirational poster.

528
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Yeah.

529
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,920
It was inspirational poster or adult diaper brand.

530
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't know.

531
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,520
I want to ruin the game for you guys.

532
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
It was great.

533
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Laughed.

534
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,840
It's a good, it's just a fun party game.

535
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,720
Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played, uh, You Don't Know Jack.

536
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,960
It called me an idiot to my face.

537
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Yeah, that's right.

538
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
The game called you an idiot.

539
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
I forgot about that.

540
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
It was, uh, what was the question?

541
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,920
Something about what one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Barney

542
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,960
Stone.

543
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,400
And it was like, uh, the correct answer was the kiss from Spiderman because you're supposed

544
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
to kiss the Barney Stone upside down.

545
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,920
But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer

546
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:40,400
goes, yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Barney Stone, idiot.

547
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
He ended up winning the round anyway, but I took it home at the end.

548
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,640
We couldn't hear any follow up because, uh, Grandpa Warcraft we were playing with and

549
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,080
I were laughing so loud.

550
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,040
We couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an

551
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
idiot.

552
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Great.

553
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,080
Um, otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade.

554
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,400
And every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that, he's like, why aren't you playing this

555
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
on PC?

556
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
But I don't know.

557
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I, I want the achievements.

558
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Don't judge me.

559
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,600
Um, and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade.

560
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,880
I once knew, you know, we've had a bunch of sad news about, you know, we had the Chinatown

561
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,140
arcade in New York City closed, arcade infinity closed as far as I'm concerned, Roseville

562
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Golf Land closed too.

563
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,440
That place is dead to me.

564
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,240
I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy

565
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,240
that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.

566
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,040
He's going to hear me fuss.

567
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,200
There's, there's no Beatmania anymore.

568
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
There's no DJ Max Technica.

569
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,880
They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.

570
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,680
All they have is DDR Disney, yeah, Disney and Max 2 and then the drum freaks are, I'm

571
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
not even into that.

572
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,320
They have guitar freaks and drum freaks that like beat the hell up, but they're there at

573
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
least.

574
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,840
But I'm just, you know, I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of, I mean, I would

575
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,320
be cool if there were some fun fighting games, no Capcom SNK to be found, no Soul Calibur,

576
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
nothing.

577
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,720
It's, they have an original Soul Calibur 2.

578
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Where the hell was that?

579
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
It was hidden somewhere.

580
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,520
And they also have an SNK, it's like, um, three different King of Fighters and then

581
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,200
a Metal Slug, one of those four in one boxes.

582
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,880
When I played that a couple of months ago and I was laughing last there, I was on the

583
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,200
right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.

584
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,880
Yeah, it's just sad.

585
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,120
The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because

586
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,160
like, that is one racing game I do really like.

587
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
I'll play that.

588
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,800
They had Initial D5, which, you know, there's a lot of people really into that series, I'm

589
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
sure we're playing that.

590
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,760
There's only one game there that I think is still in E real good and that's that Tank,

591
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Tank, Tank.

592
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,920
They do have Tank, Tank, Tank still, but I'm just, I'm over it.

593
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,640
Like, it's so far out there for me to drive to and now with no beat mania, I'm just kind

594
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,240
of like, you're dead to me, bye.

595
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,000
They have a big, um, aside from all the racers, they have the big shooter games with like

596
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,040
the giant plastic gun that, you know, like the, the Sega Rambo, Rambo game.

597
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,960
So this game is kind of fun.

598
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,240
So dad swiped his card for his little girl.

599
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,360
She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun

600
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,240
as big as she is playing Rambo.

601
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
She wasn't doing that.

602
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
Well, I was like, that is awesome.

603
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080
You kill all those mercenaries.

604
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,200
You just, yeah, you go ahead girl.

605
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Go ahead.

606
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,400
I'm going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge radio.com GOVDA has a warning about

607
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,520
the Blarney stone.

608
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,640
Don't kiss the stone.

609
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,520
All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.

610
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
That's probably some good advice.

611
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
You know what?

612
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,320
I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle and I've

613
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,280
got video of my uncle doing it.

614
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Oh really?

615
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Yeah.

616
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,360
No, not pee.

617
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,920
Your uncle kiss pee.

618
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,440
He went for his honeymoon.

619
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Okay.

620
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,680
But like lady in the tramp, I don't think, I don't really don't think that there's any

621
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,880
way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.

622
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
You know what?

623
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,220
That's what boys like to do is pee on things.

624
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,360
So where there's a will, there's a pee.

625
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,120
Uh, anyway, uh, what else did I play this week?

626
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Otherwise?

627
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,560
Um, that was pretty, I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.

628
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,840
Oh, final fantasy three on the iPhone came out this week.

629
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,040
Um, it's a remake of the DS version of final fantasy three port.

630
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Yeah.

631
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Or a port, whatever.

632
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,360
Uh, well they, I don't know if you'd say, cause they really did soup it up.

633
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,520
It's for retina display and the graphics are like noticeably like, wow.

634
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,080
I mean, I, that was one of the first things I noticed is it looks great on the iPhone.

635
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,800
I mean, granted it's kind of small.

636
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,740
I'm usually not a big fan of games on the iPhone, but you know, because they tailor

637
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,380
made this for the iPhone, the analog stick kind of works.

638
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,260
The faux analog stick they do.

639
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,440
One thing I love about it that I wish more iPhone developers would do, it's not a always

640
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,280
in the same place analog stick, wherever you touch on the screen becomes an analog stick.

641
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,800
So like, you know, in some games you want to be able to see the bottom left corner or

642
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,320
the analog stick sometimes is.

643
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,560
So if that ends up being the case of fantasy three, you can just move your thumb to the

644
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,360
upper right and have your analog stick be there.

645
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,320
And it's, it's very small little improvement that I really like.

646
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,040
Um, the only tricky touchy prices is the price.

647
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,640
Uh, 1599 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.

648
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,360
So it's a little high, but then you gotta, you know.

649
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,560
What a game is worth is really up in the air right now, and this is where a lot of controversy

650
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,720
comes in, which you've heard about, you know, at Game Developers Conference where Nintendo

651
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,760
was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and this whole 99 cents for a game and you know,

652
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
all this.

653
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,240
So I mean 1599, yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game, but at the same time the quality

654
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,600
is pretty great and you're getting a port or a remake, whatever you want to call it,

655
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,880
of a $35 DS game.

656
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,200
I mean I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.

657
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,880
I mean it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this

658
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,400
if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

659
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,360
I mean you already know if this game is for you or not.

660
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,760
Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.

661
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,400
But it looks beautiful and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't

662
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,000
really like see for yourself.

663
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,240
But um, I, the very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out

664
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,240
the 4 remake as well, but at the same time with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't

665
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,280
justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with

666
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,660
the after years.

667
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,600
So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.

668
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,080
On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.

669
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,820
And I'm, even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like 5 years

670
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,100
ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4, so I'm probably not going to get that

671
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,480
on the iPhone.

672
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,060
Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.

673
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,800
If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like 10 bucks whenever

674
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,160
the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.

675
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,360
So anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.

676
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,360
So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.

677
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,880
Actually, it was just what you were talking about, how Nintendo was poo-pooing on the

678
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,000
developers and stuff like that, the indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.

679
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,040
They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system, is their

680
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
quote.

681
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,480
You know, people that, they want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers,

682
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,760
just people that make games, I guess.

683
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,120
Because they don't want crappy games coming out in their system.

684
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,480
Excuse me!

685
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,560
Crappy games coming out in your system.

686
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,640
The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.

687
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:38,640
There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers

688
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,560
and legitimate publishers.

689
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,020
I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there, somebody

690
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,680
that I don't know might add some innovation to something instead of say, licensing Jelly

691
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,800
Belly or licensing Smiley Face.

692
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:59,120
The icon of the 60s, 70s, whoo, that's current.

693
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,080
You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.

694
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,760
I don't think, see once again, this kind of goes back to, they don't understand the whole

695
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
online business.

696
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,400
They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to

697
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,240
the online thing, they're just lost.

698
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,080
It's like they just don't know what they're doing.

699
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,720
It's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a

700
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,040
lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?

701
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,280
You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.

702
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:44,040
I mean, had they not put virtual console stuff out there for four, five, six, seven dollars

703
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,360
and put it all out for 99 cents, I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just

704
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,160
crazy amounts of games.

705
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:57,400
Well, the other thing too is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort

706
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,920
of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?

707
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,080
They have to buy the SDK, right?

708
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I think so.

709
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,000
Well, actually, no, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit,

710
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,520
because I think you can just download that stuff.

711
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Yes.

712
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
There is a license.

713
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
There is.

714
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,360
So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless if the developers

715
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,840
are making the money or not, the only thing they have to worry about is if anything is

716
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,080
going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.

717
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,840
I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have

718
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,380
set up.

719
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:37,220
So really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry

720
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,220
about.

721
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,360
Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.

722
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,080
Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is this something

723
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,480
they're going to do to make money?

724
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,560
It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with, because Nintendo doesn't

725
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,480
have to deal with the same clientele.

726
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,120
Here's the problem with Nintendo and what they're worried about is the fact that they're

727
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,480
a first-party developer as well.

728
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,200
I mean, they put out their own games.

729
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,760
Apple doesn't put out their own games.

730
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
They don't care.

731
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,560
Also, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.

732
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,920
They could put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really

733
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,840
saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.

734
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,600
There's so much garbage on there.

735
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,720
Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.

736
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,960
There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see

737
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,960
what's garbage and what's not garbage.

738
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,000
They've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because

739
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,720
if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.

740
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,280
They're not willing to embrace that.

741
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,320
It's tricky to say too where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super

742
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,040
Meat Boy, and that was kind of a... I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer,

743
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,280
but it was definitely in that middle ground.

744
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,940
It was basically two guys that made that whole game, despite maybe they had somebody else

745
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
do the music and so forth.

746
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,080
But the core of the game was two guys, and it's probably one of the best arcade games

747
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,600
to have come out in the past year.

748
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:08,040
Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?

749
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,120
Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.

750
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,680
And I don't have a problem with that.

751
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
What if people want to buy fart apps?

752
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
That's fine.

753
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
You know what?

754
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
No one's going to say, oh, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.

755
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
No, you don't buy it.

756
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Okay?

757
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
That's not a big deal.

758
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,000
Well, and the whole point too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only

759
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
really work on something like a phone, something you're going to care about.

760
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,120
Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.

761
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,720
Does that have, would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the

762
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Wii?

763
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
No?

764
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,920
Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring

765
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
out your phone into it.

766
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,120
Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and

767
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,680
then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.

768
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
Yeah.

769
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,360
But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer

770
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,080
is do people like their games?

771
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,720
Because that's really the only difference for them.

772
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Oh!

773
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,800
Two people developing out of a garage made a popular game, oh well they're an indie developer.

774
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,280
You know, large company makes fart app, oh well they're a garage developer.

775
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,440
That's really, I think, the only, that's their only excuse.

776
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Really, it just comes down to that they're, they're just not embracing what they need

777
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,040
to be embracing, the business model that's going to make them money.

778
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,400
Some interesting comments, sorry, some interesting comments from chatroom, BlackWolf says XNA

779
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,720
indie games sold so well too, or wait.

780
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,040
I would say though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft

781
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,800
really advertised it at first.

782
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,840
Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the

783
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
real arcade.

784
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Like, wasn't that...

785
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
They do that.

786
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Like, do they?

787
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,960
They do that, but they have, that, it's, it's so rare though.

788
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
It's basically...

789
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,000
Because I know that dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing, but...

790
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,500
It's a competition that they hold each year, and the, like, top few games actually do get

791
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,180
published as Xbox Live Arcade games, but that's once a year, and we're talking, like, two

792
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,720
to four games, maybe, that get published.

793
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,500
And yeah, there is a lot of junk out there, but once again, there's a problem because

794
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,800
it wasn't until well after that came out that they actually got a peer rating system for

795
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,260
that, and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.

796
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,720
People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store, where you

797
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,040
can say, okay, well the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just

798
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,800
crap, you know, I rated it one star.

799
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,120
It's, okay, this game is glitchy, and it doesn't load, or this game is broken, or whatever.

800
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,540
The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.

801
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,700
It's a clunky way to find good games, and it really screws over those developers who

802
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,200
don't land in the top spots.

803
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,480
Like, it's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.

804
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,760
Like, that's, that's my only thing with XNA is, is like, there's so many games on there,

805
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,200
I don't know where to begin, and a lot of the top stuff is poop, and if I go, and a

806
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,600
lot of people probably look at that and go, really, if this is the top stuff on XNA?

807
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Not all of it.

808
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,440
There's some good stuff that gets in there, but, I don't know, I just, I feel like there's,

809
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,600
I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong,

810
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,360
and it's just the presentation of it all.

811
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,000
And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.

812
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,080
I get why they put it where they do, but there's ways they could feature it better than they

813
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
do.

814
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
You know what I mean?

815
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,160
But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony

816
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,160
is going to try with PlayStation Suite, and that is something that's on the horizon.

817
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,480
PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.

818
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
For PC, though.

819
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,560
I mean, it's, I don't know if that's really going to make a big difference, and it's going

820
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:36,200
to be a little late, because, I mean, we're talking like five years into the console cycle,

821
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,760
and they still haven't had something like that.

822
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,120
I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leased to

823
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,320
Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make

824
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
games.

825
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,720
And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something

826
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,680
niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny, I'm going to download that.

827
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,880
But that's fine.

828
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,740
You don't have to download that.

829
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
And that's the thing.

830
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,920
Nintendo has to understand.

831
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Even the stuff that they have people paying, I mean, like, oh, seriously, they have the

832
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,960
Major League Eating game.

833
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
I mean, come on.

834
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,000
I mean, come on.

835
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,680
Is that really Nintendo quality?

836
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,520
I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League

837
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,080
Eating on our system.

838
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,940
Or like the beer pong game or something like that.

839
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,200
There's a lot of crap on there.

840
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,880
And the fact that they're just like coming out saying, oh, well, you know, we don't want

841
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,920
these garage developers ruining our system.

842
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,300
I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system

843
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,240
are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.

844
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,040
All right.

845
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,360
Well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news.

846
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
But that's okay.

847
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,360
We're talking about games.

848
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
That's how we roll.

849
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
No, we haven't got the video.

850
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
Or the news.

851
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,840
We want to get to more of the news.

852
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,840
But that's okay.

853
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,760
Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.

854
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,360
Of course, you can always add us on Facebook.

855
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

856
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,800
And of course, follow us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R. That's how you can keep tabs

857
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
with us online.

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,120
Or visit our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

859
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,540
Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.

860
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,400
Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.

861
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,240
Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

862
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,680
Let's get into some video game news for the week.

863
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Loki, start us off.

864
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
Yummy, yummy, yummy news.

865
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,000
Now, this is kind of funny.

866
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,760
I kind of laughed a little bit.

867
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
But it's not that big a deal.

868
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,280
And I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.

869
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,160
Duke Nukem Forever delayed.

870
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,360
It's only delayed a month.

871
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,600
And that's not a big deal.

872
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,620
And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.

873
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,200
It was coming out in May.

874
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,040
Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.

875
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,540
Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A. Noire.

876
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,800
Then there's Brink.

877
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
And then Fear 3.

878
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,460
And Hunted, The Demon's Forge.

879
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,000
Dungeon Siege 3.

880
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,020
MX vs ATV Alive.

881
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,440
I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.

882
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:12,000
Lego, I mean, it's not really direct competition, but Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.

883
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,480
So I mean.

884
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,580
School's letting out, right?

885
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,800
So it's like, school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.

886
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,080
But it's not typical that May's a busy month.

887
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,720
Usually June is a little bit busier.

888
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,200
May's kind of eh.

889
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,140
And then April's is dead.

890
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,320
Which April is still dead.

891
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,280
But like last year, they had a lot of good games coming out in May and it kind of worked

892
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
out for them.

893
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,300
So they're kind of doing that again.

894
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,840
But it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June, for them at least, because June right

895
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,360
now doesn't have much coming out.

896
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,280
It has a few AAA games and that's it.

897
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,080
I mean, there's stuff that's not announced yet, but very few games compared to May coming

898
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
out.

899
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,080
So, whatever.

900
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
It's a month.

901
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,780
It's not like ten years.

902
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,960
Now if it's late again and again and again and again, then, well, you know, there's not

903
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,400
really anything we can say about that.

904
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Did you watch the little video?

905
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,400
I just watched the video.

906
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
The video was funny.

907
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,240
Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know, here, you know, it was, it was pretty, pretty

908
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
fun.

909
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,520
Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.

910
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,040
But you know, see, here's the thing, I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some

911
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,120
people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in

912
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,920
development only as long as Gearbox has had it.

913
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,880
Because I don't fault them for the time that 3D Realms had the game, because, in my opinion,

914
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,440
they started over, maybe with the assets and so forth, but you know Gearbox basically started

915
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,800
from quote-unquote scratch.

916
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,660
I mean, maybe there were some scraps here and there that they recycled, but Gearbox

917
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,400
probably had to build this game from the ground up.

918
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,840
So I don't fault them for the ten year delay this game took.

919
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,460
I don't think it was really their fault.

920
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
So one month, whatever.

921
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,240
And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.

922
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,760
I mean, they could have, it could have just like, no one could have bought it.

923
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,960
They just said, ah, forget it, you know, Duke Nukem's ten years ago, who cares?

924
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Right.

925
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,680
Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something.

926
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Oh, hell no.

927
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
That wouldn't work.

928
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Yeah, I know.

929
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point you just have to put it

930
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
out.

931
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Yes, I have an idea.

932
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.

933
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,400
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever if it wasn't delayed

934
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,560
at least one more time.

935
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,480
And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.

936
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,800
And of course, you know, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced, Duke Match,

937
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,980
Team Duke Match.

938
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:34,920
But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.

939
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,320
And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.

940
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,680
But the babe will sporadically freak out, and you have to, I guess, slap her to get

941
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
her back in line.

942
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Oh, great.

943
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
On the rump.

944
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,080
A little playful spank to keep her in line, because that's a good message.

945
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,200
They said it in the face, but, well, something.

946
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,200
No.

947
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Slap.

948
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
Slap his ass.

949
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,440
Is that how I can keep Dark Sakura in line when she yells at me on the show?

950
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,840
Bitch, please.

951
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,920
I don't want to be a widower at 33.

952
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,520
But yeah, I mean, it's Duke Nukem.

953
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Come on.

954
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,080
I heard Fox News did a thing on it.

955
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
Come on.

956
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Fox News.

957
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Fox News is stupid.

958
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,480
The media is going to just take this opportunity to say, look at the games you're buying your

959
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
kids.

960
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
Look at the games.

961
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Look like this.

962
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,320
Every single video game is slapping women on the ass.

963
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,040
And they will turn you gay.

964
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,740
All of them will turn you gay.

965
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,400
That's Fox News for you.

966
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,440
Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?

967
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,160
Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.

968
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,160
I don't know.

969
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Perhaps.

970
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,600
No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.

971
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,920
Come on, people.

972
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
I don't know.

973
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,140
Duke Nukem made me very happy.

974
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,840
I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.

975
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm looking forward to this new one, even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.

976
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm going to be so, so very disappointed that I sort of don't care.

977
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,720
It's like, I don't know, it would be like Death Race 3000.

978
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,040
I mean, you know, they're never going to live up to the awesomeness that was Death Race

979
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
2000.

980
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,960
Hell, the remake didn't live up to the awesome Roger Corman classic, but you still kind of

981
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,760
want to watch it anyways because it's got more killing in it and it's got cheesy stuff.

982
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,200
We'll have Jason Statham.

983
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,200
And no hand grenade.

984
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,200
I mean, come on.

985
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
That was awesome.

986
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Aw.

987
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
All right.

988
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,640
Well, moving on to something a little more artful, maybe you're familiar with a company

989
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,800
called The Weinstein Company.

990
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,680
This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting

991
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,240
into films when they left Miramax, they went their separate ways, right?

992
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,160
And they actually put out, or they distributed, they don't, you know, make the movies, but

993
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
they're a distributor.

994
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,640
They distributed The King's Speech, which of course won the Oscar this year.

995
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,280
Well, The Weinstein Company is getting into games.

996
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,160
They formed this week a strategic consultancy, whatever that means, with Beefy Media.

997
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,720
I love that.

998
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,240
The Weinstein Company, arthouse maker, films up with, teams up with Beefy Media.

999
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,960
Anyhow, they're supposedly going to be capitalizing on Weinstein properties.

1000
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,680
Now, The Weinstein Company also owns Dimension Films, which is responsible for a lot of the

1001
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,000
horror movies you see out there right now.

1002
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,600
So this would include things like Scream, which, you know, is getting a new movie after,

1003
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:32,200
what, 10 years, very soon, Halloween, Hellraiser, Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids.

1004
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,880
All of these would now fall under this possible TWC games table.

1005
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
Because Spy Kids is frightening.

1006
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,320
Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.

1007
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,240
I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand

1008
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,240
they're what?

1009
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,240
James Bond for kids, right?

1010
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
Pretty much?

1011
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,280
It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.

1012
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,600
There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became Lava

1013
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Girl and Sharkboy.

1014
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,400
And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.

1015
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,400
He was Sharkboy.

1016
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,520
Oh, really?

1017
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,200
You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.

1018
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,520
That kind of frightens me.

1019
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,520
And that's, it was the origin of Machete.

1020
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,520
Oh, okay.

1021
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,080
Well, that's okay.

1022
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,000
So does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under your box?

1023
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,240
They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.

1024
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,720
Pulp Fiction was Miramax.

1025
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,000
I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.

1026
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,300
So where's my Kill Bill video game?

1027
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,440
Maybe that could be a part of this.

1028
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,440
I don't know.

1029
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,640
It very well could be.

1030
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Very well could be.

1031
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,840
Especially if they do a sequel, which they weren't talking about doing.

1032
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
So that's it.

1033
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,980
You know, obviously no game announcements right now, but they are exploring these brands

1034
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,480
in the video game universe.

1035
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,200
I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening.

1036
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,240
Like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense.

1037
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,280
And yes, I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago.

1038
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,880
And you may remember, I mean it's not unlike, you know, movie studios to get into the game

1039
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
business.

1040
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,160
Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.

1041
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:58,480
I mean, Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot, they don't do anything console-wise

1042
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
right now.

1043
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,520
They like some online downloadable games.

1044
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,120
But Warner Games is a big one, for sure.

1045
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
And Disney.

1046
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Disney Interactive.

1047
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
All right.

1048
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:14,720
Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future, but right now, nothing but an announcement.

1049
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,520
And who knows, maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5.

1050
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Or 6.

1051
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Or 21.

1052
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Whatever.

1053
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,840
Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.

1054
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,640
Which is, I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies

1055
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:35,520
like Saw and all that stuff, but to me, Scream is like, I don't know, like, Scream is okay.

1056
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,960
I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not like Saw sick.

1057
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,960
I didn't mind the Scream movie, actually.

1058
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah, Scream's cute.

1059
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,360
I was just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?

1060
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Showgirls.

1061
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,160
Yeah, Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.

1062
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160
I'll see those.

1063
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Yeah.

1064
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,680
I just hope that Hayden Panterre is the before-the-credits killing.

1065
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,720
No spoilers in chat.

1066
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
I will destroy you.

1067
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,720
All right.

1068
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,720
Dark Saga.

1069
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
Well.

1070
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,000
Well, speaking of kids' movies and scary, Pokemons!

1071
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Yay!

1072
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,520
Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold two million units in the first

1073
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:17,120
two weeks in the U.S., and five million plus copies in Japan, so, uh, yeah, they've made

1074
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,520
their money.

1075
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,920
Seven million people playing the game.

1076
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,520
Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.

1077
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:30,280
Well, we were at, um, at Dimple, which is a local resell place, and they're saying that

1078
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,160
basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.

1079
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Oh, I'm sure.

1080
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Yeah, so.

1081
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,160
I can-

1082
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
Kids eat this shit up.

1083
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,440
Hell, adults eat this stuff up, too, like, you know, Miek LaTov, who's been on this show

1084
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
in the past.

1085
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,560
And he was playing Black and White, but he imported them.

1086
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,700
He imported it and he got the regular ones.

1087
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,700
But you know what?

1088
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:53,400
Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?

1089
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,800
Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.

1090
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,960
Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.

1091
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,080
The character I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old

1092
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,880
school Black and White Game Boy.

1093
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,880
You know what I mean?

1094
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,480
Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.

1095
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,840
Maybe Black and White does something different that I haven't seen yet.

1096
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,840
I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.

1097
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
I do kind of want to play it.

1098
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
Oh, Black and White, you can collect poop.

1099
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
Oh, yay.

1100
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,080
And their poop does special things.

1101
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,360
Oh, hooray.

1102
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,360
So yeah.

1103
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,880
Anyhow, so yeah, I'll probably check that out eventually, but you know there's going

1104
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,420
to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.

1105
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,420
You know what?

1106
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,420
Pokemon...

1107
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,420
You know what?

1108
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,760
I'm done with Pokemon.

1109
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,920
I'm really done.

1110
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,680
I would never say never, because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?

1111
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,400
Okay, that's different, but I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.

1112
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,840
Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.

1113
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,520
I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.

1114
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,640
There is sort of one that someone made called PokeFarm, like a website.

1115
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,360
I mean, official Reggie Fils-Aime coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have

1116
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,360
been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.

1117
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,360
You know Nintendo wouldn't do an MMO.

1118
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,200
I have it tied to my harem of women down here.

1119
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,360
You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.

1120
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,680
Too much that they couldn't.

1121
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,180
If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would

1122
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,040
want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.

1123
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,300
It'd be something like Animal Crossing.

1124
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,080
I think too, a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs, because

1125
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,360
Pokemon is so much for kids, like, you know, it would be an MMO with pre-determined phrases

1126
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,740
that you can say, and you know, it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO, but that would

1127
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:39,280
be better than nothing, but that's just me, so.

1128
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,760
The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.

1129
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,280
I read a list a couple days ago, it was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries

1130
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,280
that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game, and it's like, this

1131
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,040
Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.

1132
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,040
Cubone!

1133
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,040
Yeah.

1134
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,040
It was Cubone.

1135
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,040
Yeah.

1136
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,040
What?

1137
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
Really?

1138
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,400
This one is the soul of the dead child who comes back and eats other souls.

1139
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,520
I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and

1140
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,600
there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed, and it's supposed

1141
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,280
to be like an alien thing, but it's still like, dude!

1142
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,560
Not cool!

1143
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,400
You know?

1144
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,800
This might be, why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that.

1145
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,680
Maybe that hits a little close to home, especially for kids.

1146
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,440
Anyhow, let's move on.

1147
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,120
More gaming news, Loki.

1148
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah, so there's some rumored features that are going to be coming to Forza 4.

1149
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,760
This is coming from a special survey that they had.

1150
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:48,680
Of course, a survey that was not supposed to be leaked out, but I don't know what was.

1151
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,000
So, some of the information that people have gathered are speculating coming from there.

1152
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,920
Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able

1153
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,000
to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.

1154
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,600
So they're going to have some controller-free racing.

1155
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,480
I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.

1156
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,480
Like the U-Force?

1157
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,120
Like the U-Force or like Joyride.

1158
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:22,160
They're saying it's going to support over 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.

1159
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:29,880
They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode, a new career mode involving an

1160
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,280
automotive world tour.

1161
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,320
They're going to increase the variety in challenges and events that you participate in.

1162
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:43,880
The game's going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and

1163
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,400
shading models.

1164
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,600
Also I guess they're saying that...

1165
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,040
This is kind of cool.

1166
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,360
They're going to be doing...

1167
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,120
And once again, this is all you need to do in your damn games.

1168
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,800
Just make it better with Kinect by introducing head tracking.

1169
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,640
Awesome.

1170
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,740
And I guess they're going to also have voice control for menus and air faces.

1171
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
That is awesome.

1172
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,640
But hey, head tracking.

1173
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,640
It's not that difficult.

1174
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,800
Add it to every single goddamn first person shooter that you have.

1175
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
Done.

1176
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
I mean you don't need to have...

1177
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,360
You're still using a controller.

1178
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,600
It's just tracking your head to make it slightly more realistic.

1179
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,200
I have to admit that would be kind of cool.

1180
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,440
Why is that so difficult?

1181
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,440
I mean it...

1182
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Nintendo could be...

1183
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,920
As much as I am not a fan of the 3D metroids, it's the first thing that comes to mind with

1184
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,840
like a Nintendo backed first person shooter that would be really cool with the head tracking.

1185
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,800
Could you imagine a time crisis with head tracking?

1186
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,280
Where you peek over or around a corner?

1187
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,280
That would be cool.

1188
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
Police 9-1-1?

1189
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,200
Which was also one of the few machines they had at Roseville Golf Land.

1190
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
So police 9-1-1-2.

1191
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,760
One of the few machines they had that was working.

1192
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,760
I know, right?

1193
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,280
They should have, what was it, rescue 9-1-1.

1194
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,600
Sir William Shatner.

1195
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,600
No.

1196
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Well.

1197
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,400
Quick comment from our chat room at chat.orchestlandtrader.com.

1198
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,400
They're behind a little bit because of the delay, so it goes back to the Pokemon story.

1199
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,500
Act F wanted to correct something saying it's not...

1200
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,120
It's actually not called ground zero though.

1201
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,280
It's called Relic Castle.

1202
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,400
Maybe it was something to do with the translations.

1203
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,000
One of my friends is saying something.

1204
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,240
But of course, you know how rumors go.

1205
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
So alright, fine.

1206
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
There you go.

1207
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,480
A little correction issue there.

1208
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,640
Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza.

1209
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,240
Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.

1210
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,520
I don't know.

1211
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
Head tracking.

1212
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,840
I'm very interested to see that implemented in more games.

1213
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,920
I really think it's a good idea and it's simple.

1214
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,440
If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to

1215
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
be like, oh casual.

1216
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,440
Head tracking.

1217
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
That's all you got to do.

1218
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
And you can even say, hey look.

1219
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
It puts you in the game.

1220
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
And guess what?

1221
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,600
You don't have to use the stupid, you know, Kinect stuff if you don't want to.

1222
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,600
That's awesome.

1223
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,100
Well, now, I don't know if you guys remember when Nintendo did this.

1224
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,300
This was way before the 3DS.

1225
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,840
Way before the Game Boy.

1226
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
Even the NES.

1227
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,800
They used to do these little LCD Game and Watch games.

1228
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,200
That's where Mr. Game and Watch comes from.

1229
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
I've got a couple.

1230
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Yeah, I know.

1231
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
The old school stuff.

1232
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,080
The old Mario Brothers one and some other ones.

1233
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,560
I had the Cenet Mixer one.

1234
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,560
Oh, good times.

1235
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,560
Yeah.

1236
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,920
So yeah, these Game and Watch games are really old school.

1237
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,320
They even have like a Donkey Kong Jr. one and so forth.

1238
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,640
Well, there's this new website that came out this week and, or at least caught wind on

1239
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,640
the game blogs this week called Pikapeak.com.

1240
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,200
No that's not a Pikachu thing.

1241
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,400
It's maybe Pikapik.

1242
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
I don't know.

1243
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,160
P-I-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to check this out.

1244
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,360
You can actually play a variety of the Game and Watch LCD games, at least until this website

1245
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,360
gets shut down.

1246
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,160
But really, Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game and Watch

1247
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
games.

1248
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,160
I don't know.

1249
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
So yeah, I'm on it right now.

1250
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,780
I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here.

1251
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,780
Let's see.

1252
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,320
What did I find here?

1253
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Otto Slalom.

1254
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,320
That doesn't look like fun.

1255
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,240
I want to play Mario Brothers or something.

1256
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,240
Mary Cook.

1257
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,440
Oh, I remember this one.

1258
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,440
Good times.

1259
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh, you can even move back and forth.

1260
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,440
That's done very well.

1261
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,320
Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S

1262
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,920
and K. So let's see if we can start.

1263
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,440
Here we go.

1264
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,320
Good times.

1265
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,280
Listen to the sounds of LCD games.

1266
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,280
That's right.

1267
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,120
This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.

1268
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,120
Ooh, it looks like it's Russian.

1269
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,440
Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.

1270
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,320
Anyhow, good times.

1271
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,320
So check that out.

1272
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:35,280
T-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain

1273
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,960
you for like five minutes.

1274
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,640
Well let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.

1275
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:50,860
There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness

1276
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:55,920
of the romance in Dragon Age 2.

1277
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,960
And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer.

1278
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,880
And that he didn't like that...

1279
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,200
Basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.

1280
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,880
He's like, we are your demographic.

1281
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,160
You need to cater to us.

1282
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,120
Basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.

1283
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,120
We play the Sims.

1284
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,120
Yeah.

1285
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:22,240
And he's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us

1286
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,760
male gamers were happy.

1287
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,040
And he said, now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you

1288
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,040
don't speak for me.

1289
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,040
I love Dragon Age 2.

1290
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:35,160
But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.

1291
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,160
He also uses commas very poorly.

1292
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,560
So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of Bioware.

1293
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:53,840
Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer,

1294
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
we know you don't.

1295
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,080
I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight

1296
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,160
male gamers out there.

1297
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,920
And basically saying, you know, I'll read a few lines here and there.

1298
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,720
It says, the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer.

1299
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,900
They're for everyone.

1300
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,480
We have a lot of fans, many of whom are neither straight nor male, and they deserve no less

1301
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,560
attention.

1302
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,040
We have good numbers, after all, on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of

1303
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,440
content in DAO, and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea

1304
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,240
that the numbers are not insignificant.

1305
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:34,800
And basically going on, you know, it's basically saying, yeah, we don't care, you need to get

1306
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,000
your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world.

1307
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,800
And there's one paragraph, if you don't mind me reading it, that is like the most awesome

1308
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,800
thing.

1309
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,800
It's about lies to the world in general, and I think everyone needs to take this to heart.

1310
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,600
And if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility, it has to do

1311
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,760
with privilege.

1312
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,540
You can write it off as political correctness if you wish, but the truth is that privilege

1313
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,640
always lies with the majority.

1314
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:04,040
They're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance.

1315
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,440
They don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them.

1316
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,760
What's everyone's fuss all about?

1317
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,080
That's the way it should be.

1318
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,560
Anybody else should get used to not getting what they want.

1319
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:21,600
It's basically saying, well, yeah, everyone else might have catered to you, but hi, this

1320
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,760
is the real world and the universe doesn't revolve around you.

1321
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:29,120
And the part of the argument I don't get is that the game doesn't force you to do any

1322
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,640
particular path.

1323
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:37,000
Like, it's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.

1324
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,320
And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.

1325
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,440
This is an insanely popular series with women.

1326
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,440
Tiara is a big fan.

1327
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:45,440
Oh, yeah.

1328
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,000
I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.

1329
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,160
And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.

1330
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,960
I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.

1331
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
They were so cute.

1332
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,960
They were so adorable.

1333
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,640
How could anybody be upset about that?

1334
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,300
And on top of that, it gave you options that you could not go through with the romance.

1335
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,800
You could say the quote, wrong thing to make the romance not happen.

1336
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,120
It was totally like, it was, it was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.

1337
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,120
And what I also don't understand where this dude is coming from is it's like, well, have

1338
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,800
you ever watched an episode of Will and Grace?

1339
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,560
Like did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out or something?

1340
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,640
You know what I mean?

1341
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,060
It's kind of like, what's the big, even if, even if there really wasn't an option, a good

1342
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,360
game is still a good game.

1343
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,840
A good story is a good story.

1344
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,200
It's kind of like, what's your big...

1345
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,360
And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a

1346
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:51,680
bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I would say, homocentric is there's gotta

1347
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,400
be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well this makes me uncomfortable

1348
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,440
and it's gotta be personal insecurity, I think.

1349
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,360
My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play

1350
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,920
him as, with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the

1351
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,280
male NPCs that you could do a same sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit

1352
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,880
so that it's, you know, the way that the game is set up is to where you can tell, okay,

1353
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,660
well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.

1354
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:33,480
I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility even if it's

1355
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,460
not something that they would RP into the game themselves.

1356
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:40,800
Like they basically, if there is a same sex option, they want it buried so deep that you

1357
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,940
have to go to Game Facts and look up how to do it.

1358
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:48,820
They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game because they don't

1359
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,820
like it.

1360
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,860
And you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.

1361
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,500
It doesn't matter.

1362
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,880
You're going to have to get used to, you know, things are going to happen in life that you're

1363
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,920
not comfortable with.

1364
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,060
Things are going to happen that are not fitting in with your worldview.

1365
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,060
Get used to it.

1366
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,060
It's called reality.

1367
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,500
Let me also kind of phrase it this way.

1368
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,780
I'm sure this guy doesn't listen to the show, but let me like just kind of give you a dose

1369
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,700
of reality.

1370
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,580
Flip the tables, dude.

1371
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:23,840
I am a homosexual gamer and have been forever and I have to play through all these games

1372
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,940
that have straight storylines.

1373
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:30,620
Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these

1374
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,620
games?

1375
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,160
No, because they're stories.

1376
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:39,060
And like for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays

1377
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,260
a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.

1378
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,280
Like I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the

1379
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,940
time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time

1380
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,000
was so, you know, emotionally moving.

1381
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,620
Did I, was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?

1382
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:02,260
No, that's like, it does, a good story is a good story.

1383
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,260
You know what I mean?

1384
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:08,740
Well, I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.

1385
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:14,140
You think about this, when you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.

1386
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:19,700
And if it's in your character's nature to, you know, flirt with a girl, then you stay

1387
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,040
within your character's nature.

1388
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,080
If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.

1389
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:31,740
If they are completely, you know, say you're playing like the most uptight paladin, they're

1390
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:34,380
supposed to get uncomfortable whenever and anyone flirts with them.

1391
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,740
You know, that's the type of thing.

1392
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,940
You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing it if it's immersive enough

1393
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:40,480
of a game.

1394
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,620
And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.

1395
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,620
I don't know.

1396
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:51,940
I mean, but the whole point of you, the whole thing is that you are in game as your character.

1397
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:57,300
Unless it's saying you are you in the game, but no, you're playing this person that's

1398
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,740
living in this life at this time.

1399
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,540
And yeah, I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable, you know, show a little bit

1400
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,540
of interest?

1401
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,540
Hmm?

1402
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,540
It's just ridiculous.

1403
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,300
Bro dude needs to get over it.

1404
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,780
And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.

1405
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,520
B if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're

1406
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,380
forced to watch anal sex.

1407
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:19,380
Okay.

1408
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,380
I mean, let's be real.

1409
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,380
It's a fade.

1410
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,300
It's artful and you know, whatever.

1411
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:29,600
It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters

1412
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,320
you're not comfortable with, but let's face it, there's no game that's tacky like that

1413
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
at all.

1414
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,860
Except maybe the guy game.

1415
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,000
How many years ago was that?

1416
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's just the point.

1417
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:47,020
I mean, and if you're that insecure, then you know what, go find yourself a good therapist

1418
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,060
and deal with your insecurities instead of taking them out on developer of the game who

1419
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:53,220
is catering to their audience.

1420
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:57,540
Essex in our chat room says, I'm a big old queen, but I love Lulu in Final Fantasy X

1421
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,540
just for that outfit.

1422
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,540
Right?

1423
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:00,540
I know.

1424
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:01,540
She was beautiful and vicious.

1425
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,980
I was pissed that she wasn't really a central character in 10 too.

1426
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,120
I was a little upset though that she didn't look pregnant.

1427
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,120
That's true.

1428
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,260
Canyon in our chat room says my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.

1429
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,780
There you go.

1430
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:19,780
In a Final Fantasy X too, they made Lulu a stay at home mom.

1431
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,780
Totally destroyed her form.

1432
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,780
10 too.

1433
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,780
Oh, 10 too.

1434
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,780
That's right.

1435
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,780
All right.

1436
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,540
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates, some games coming

1437
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:32,340
out soon to a Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.

1438
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,340
Yes.

1439
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,540
Um, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

1440
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,580
Um, you know, not to mention, I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming

1441
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,540
out today because, well, it's today and not next week.

1442
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,660
Um, some other cool stuff though that will be coming our way.

1443
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:51,780
WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii and the PSP.

1444
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:57,220
Um, if you're looking for like an arcade style WWE game, kind of, uh, reminds me of like

1445
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:02,060
stuff that they had way back on, like the Super Nintendo NES, that kind of stuff.

1446
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:08,660
Um, Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360, of course a tie-in with the new movie, Hop on

1447
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:17,460
Nintendo DS, um, let's see, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation

1448
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:30,780
3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii, um, Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition

1449
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:38,780
that's, uh, coming out on PSP as well, um, Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3 and

1450
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:49,180
Xbox 360, uh, NASCAR 11 on, uh, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Country Dance, um, taking

1451
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:53,820
the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it, of course it's not actually

1452
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:58,840
by Ubisoft, it's kind of a knock-off, but, you know, same type of thing.

1453
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,820
And that'll be on the Wii, uh, Pinkalicious, based off of like some children's book, that's

1454
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:09,720
on Nintendo DS, Zuzu Puppies, yes, it's not hamsters anymore, it's just, you know, animals,

1455
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:17,420
so now that's coming out on Nintendo DS, and, um, and that would be it.

1456
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,620
Again, the chat's delayed a little bit, but I have to read this comment from chat, because

1457
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:25,500
I love it so much, before I get to the Japanese release dates, Bochikawa in our chatroom

1458
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,980
says, if it's a choice, it's a choice in a game, you've got another choice, don't play

1459
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:31,980
the game.

1460
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:32,980
Well said, my friend.

1461
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:36,660
Alright, on to Japanese release dates, what's coming out in Japan very soon.

1462
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,020
On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360, as well as a game

1463
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:46,660
called Nailed, no, that is not a sexual connotation, it actually looks like an ATV racing game,

1464
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:54,580
I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah, Top Spin 4, the, uh, did you see

1465
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:58,020
that very controversial Serena Williams commercial, I don't think it made our show world tonight,

1466
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,500
did you see that, uh, Top Spin 4 commercial?

1467
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
It was dumb.

1468
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:12,500
It was not even that, that controversial at all, so, alright, um, also moving on to, uh,

1469
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:17,680
releases on the Playstation 3, Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Top Spin

1470
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:24,460
4 there as well, um, moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing, cause things have dried up there

1471
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,460
a little bit.

1472
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:31,580
Um, on the 3DS, March 31st, uh, you have to look forward to Blaze Blue Continuum Shift

1473
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:38,500
2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imakai Sakyo Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then,

1474
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,220
uh, a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4 themed stuff.

1475
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:43,980
You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?

1476
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:44,980
You got it.

1477
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:45,980
So forth.

1478
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,980
Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here, cause sadly there's, like, nothing really

1479
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:54,060
coming out on the 360 or the PS3, but granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now,

1480
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,340
I'm sure some things kind of got moved around, so, you know.

1481
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:02,100
Uh, lastly on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift

1482
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:09,220
2 is out there as well, and, and, and, Oni Chambara Special, yeah, March 31st.

1483
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,860
Let's move on to Europe!

1484
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:17,340
Well, not a whole bunch, it's a short list, um, on the 30th we have Islands of Wakku,

1485
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:27,100
and Strania the Stella Machina, I guess, Machina, um, that makes me think of your cat.

1486
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,100
The Stella Machina?

1487
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,100
The Stella Machina.

1488
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,100
She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.

1489
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,100
No.

1490
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,500
She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.

1491
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,140
So I've seen.

1492
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,260
And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse, which, as Loki

1493
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,220
would have us believe, is awesome.

1494
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:47,540
It is very awesome.

1495
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,660
Is it like, ah, awesome?

1496
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:50,660
Yes it is.

1497
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,660
It's O-Face, apparently.

1498
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:52,660
It is that awesome.

1499
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:57,160
Alright, let's move on with some more news, we're just a little ways away from the classic

1500
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,900
game of the week, real good one this week too, one that I think a lot of you have played,

1501
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,540
but we'll get there after a couple more news stories.

1502
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:13,740
Ah, yes, um, so, this is always fun, um, Sony, and I don't really know if this is a big deal,

1503
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:20,620
but I guess they're transferring the online service operations, um, to a new division

1504
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:23,820
of their company, I guess.

1505
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:28,980
The Sony Network Entertainment Inc. instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America

1506
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,460
and that kind of stuff.

1507
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,460
I don't know.

1508
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,820
Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.

1509
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:42,180
It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like, I don't know, the people

1510
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:47,060
that run Ragnarok online or something like that, although that would be quite funny.

1511
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,660
I love Ragnarok.

1512
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:53,140
But um, yeah, okay, so, I don't know, a lot of people are covering this and yeah, it's

1513
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:59,140
coming, the change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into

1514
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:04,820
a new terms of service, blah blah blah, I mean, so what?

1515
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:10,100
So they're changing the name of that division.

1516
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,260
It's more of like a consolidation thing.

1517
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:13,420
It really doesn't seem like a big deal.

1518
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:17,420
I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot

1519
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:21,540
of our listeners do, I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always

1520
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:24,060
gives us the PSN updates and all that.

1521
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:28,980
It's consolidating with the one on the Playstation 3 and it sounds like a good thing.

1522
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:34,060
It's probably all moving towards something more unified for the NGP or whatever they

1523
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,780
ultimately call that thing.

1524
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:40,500
And honestly, if Microsoft does it, with the Zune points or whatever, I guess the Zune

1525
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,340
isn't around anymore, but you know what I mean, like the points for Microsoft on the

1526
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:50,100
360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune or on your PC through Windows

1527
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:53,440
Media, it's just competitive or whatever.

1528
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,160
It's no big deal, really.

1529
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:02,780
But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.

1530
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,460
I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.

1531
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:06,460
No, it's not.

1532
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:07,460
It's just, whatever.

1533
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,460
They're changing something.

1534
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,860
They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.

1535
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:17,140
They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account

1536
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,140
or...

1537
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,140
I don't know.

1538
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,260
I'd be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.

1539
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:25,180
That's all that matters.

1540
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:30,180
Alright, a couple updates for you on what's going on in the gaming community for Japan

1541
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,640
Relief and the tragedy that's happened over there.

1542
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,260
Some really cool stuff happening at Sega.

1543
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:38,020
Sega is auctioning off some very rare collectibles.

1544
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,780
There is a Valkyria Chronicles poster that's going to be auctioned off.

1545
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,660
A Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off.

1546
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,140
Lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega.

1547
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,660
If you want to see more information on that, go to their blogs, blogs.sega.com.

1548
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:54,220
A Yakuza track jacket.

1549
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:55,220
There's a lot of...

1550
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:56,220
A Dreamcast bag.

1551
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:01,100
There's like, I'm sure, tons of stuff in here where DarkSocko would be like, what?

1552
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,020
She's like, I have four of those already.

1553
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:07,860
Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3, I know she doesn't

1554
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
have that.

1555
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:12,260
Or Virtua Tennis Sweatbands, I don't think I've seen those before.

1556
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:17,020
But how about an Outrun art signed by Yu Suzuki, I bet Dan would be all over that.

1557
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,340
I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.

1558
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,660
Alright.

1559
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,020
But still, it's for Japan Relief, so it is a good cause.

1560
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,020
It's a good cause.

1561
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,020
It's a great cause.

1562
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:31,720
Alright, also going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.

1563
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,620
It's something that's on Facebook right now, and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.

1564
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,620
What is it?

1565
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,780
It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.

1566
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:45,380
It's gonna be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed

1567
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,060
to be on TV.

1568
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,900
But it's gonna feature folks throughout the gaming industry, Tim Schafer, Peter Molyneux,

1569
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,780
all these folks talking about how the Japanese have impacted the gaming industry for us and

1570
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,460
how the Japanese will continue to shape it in the future.

1571
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:04,220
And you know, folks from G4 and Destructoid are gonna take part in this as well.

1572
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:09,260
So you can check out more information on that, gamersheartjapan.com.

1573
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:12,340
And that's a whole special thing they're gonna put together that's just, you know, I think

1574
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:14,540
it's kind of similar to what the music industry did.

1575
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:17,220
You saw a lot of like music industry, Heart Japan.

1576
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,900
I wouldn't even say I saw somewhere on the internet like voice actors for anime, Heart

1577
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,900
Japan.

1578
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,660
I don't remember what they called it, but there's a lot of this like Heart Japan stuff

1579
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:28,060
going on right now, and you know, all for a great cause.

1580
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:33,700
So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty

1581
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,700
good.

1582
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:39,060
Like even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually

1583
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,100
sounds like an interesting special.

1584
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:45,680
And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.

1585
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,740
So very cool.

1586
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:51,500
I kind of, it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming

1587
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,900
industry to like a telethon type thing.

1588
01:16:54,900 --> 01:17:00,260
Like you remember when another big tragedy happened, Katrina and George Clooney put together

1589
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,020
all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief.

1590
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:09,540
This kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a, you know, different type of

1591
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,540
tragedy.

1592
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,540
So kind of neat.

1593
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,180
Definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds.

1594
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,180
I think it's a good idea.

1595
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:16,220
I think it's a great idea.

1596
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,740
So I'll be checking that out myself.

1597
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:23,020
All right, for now though, let's move on into the classic game of the week.

1598
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:26,620
You know, every week here on the show, we like to take a trip down memory lane and look

1599
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:31,580
at a game that helped us become who we are today.

1600
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:35,460
And this is a game that is near and dear to all of our hearts here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1601
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:36,460
It's not a music game.

1602
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,460
It's something else that's pretty awesome.

1603
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,500
It is dark soccer's classic game of the week.

1604
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,940
She's going to jump in the vault right now and pull that game for us.

1605
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,940
Dark soccer.

1606
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,940
What is the classic game of the week?

1607
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:51,220
Classic game of the week is dark stalkers, which in Japan was known as vampire and in

1608
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:54,780
Europe as vampire hunter.

1609
01:17:54,780 --> 01:18:03,860
There was a trilogy of these fantastic, super fun and one of my favorite games ever.

1610
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:08,020
I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before where we had the World

1611
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,780
Cup soccer and Killer Instinct.

1612
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:15,340
Well, this was another game that we had and there's this one guy who was super epically

1613
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,220
awesome at this game and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did and I felt so accomplished.

1614
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:23,260
But yeah, there were three different games in the series.

1615
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:27,060
There was a vampire slash dark soccer's.

1616
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:32,100
There was vampire hunter slash night warriors, which is the second one and vampire savior.

1617
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,980
And then there was a vampire hunter two and a vampire savior two.

1618
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:40,180
There were sort of upgraded versions and then the rereleases which came out later.

1619
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:47,860
So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this

1620
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:52,500
particular universe and hunters, but you've got, you know, your vampires.

1621
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:57,440
You have your ghost, your demon possessions, your zombies.

1622
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,440
The characters of the game.

1623
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,580
There was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbien, who was the werewolf, Victor

1624
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:10,100
von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein's monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was

1625
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:17,140
the succubus, Anna Kars, who's a mummy, Felicia, the cat woman, Bishamon, who was this possessed

1626
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:19,980
samurai armor.

1627
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:27,500
You had Riku, who was the fish man and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch, what a shock.

1628
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:34,260
And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot,

1629
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:39,260
like an ancient Aztec robot and Pyron, who is this flame guy.

1630
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:43,220
And it was a pretty cool game, lots of fun, very street fightery.

1631
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:47,860
You could air block and crouch walk and had chain combos and different things.

1632
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,260
You had a super combo, so you could do a special attack.

1633
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:57,580
And it actually would, though, drain as you played if you didn't keep doing stuff to refill

1634
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,580
it.

1635
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:03,460
It came out on PlayStation in 96 and had a new opening theme, which was really cool.

1636
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,100
But it was the theme for the American Dogstalkers animated series, which was kind of crap.

1637
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,860
And then we had Vampire Hunter, or Night Warriors, as it came out over here.

1638
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:15,260
So we got Donovan and Sienko in there.

1639
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:20,940
And you could also play as Huitzil and Pyron, still the bosses.

1640
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:26,540
And you had a normal mode, and then you had an easy mode that was an auto block mode and

1641
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:27,540
different chain combos.

1642
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,340
And it came out on the Saturn, which I've got this version.

1643
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,720
Super, super awesome game.

1644
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,860
It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the US.

1645
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,260
And of course, the Japanese version was the same, because the Saturn had more memory for

1646
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,260
it.

1647
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:47,580
So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jetta, who was totally

1648
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:55,980
my character for a while, and Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.

1649
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:00,380
And QB, who was always fun, and baby Bonnie Hood, which she actually had a better name

1650
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,380
in Japan.

1651
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,740
It was Bulleta.

1652
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,580
She was super fun to use.

1653
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,820
And I love her ending, because it's like this monster family watching TV.

1654
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:13,500
There's been this massacre, and everyone will watch out for a human person.

1655
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,940
They're like, oh, these humans are so scary.

1656
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:16,940
Keep us safe, daddy.

1657
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,500
I'll protect you, son.

1658
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:23,180
And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and

1659
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,180
everything.

1660
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,180
But anyway.

1661
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,980
Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.

1662
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:34,420
And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4-meg RAM cartridge.

1663
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:36,020
Got this one, too.

1664
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:39,340
And so it was fully arcade perfect.

1665
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,140
It was fantastic.

1666
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:46,580
And you could play as...

1667
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,980
It was all kinds of different bonus characters in it.

1668
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:56,140
You had Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.

1669
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:59,060
Shadow basically was...

1670
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:05,380
You could assume the identity of the defeated character in there, and then...

1671
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,460
So if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan, that type of game.

1672
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,660
It was really cool.

1673
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,100
And of course, like I said, there was also the upgraded ones.

1674
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:22,420
There's Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2 that were the upgraded versions.

1675
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,540
Different tweaks.

1676
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:28,260
You also had slightly different...

1677
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:34,140
I think that they redid some of the sprites for it, too, if I'm correct.

1678
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,260
And you also had Bishamon and Shadow as the secret characters, and you had Marionette

1679
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,140
that were basically mirror matches.

1680
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,980
And then there were the re-releases.

1681
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:49,940
There's Vampire Chronicle, which was the one that came out on Dreamcast.

1682
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:52,660
It was a Dreamcast direct mail order.

1683
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,100
And I believe I have that one, too.

1684
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,340
Pretty sure I do.

1685
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,380
And it came out over here as Dark Sulkish Chronicle, the Chaos Tower.

1686
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:03,000
There's a PSP version.

1687
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,900
There's also Dark Sulkers Collection that came out on PS2 in 2005.

1688
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,460
And then there was an animated series that was kind of crap.

1689
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:16,340
And then the OAV series, which is actually kind of cool, called Vampire Hunter the Animation

1690
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,360
Series put out by Viz.

1691
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:22,900
There were manga, different comics that came out.

1692
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:30,500
And then there was Dark Sulkers graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards

1693
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,500
and concept art.

1694
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,500
But that was put out by Udon.

1695
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,540
Udon is fantastic in their Capcom related art.

1696
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,060
I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.

1697
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,300
They are amazing artists.

1698
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:45,460
Their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.

1699
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:56,780
And then in Love Hina, actually, there were the main female characters were the costumes

1700
01:23:56,780 --> 01:24:03,380
of Boletta, Sienko, Felicia for Halloween in chapter 86 of the manga.

1701
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:07,540
And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia and Sienko.

1702
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:14,660
So this is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.

1703
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:23,740
UGO ranked it as number 19 and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Dark

1704
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,740
Sulkers coming out.

1705
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,740
That'll be awesome.

1706
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:29,380
I don't know how founded that is, but.

1707
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:33,380
Well here's a comment from Mr. J100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.

1708
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:37,940
I remember the MVC 3 panel at New York Comic Con someone asked the devs if they would consider

1709
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,540
making a Dark Sulkers sequel or remake.

1710
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:45,460
Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting

1711
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,460
it.

1712
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,460
Get on it.

1713
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:53,380
Well, you know what, imagine, okay look how well Street Fighter 4 did.

1714
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,820
Look how Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.

1715
01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:00,660
It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Dark Sulkers game.

1716
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:05,460
Bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then throw in some new ones.

1717
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,500
You've got all kinds of supernatural mythos out there.

1718
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,340
There's that Street Fighter cross Tekken game though still on the way that I think has gone

1719
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,300
to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.

1720
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,900
Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.

1721
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,740
That's the classic game.

1722
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:25,660
Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic, Dark Sulkers, what's that?

1723
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:28,460
Another hidden character, Dee.

1724
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:34,860
Which was the fully, you know Donovan was half Dark Sulkers, well there was the version

1725
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,820
of him that was all evil and vampirey.

1726
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:42,100
And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following

1727
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,460
around with him, only she's older, but it fades out and that's his ending.

1728
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,460
Alright.

1729
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:50,980
Well there it is, your classic game of the week, Dark Sulkers from the arcade by Capcom

1730
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,740
and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Dark Sulkers

1731
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:55,740
is definitely not forgotten.

1732
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:58,760
Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back

1733
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,660
with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com

1734
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,780
slash o-l-r.

1735
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:08,020
Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news, then we'll

1736
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,740
get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of The

1737
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:16,100
Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.

1738
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,780
We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

1739
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:26,980
this.

1740
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:29,340
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1741
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:35,580
We are live on this Sunday evening, March the 27th of 2011 with our 407th episode of

1742
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,020
Orange Lounge Radio.

1743
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:41,260
Welcome back, we had a fun first half talking a little bit about the 3DS launch and talking

1744
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:44,060
about BioWare and Forza and some other stuff too.

1745
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:48,420
We're going to get into plenty more gaming news and your twitter topics in just a minute

1746
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:53,380
here, but first we want to do some rapid fire news right after we do some plugs for our

1747
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:57,100
spinoff shows, or side projects if you will.

1748
01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:00,420
Dark Soccer, I believe your side project had a pretty big show this week, right?

1749
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:04,340
Yes, we had a fantastic show.

1750
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:11,880
The show that I do is called Comic Insanity, and it's basically comics, I do this with

1751
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:16,500
Tiara, who you've heard on the show, she's hosted before, Mar and Marvel, and also with

1752
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:22,820
Dan Shadow, and we basically discussed comics, but we had a special guest for our recording

1753
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:29,940
today, which you can hear on Tuesday, downloaded from Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

1754
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:38,580
We had Todd Stashwick on the show, and he is doing, actually writing an online comic.

1755
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:46,380
It's called Devil Inside, it's on his website, ToddStashwick.com, but he's also known in the

1756
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:54,300
TV sci-fi fan community as kind of a monster and bad guy, you know, he's taken those kinds

1757
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
of roles.

1758
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:59,300
He's been on Buffy, he's been on Angel, he's on Supernatural, one of my favorite episodes

1759
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,300
too.

1760
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,260
He played Dracula, that was cool.

1761
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,660
Like a black and white Dracula was really cool.

1762
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:08,340
He could have been a character in Dark Stalkers.

1763
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:14,980
But he's such a great guy, really fun to talk to, and geeked it up with us this morning,

1764
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:15,980
so it was really cool.

1765
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,980
Awesome.

1766
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,820
But read Devil Inside, seriously, it's good.

1767
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,580
Like anyone could get into this, it's so good.

1768
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:27,860
Well, the side project I had, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week,

1769
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:29,200
we did have a pretty exciting guest.

1770
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:33,100
If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, we're the best little Horde House

1771
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,100
in Azeroth.

1772
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:37,520
Now with a website, HordeHouse.com, finally, we have an official website for the show.

1773
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,140
So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and Extfer talking about it.

1774
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,420
And this week, we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle

1775
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:48,060
Madison from Video Game Outsiders, and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network,

1776
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,060
joined us.

1777
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,540
And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.

1778
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:55,400
Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Extfer and I, and I was really worried

1779
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,740
that Extfer was gonna make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time, she really

1780
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,040
played along with it.

1781
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,340
And Michelle had a book come out, and congrats to her.

1782
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,940
You may not know this, but she does the whole, her and her sister are behind the Damn You

1783
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:07,980
autocorrect.

1784
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:08,980
That is them.

1785
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:11,600
And they've had a lot of success with that and just had a book come out.

1786
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,980
So please support Michelle and buy that book.

1787
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:14,980
I think that's great.

1788
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:16,980
And other great podcasts on the All Games Network.

1789
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:22,180
Again, HordeHouse.com, even if you don't like WoW, apparently, I had my buddy Brad from

1790
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:26,300
Pod Culture said, I don't even really, you know, I haven't gotten into WoW, but your

1791
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,300
show was, you know, still pretty good.

1792
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,580
And it got me to get a trial account.

1793
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:32,580
Sucker.

1794
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Addict.

1795
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,580
No.

1796
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:38,020
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some rapid fire news.

1797
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:40,220
Loki, what else is going on in the news this week?

1798
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:50,060
You know, actually, I was reading GameStop was, I think, handing out free trial discs

1799
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,060
for a while.

1800
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:52,660
That's kind of neat.

1801
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:56,180
Anyways, so actual rapid fire news, though.

1802
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:57,940
Some pretty cool stuff.

1803
01:29:57,940 --> 01:30:01,940
Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstar Apocalypse.

1804
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:07,020
Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end, and that would be in the UK, where

1805
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:11,460
it's gotten a release date, March 31st, so you won't have to wait very long, actually,

1806
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,020
to play the game.

1807
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:19,420
And you know, if you really die in the play of the game, and you're not in the UK, it

1808
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:23,540
is region free, so import away.

1809
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,820
But let me really just give it a couple more weeks, it'll be out.

1810
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:31,140
But it is really awesome, so you should really pick it up.

1811
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:35,780
Some annoying game is expanding, and that annoying game would be Farmville.

1812
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,940
They're having an English countryside expansion.

1813
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:46,700
I guess it's for players level 20 and above, I guess if you log into the game, you will

1814
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:54,780
be greeted, I guess, by a crash landing zeppelin, and it'll begin the game's, they're calling

1815
01:30:54,780 --> 01:31:02,660
it the British Invasion, and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship, and

1816
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:09,260
he invites the players back to his homeland, where you can, you know, create farms there.

1817
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:10,900
Wait, wait, do you hear that?

1818
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:11,900
Wait, do you hear it?

1819
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:17,180
Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.

1820
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,660
Farmville news, Loki, what did you expect me to say?

1821
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,060
My mother cares.

1822
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:31,660
And finally, after a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.

1823
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:38,740
Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed, so it is still in beta.

1824
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:43,220
It might as well, you might as well have left it offline, because it would have been doing

1825
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:47,060
people more of a favor than actually them playing the game.

1826
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:49,820
You're terrible, but accurate.

1827
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:56,220
So apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were, you know, taking them offline

1828
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,020
to conserve power in Japan.

1829
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:09,380
They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also

1830
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:19,500
by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.

1831
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,380
Square Enix is cooking in the dark for the benefit of you all to bring the servers back

1832
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,380
online.

1833
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:26,820
Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.

1834
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,820
No, I know.

1835
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,700
But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.

1836
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,460
It might be a little warm.

1837
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,460
Crack a window.

1838
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,180
All right, moving on to other MMOs.

1839
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:40,180
This is a free one online that's pretty popular.

1840
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,740
Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later

1841
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,740
this year.

1842
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:51,060
I've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO, and

1843
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:55,780
it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, looks like an old school SNES type of little

1844
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,780
game.

1845
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:57,780
So obviously, it's graphic style.

1846
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:03,580
I've really drawn in a lot of users, 2.2 million concurrent users, meaning at the same time.

1847
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:04,580
So that's pretty awesome.

1848
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,620
It is coming out for Xbox Live later in the year.

1849
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,460
It will be published by Microsoft Game Studios.

1850
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:12,140
Now, it's a free-to-play MMO online.

1851
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:15,980
They sell items and other little enhancements for premium fees.

1852
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:16,980
Here's the deal.

1853
01:33:16,980 --> 01:33:20,460
The Xbox Live Arcade one, it won't be free-to-play.

1854
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,420
It's actually going to cost money.

1855
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:25,220
And this is the other weird thing.

1856
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:29,180
It might not really be an MMO either, because they came out and said, and this is from a

1857
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:34,940
Microsoft representative, it's not a freemium MMORPG.

1858
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:38,620
It's with online multiplayer features.

1859
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,020
So I don't know.

1860
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:42,980
Set the expectation bar a little low, but I don't know.

1861
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,420
It could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade.

1862
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:46,420
We'll see.

1863
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:49,980
If you've been following the Back to the Future games from Telltale, you'll probably be looking

1864
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:52,980
forward to the third episode of the series.

1865
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:56,140
And you can look forward to one of the voice actresses they've confirmed for it.

1866
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:00,680
Claudia Wells will be reprising her role as Jennifer.

1867
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,140
So pretty cool.

1868
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:07,100
Now, she was the original actress, I believe, in the sequels Elizabeth Shue took over the

1869
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,100
role.

1870
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:13,500
And the original Jennifer is back for the Back to the Future games.

1871
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,500
That's pretty cool.

1872
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,540
They've gotten a lot of the original voice actors.

1873
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:18,100
And one more story for you guys.

1874
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,180
The NPD put out a press release this week.

1875
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:24,460
Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?

1876
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,460
Imagine Babies.

1877
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:29,180
No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or

1878
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:30,720
maybe it was Call of Duty.

1879
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,460
Those games sell like crazy.

1880
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:36,620
Actually, apparently the best gross revenue game.

1881
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:41,660
We're not talking games that like sold the most number of units, but we're talking about

1882
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,800
what actually made the most money.

1883
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:51,260
Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock was the most money making game of the past generation.

1884
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:53,260
And they're canceling the series?

1885
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,800
Kind of ironic in that regard, but let's face it, three was the peak.

1886
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,060
It went really downhill fast from there.

1887
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,780
So you know, that was three came out concurrently with Rock Band, which by the way, was number

1888
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:05,300
five on the list.

1889
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:11,300
Isn't three the Guitar Hero that had like a million different skews of different combinations

1890
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,860
of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.

1891
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:18,380
Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.

1892
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,380
That's when it got really bad.

1893
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,380
No, that one.

1894
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:21,380
The band hero.

1895
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,280
The three was just guitar, not guitar.

1896
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:28,900
It wasn't, it was just as like any of the other Guitar Hero games, well, prior to that,

1897
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,220
any of the other Guitar Hero games.

1898
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:35,700
That's when they got to, you know, well, actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because

1899
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,860
it was just, you know, like Rock Band.

1900
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:42,580
It was game, guitar game, band.

1901
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:45,100
Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of too.

1902
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:47,220
I noticed that when I was playing the machine.

1903
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,820
I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week, so.

1904
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,820
Probably not worth it.

1905
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:54,620
No, it really wasn't because I failed the song, which pissed me off because the guitar

1906
01:35:54,620 --> 01:35:57,300
was broken and one of the buttons didn't work right.

1907
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:59,100
Uh, that's, that's terrible.

1908
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,100
What a surprise!

1909
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,860
Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Land if it's not broken.

1910
01:36:02,860 --> 01:36:03,860
Alright.

1911
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,340
Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.

1912
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,740
Dark Sakura.

1913
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:13,340
Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.

1914
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,780
Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.

1915
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:22,340
That will have a 900 point price tag.

1916
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,260
It's one of my favorite RPGs.

1917
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:27,500
I've actually gotten original of this too.

1918
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:32,580
Something about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it

1919
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:35,220
is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.

1920
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:38,300
And hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.

1921
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,420
Precisely.

1922
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:43,260
And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.

1923
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:47,700
There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.

1924
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:51,300
It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs.

1925
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:53,300
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.

1926
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,500
Don't you want somebody to love?

1927
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,820
And Santana's Black Magic Woman.

1928
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:03,780
Imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.

1929
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:04,780
Imagine that in pro.

1930
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:07,140
Wouldn't that be crazy?

1931
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:14,100
And then Dragon Force through the Fire and the Flames, and Operation Ground and Pound.

1932
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:17,020
So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.

1933
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:20,420
Kind of ironic, we just had a story about Guitar Hero, because that was one of the most

1934
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,820
memorable songs from that series.

1935
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:22,820
But Rock Band is awesome.

1936
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:23,820
And from 3, I think.

1937
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:24,820
Wasn't it?

1938
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:27,540
I think so.

1939
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:36,700
At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii points for the standard Rock packs, 160 points.

1940
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:43,260
And the Days of Peace pack will actually be 550 Wii points, or 440 Microsoft points.

1941
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:47,660
And then through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have pro guitar

1942
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:49,680
and pro bass mode.

1943
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:54,060
And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii points, or 80 Microsoft points.

1944
01:37:54,060 --> 01:38:03,700
And last but never least, we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

1945
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:06,740
And he's on fire.

1946
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:11,740
He's burning up, and he's got some bad red eye problems, so he's going to need some Visine.

1947
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:13,980
He's burning for you.

1948
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:19,980
And the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website.

1949
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:29,300
So definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're

1950
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,540
officially there.

1951
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:32,220
And the profile is there.

1952
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,220
And I will post that into the chatroom.

1953
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:35,700
So what exactly is Evil Ryu do that...

1954
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,700
Well, technically...

1955
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:37,700
Evil things?

1956
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,700
Technically...

1957
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:40,700
He kicks puppies.

1958
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,740
He's Satsui no Hadou Ryu.

1959
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:47,300
Because I guess Akuma is always like, give in to your fighting spirit.

1960
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,300
Okay.

1961
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:49,300
Join the dark side.

1962
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,300
That's what Evil Ryu is.

1963
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:54,460
If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Goku.

1964
01:38:54,460 --> 01:39:00,740
I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back, and it's all torn, and

1965
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:03,100
he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.

1966
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,100
Who's Oni?

1967
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,620
Is that like Evil Evil Goku?

1968
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:08,380
I think that would be, yeah, like Uber Goku.

1969
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,380
It's Eviler!

1970
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:13,660
Give in to your Evil Evil.

1971
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,540
There's voice samples on there too.

1972
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,020
Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.

1973
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:20,020
Alright.

1974
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,940
I'm gonna post this in the chatroom.

1975
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,660
Fun little soundboard to play with there.

1976
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:25,260
Let's go to the Twitter!

1977
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:29,820
Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, and every week we like to read your tweets.

1978
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:30,820
Tweet tweet.

1979
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:33,580
Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, let's look at some tweets.

1980
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:39,380
Some interesting tweets from 13X Forever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently

1981
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:44,460
are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.

1982
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:48,020
Now before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently

1983
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:51,620
what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment, it was a point

1984
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:56,800
and click adventure computer game, it was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.

1985
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,980
It was supposed to be I think after Warcraft 2, it was gonna be fourth quarter 97, so that

1986
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:06,900
would have been a little bit before Starcraft, kind of in that era, so this was like an old

1987
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:07,900
game.

1988
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:11,340
But randomly these YouTubes went up that we got linked to, so I'm just kind of taking

1989
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,020
a quick peek at how this played out.

1990
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:15,700
So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and

1991
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:16,700
those types of games.

1992
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,820
Oh the art in this looks pretty cool.

1993
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:23,500
Looks more SCUMM engine, but yeah it's within the SCUMM engine, LucasArts, King's Quest

1994
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,780
vein, that style of gameplay.

1995
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:30,340
Actually the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me, kind of that really like,

1996
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:35,700
really like very jerky motion cell animation stuff.

1997
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:39,220
It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking

1998
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:40,620
cancelled, you know what I mean?

1999
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:45,820
Oh there's a trailer here for this game actually, let me click on this and take a look at this

2000
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:48,040
real quick if it'll load.

2001
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:53,100
This is an old school trailer from like 97, let me just take a peek at this, what could

2002
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,220
have been, but is not.

2003
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:58,260
Let's see, pass the logo, come on people.

2004
01:40:58,260 --> 01:41:03,860
Three great wars between the human alliance and the orcish invaders have laid waste to

2005
01:41:03,860 --> 01:41:07,260
the once proud realms of Azeroth.

2006
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:32,860
See this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from Azeroth, this has been a whole

2007
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:47,660
new era.

2008
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:54,260
I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off

2009
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:58,460
into the novels, so if you're a lore nerd like I am, read the books and you'll get all

2010
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:01,060
the story from that game.

2011
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:06,100
Alright, Dark Tetsuya sends us a link, greetings true believers, I got your first Wondercon

2012
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,740
scoop right here about a new Spiderman game in the works.

2013
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:12,500
Dark Tetsuya very excited because he's going to Wondercon and promises to bring back lots

2014
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,400
of stories for OLR, but I guess there is a new Spiderman game that's supposed to be shown

2015
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:22,620
at Wondercon, yeah that's what they're saying, Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision

2016
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:26,340
Spiderman panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spiderman

2017
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,580
game is, check that out.

2018
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:33,100
Henderson Man tweets us at twitter.com slash OLR, how do you think the iPhone has hurt

2019
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:34,460
sales of 3DS?

2020
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:38,940
I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.

2021
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:43,660
The guy told me I was the only one who even asked, should Nintendo be worried?

2022
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:49,900
I would say no, mostly because it's still early and there hasn't been a lot of like,

2023
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:55,300
there haven't been commercials, they went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.

2024
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:00,180
There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing though, unless you're really gung

2025
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:06,380
ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind

2026
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,780
of like, ooh I gotta have that.

2027
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:14,160
There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good and there's a lot of blogs covering all

2028
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:19,760
that stuff and saying hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs but don't.

2029
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:25,740
It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top and yes,

2030
01:43:25,740 --> 01:43:32,740
as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.

2031
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:38,020
And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305 says this tweet

2032
01:43:38,020 --> 01:43:41,740
about Mortal Kombat download characters, I guess those were announced just recently.

2033
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:45,700
I'm actually very excited, one of my favorite characters from the series who came out later

2034
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:51,900
in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content, Kenshi, that was the blindfolded,

2035
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:55,380
he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters, and a character

2036
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,380
called Scarlet.

2037
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:03,740
Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist, she's kind of in that Ermac

2038
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:09,940
thing where there really wasn't a character named Scarlet, but I guess what happened is

2039
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:15,140
that sometimes the game would glitch out and create a red version of Katana or Mileena

2040
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:20,540
and she was referred to as Scarlet by the arcade going folk and so now they have actually

2041
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:26,300
made Scarlet a character and she's going to be a downloadable character, so kind of funny

2042
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,300
that they're doing that.

2043
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,300
I mean that's kind of where Jade comes from too, I mean Jade was a legitimate hidden character

2044
01:44:31,300 --> 01:44:35,300
but she was just a palette swap for green and had both Katana and Mileena's moves and

2045
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:40,220
now she's a whole, they gave her a big bar thing that she used as a weapon, kind of made

2046
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:44,500
her flesh her out as an actual character, so good stuff coming to the Mortal Kombat

2047
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,820
game that is out next month.

2048
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:52,460
I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs Sanrio, that's the license that

2049
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:53,460
I'll play.

2050
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:54,460
Kitty-ality.

2051
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:55,460
Yeah.

2052
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,460
Bad Batsumaru.

2053
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,460
I would think Cutality.

2054
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:58,460
Huh?

2055
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,460
Cutality.

2056
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,460
Friendship?

2057
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,460
Friendship?

2058
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:05,740
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, sorry to make you put down the 3DS lowkey

2059
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:06,740
but.

2060
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:07,740
It's alright.

2061
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:17,220
So this is kind of neat, Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of, well both Resident

2062
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:23,260
Evil 4 and Code Veronica, and they're coming over here as some download content, well not

2063
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:29,220
really, download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.

2064
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:33,220
No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the, you know, souped

2065
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:39,840
up visuals, but people love their Resident Evil 4, and I know even the Wii version with

2066
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:47,380
just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular, so I

2067
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:49,580
could see this doing pretty well.

2068
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:55,720
And you know, it's kind of the whole HD remake thing is really even popular lately, so not

2069
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:00,180
surprised to see it happen.

2070
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,180
Alright.

2071
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:02,860
Wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?

2072
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:08,220
Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being, you know, talked about as well, they revealed

2073
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:16,780
it in the official Xbox Magazine, it's not really, they haven't really said where it's,

2074
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:20,540
what's going to take place, they are saying that you can change the history of Resident

2075
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:30,500
Evil, and I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.

2076
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:38,820
So it's interesting, I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.

2077
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,820
Hmm.

2078
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:50,780
I don't know, it sounds interesting, not really a series I follow too well, I don't know.

2079
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,260
I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.

2080
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:57,500
I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.

2081
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:03,020
Alright, well let's talk about what will not happen, and apparently if rumors are to be

2082
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:08,900
believed, Bonk and Bomberman, those ports on the 3DS, not happening, and a lot of that

2083
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:12,020
has to do with what's been going down at Hudson Entertainment, of course they closed a big

2084
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:15,180
office of theirs not that long ago after the whole Konami takeover.

2085
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,500
Remember this way, I've played the Bonk game, it was terrible.

2086
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,500
On the 3DS?

2087
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,260
No, on the 3DS, on the Xbox Live Arcade.

2088
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:25,460
Oh yeah, well there was supposed to be one on the 3DS, and Bomberman, which would have

2089
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:29,540
been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff, but apparently it is not going

2090
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,540
to happen.

2091
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:34,740
Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no no no,

2092
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:38,980
that's not true, but those are the rumors going around right now.

2093
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:43,540
Apparently Konami went out and told Wired that the announcement didn't come from us,

2094
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:44,540
so it's not true.

2095
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:48,460
We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.

2096
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:52,540
Now the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all

2097
01:47:52,540 --> 01:47:55,820
this stuff, I mean they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little

2098
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:57,260
bit of controversy going on.

2099
01:47:57,260 --> 01:48:02,380
I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved, new development house,

2100
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:04,940
either way, you're not seeing them anytime soon.

2101
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:09,060
I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman

2102
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:13,780
wouldn't happen, Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's got to happen at some point,

2103
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:16,060
it's probably just not going to happen as soon as you'd like.

2104
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:17,060
We'll see though.

2105
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:25,180
Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over,

2106
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:31,860
Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be more than one game announced at E3.

2107
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:37,660
So the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5, maybe another Zone of the Enders, could

2108
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:38,660
be anything.

2109
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:42,460
Would it be cool if there was another Snatcher?

2110
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:43,460
No.

2111
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:45,740
Hey, you never know.

2112
01:48:45,740 --> 01:48:46,740
Never know.

2113
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:50,340
So, anything could happen.

2114
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:51,740
What would you like to see?

2115
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:54,420
Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.

2116
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:55,420
What would I like to see?

2117
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:56,980
I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.

2118
01:48:56,980 --> 01:48:59,060
From Kojima anyways?

2119
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:00,060
Probably that.

2120
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:03,860
The Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.

2121
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:07,000
I would be down with maybe like a Metal, I don't know, I want to see something new come

2122
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,360
out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid.

2123
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,360
Or Acid.

2124
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,620
It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.

2125
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:17,660
I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.

2126
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:21,300
And I think, didn't we already know there's a Metal Gear game coming on 3DS?

2127
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:22,380
I think that's inevitable.

2128
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,760
You're going to see that at E3 this year, it's whatever.

2129
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:29,920
And that'll probably be the big push from Konami at their booth this year is probably

2130
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,140
whatever Metal Gear game is in development.

2131
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:35,740
We're almost starting to see, and you know there's a new Silent Hill game, you're kind

2132
01:49:35,740 --> 01:49:38,060
of starting to get a sense of what games you're seeing at E3 this year.

2133
01:49:38,060 --> 01:49:40,060
But there'll be some surprises.

2134
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:43,700
I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.

2135
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:44,700
Alright.

2136
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:47,660
Could you imagine that?

2137
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:52,420
I thought he was supposedly like ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening

2138
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,420
there with that.

2139
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,420
I don't remember.

2140
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:55,420
Alright.

2141
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:59,500
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

2142
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,720
Ah yes.

2143
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,760
This is kind of neat.

2144
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,700
I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff really.

2145
01:50:08,700 --> 01:50:18,620
It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or really offensive stuff.

2146
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:25,580
Well they've, ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half Life 2

2147
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:26,580
and whatnot.

2148
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:30,460
They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.

2149
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:34,420
It's basically, yeah School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.

2150
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,420
Oh my god.

2151
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:36,740
Now who would find that offensive?

2152
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:40,380
I don't understand, that doesn't make any sense to me.

2153
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:45,120
But apparently I guess the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first

2154
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:51,980
person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.

2155
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,980
Yeah.

2156
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:57,900
I can't imagine why they would remove something so harmless.

2157
01:50:57,900 --> 01:50:59,500
I know, right?

2158
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,140
Why would someone even make that?

2159
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:04,620
Just knowing what, I mean, well I know why someone would make that.

2160
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:08,660
Someone made that to basically troll, because they could, right?

2161
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,620
I mean that's why you make this.

2162
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:14,260
To say like, heh heh heh, look what I made, it's really controversial and I shouldn't

2163
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,500
be making a game like this but I did.

2164
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:22,660
Yes, apparently I guess they're saying, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why

2165
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:25,140
they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right

2166
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:32,180
to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer-run site, the

2167
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:35,640
confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.

2168
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:44,580
And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well and it says, I guess

2169
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:53,380
they have the boring effect that someone took from that bullet storm duty calls viral game

2170
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:55,900
thing that they put in there.

2171
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:59,140
I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.

2172
01:51:59,140 --> 01:52:00,740
Really?

2173
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:04,060
That's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.

2174
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,060
Only a matter of time.

2175
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:10,660
Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they're playing school shooter, oh my god.

2176
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:14,620
How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game

2177
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:16,900
school shooter by Valve.

2178
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:20,840
Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban but they also get Half Life 2 banned and that's

2179
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:24,140
when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off and.

2180
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,740
And the game turned you gay.

2181
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:32,380
It turned you gay, so very gay.

2182
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:39,260
Alright enough about that, silly mods, although I have to admit I probably would play it once

2183
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:44,500
just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment, alright.

2184
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:49,380
It's probably dumb, I mean, it's probably a terrible, terrible game.

2185
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:53,700
There was a very interesting competition that took place recently, it was the Kong Off is

2186
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:58,260
what this was called, some photos have gone up from the event which was just held recently,

2187
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:01,580
it was held in New Jersey at Richie Knuckles Arcade Games.

2188
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:03,140
What was so special about the Kong Off?

2189
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:07,820
Well, god, it's the story that won't go away about the high score for Donkey Kong.

2190
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:10,740
And you now have three people battling for it.

2191
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:15,500
There's Steve Weeby and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie, The King of Kong.

2192
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:19,420
And then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who, as we reported last week, is going to have

2193
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:21,460
his own movie now coming out.

2194
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,460
All this stuff.

2195
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:26,620
All of them were in the same building at this Kong Off, so that's pretty cool.

2196
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,300
So who ended up winning?

2197
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:31,220
Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong Off.

2198
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,940
And second place, Steve Weeby.

2199
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:38,700
Seventh place, Billy Mitchell, out of ten.

2200
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:41,500
I would have loved to see the look on his face.

2201
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:46,600
But you are talking about ten like godly Donkey Kong players and it's so funny how this game

2202
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,820
is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.

2203
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:53,980
I wonder if the guy, I think he like, beat the top scorer of Missile Command and he plays

2204
01:53:53,980 --> 01:53:54,980
with his feet.

2205
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:55,980
Mhm.

2206
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:56,980
Seriously.

2207
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:58,780
Is that Captain Awesome?

2208
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:02,420
They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his

2209
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:03,420
feet.

2210
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,420
That's awesome.

2211
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:10,020
SX in our chatroom says Kong Off sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.

2212
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,400
No, no, it's nothing like that.

2213
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:17,900
But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing

2214
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:19,180
their Donkey Kong.

2215
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:21,340
I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.

2216
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:24,260
Stop it, Loki.

2217
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:25,260
Stop it.

2218
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:29,020
Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.

2219
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,900
I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.

2220
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:35,820
They've made these like special flyers that say the Kong Off.

2221
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:39,860
I mean, these dudes like love Donkey Kong.

2222
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:44,180
I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.

2223
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:45,960
I have to give kudos for that.

2224
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:51,420
I mean, if you're going to go in, go all in, right, on this classic stuff.

2225
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:53,780
So there's, there's big love for Kong.

2226
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:54,780
All right.

2227
01:54:54,780 --> 01:55:00,500
There's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called List List.

2228
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:06,860
Now, we haven't done a list list in a little while, it's been a few months, so let me recap

2229
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:08,740
how list list works.

2230
01:55:08,740 --> 01:55:14,040
We are about to make the definitive list about a certain topic and it's a scientific process

2231
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,180
and once we've made up the list, it's done.

2232
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,180
There's no arguing.

2233
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:18,200
It is, it is done.

2234
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,720
This is the list, okay?

2235
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,740
And the way it works is that we're going to go around the room and Dark Sakura, myself,

2236
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:28,380
Loki and tonight's guest Salacious Pop, we're all going to pick three things that we think

2237
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:30,780
should go on the list around the topic.

2238
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,860
Then we go to the elimination round and each take one item off the list.

2239
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:39,340
So that will leave us with a list of eight items that the chat room will then vote on.

2240
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,280
Their number two and their number one picks.

2241
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:46,920
So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

2242
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:50,380
So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do

2243
01:55:50,380 --> 01:55:53,220
with the 3DS launch, so here it is.

2244
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:59,360
The list list tonight, fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant

2245
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,360
buy.

2246
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:04,860
I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because,

2247
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:08,140
you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is

2248
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:11,260
it's kind of lackluster launch title.

2249
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:12,340
Launch titles.

2250
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:15,260
So folks are saying maybe there's some games you should wait for.

2251
01:56:15,260 --> 01:56:19,260
Well tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch

2252
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:22,940
titles would have made the system an instant buy.

2253
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:24,980
All right, here we go to list list.

2254
01:56:24,980 --> 01:56:28,340
And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for

2255
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:32,700
the list because if one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually

2256
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:36,660
turn to chat to help us kind of round up, round out the list.

2257
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:37,660
So who wants to start tonight?

2258
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:39,660
I guess we'll go with Dark Sakura.

2259
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,340
Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?

2260
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:44,180
What is the number three item on your list?

2261
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,180
It's not a game.

2262
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,180
It's an item.

2263
01:56:46,180 --> 01:56:47,180
That's fine.

2264
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:48,180
It's a launch title.

2265
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:49,180
Doesn't mean launch game.

2266
01:56:49,180 --> 01:56:54,460
A lenticular photo printer.

2267
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:57,600
And what would be, what would the lenticular photo printer do?

2268
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:00,420
It would print up your images in 3D.

2269
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:03,460
Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.

2270
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:06,780
So like, kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D?

2271
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:07,780
Yeah.

2272
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:08,780
Okay.

2273
01:57:08,780 --> 01:57:11,820
So it would print one layer, print a second layer.

2274
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:15,940
It'd be huge probably, but I'd still think it would be neat to have something like that.

2275
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:23,060
I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my Wang that I would take.

2276
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:26,940
Slaces Pop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.

2277
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,020
The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.

2278
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:33,420
Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.

2279
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:37,540
I'd buy that.

2280
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:42,340
And how exactly would Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster work?

2281
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:49,300
Jubble physics in 3D and you shoot aliens and you get, you get, you get grease from

2282
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,740
your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.

2283
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:56,340
You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.

2284
01:57:56,340 --> 01:57:58,580
Brings a whole new meaning to screw attack.

2285
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:00,440
All right.

2286
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:01,580
I guess I'll go next.

2287
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:06,300
The number three thing that launch title that would have made me get a 3DS right today,

2288
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,580
first thing, um, how about F-Zero 3DS?

2289
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:12,060
I'm going to go a little serious here.

2290
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:14,180
Where's my fucking new F-Zero game?

2291
01:58:14,180 --> 01:58:15,180
F-Zero 3DS.

2292
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,820
Loki, what's your number three answer?

2293
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:19,020
Well, this is a more of a serious route.

2294
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:24,300
I swear that this is in development because I, I thought I saw some sort of screenshots

2295
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:31,660
or something like this, but, uh, Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.

2296
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:36,660
Excite Truck is awesome, not that this is Excite Bots bullshit though, Excite Truck.

2297
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:37,660
Excite Truck.

2298
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:42,580
Hell, you don't even have to do anything different, put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks,

2299
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:43,580
everything.

2300
01:58:43,580 --> 01:58:49,260
Although I would like it if you did something, but you know, if you don't have to, then fine.

2301
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:55,220
So far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and

2302
01:58:55,220 --> 01:58:56,580
Excite Truck 3DS.

2303
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,900
Dark Sakura, what's your number two?

2304
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,100
Planet Harrier.

2305
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:05,380
I love this game, I have only gotten to play it a few times, there's been no home version

2306
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,380
released.

2307
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:10,180
Don't you think it would be about time for it to, you know, something like that to come

2308
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,180
on 3DS?

2309
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:16,780
You know, it's, it's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.

2310
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:20,420
I can see a lot of those, like, old school, like, Sega shooters and I think of 3D World

2311
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:22,100
Runner, like, for the NES.

2312
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:27,060
But those, this sort of first person, not kind of first person, but those, those perspective

2313
01:59:27,060 --> 01:59:30,540
games would be perfect for that type of screen.

2314
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:31,540
So, I'm with you.

2315
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,100
My vote is Planet Harriers.

2316
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:34,100
All right.

2317
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:38,260
Slasius Pop, your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today.

2318
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:43,100
Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, Migraine and Vertigo Edition.

2319
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:47,780
What exactly is Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo

2320
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:48,780
Edition?

2321
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:53,860
Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames

2322
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:58,220
to make the 3D, they make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have

2323
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:59,220
to lay down.

2324
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:03,660
Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image

2325
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:04,660
or something.

2326
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:05,660
They have that already.

2327
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:08,340
It's called, um, Ridge Racer.

2328
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:09,740
All right.

2329
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:15,380
Uh, game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.

2330
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:20,620
I'm going to say, Breasts 3D.

2331
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:26,060
All it would be, would be pictures of breasts in 3D.

2332
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:30,420
And I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that, cause who doesn't love boobs,

2333
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,980
gay or straight or whatever you are.

2334
02:00:31,980 --> 02:00:35,460
Does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it, it has a little bead

2335
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,140
that it can tell, so you can shake, you can shake it.

2336
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:42,220
It would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again is

2337
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:46,300
that you could just, you could, you know, you could motorboat the boobs if you want,

2338
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:48,900
but it's not, it's not just restricted to Samus Aran.

2339
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:52,860
Like I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster, but I want to see just,

2340
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:54,420
just boobs.

2341
02:00:54,420 --> 02:01:01,540
Little boobs, big boobs, lopsided boobs, boobs, fake boobs, real boobs, more boobs.

2342
02:01:01,540 --> 02:01:04,340
You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up

2343
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:06,340
to a person.

2344
02:01:06,340 --> 02:01:07,340
Yeah.

2345
02:01:07,340 --> 02:01:11,340
That would be a perfect mode.

2346
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:15,620
It would actually use the whole like, uh, what is that, the, the, the camera on the

2347
02:01:15,620 --> 02:01:18,620
backside for those like, uh, virtual reality type simulations.

2348
02:01:18,620 --> 02:01:23,540
And like, if I, if I point the camera at Jamie just suddenly like random boobs will show

2349
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:25,500
up.

2350
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:26,500
She's frowning.

2351
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:27,500
She's making a frowny face.

2352
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:31,460
Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing, thank you.

2353
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:33,620
My boobs are epic.

2354
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:36,860
All right, Loki, your number two pick launch title for the 3DS that would have made you

2355
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:37,860
buy one today.

2356
02:01:37,860 --> 02:01:40,700
Uh, just what you said made me forget.

2357
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,780
Um, it is, oh yes, of course.

2358
02:01:43,780 --> 02:01:47,620
Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.

2359
02:01:47,620 --> 02:01:49,900
That would be so amazing.

2360
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:54,460
I can take Earth Defense Force with me since the PSP version is not yet announced.

2361
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:55,460
Come over here.

2362
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,460
All right.

2363
02:01:56,460 --> 02:02:00,740
Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS going into the number ones.

2364
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:05,980
We have lenticular photo printer, Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster, F zero 3DS excite

2365
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:12,260
truck 3DS planet Harrier, Zelda eight bit 3DS migraine and vertigo edition breasts 3D

2366
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:15,940
and Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS.

2367
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:17,700
Let's get into the number one.

2368
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:20,820
This is, you just fucking need it.

2369
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:25,700
Dark Sakura, the new guardian legend, duh.

2370
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:27,540
It's my list.

2371
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:33,960
The new guardian legend in 3D in 3D because we're going to be at guardic and he had guardia.

2372
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,560
So I guess the Japanese name of this would be shin guardia.

2373
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,980
I don't care what the fuck they call it.

2374
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:40,980
Just put it out already.

2375
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:41,980
I know, right?

2376
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:42,980
Damn it.

2377
02:02:42,980 --> 02:02:43,980
Nintendo or compile.

2378
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:49,220
I realize compile needs to reform somehow, but just, just do it reform and put out.

2379
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:50,220
All right.

2380
02:02:50,220 --> 02:02:51,220
Thank you.

2381
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:54,260
Please put out XOXO slashes, pop number one.

2382
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,260
You need it.

2383
02:02:55,260 --> 02:02:56,260
You need it now.

2384
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:57,260
I'm 3DS.

2385
02:02:57,260 --> 02:03:04,520
Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer.

2386
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:08,500
And how exactly would Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer work?

2387
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:13,380
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

2388
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:17,060
And it has a built-in calendar days of the week.

2389
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:20,820
Did I break Rob?

2390
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,820
Is he upset?

2391
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:23,500
No, I'm just regretting some things.

2392
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,500
All right.

2393
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,500
I'm kidding.

2394
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,500
All right.

2395
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:27,500
Let's move on.

2396
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:32,220
Number one answer from me, the 3DS game we most need to see.

2397
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,220
What did they call that?

2398
02:03:33,220 --> 02:03:34,220
The, the virtual reality.

2399
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:35,220
I'm calling it wrong.

2400
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:39,140
What's it, what's it really supposed to be called the like the face blaster.

2401
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:40,140
What is that?

2402
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:41,140
The augmented reality.

2403
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:42,140
Thank you.

2404
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:43,140
Augmented reality.

2405
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:44,460
It's an augmented reality game for you.

2406
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:47,220
And I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.

2407
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:57,700
Augmented reality, Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.

2408
02:03:57,700 --> 02:03:58,700
That's right.

2409
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:02,060
You can go to Golf Land and just, you know, then suddenly the little kids there celebrating

2410
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:08,100
their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts.

2411
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:11,380
You know, it's Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.

2412
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:19,580
All right, Loki, number one game you most need to see on the 3DS, uh, an actual innovative

2413
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:28,580
game from Nintendo, you know, something that perhaps is not, you know, funny, I don't think

2414
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:32,820
this is actually a launch title, but just, just, just a description, an actual innovative

2415
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:38,500
game from Nintendo, you know, like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that

2416
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:39,500
they put out.

2417
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:45,020
You know, like for example, Animal Crossing, it's been the same for a while now and, you

2418
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:51,940
know, uh, even some of the other, like, you know, they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games.

2419
02:04:51,940 --> 02:04:53,420
They're just, Oh, now they're in 3D.

2420
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:56,780
I mean, come on innovation here.

2421
02:04:56,780 --> 02:05:01,680
This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?

2422
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,260
Like new, just because it's all the mascots that we...

2423
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,260
Wii Music.

2424
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:06,260
No, Wii Fit.

2425
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:07,740
I would say Wii Fit.

2426
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:08,740
But that's not...

2427
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:12,140
We have anything iconic though, like a Mario or a Kirby.

2428
02:05:12,140 --> 02:05:13,140
Wii Sports.

2429
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:17,100
What about WooHoo Island?

2430
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,580
So basically we're getting Kirby's Crochet Carnival is what you're saying.

2431
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:26,660
Actually, no, I do have a name for my innovative game, WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

2432
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:29,940
You want to change your answer to WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch?

2433
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:30,940
Yes.

2434
02:05:30,940 --> 02:05:31,940
All right.

2435
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:36,060
So an actual innovative game from Nintendo is now WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

2436
02:05:36,060 --> 02:05:37,060
Yes.

2437
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:40,940
Wouldn't that just be Dead Island?

2438
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:44,380
It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that

2439
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:45,380
void.

2440
02:05:45,380 --> 02:05:46,380
All right.

2441
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:47,380
WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

2442
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,380
All right, here we go.

2443
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:49,740
Here's the list as it stands right now.

2444
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:55,660
Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Trek

2445
02:05:55,660 --> 02:06:02,580
3DS, Planet Harrier, Zelda 8-Bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition, Brest 3D, Earth Defense

2446
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:09,020
Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, Rebecca Black's Preteen Convertible Off-Road Racer,

2447
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:14,620
Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper 3DS, and WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

2448
02:06:14,620 --> 02:06:18,220
Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.

2449
02:06:18,220 --> 02:06:21,940
We're going to start with Dark Sakura, but for now let me read some of the suggestions

2450
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:23,860
you guys had in the chat room.

2451
02:06:23,860 --> 02:06:31,020
Akdev suggested Furi vs. Cosplayers 3DS, SHA100Matt suggested IHOP Restaurant Fighter 3DS, Tiger

2452
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:36,980
Claw said DDR 3DS, IHOP Restaurant Fighter, now would that be the actual restaurants fighting

2453
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:38,340
because that could be very cool.

2454
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:44,220
No, actually in my mind it's Denny's, like go on YouTube and Google Denny's Fight Oakland,

2455
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:46,420
it's great.

2456
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:50,700
The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes, amazing.

2457
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:58,820
SHA100Matt says Killer Instincts 3DS, Ray Deer in chat says Rob's Ass 3DS, hey, let's

2458
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:05,980
see, AkumaJP says 3D Cat Ball, you know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer,

2459
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:13,420
SJ100Matt says Match Game 3DS, DJBlazekin says Space Channel 5 3D, SJ100Matt says Betty

2460
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:19,460
White Simulator 3DS, what, you'd just be badass the whole time, is that what that is?

2461
02:07:19,460 --> 02:07:26,460
Akdev says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR Technology, I am surprised, that sounds like an announcement

2462
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,460
to you Furi right there.

2463
02:07:27,460 --> 02:07:31,980
And Dark Tetsuya said Gals Panic 3D, alright, those were the runners up but let's get back

2464
02:07:31,980 --> 02:07:35,660
to the list, unfortunately it's just the way the game works, these are all amazing answers

2465
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:41,220
but unfortunately the way the game works, things have to go, it's part of the process.

2466
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:45,140
So Dark Sakura we'll start with you, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2467
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:54,580
First of all you need an apostrophe in blacks, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrated Vertigo

2468
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:59,700
Edition because I have a Virtual Boy, and the game's pretty much already out as Ridge

2469
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:00,700
Racer.

2470
02:08:00,700 --> 02:08:04,020
Alright, sorry Alan it has been stricken from the list.

2471
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:07,060
Salacious Pop your chance for revenge or you could go for something else, which of these

2472
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:11,980
items is not worthy of the list?

2473
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,460
The Golf Land birthday party.

2474
02:08:13,460 --> 02:08:19,280
Oh you're killing me, why are you taking that off the list?

2475
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,820
Well there's serious answers and there's my smart ass answers and I can't take down one

2476
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:25,580
of mine so.

2477
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:30,580
Alright there you go, it is removed from the list much to the sadness of the chat room.

2478
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:35,020
My turn to strike one from the list, I'm sorry to do this but Loki, WooHoo Island Zombie

2479
02:08:35,020 --> 02:08:41,500
Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it, alright, alright so Loki, which

2480
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,340
of these is not worthy of the list?

2481
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:48,260
Lenticular Photo Printer, I mean having taken some of the photos are not that impressive

2482
02:08:48,260 --> 02:08:50,300
and would not want to print them out.

2483
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:53,620
Alright so maybe, it's just too soon for the Lenticular Photo Printer.

2484
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:54,620
We have a balanced list.

2485
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:59,860
Yeah I was going to say everybody took some, everybody lost one so it's very rare that

2486
02:08:59,860 --> 02:09:02,540
that happens, usually someone gets picked on.

2487
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:05,960
So here you go, here is what you guys in the chat can vote on, I'm going to read this list

2488
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:07,100
one more time.

2489
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:12,020
You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers, you gotta

2490
02:09:12,020 --> 02:09:13,700
message me those.

2491
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:17,300
You need to mark them as number one or number two or I will assume that the one you name

2492
02:09:17,300 --> 02:09:20,620
first is your number one and the one you name second is your number two.

2493
02:09:20,620 --> 02:09:23,740
By the way you're getting boos in the chat room for taking off Golf Land first season.

2494
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:25,620
What's your handle in chat this week?

2495
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:26,620
It's Skye.

2496
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,620
Okay got it back.

2497
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:28,620
Alright yes I got it back.

2498
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:30,960
So send a private message to Skye with your number one and number two votes.

2499
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,540
Here is the list that you can vote on right now.

2500
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:41,300
Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,

2501
02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:49,220
Brest 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's pre-teen

2502
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:50,660
convertible off-road racer.

2503
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:52,660
I can't believe that made it through.

2504
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:55,580
Alright I would play that.

2505
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:57,060
I would play as the girl in the braces.

2506
02:09:57,060 --> 02:10:01,180
It probably would be, yeah I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.

2507
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:04,540
Alright so yeah that's going to do it.

2508
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:08,100
Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.

2509
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:13,220
Place your votes and we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.

2510
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:17,440
For now though we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.

2511
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,500
Every week you guys send us emails.

2512
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,260
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2513
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:24,820
Again that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2514
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:27,820
It was looking really thin this morning so I put a call out on Twitter.

2515
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:28,820
Did it work?

2516
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:29,820
Did we get some emails?

2517
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:30,820
We have two.

2518
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:31,820
That's better than zero.

2519
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,820
Alright.

2520
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:33,820
But not better than F-Zero.

2521
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:34,820
F-Zero is awesome.

2522
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:40,900
This first one comes from RaBaba.

2523
02:10:40,900 --> 02:10:46,220
I'm surprised the Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on

2524
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:47,220
American TV.

2525
02:10:47,220 --> 02:10:51,400
If you've ever seen them it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager

2526
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:54,140
talking about the things they use their PCs for.

2527
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,440
Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.

2528
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:02,900
Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.

2529
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:07,180
It implies that if you play MMOs you're automatically a threat to PC security.

2530
02:11:07,180 --> 02:11:11,080
I find this offensive not to the point of emotionally offended but the overly negative

2531
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:14,340
stereotype that is also completely wrong.

2532
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:15,980
New Zealand gets Jackie Chan ads.

2533
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:18,380
No fair RaBaba.

2534
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:20,380
Agreed.

2535
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:22,380
And last email.

2536
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:26,540
Oh no punctuation.

2537
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:30,580
Yay your favorite.

2538
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:35,940
And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.

2539
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,140
That sounds like what auto correct would do.

2540
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:39,140
I know.

2541
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:44,940
Yesterday was great especially the second round of laser tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.

2542
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:48,700
It was the last 10 to 30 seconds I was on the high rise and these three little kids

2543
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:54,220
just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off a one by one in 1.5 seconds

2544
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:57,300
enacting a triple kill.

2545
02:11:57,300 --> 02:12:01,700
It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp most of them being from

2546
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:07,540
preschool to fourth grade fun times punctuate the sad parts of my experience was when I

2547
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:12,100
went down there was no BeatMania 2DX.

2548
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:18,220
I know what 2DX is person and Para Para second mix game would be and there was it was nowhere

2549
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:19,220
to be found.

2550
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:23,380
I saw that they sold it in their place was a theta screen Daytona USA in a four player

2551
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:28,980
Mario Kart I shouted in my head WTF first keyboard mania then pop music now Para Para

2552
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:32,060
then guitar freaks now BeatMania fuck you.

2553
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:35,220
That's my translation of the all caps.

2554
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:40,460
This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate

2555
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:46,140
wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play

2556
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:53,260
except drum mania V3 DDR Max 2 6th mix oh 6th mix and dance dance revolution 5th mix

2557
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:54,980
and in the group too.

2558
02:12:54,980 --> 02:13:00,320
If only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones

2559
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:09,180
like DJ Max Technica and G beat and dare I say it gulp pump it up pro maybe then maybe

2560
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:15,980
they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.

2561
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:20,720
Peace out DJ Blaze kid PS if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced

2562
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:24,820
to buy an import just to play all the good music games.

2563
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:27,820
There isn't an arcade like AI anymore I hate to say it.

2564
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:36,100
It was AI an AI RIP yeah all right if you want to send us an email mailbag at orange

2565
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:42,260
lounge radio dot com I put the last call out for listless votes so hopefully we're gonna

2566
02:13:42,260 --> 02:14:02,660
tally those up but not before we do some angst grr argh angst time.

2567
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:14,220
FUs of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum

2568
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:22,340
so I'm gonna say I feed a gluten and meat neither of them agree with me no matter how

2569
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:31,920
tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is so I'm telling them goodbye for a while goodbye

2570
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:38,640
I will sort of miss you but my stomach won't done Loki F you the people have turned too

2571
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:42,980
damn slow in their cars there's some people that for some reason they need to slow down

2572
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:48,160
the one mile per hour to make a turn into a driveway of a plaza it doesn't even have

2573
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:53,540
a curb or anything it's just I don't understand it I mean I can make turns a lot faster than

2574
02:14:53,540 --> 02:15:01,020
that and it just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow or when they're merging lanes

2575
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:04,980
I love these people they're just like oh I'm gonna cut in and out lanes I have my turn

2576
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:09,700
right turn signal on but I'm just gonna assume that one turn signal on means I can go any

2577
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:18,780
way I want so fuck you the bad drivers um my fu the whoop not ready for that song yet

2578
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:23,440
uh my fu of the week actually I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately I can't

2579
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:28,300
complain too much but I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday oh my

2580
02:15:28,300 --> 02:15:34,380
god that was so terrible um yeah that was bad and my tooth still kind of hurts a little

2581
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:39,420
bit so fu to pain even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting

2582
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:47,180
it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of so I'm pretty great so fu to pain

2583
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:55,540
place to pop it's not really that angsty I guess but just fu to having only two weeks

2584
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:59,340
to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do but it's still a good

2585
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:06,940
thing so nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated all right

2586
02:16:06,940 --> 02:16:10,380
all right that does it for the fus of the week let's do a couple more news stories and

2587
02:16:10,380 --> 02:16:15,260
then we will reveal tonight's list list definitive list and we will get to the skype line in

2588
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:20,860
just a little bit but for now a couple quick stories loki yeah um as we've kind of mentioned

2589
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:26,580
before that the hd remix are kind of a uh a remix of different games are kind of popular

2590
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:32,740
nowadays and ubisoft is jumping on board that trend um they actually have a few games coming

2591
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:37,900
out uh the first course the splinter cell uh classic trilogy that's coming out june

2592
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:45,940
21st now and uh will feature three games in that series also the prince of persia hd trilogy

2593
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:51,100
so push back a little bit to april 19th and that would feature the uh my birthday the three

2594
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:59,500
games in the um sands of time series so um it's neat i guess um i think the i want to

2595
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:03,180
say that the uh games at least the prince of persia ones are already on the playstation

2596
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:09,380
network they're 15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving five bucks um apparently

2597
02:17:09,380 --> 02:17:13,460
also the uh splinter cell games are going to be available on the playstation network

2598
02:17:13,460 --> 02:17:18,420
as well i'm assuming for probably around the same price 15 bucks each 40 for the compilation

2599
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:24,980
of you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so yeah

2600
02:17:24,980 --> 02:17:31,540
save five bucks all right well would you like to be able to play more games on the mac well

2601
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:36,980
maybe you can get a thing called boxer uh this isn't like boxers versus briefs or anything

2602
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:42,900
this is actually a boxer it's a dos box for the mac that's right i did a little joke there

2603
02:17:42,900 --> 02:17:48,260
this will allow you to play old pc games on the mac but you know what all joking aside

2604
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:53,300
this is pretty cool uh dos box of course was a old emulator that will make uh playing games

2605
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:58,780
from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines boxer is kind of this redone

2606
02:17:58,780 --> 02:18:04,220
for apple computers uh the mac series of course and uh what i like about it is they've kind

2607
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:08,300
of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit like you can see xcom in there although

2608
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:12,660
it's just the demo but doom 2 is playable in this which is pretty cool so if you own

2609
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:17,660
a mac um i would be checking this out boxerapp.com is where you can go to check out the boxer

2610
02:18:17,660 --> 02:18:22,060
emulator for your old school dos fix and this doesn't come with any games right you have

2611
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:26,920
to install your own yeah i'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in like i

2612
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:32,420
see uh doom 2 it's probably the freeware one and then underworld the demo ultimate underworld

2613
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:37,600
probably just box with some of those you can though for the record play pc games on a mac

2614
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:45,100
you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels i think it's called but i think

2615
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:49,820
what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important

2616
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:54,340
because some of the old dos games you try to play them on a pc now i'm just like crazy

2617
02:18:54,340 --> 02:19:00,300
you can't do it because you know the first computer i ever had pc was a 16 megahertz

2618
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:04,740
computer and it was blazing fast and you know i used to play games like x-men on it and

2619
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:08,620
like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what did computers

2620
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:15,300
go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're

2621
02:19:15,300 --> 02:19:20,940
gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the

2622
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:27,620
winner so here it is tonight's definitive list no arguing folks it's a done deal this

2623
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:34,620
is a very scientific process the launch title that would have made you get a 3ds number

2624
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:42,340
three breasts 3d that's right the game with boobs boobs and more boobs i already have

2625
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:47,740
that game almost as good as the real thing i already have that game all right uh your

2626
02:19:47,740 --> 02:19:51,220
number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3ds would have made you get

2627
02:19:51,220 --> 02:19:57,740
one today samus arand's motorboat and bikini blaster woohoo i see a pattern it could be

2628
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:04,220
in another nintendo tecmo collaboration there you go absolutely but the number one thing

2629
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:10,980
that would have made you buy a 3ds today f-zero 3ds going for a serious answer there it is

2630
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:16,500
f-zero 3ds is the winner i thought for sure that it would be the offered racing game uh

2631
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:21,720
rebecca black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being and it was

2632
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:26,700
just it was fourth place just shy of the list i'm kind of glad though it won't be etched

2633
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:30,620
permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old

2634
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:36,260
next week all right uh we totally missed out on all the charlie sheen references we could

2635
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:42,340
use i know you could winning 3ds but no one cares anymore i'm kind of over it i didn't

2636
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:48,700
care to be yeah yay we're watching a man self-destruct live on tv it's great but it's different now

2637
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:55,340
because it's a man doing it it's been a while yeah maybe he'll show his kush on tv and people

2638
02:20:55,340 --> 02:21:03,580
will care as he's getting out of a limo sure cobwebby all right skype line is open now

2658
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:06,540
evil five well i've seen uh videos of it and just the uh i did the graphics look amazing

2659
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:12,580
and the gameplay looks cool now and you're a partner is a girl so you can't beat that

2660
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:17,620
now resident evil 5 has been out for some time so what's uh what's stopping you from

2661
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:24,180
just getting the damn game already well i don't have the system oh wow wow wow that

2662
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:31,420
happens so you you are not an owner of any uh 360 ps3 type consoles no we've got a nintendo

2663
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:37,100
gamecube and uh nintendo 64 that's all right that shit's expensive the new stuff so you

2664
02:23:37,100 --> 02:23:42,380
you you are kicking it old school yes i am so what games what old school games do you

2665
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:55,540

2666
02:23:55,540 --> 02:24:03,220
dark the one for the 64 classic i also have um fighting for 64

2667
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:13,500
uh golden i double o seven well these are all classic games so so is it just like you

2668
02:24:13,500 --> 02:24:18,040
know i'm kind of surprised if you own a gamecube and a 64 you haven't yet taken the plunge

2669
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:24,060
and gotten a wee is it just is it just a money thing well i'm still living at home and i

2670
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:28,500
haven't moved out and i don't uh think i want to spend my money on that even though i like

2671
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:32,740
playing on wheeze i don't think i want to own one yeah you know it's like you know the

2672
02:24:32,740 --> 02:24:39,340
rent or a wee the ramps probably a good idea i mean seriously i know i'm gonna so i'm with

2673
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:45,100
the uh gamecube uh i've got uh diehard vendetta i don't think i'm not sure if you've heard

2674
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:49,780
of that uh no probably not i wasn't really into the diehard movies although well i don't

2675
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:54,940
know yippee-ki-yay motherfucker maybe i don't know just do we do we get that in the game

2676
02:24:54,940 --> 02:24:58,780
do we get a yippee-ki-yay motherfucker in the game i uh haven't played in such a long

2677
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:03,940
time i've forgotten okay that's all right i probably not because it's a nintendo based

2678
02:25:03,940 --> 02:25:09,580
product so well it's an unrated game so you never know that's true okay here here's my

2679
02:25:09,580 --> 02:25:12,740
thing though uh resident evil you brought up resident evil five now one of the greatest

2680
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:17,380
gamecube games they ever made was resident evil four so have you checked that out on

2681
02:25:17,380 --> 02:25:23,960
gamecube i think i do want to buy that and they i think they made that game for the we

2682
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:28,600
as well but it's the same the graphics are still the same yeah pretty much i mean the

2683
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:33,420
we's just two game cubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway so that's

2684
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:38,260
a pretty good description uh how's your pc because some folks in chat are kind of commenting

2685
02:25:38,260 --> 02:25:41,960
wow this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago maybe he should

2686
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:48,000
game on the pc have you have you tried gaming on pc i don't have a pc i'm actually using

2687
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,940
a mac laptop right now well that well we just talked about dos box on the mac you might

2688
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:59,140
that might be an option for you i don't know yeah i've actually had the original uh one

2689
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:05,600
version of the original doom for the 64. i see so well uh you might have to check out

2690
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:09,380
steam for the mac or something i don't know uh it's an option for you all right we gotta

2691
02:26:09,380 --> 02:26:14,660
take some more calls any other uh last minute thoughts before we uh let you go uh no just

2694
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:28,540

2695
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:31,780
the folks in the chat room are like is that call from like three years ago what's going

2696
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:35,300
on but it's like you know that's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody

2697
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:39,060
gets to just take the plunge i should have asked how old he was because he did say he

2698
02:26:39,060 --> 02:26:41,780
lived at home and you know granted a lot of adults live at home but he might have also

2699
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:46,700
been 16 which could have answered a lot of that i don't know all right one eight seven

2700
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:50,740

uh black and white pokemon before i say that yeah yeah i have it i have both actually but

2704
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:11,860
um before i go on tonight i just want to say uh that previous caller uh die hard vandetta

2705
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:16,540
he called it uh it does have a lot of cursing in it awesome it's actually uh a big deal

2706
02:27:16,540 --> 02:27:20,340
they were trying to go after nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many f

2707
02:27:20,340 --> 02:27:26,420
bombs in that game nice you wouldn't believe it i'm glad but um anyway so yeah the pokemans

2708
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:32,100
show us your pokemans yeah i definitely recommend it i mean i think um if you haven't played

2709
02:27:32,100 --> 02:27:36,020
pokemon in a while i think you should definitely pick this one up i mean they always add something

2710
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:41,220
new to the pokemon games and uh what they added new to this one is uh there's a lot of um

2711
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:47,940
uh uh wi-fi connectability to the game like um they have the whole uh you know the big thing

2712
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:53,300
that's like street pass they have that where if you have your uh your ds on and you walk by

2713
02:27:53,300 --> 02:27:58,340
someone and they have a pokemon you exchange information they have the uh you can battle

2714
02:27:58,340 --> 02:28:06,740
people online um what else do they have they have mudkip 2.0 huh mudkip 2.0

2715
02:28:07,940 --> 02:28:10,420
i don't even know what that is i'm just trolling don't listen to me

2716
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:17,220
but anyway yeah they have this thing called uh g gear where it's like um you have three different

2717
02:28:17,220 --> 02:28:21,940
types of ways that you can connect with people uh there's the uh infrared where it's like it's

2718
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:26,660
like a face-to-face type of connection that you do then there's the uh like i've mentioned before

2719
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:31,460
you know like the street pass type thing and then there's the uh internet wi-fi and i mean there's

2720
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:38,020
just a lot to it i mean it's a really big game i mean i can go i i can go on forever about um how

2721
02:28:38,020 --> 02:28:42,180
much they added to the game it's really a great game so my ignorance earlier in the show should

2722
02:28:42,180 --> 02:28:46,660
not have said that the pokemon games haven't really changed in a while well i mean it's your

2723
02:28:46,660 --> 02:28:51,620
opinion but actually they have changed the one that you mentioned uh the ruby what was it ruby

2724
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:58,740
silver yeah now ruby what they yeah i mean i'm not i'm not the biggest uh pokemon historian but um

2725
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:02,980
what i think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases which they didn't have

2726
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:08,260
in the uh the original which was i think well was it red and blue or some shit okay but to be fair

2727
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:13,140
i mean how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game i mean maybe a little bit

2728
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:17,380
because i mean certain certain pokemon you couldn't catch you know you have to catch them at certain

2729
02:29:17,380 --> 02:29:22,100
days of the week you have to catch them at certain uh you know either day or night i mean you know

2730
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:26,420
i mean they they really do innovative stuff with it i mean you know it may not be something that's

2731
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:31,540
gonna like uh change how you think about pokemon but i mean they always uh consider the fans and

2732
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:36,500
they you know they kind of like cater to what uh the fans want like whatever the fans are asking

2733
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:41,620
for it you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next pokemon game let me ask one of the fanboy

2734
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:45,540
questions of the year and i don't know how many times we brought this up on the show but why do

2735
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:50,020
you think nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a pokemon mmo everybody i would even fucking

2736
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:55,380
play a pokemon mmo well you you mentioned earlier um like i said i'm not the biggest uh pokemon

2737
02:29:55,380 --> 02:30:02,420
historian but they do have this uh website thing that's coming out on uh march 30th which is kind

2738
02:30:02,420 --> 02:30:06,580
of gonna is i guess you could say it's kind of like a minimum uh mmo you're gonna have like some

2739
02:30:06,580 --> 02:30:12,580
kind of pokey farm and you can you can raise your pokemon slaves there and you know make them fight

2740
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:16,100
you know you know all that type of stuff so i mean they do have some type of uh

2741
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:21,220
nmo thing going on i don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them

2742
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:25,940
like in a while but um you'll be able to link up with maybe i don't know maybe 10 people in a room

2743
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:32,260
and you can all like uh chat and this you can tie razorblades to their feet and all that shit

2744
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:36,180
this sounds like you're turning cock fighting into a video game but you've just replaced

2745
02:30:36,180 --> 02:30:40,420
that with pikachu that's pretty much what pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it

2746
02:30:40,420 --> 02:30:44,580
you're basically catching you'd be a very dirty yes yeah it's cock fighting pretty much but i

2747
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:50,500
mean it's great you know i mean i i don't mind it get your pikachu out of my cock fighting game

2748
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:55,620
sorry we're having too much fun yes better than getting the real roosters and having them beat the

2749
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:59,540
crap out of each other you could do it virtually all right and that and that's pretty much what

2750
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:04,260
the main story is about in this game there's actually uh a guy who wants uh to free all the

2751
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:07,620
pokemon because he's like oh you know we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy

2752
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:17,380
shit so he's basically pita yeah yeah all right would that be people for the ethical treatment

2753
02:31:17,380 --> 02:31:24,500
of pokemon pp all right anyhow all right we gotta let you go guys judo but thank you for our pokey

games okay a lot so what's all what's all changed what what am i missing by not experiencing pokemon

2765
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:54,100
black and white well you have more stuff to do with pokemon uh you have to uh watch out for

2766
02:32:54,100 --> 02:33:01,780
stats like special attack and defense you also have to raise some certain pokemon to to obtain

2767
02:33:01,780 --> 02:33:09,140
them you have to work that pokemon you have to train them can you can you whip your pokemon

2768
02:33:09,140 --> 02:33:17,460
like the derby owners club if you're a competitive player pretty much you have to do that no okay

2769
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:28,180
all right and also uh about nintendo not doing the pokemon mmo pretty much nintendo i think has said

2770
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:36,180
that they don't want to do it because it's uh it's a very very big project and i think they

2771
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:42,100
said that that it couldn't work well fuck them give me what i want is that too much to ask

2772
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:49,300
everyone would play it i know i i don't play mmos i don't like them but i know i would play a

2773
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:54,420
pokemon mmo i want i dare somebody to call in and say they wouldn't play the pokemon mmo anyone in

2774
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:59,380
this room would anyone in this room not play the pokemon mmo or at least give it a try i'd try i

2775
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:04,260

2776
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:10,900
shoot pokemon no because i don't like it i think the stupid series that certain people over age

2777
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:15,700
hold on hold on i just i have to know haven't you bought every single animal crossing game they've

2779
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:31,140
you hate you hate my wife wanted to play yeah likely story it is likely well maybe josh wants

2780
02:34:31,140 --> 02:34:36,420
to play pokemon mmo i bought nintendo dogs and i hate it and i'm getting rid of it so you know what

2781
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:43,620
it doesn't matter i want to play nintendo buy it oh you want to play the new nintendo dogs

2782
02:34:43,620 --> 02:34:52,100
boot up the old nintendo and get drunk it'll be in 3d there i don't know i just want someone to

2783
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:59,700
convince my husband to get me my 3ds uh look what you started act f we're all fighting it's all in

2784
02:34:59,700 --> 02:35:03,300
the fighting tonight i know olr is going to break up tonight and it's all because of your call i

2785
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:07,620
just want you to know that i'm kidding i'm sorry about that sorry i'm kidding all right well

2786
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:15,700
basically nintendo said uh the most principle thing they that uh what's the word they don't

2787
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:23,220
want to do it because it's a big infrastructure and it's uh like i said a very big project for

2788
02:35:23,220 --> 02:35:28,580
for them to handle and they don't want to do it i see they're the number one selling console in

2789
02:35:28,580 --> 02:35:33,620
the motherfucking world yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a pokemon mmo

2790
02:35:33,620 --> 02:35:39,860
little old microsoft i have no idea how they're doing it and sony she's boy they're sure suckers

2791
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:46,180
well to uh to uh you know their defense that microsoft doesn't have an mmo

2792
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:53,940
but they have an online infrastructure which is more than nintendo has debatable to i mean

2793
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:57,700
they did have final fantasy 11 you know i'm always going to whip out that card and fantasy star

2794
02:35:57,700 --> 02:36:01,860
universe that's true has all right fine then they already have more than intended us it's a

2795
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:07,540
microsoft just is opposed to mmos for some reason there's some weird thing going on like i don't

2796
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:12,580
know if they were just burned by final fantasy 11 or what but i don't know or maybe it has something

2797
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:17,620
to do with their next system maybe the next system is all going to be about mmos who knows i'm making

2798
02:36:18,180 --> 02:36:24,100
shit up now all right act f before i let you go since we've completely um you know derailed your

2799
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:29,300
phone calls many times uh anything else you want to share with our folks tonight well just one

2800
02:36:29,300 --> 02:36:39,060
question one last question of course would you pay around 525 for a 3ds hell no i wouldn't not

2801
02:36:39,060 --> 02:36:42,340
right now not until more games come out let me guess that's how much you're having to pay in

2802
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:51,220
mexico huh yep don't you live not far from the border luckily but for those who doesn't or who

2803
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:56,340
don't you need to just drive to san diego or find a friend here who can help you out for a lot

2804
02:36:56,340 --> 02:37:02,340
cheaper that's crazy talk 500 bucks i can find a friend i have i live pretty much across the border

2805
02:37:02,340 --> 02:37:10,660
so i can find a friend and k can bring me one but those who live on the south those are pretty much

2806
02:37:10,660 --> 02:37:17,860
screwed they're paying six hundred six thousand pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3ds

2807
02:37:17,860 --> 02:37:24,500
unbelievable all right well act after we hope uh it gets to a more reasonable level in mexico soon

2808
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:30,020
but it is launch day i mean give it a few weeks to stabilize you know if the sales are not so hot

2809
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:33,540
or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought maybe the price will drop pretty quickly

2810
02:37:33,540 --> 02:37:40,100
we'll see no doubt it but well let's see we'll see all right take care buddy take care you too

2811
02:37:40,740 --> 02:37:44,180
boy sometimes we forget how spoiled we are in america that at least these game companies put

2812
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:50,100
out the consoles here you know what i mean it's weird that nintendo doesn't do more with mexico

2813
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:55,060
because you know they have the the manuals all in spanish and french so that they can launch

2814
02:37:55,060 --> 02:38:00,900
in multiple regions simultaneously i don't know let's go to one or two more calls hi you're on

2815
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:05,220
orange launch radio who's this hey it's ron how's everyone doing tonight hey good rama i just want

2816
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:10,020
to say real quick to this our phones are like packed tonight it's weird like it's just constantly

2817
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:14,260
lit up the whole screen so if you don't get through tonight don't get sand in your vagina

2818
02:38:14,260 --> 02:38:17,780
just send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com because millions of people will call

2819
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:21,220
but yet no one will email us i don't understand all right barama you got through what's on your

2820
02:38:21,220 --> 02:38:27,780
mind tonight a few things um number one i know the music is out on the podcast but when you were

2821
02:38:27,780 --> 02:38:35,060
playing music from um space channel five i had mentioned that about years ago i was in a skit

2822
02:38:35,060 --> 02:38:39,540
where it was dance dance revolution versus space channel five i had to have been at least 10 years

2823
02:38:39,540 --> 02:38:47,140
ago when ddr was popular i'm just kidding i bet it was close to seven what was uh what was what

2824
02:38:47,140 --> 02:38:53,780
was this ddr versus space channel five sketch it was pretty much a dance off between which was

2825
02:38:53,780 --> 02:38:59,140
better on the characters from space channel five or ddr but what had happened was way to see it

2826
02:38:59,140 --> 02:39:04,340
let's go after the dance off uh the main villain from space channel five part two comes out tries

2827
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:10,580
to take over the convention both sides join forces and do another dance off to destroy him but we

2828
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:15,380
cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together now which character did you play and

2829
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:23,540
please don't say space michael rage rage nice you wear pants no i did not have the hair i didn't

2830
02:39:23,540 --> 02:39:30,420
have time to throw that together you didn't go as pantsless rage no it's an old school a large

2831
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:38,580
old school old school good you wore pants yes indeed so who ultimately ended up being victorious

2832
02:39:38,580 --> 02:39:46,180
the ddr people or the space channel five people i really don't know because it just ended up like

2833
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:50,180
a tie per se but we still ended up winning an award which was pretty cool it was open to

2834
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:56,340
interpretation that's what it was yes whatever you wanted to happen you as the viewer so what

2835
02:39:56,340 --> 02:40:02,340
cons are coming up rama any cons you're going to soon you're the con king uh anime boston but you

2836
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:06,180
know that's them but i do have a couple more things i want to cover that i'm gonna be on my

2837
02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:13,860
merry little way all right number one loki you mentioned about what's the point of having

2838
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:18,740
projectors with video games and stuff like that something tells me you've never seen gaming

2839
02:40:18,740 --> 02:40:24,660
tournaments i missed like half of what you just said there yeah you you bought uh you botched up

2840
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:28,580
a little bit i don't know the connection but let me just repeat a little bit um rama is basically

2841
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:31,380
a couple weeks ago on the show i don't even remember when you said it but you talked about

2842
02:40:31,380 --> 02:40:35,940
projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles but rama is saying well what about

2843
02:40:35,940 --> 02:40:40,500
gaming tournaments or anime cons or you know he does conventions and probably sees like ddr on

2844
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:46,500
projectors all the time at the atari party they had um games on projector yeah that's cool that

2845
02:40:46,500 --> 02:40:50,660
you can do that but you can do that with pretty much any console i don't think it needs to be

2846
02:40:50,660 --> 02:40:59,300
necessarily built into a console and that being its you know its uh primary source of you know

2847
02:40:59,300 --> 02:41:06,020
putting out the images it's just it's impractical for a lot of people i mean for maybe a convention

2848
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:11,540
or something like that where you don't want to bring a tv um that may work but the majority of

2849
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:17,140
people out there don't use projectors a projector is basically a tv you know and so you use it for

2850
02:41:17,140 --> 02:41:24,180
certain scenarios so i guess that's where loki's coming from eh i'm just saying you know if you if

2851
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:28,340
it's like if they come out with like some sort of 3d holographic system or something like that that

2852
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:35,300
requires some special display that's not out there holodeck in a box you know then you know you want

2853
02:41:35,300 --> 02:41:40,900
one but like if it's just like oh look it's this console with a projector like a pico projector

2854
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:51,540
built in it's kind of i don't know it's neat i guess but it's impractical unless of course it

2855
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:55,140
runs on batteries and that might be pretty cool because then you can at least take it places and

2856
02:41:55,140 --> 02:42:02,660
play stuff but um you know i don't know all right rama anything else i had something else but i'll

2857
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:07,140
save that for another time all right fair enough or you can email hint hint we need more emails all

2858
02:42:07,140 --> 02:42:15,140
right we'll do rama take care buddy no problem bye have fun at anime boston be good times all

2859
02:42:15,140 --> 02:42:20,820
right uh let's go ahead and get to some more calls 1877 game olr username on skype is orange

2860

like a console it's uh 1080p visuals which make it look almost like a gran turismo type quality

game and use the actual um ipad as the steering wheel with the gas and brake on there and it has

2869
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:14,580
a like a map display on the actual ipad but the actual games on the tv let me go to the phones

2870
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:19,620

2874
02:43:33,380 --> 02:43:38,500
very proud of my stepdaughter she's loving and she already been in less than about a month and

2875
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:42,820
a half been through the first two games of the professor latent series and only needed help like

2876
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:47,060
once or twice with one or two of the puzzles that is really amazing that's really good that's a very

2877
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:52,340
cerebral game so awesome for her yeah she's very smart and she loves this type of puzzle game so

2878
02:43:52,340 --> 02:43:56,500
i'm looking forward to getting her the third one you got a kid genius on your hand mensa test

2879
02:43:56,500 --> 02:44:01,940
yeah really no joke um i bought pokemon black the day it came out and i really loved it and

2880
02:44:01,940 --> 02:44:07,300
i haven't played pokemon for quite a while i really pissed off the original and the only

2881
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:12,580
reason why i got it was because a lot of my friends i knew had was getting either getting

2882
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:18,340
the black or getting white so i decided well why not so you know and um try it out i'm really

2883
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:23,300
enjoying it i'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated some of the move sets have changed around

2884
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:29,540
and the different ways they're doing the wi-fi connection now so i can trade with friends even

2885
02:44:29,540 --> 02:44:34,900
from across states if i wanted to which was really cool which i tried that out so it was though the

2886
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:40,020
microphone when it came on kind of threw for a loop but um it was very it's very cool though i

2887
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:44,340
mean the the features and the functionality to put into it unfortunately it's kind of sad that

2888
02:44:44,340 --> 02:44:49,860
the global link where you could put your pokemon and do dream and put them in like a dream world

2889
02:44:49,860 --> 02:44:55,300
was kind of like a um web browser game type thing unfortunately won't be coming anytime soon because

2890
02:44:55,300 --> 02:44:59,860
of the fact that over japan with the earthquake they had to shut down the servers for it and they

2891
02:44:59,860 --> 02:45:05,620
came out with a release saying though it was supposed to come on on the 30th um for uh north

2892
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:13,060
america and europe there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up so that was the

2893
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:16,420
one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there

2894
02:45:16,420 --> 02:45:22,100
has been a delay and they have really statements about that so let me ask you the same fanboy

2895
02:45:22,100 --> 02:45:26,100
question i haven't asked everybody else about the whole pokemon mmo would you would you leave

2896
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:33,540
warcraft for a pokemon mmo no no why is that i think that would be more towards your like

2897
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:39,300
smaller kids and stuff kind of like the free realm is for like sony um i really don't see it

2898
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:46,500
mean more towards adults i wouldn't mind playing it just for you know lols or if it's you know for

2899
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:51,220
a good price but i just don't really see me playing a pokemon mmo when i just can go online

2900
02:45:51,220 --> 02:45:55,300
and just do the same things to the regular pokemon and just challenge somebody over wi-fi

2901
02:45:56,260 --> 02:45:59,940
gotcha unless they're gonna offer like a bunch more stuff to it so

2902
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:06,340
i don't know i'm just i'm just type you know i just thought i couldn't really see myself doing

2903
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:10,900
that but if they didn't want to do it it'll be a good cash cow go for it it'll probably give

2904
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:15,140
wild probably run for our money if they if they can pull if they can play it off and do it right

2905
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:21,780
that is and um also coming into the straight mail too for the bio well the bioware sorry really

2906
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:28,340
quickly i don't get offended when i would play games say like dragon age uh dragon age 2 mass

2907
02:46:28,340 --> 02:46:34,340
effect and had a chill quote gay uh sex scene would happen i'm not gonna be like oh my god i

2908
02:46:34,340 --> 02:46:38,260
can't believe i'm seeing this i mean i couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and

2909
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:42,900
said for all the street mail sorry not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that so

2910
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:50,340
and if i don't like something i just don't play it that's as simple as that so right so uh yeah um

2911
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:56,740
it was a weird story and it's it's kind of cool though the bioware like came out and just totally

2912
02:46:56,740 --> 02:47:01,300
like defended it and i'm glad that like if they're gonna go all in like that they really go like all

2913
02:47:01,300 --> 02:47:06,740
in and stand by it and you know the artistic stuff behind it precisely and i don't see any reason as

2914
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:12,260
to why it didn't cause an outcry people knew about this way before i mean as soon as the game hits

2915
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:16,500
people knew about this they warned people and they were like oh we're putting all this stuff in we're

2916
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:20,900
showing you some of the scenes and they're letting people know and it's like it was your choice

2917
02:47:20,900 --> 02:47:26,500
either you do you can either a buy it knowing what was in it or b don't buy it don't worry about it

2918
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:31,780
at all and just don't get all up you know don't make those decisions like like like it was said

2919
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:37,540
before you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen and you would know

2920
02:47:37,540 --> 02:47:43,060
because of by the reaction of the people and what they say i mean it's kind of obvious all right

2921
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:48,580
well we'll leave it on that for now excellent thanks so much for the call anytime enjoy your

02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:39,700
right any other last minute stories we didn't get to loki no um but i did want to mention one thing

2938
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:45,860
though and just after watching the updated you know system update thing for uh the okay go video

2939
02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:50,180
if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for nintendo dogs they are really like

2940
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:56,180
really just missing the boat here because it's with friends which because all the games are

2941
02:49:56,180 --> 02:50:02,020
nintendo dogs and cats you know with friends um and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video and

2942
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:11,780
it's in 3d come on nintendo it's like here you go great ad campaign don't have to do anything you

2943
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:18,180
you just go go with it okay go no seriously though i'm surprised they should have if they wanted to

2944
02:50:18,180 --> 02:50:21,620
be kind of hip and cool about it they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with

2945
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:25,540
little big planet where it was with live actors and stuff like that that i'm pretty awesome

2946
02:50:26,500 --> 02:50:30,500
but then again the game is just a rehash of the last game or they just need to get oprah to

2947
02:50:30,500 --> 02:50:39,460
give away 3ds is on our last show and you get a 3ds and you get a 3ds it's by nintendo she already

2948
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:43,940

2949
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:49,620
course they did awesome you would too if you've been in that audience hold me i would have been

2950
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:53,140
you if you got to go to the britney concert she totally told them too because she never says that

2951
02:50:53,140 --> 02:50:57,780
it's a giveaway episode so it's like oh we're going to talk about to cancer patients and it's

2952
02:50:57,780 --> 02:51:02,180
very sad then all of a sudden all the big balloons fall out of the sky and everyone you know celebrate
