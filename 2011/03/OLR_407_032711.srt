1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:23,001
[SPEAKER_07]: 2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have some 3DS titles already been cancelled?

2
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:36,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:42,256
[SPEAKER_11]: It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.

5
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:43,917
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:46,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:49,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,601
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

11
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?

12
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:56,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Ugh!

13
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:56,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

14
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:01,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smushage.

15
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:05,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like boob smash.

16
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:07,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.

17
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:37,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute, but of course we can't do a show without Techmaster Loki!

18
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:41,623
[SPEAKER_09]: See, the reason they canceled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.

19
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Did she?

20
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:46,089
[SPEAKER_09]: She very well could have.

21
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:49,921
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.

22
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:50,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

23
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:51,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't explain it.

24
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:53,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So how are you doing, Loki?

25
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:53,864
[SPEAKER_11]: What's new with you?

26
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:55,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, you're right, you're right.

27
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,866
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm confusing her with Chyna.

28
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:57,847
[SPEAKER_09]: My mistake.

29
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I should never do that.

30
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because Chyna did enough steroids.

31
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the country, but the wrestler.

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,591
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the wrestler, yes.

33
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I should never.

34
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize, Lucy Lawless.

35
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:10,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.

36
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucy Lawless could play Chyna.

37
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:12,878
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's awesome.

38
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:13,919
[SPEAKER_04]: In like a Lifetime movie.

39
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Chyna is a man beast, okay?

40
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,684
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's because of steroids.

41
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:23,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand it's because of steroids, but yes.

42
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man.

43
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I feel bad?

44
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:31,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange Lounge Radio.

45
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:32,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to Salacious Pop.

46
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:32,938
[SPEAKER_11]: What up?

47
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:33,699
[SPEAKER_11]: How you doing?

48
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing good.

49
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:34,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,322
[SPEAKER_11]: You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?

51
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:39,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you watch any TV at all?

52
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:40,535
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

53
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.

54
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:47,516
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no like, you know, Hulu that you watch?

55
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.

56
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:50,237
[SPEAKER_11]: You watch Archer.

57
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:51,357
[SPEAKER_11]: You got me hooked on that show.

58
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,017
[SPEAKER_11]: That show's funny.

59
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:53,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that show on FX.

60
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:54,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

61
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:55,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You think it's funny?

62
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:56,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

63
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:02,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried watching a few episodes of that to see because, you know, it looked really funny and it was terrible.

64
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:03,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

65
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,500
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just terrible.

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,760
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I love Archer.

67
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,200
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

68
00:03:07,065 --> 00:03:11,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I gotta go back and watch it, but the first few episodes just annoyed me because it wasn't funny enough.

69
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes, I don't know.

70
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, I don't know.

71
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:18,070
[SPEAKER_11]: But every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.

72
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:28,074
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very dark, the secretary that wants to bang everybody, because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.

73
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:30,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Just really, like, wow.

74
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:30,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

75
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,056
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of awesome stuff.

76
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,886
[SPEAKER_11]: where you can join us in the live chat room.

77
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:54,407
[SPEAKER_11]: We do interact with the audience.

78
00:03:55,108 --> 00:04:02,012
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, Why is the State Theater near my house doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week?

79
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:02,712
[SPEAKER_11]: WTF.

80
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:08,481
[SPEAKER_11]: People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff and I'm so over it.

81
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like Rebecca Black.

82
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:14,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Rebecca Black was cool a week ago and now I think I'm finally getting over it.

83
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's become a parody of itself in a way.

84
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,153
[SPEAKER_11]: And Charlie Sheen, is your buddy doing a live tour or something?

85
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:22,094
[SPEAKER_11]: No thanks.

86
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:24,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll go watch Hot Shots again.

87
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I never actually watched the interview.

88
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: or heard anything.

89
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.

90
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?

91
00:04:34,612 --> 00:04:37,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Either of them.

92
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:39,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.

93
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,441
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?

94
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,582
[SPEAKER_11]: That was... Alan, what was that you posted on the walls?

95
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:51,103
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a group called... I don't want to get their name wrong.

96
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:51,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Bad Lip Sync?

97
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:53,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Bad Lip Reading?

98
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:53,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was it.

99
00:04:54,385 --> 00:05:11,371
[SPEAKER_10]: So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth and then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how... And then if you look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what it looks like she's saying.

100
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:12,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's pretty awesome.

101
00:05:16,198 --> 00:05:17,058
[SPEAKER_10]: As you're queuing up the video.

102
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:22,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I would try to play some of it here, but YouTube's acting ignorant right now.

103
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:22,661
[SPEAKER_11]: It's terrible.

104
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:24,982
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very ignorant right now.

105
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:25,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe this.

106
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:26,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Such ignorance.

107
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:28,563
[SPEAKER_11]: There it goes.

108
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:33,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see if I can play some of this here.

109
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna see it get nasty.

110
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

111
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:56,398
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be the theme song to River City Ransom Part 2, which we were talking about last week.

112
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,801
[SPEAKER_04]: About fighting and chickens.

113
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:00,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Barney.

114
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: We got party hats.

115
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:02,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Barney, Barney.

116
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:05,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.

117
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:08,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually much... I could listen to that.

118
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I would buy that on iTunes.

119
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:14,010
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, earworm than the original is.

120
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'll be in the shower.

121
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:17,312
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, stop it.

122
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:19,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.

123
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk about actual video games.

124
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:27,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen and Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes of our show.

125
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,402
[SPEAKER_11]: That's way too much.

126
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:31,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about actual video games and how was your gaming week?

127
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

128
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,910
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was epic.

129
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:44,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the terms of RPGs, because Dan and I are playing, well more like Dan's playing through it and I'm watching him while I crochet.

130
00:06:45,499 --> 00:07:14,046
[SPEAKER_04]: we're playing through Final Fantasy and we're halfway through the first game and when we're done with that we're going to go to 2 and then since we don't have a home version of 3 that we can play on the TV we're going to skip on to 4 and then we're going to do 5 which we've got a couple versions of now 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2 11 was crap and not really a game I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while

131
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it for three years and never got to level cap.

132
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:16,889
[SPEAKER_04]: What about 12-2?

133
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:38,524
[SPEAKER_11]: 12.2 was on the DS.

134
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And it wasn't really 12.2, it was a side story.

135
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,246
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a 12.2 that we saw.

136
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:44,246
13.2.

137
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's two damn many games now.

138
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:55,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, are you going to be playing the Final Fantasy 4, was it the After Years or whatever?

139
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be out by the time we get to it.

140
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: We just might hook up the SNES.

141
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:00,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

142
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can put it on the Wii.

143
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:04,293
[SPEAKER_04]: We loaned out our Wii.

144
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:06,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Wii's on loan.

145
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:11,108
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.

146
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:11,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

147
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,411
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got anthology versions.

148
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have one if you need to borrow one.

149
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got anthology versions.

150
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:20,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the Super Nintendo versions.

151
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:24,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, we've got, I think, three different versions of that game that we could play.

152
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:25,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me back up a little bit.

153
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you doing this?

154
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,886
[SPEAKER_04]: because this is romantic.

155
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:39,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, back in the day, I say that like it was so long ago, but Dan would play it through Resident Evil 2 and I would be his navigator.

156
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because it's been a long time since I've played the first one and when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.

157
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a Wonderswan But with the souped up music

158
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:10,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The Warrior, The Monk, The Thief, and Red Mage

159
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:25,426
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

160
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:44,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm versatile and can cast Fire 3.

161
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:51,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Then our friend Becky, he's named our monk because Becky kicks ass.

162
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Mystique is the thief because it's Mystique.

163
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thief is always asleep or dead.

164
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:04,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what Mystique's like whenever we have work to do.

165
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's been on the show.

166
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:08,433
[SPEAKER_04]: People have heard her.

167
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:32,087
[SPEAKER_04]: um so it's pretty fun and like I was yelling at the husband the other day I'm playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 3 mostly at school like before class when I get a chance to and uh playing wow and um I made a new character Rebecca Black just because I thought it would be funny and I like now you're stuck with it

168
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:36,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like running through Stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?

169
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah.

170
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's fun.

171
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:43,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my own version of trolling.

172
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,289
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.

173
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought this chicken for us to eat.

174
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else for your gaming week?

175
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:56,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball.

176
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played some pinball.

177
00:10:59,017 --> 00:10:59,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

178
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:07,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some World Cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.

179
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:10,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I, like, drained them on my last two balls.

180
00:11:10,766 --> 00:11:13,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck.

181
00:11:13,528 --> 00:11:14,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Whee!

182
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:14,829
Whee!

183
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:16,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Goal!

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Suck.

185
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,743
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what my game was like.

186
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:20,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dan's my witness.

187
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:21,147
[SPEAKER_04]: He can vouch for me.

188
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,551
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my gaming week.

189
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:24,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

190
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:25,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And I crocheted.

191
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:26,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, how about you and your gaming week?

192
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:31,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what did I play this week?

193
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Motorstorm Apocalypse.

194
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:36,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I finished the rookie, uh, story mode thing.

195
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:40,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.

196
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:41,819
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really hard as it is.

197
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:49,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually kind of an archer type intro for.

198
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so I'm interested to see where that goes.

199
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,367
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, um, what else did I play?

200
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:58,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I played...

201
00:11:58,948 --> 00:12:00,689
[SPEAKER_09]: More Ridge Racer, because it's fun.

202
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.

203
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my US 3DS now, and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it should be sold this week.

204
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And got some Pilotwings and Super Street Fighter 4.

205
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:23,706
[SPEAKER_09]: So, those are kind of the games to get, I guess.

206
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:25,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

207
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:28,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really what I'm getting for a while.

208
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:08,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I still kinda sorta want one.

209
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:12,211
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.

210
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:17,335
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.

211
00:13:18,616 --> 00:13:20,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Beyond that, might as well wait.

212
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:21,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously, it's

213
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,230
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a Wii situation right now.

214
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.

215
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:33,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.

216
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:40,499
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo really seemed hellbent on getting this thing out in March.

217
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:46,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we really start ramping up for the holiday season?

218
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:51,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had the Kid Icarus and some of these other games...

219
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:54,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many third parties on board.

220
00:13:54,706 --> 00:14:00,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is the movies, the entertainment package and everything.

221
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:09,669
[SPEAKER_11]: If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the summer, kids' graduation presents and things like that.

222
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say they sell a million of these, if not more, by summertime.

223
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there's already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey...

224
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:22,979
[SPEAKER_11]: How about putting out that Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?

225
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.

226
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:30,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.

227
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:40,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And by putting it out just before the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're going to sell all their first batch of systems probably within the first week.

228
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:45,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their investors.

229
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,430
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I really think the reason why they did it.

230
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here.

231
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's out in all regions now.

232
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:55,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

233
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:28,951
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.

234
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you still bought one, like a lamb to the slaughter.

235
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,235
[SPEAKER_09]: You were in line.

236
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:36,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care about their crappy web browser.

237
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:39,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Or their store, because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.

238
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:50,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had, and they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music, but

239
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:51,929
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

240
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,838
[SPEAKER_11]: which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.

241
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,002
[SPEAKER_11]: All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer and then the background was on the back layer.

242
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:28,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, but I'm not going to lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming to get done?

243
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not.

244
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:32,851
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they just built an emulator and it runs ROMs and that's it.

245
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:33,651
[SPEAKER_11]: You're done.

246
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,914
[SPEAKER_11]: A question from Tigerclaw in our chat room.

247
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they are going to do on the 3DS browser.

248
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think any at all?

249
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:44,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, if anything.

250
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe something in Flash?

251
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

252
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:54,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit, they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.

253
00:16:55,421 --> 00:16:58,901
[SPEAKER_09]: They supported Flash, or no, they didn't support Flash.

254
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:00,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember what they supported.

255
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,522
[SPEAKER_09]: They supported something with it.

256
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:03,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very basic.

257
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just like the PSP was, where it supported... It used Basic.

258
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Basic.

259
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:28,182
[SPEAKER_09]: it supports flash but very little flash because of the kits that they had but I think if anything what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that those 3D pictures are in so like say if I post that on my wall or something like that somewhere in a webpage it would be in 3D on yours

260
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:39,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing Nintendo games in Flash on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games on my 3D.

261
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:39,911
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be very meta.

262
00:17:40,932 --> 00:17:41,573
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you couldn't.

263
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:49,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why you couldn't is because it doesn't have the processing power to handle something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like that either.

264
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP.

265
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd never be able to build something like that.

266
00:17:55,703 --> 00:17:57,706
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room.

267
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:01,170
[SPEAKER_11]: The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.

268
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:01,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I did hear about that.

269
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's interesting.

270
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know.

271
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,220
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of a show-off thing, right?

272
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:12,303
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D.

273
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.

274
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go ahead.

275
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:21,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, go ahead.

276
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:22,823
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Okay Go is a good band.

277
00:18:23,224 --> 00:18:25,966
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.

278
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in Rock Band.

279
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:32,210
[SPEAKER_10]: All their videos since then have been amazing.

280
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, and that one that was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing video.

281
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's the one with the dogs, the one with them in the park, with the stop motion.

282
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:41,897
[SPEAKER_10]: The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there.

283
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:42,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

284
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:42,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

285
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like they're on the cutting edge of music videos.

286
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:49,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like them and Lady Gaga right there.

287
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:51,433
[SPEAKER_11]: They should collaborate.

288
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.

289
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:54,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

290
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:55,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Good show.

291
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:56,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

292
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:57,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Another good band.

293
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so is that it for your Gaming Week, Loki?

294
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Some 3DS rants and so forth?

295
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:12,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday, which, I don't know why all the hate, really.

296
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever.

297
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:16,783
[SPEAKER_09]: This is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.

298
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It was entertaining.

299
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:22,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertainment movies?

300
00:19:22,386 --> 00:19:23,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand.

301
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:28,429
[SPEAKER_11]: See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really?

302
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:28,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright.

303
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:29,549
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what you want to see?

304
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it this way.

305
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny because a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of different games.

306
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:46,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they have this one scene that you've probably seen there where they're in a mech and stuff, and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from Killzone.

307
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:47,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's...

308
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:49,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much that.

309
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,080
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks so much like it.

310
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

311
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:52,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there lots of boobs?

312
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.

313
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:54,462
[SPEAKER_11]: It's PG-13.

314
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:55,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, come on!

315
00:19:58,285 --> 00:20:02,467
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train.

316
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:10,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy XIII where they're fighting soldiers and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.

317
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:15,934
[SPEAKER_09]: It's badass, but seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?

318
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:17,594
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be really awesome as a game.

319
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:21,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.

320
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.

321
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.

322
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:32,040
[SPEAKER_10]: He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.

323
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,140
[SPEAKER_10]: The 300...

324
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:35,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Problematic but awesome.

325
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:35,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Then Watchmen.

326
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,285
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the novel, but now this.

327
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,326
[SPEAKER_11]: So Superman's going to be great.

328
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool, but I see people's complaints.

329
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:48,708
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, well, the first part of the movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.

330
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:49,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So what?

331
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:51,829
[SPEAKER_09]: So it didn't have dialogue in it.

332
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:52,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Neither did WALL-E.

333
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:56,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So that argument is null and void because WALL-E is one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years.

334
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001.

335
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

336
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:11,320
[SPEAKER_09]: But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.

337
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,221
[SPEAKER_09]: And, whatever, who cares?

338
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:20,448
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter because if it was just like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution and stuff.

339
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:26,093
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically her coping with whatever is going on because apparently, you know, there's...

340
00:21:26,813 --> 00:21:32,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as a burlesque type place.

341
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:40,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The way she copes with it goes into this imaginary world thing where she's solving how she's going to escape.

342
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,661
[SPEAKER_09]: You see how she's going to figure that out right in the very beginning.

343
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:47,923
[SPEAKER_09]: She figured it all out, but this is just all very quick.

344
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:51,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like Inception where there's a lot of stuff taking place in a very short period of time.

345
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:55,810
[SPEAKER_11]: and Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.

346
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobies in 3D.

347
00:21:57,052 --> 00:21:58,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any porn in 3D?

348
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:03,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and you can download it to your flashcard.

349
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,405
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.

350
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:07,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would not be difficult to do that.

351
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:19,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say otherwise your biggest hope would be Netflix when it comes out if they start doing the 3D movies and then like Piranha 3D is going to be like your boobies in 3D or whatever else.

352
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:28,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Well once they have it where you can say take video with your 3DS and stuff they'll find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and

353
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:29,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Ta-da!

354
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,226
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

355
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:30,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be done.

356
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,187
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I don't know.

357
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:33,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be hard to do 3D.

358
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:41,414
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays, and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet, so I don't know.

359
00:22:41,474 --> 00:22:42,134
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a while.

360
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:43,395
[SPEAKER_11]: But boobies in 3D.

361
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:44,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's a great use of 3D.

362
00:22:45,216 --> 00:22:48,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, though, that's just to get people in seats for, like, Piranha 3D.

363
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's...

364
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:52,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It is interesting.

365
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:58,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and it's got a lot of gore in it.

366
00:22:58,713 --> 00:22:59,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds awesome.

367
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, whatever.

368
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:04,895
[SPEAKER_09]: You're part of the problem!

369
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:05,615
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, okay.

370
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:07,896
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something I can't remember.

371
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think if we're actually going to get into it tonight.

372
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,378
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I had a Nintendo thing.

373
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something

374
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:27,106
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to refresh my memory while I was pissed off.

375
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:27,727
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty good.

376
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:36,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2 because I have to revisit that game every couple months.

377
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:41,757
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is the very beginning when you're on the train.

378
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:45,618
[SPEAKER_10]: play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm.

379
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is the very scary, gory Resident Evil inspired.

380
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:54,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the developers of Valve said that Resident Evil influenced that zone.

381
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.

382
00:23:57,907 --> 00:23:58,708
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I'm at right now.

383
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:00,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I played some Warcraft 3.

384
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:03,011
[SPEAKER_10]: The RTS from 2003.

385
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:05,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm starting to use cheat codes now.

386
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:07,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so I can see the story.

387
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:09,817
[SPEAKER_10]: And uh

388
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:13,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, World of Warcraft.

389
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:15,139
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

390
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,883
[SPEAKER_11]: When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?

391
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:28,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.

392
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:32,476
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.

393
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Boy band or adult diaper?

394
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:36,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Something like that?

395
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:02,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

396
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:05,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to ruin the game for you guys.

397
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:06,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It was great.

398
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:07,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Laughed.

399
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,433
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a fun party game.

400
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:11,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played You Don't Know Jack.

401
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,115
[SPEAKER_11]: It called me an idiot to my face.

402
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:13,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's right.

403
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:14,755
[SPEAKER_11]: The game called you an idiot.

404
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:15,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about that.

405
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:16,416
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the question?

406
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:16,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Something about...

407
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:22,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Which one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Blarney Stone?

408
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was like, the correct answer was the kiss from Spider-Man, because you're supposed to kiss the Blarney Stone upside down.

409
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:38,590
[SPEAKER_11]: But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp, and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer goes, Yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Blarney Stone, idiot.

410
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:41,933
[SPEAKER_11]: He ended up winning the round anyway.

411
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:43,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I took it home at the end.

412
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:52,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We couldn't hear any follow-up because Grandpa Warcraft, who we were playing with, and I were laughing so loud we couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an idiot.

413
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:53,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

414
00:25:54,561 --> 00:26:20,991
[SPEAKER_11]: um otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade and every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that he's like why aren't you playing this on PC but I don't know I want the achievements don't judge me um and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade I once knew you know we've had a bunch of sad news about you know we had the Chinatown Arcade in New York City closed Arcade Infinity closed as far as I'm concerned Roseville Golf Land closed too that place is dead to me

415
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:28,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.

416
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:30,617
[SPEAKER_04]: He's gonna hear me fuss.

417
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,099
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no Beatmania anymore.

418
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:34,780
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no DJ Max Technica.

419
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,442
[SPEAKER_11]: They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.

420
00:26:37,882 --> 00:26:39,844
[SPEAKER_11]: All they have is... DDR Disney.

421
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:45,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Disney and Max 2, and then the Drum Freaks guitar hero, which I'm not even into that anymore.

422
00:26:45,728 --> 00:26:49,150
[SPEAKER_10]: They have Guitar Freaks and Drum Freaks that beat the hell up, but they're there at least.

423
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're beat.

424
00:26:50,351 --> 00:27:17,086
[SPEAKER_10]: but I'm just you know I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of I mean I would be cool if there were some fun fighting games no Capcom SNK to be found no Soul Calibur nothing it's they have an original Soul Calibur 2 where the hell was that it was hidden somewhere and they also have an SNK it's like um three different King of Fighters and then a Metal Slug one of those four-in-one boxes when I played that a couple months ago and I was last there I was

425
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:21,928
[SPEAKER_10]: on the right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.

426
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, this is sad.

427
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:29,991
[SPEAKER_11]: The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because that is one racing game I do really like.

428
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:30,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll play that.

429
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,694
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Initial D5, which there's a lot of people really into that series.

430
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:35,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure we're playing that.

431
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,479
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

432
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:56,191
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like the Sega Rambo game.

433
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,614
[SPEAKER_10]: That game is kind of fun.

434
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:01,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Some dad swiped his card for his little girl.

435
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:07,484
[SPEAKER_10]: She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun as big as she is playing Rambo.

436
00:28:07,564 --> 00:28:08,465
[SPEAKER_10]: She wasn't doing that well.

437
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:09,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, that is awesome.

438
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:11,188
[SPEAKER_10]: You kill all those mercenaries.

439
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:12,929
[SPEAKER_10]: You just, yeah.

440
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,010
[SPEAKER_11]: You go ahead, girl.

441
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

442
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:14,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

443
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

444
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:20,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Giovedea has a warning about the Blarney Stone.

445
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't kiss the stone.

446
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:24,052
[SPEAKER_11]: All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.

447
00:28:24,072 --> 00:28:26,713
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably some good advice.

448
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:27,693
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

449
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:32,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle.

450
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:36,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got video of my uncle doing it.

451
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:36,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

452
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:38,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

453
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:39,276
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not peeing on it.

454
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Your uncle kissed pee.

455
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,330
[SPEAKER_04]: He went for his honeymoon.

456
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

457
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And kissed pee.

458
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:45,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

459
00:28:45,951 --> 00:28:46,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Lady and the Tramp?

460
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:52,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think... I really don't think there's any way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.

461
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:54,315
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

462
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:56,156
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what boys like to do is pee on things.

463
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So where there's a will, there's a pee.

464
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:01,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, what else did I play this week otherwise?

465
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,440
[SPEAKER_11]: That was... I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.

466
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:04,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

467
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy III on the iPhone came out this week.

468
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,422
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

469
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,790
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

470
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:56,309
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that ends up being the case of Final Fantasy 3, you can just move your thumb to the upper right and have your analog stick be there.

471
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very small little improvement that I really like.

472
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,334
[SPEAKER_11]: The only tricky, touchy price is the price.

473
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,018
[SPEAKER_11]: $15.99 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.

474
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:11,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a little high, but then you gotta... What a game is worth...

475
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:30,129
[SPEAKER_11]: is really up in the air right now and this is where a lot of controversy comes in which you've heard about you know a game developers conference where Nintendo was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and sold 99 cents for a game and you know all this so I mean $15.99 yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game but at the same time

476
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:38,375
[SPEAKER_11]: The quality is pretty great and you're getting a port or remake, whatever you want to call it, of a $35 DS game.

477
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:42,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.

478
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:48,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

479
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,384
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you already know if this game is for you or not.

480
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:52,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.

481
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:58,867
[SPEAKER_11]: But it looks beautiful, and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't really see for yourself.

482
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:14,170
[SPEAKER_11]: The very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out the 4 remake as well, but at the same time, with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with the After Years.

483
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,530
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.

484
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,371
[SPEAKER_09]: What if they put it out with the remake and the After Years?

485
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:23,494
[SPEAKER_11]: On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.

486
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:32,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like five years ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4.

487
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm probably not going to get that on the iPhone.

488
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:39,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.

489
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:46,591
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like $10 whenever the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.

490
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:47,272
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

491
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:50,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.

492
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:54,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.

493
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it's just what you were talking about.

494
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:59,015
[SPEAKER_09]: How Nintendo was poo-pooing on the developers and stuff like that.

495
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,537
[SPEAKER_09]: The indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.

496
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:08,280
[SPEAKER_09]: They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system.

497
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Is their quote.

498
00:32:10,922 --> 00:32:15,645
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people that... They want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers.

499
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:17,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Just people that make games, I guess.

500
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:21,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't want crappy games coming out on their system.

501
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

502
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:24,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me!

503
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:27,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Crappy games coming out of your system.

504
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:31,360
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.

505
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:40,452
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers and legitimate publishers.

506
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there.

507
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody that, I don't know, might add some innovation to something instead of, say, licensing Jelly Belly or licensing Smiley Face.

508
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,545
[SPEAKER_09]: The icon of the 60s, 70s?

509
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:59,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo, that's current.

510
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.

511
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:08,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think... See, once again, this kind of goes back to they don't understand...

512
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:10,644
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole online business.

513
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:16,987
[SPEAKER_09]: They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to the online thing, they're just lost.

514
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like they just don't know what they're doing.

515
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:30,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?

516
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:35,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.

517
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:44,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, how do you not put virtual console stuff out there for $4, $5, $6, $7 and put it all out for $9?

518
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:50,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just crazy amounts of games.

519
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:59,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the other thing, too, is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?

520
00:34:00,202 --> 00:34:01,563
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to buy the SDK, right?

521
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:02,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

522
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:07,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit, because I think you can just download that.

523
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:08,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

524
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,271
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a license.

525
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,492
[SPEAKER_11]: There is.

526
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:17,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless of if the developers are making the money or not.

527
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:24,440
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing they have to worry about is if anything is going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.

528
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:29,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have set up.

529
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So, really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry about.

530
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:41,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.

531
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:46,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is it something they're going to do to make money?

532
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:54,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with because Nintendo doesn't have to deal with the same clientele.

533
00:34:55,373 --> 00:35:02,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem with Nintendo, and what they're worried about is the fact that they're a first-party developer as well.

534
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:04,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they put out their own games.

535
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple doesn't put out their own games.

536
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:06,516
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't care.

537
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:11,478
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I mean, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.

538
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:20,700
[SPEAKER_09]: They can put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.

539
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much garbage on there.

540
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:23,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.

541
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:28,958
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see what's garbage and what's not garbage.

542
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:41,621
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.

543
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:44,103
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just they're not willing to embrace that.

544
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:52,308
[SPEAKER_11]: It's tricky to say, too, where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super Meat Boy, and that was kind of a, I mean, I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer, but it was definitely in that middle ground.

545
00:35:52,328 --> 00:35:54,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was basically two guys that made that whole game.

546
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:57,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite maybe they had somebody else do the music and so forth.

547
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:58,953
[SPEAKER_11]: But the core of the game was two guys.

548
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:03,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's probably one of the best arcade games to have come out in the past year.

549
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:07,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?

550
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.

551
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:13,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't have a problem with that.

552
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:15,365
[SPEAKER_09]: What if people want to buy fart apps?

553
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:15,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

554
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:16,406
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

555
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's going to say, oh, well, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.

556
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:20,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you don't buy it, okay?

557
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:21,790
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a big deal.

558
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:28,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and the whole point, too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only really work on something like a phone.

559
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:33,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.

560
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the Wii?

561
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,175
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

562
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:42,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring out your phone and do it.

563
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:48,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.

564
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:48,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

565
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:57,507
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer is do people like their games?

566
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:59,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's really the only difference to them.

567
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:02,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, two people developing out of a garage made a popular game.

568
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:04,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, they're an indie developer.

569
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:07,435
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, large company makes fart app.

570
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:08,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, they're a garage developer.

571
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:12,879
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really, I think, the only... That's their only excuse.

572
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:13,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

573
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, it just comes down to that they're just not embracing what they need to be embracing.

574
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:20,827
[SPEAKER_09]: The business model that's going to make them money.

575
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:23,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Some interesting comments from chat room.

576
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Blackwolf says, XNA indie games sold so well too.

577
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:27,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Or wait.

578
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:35,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say, though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft really advertised it at first.

579
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:40,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the real arcade?

580
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:41,997
[SPEAKER_11]: They do that.

581
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:42,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they?

582
00:37:43,197 --> 00:37:45,898
[SPEAKER_09]: They do that, but it's so rare, though.

583
00:37:46,278 --> 00:37:49,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know that Dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing.

584
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:57,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a competition that they hold each year, and the top few games actually do get published as Xbox Live Arcade games.

585
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,801
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

586
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:17,079
[SPEAKER_09]: and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.

587
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:27,706
[SPEAKER_09]: People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store where you can say, okay, well, the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just crap, you know, I rated it one star.

588
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:32,569
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, okay, this game is glitchy and it doesn't load or this game is broken or whatever.

589
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:34,490
[SPEAKER_11]: The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.

590
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:40,514
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a clunky way to find good games and it really screws over those developers who don't land in the top spots.

591
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:43,775
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.

592
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,455
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my only thing with XNA.

593
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,716
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so many games on there, I don't know where to begin.

594
00:38:47,896 --> 00:38:49,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of the top stuff is poop.

595
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of people probably look at that and go, really?

596
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:55,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is the top stuff on XNA?

597
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:56,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all of it.

598
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,280
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some good stuff that gets in there, but I don't know.

599
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong.

600
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just the presentation of it all.

601
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,962
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.

602
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:09,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I get why they put it where they do.

603
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:12,343
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's ways they could feature it better than they do.

604
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:13,104
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

605
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:19,045
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony is going to try with PlayStation Suite.

606
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is something that's on the horizon.

607
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:25,167
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.

608
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:25,787
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

609
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:49,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leads to Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make games.

610
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:57,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny.

611
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to download that.

612
00:39:59,043 --> 00:39:59,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's fine.

613
00:39:59,824 --> 00:40:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to download that.

614
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:03,728
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the thing Nintendo has to understand.

615
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the stuff that they have people paying.

616
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:10,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, they have the Major League Eating game.

617
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:12,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

618
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, come on.

619
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that really Nintendo quality?

620
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:21,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League Eating on our system.

621
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like the Beer Pong game or something like that.

622
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,133
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of crap on there.

623
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:31,915
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that they're just coming out saying, oh, well, we don't want these garage developers ruining our system.

624
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:39,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.

625
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news, but that's okay.

626
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:46,835
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about games.

627
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:47,616
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we roll.

628
00:40:47,676 --> 00:40:49,758
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we haven't got the video, or the news.

629
00:40:49,918 --> 00:40:51,019
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to get to more of the news.

630
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,281
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's okay.

631
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:54,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.

632
00:40:54,783 --> 00:41:00,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you can always add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

633
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:05,554
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how you can keep tabs with us online, or visit our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

634
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:10,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.

635
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:12,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.

636
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

637
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into some video game news for the week.

638
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, start us off.

639
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Yummy, yummy, yummy news.

640
00:41:22,992 --> 00:41:23,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is kind of funny.

641
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of laughed a little bit, but it's not that big a deal, and I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.

642
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Duke Nukem Forever, delayed.

643
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:38,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only delayed a month, and that's not a big deal.

644
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:42,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.

645
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,891
[SPEAKER_09]: It was coming out in May.

646
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.

647
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:51,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A.

648
00:41:51,576 --> 00:42:01,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Noire, then there's Brink, and then Fear 3, and Hunted the Demon's Forge, Dungeon Siege 3, MX vs. ATV Alive.

649
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.

650
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:08,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, LEGO, I mean, it's not really direct competition,

651
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:10,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.

652
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,369
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean... School's letting out, right?

653
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:16,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.

654
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,831
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not typical that May's a busy month.

655
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:31,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually June is a little bit busier, May's kind of eh, and then April's is dead, which April is still dead, but like last year they had a lot of good games come out in May and it kind of worked out for them, so they're kind of doing that again.

656
00:42:33,257 --> 00:43:00,366
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June for them at least because June right now doesn't have much coming out it has a few AAA games and that's it I mean there's stuff that's not announced yet but very few games compared to May coming out so whatever it's a month it's not like 10 years now if it's delayed again and again and again and again then well you know there's not really anything we can say about that but did you watch the little video

657
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:02,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I just watched the video, it was funny.

658
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:02,985
[SPEAKER_09]: The video was funny.

659
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:06,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know here.

660
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was pretty funny.

661
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.

662
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, see, here's the thing.

663
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:24,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in development only as long as Gearbox has had it.

664
00:43:24,695 --> 00:43:25,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't...

665
00:43:25,816 --> 00:43:26,156
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.

666
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:50,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.

667
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:53,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they could have... It could have just, like, no one could have bought it.

668
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,081
[SPEAKER_09]: They just said, eh, forget it, you know.

669
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:57,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Duke Nukem's 10 years ago, who cares?

670
00:43:58,123 --> 00:43:58,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

671
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:02,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something, but... Oh, hell no, that wouldn't work.

672
00:44:02,827 --> 00:44:03,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

673
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,789
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point, you just have to put it out.

674
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:06,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have an idea.

675
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:11,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.

676
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:16,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem forever if it wasn't delayed at least one more time.

677
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:20,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.

678
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:25,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced.

679
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:27,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Duke Match, Team Duke Match.

680
00:44:27,928 --> 00:44:34,154
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.

681
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.

682
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:42,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But the babe will sporadically freak out and you have to...

683
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:43,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitch, please.

684
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to be a widower at 33

685
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:39,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?

686
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:44,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.

687
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:44,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

688
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:46,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps.

689
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,430
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.

690
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:50,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, people.

691
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:52,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

692
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:53,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem made me very happy.

693
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.

694
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:59,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to this new one even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.

695
00:46:00,033 --> 00:46:02,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be so, so very disappointed but I swear I don't care.

696
00:46:04,535 --> 00:46:04,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like

697
00:46:05,772 --> 00:46:06,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Death Race 3000 Death Race 2000

698
00:46:31,553 --> 00:46:33,975
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, moving on to something a little more artful.

699
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:37,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you're familiar with a company called the Weinstein Company.

700
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:43,081
[SPEAKER_11]: This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting into films when they left Miramax.

701
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,321
[SPEAKER_11]: They went their separate ways, right?

702
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:47,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And they actually put out or they distributed.

703
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:48,304
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't.

704
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:49,324
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

705
00:47:03,912 --> 00:47:05,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Halloween, Hellraiser,

706
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:35,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids, all of these would now fall under this possible TWC games label.

707
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Spy Kids is frightening.

708
00:47:37,595 --> 00:47:39,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.

709
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:46,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand they're what, James Bond for kids, right?

710
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:46,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much?

711
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:49,644
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.

712
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:54,688
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became what, Lava Girl and Shark Boy?

713
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:56,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.

714
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:58,110
[SPEAKER_10]: He was Shark Boy.

715
00:47:58,411 --> 00:47:58,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, really?

716
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:02,113
[SPEAKER_11]: You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.

717
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:03,114
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of frightens me.

718
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:05,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the origin of Machete.

719
00:48:06,376 --> 00:48:06,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

720
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's okay.

721
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:11,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under Miramax?

722
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,101
[SPEAKER_10]: They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.

723
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:15,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Pulp Fiction was Miramax.

724
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.

725
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:20,164
[SPEAKER_11]: So where's my Kill Bill video game?

726
00:48:20,184 --> 00:48:21,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that could be a part of this.

727
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,366
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

728
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:23,386
[SPEAKER_09]: It very well could be.

729
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:24,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Very well could be.

730
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:27,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially if they do a sequel, which they were talking about doing.

731
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:27,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

732
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:45,485
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's it you know obviously no game announcements right now but they are exploring these brands in the video game universe I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense and yes I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago and you may remember I mean it's not unlike you know

733
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:49,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Movie Studios to get into the game business.

734
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:52,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.

735
00:48:54,194 --> 00:48:56,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot.

736
00:48:56,797 --> 00:48:58,959
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't do anything console-wise right now.

737
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:05,605
[SPEAKER_09]: They like some online downloadable games, but Warner Games is a big one for sure.

738
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:06,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And Disney.

739
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:08,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Disney Interactive.

740
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:10,213
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

741
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:12,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future.

742
00:49:12,636 --> 00:49:14,437
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, nothing but an announcement.

743
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And who knows?

744
00:49:15,378 --> 00:49:19,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5 or 6 or 21.

745
00:49:20,363 --> 00:49:20,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

746
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:25,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.

747
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:30,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies like Saw and all that stuff.

748
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,255
[SPEAKER_11]: But to me, Scream is like...

749
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:35,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, like, Scream is okay.

750
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not, like, soft-sick.

751
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mind the Scream movies, actually.

752
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Scream's cute.

753
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:42,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?

754
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Showgirls.

755
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:47,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.

756
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:47,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll see those.

757
00:49:48,346 --> 00:49:51,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I just hope that Hayden Pantera is the before-the-credits killing.

758
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,451
[SPEAKER_11]: No spoilers in chat, I will destroy you.

759
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:57,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, DarkSakura.

760
00:49:58,013 --> 00:50:02,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of kids, movies, and scary, Pokemons!

761
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:03,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

762
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold 2 million units in the first two weeks in the US.

763
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:15,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And 5 million plus copies in Japan.

764
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, they've made their money.

765
00:50:19,568 --> 00:50:20,829
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 million people playing the game.

766
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.

767
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:33,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were at Dimple, which is a local resale place, and they're saying that basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.

768
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:34,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sure.

769
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:37,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so... Kids eat this shit up.

770
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:39,699
[SPEAKER_11]: How adults eat this stuff up, too.

771
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, Miklatov, who's been on this show in the past.

772
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:44,422
[SPEAKER_04]: He was playing Black and White.

773
00:50:44,562 --> 00:50:46,543
[SPEAKER_11]: He imported it, and he got the regular ones.

774
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:47,184
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

775
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:52,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?

776
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:55,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.

777
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:57,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.

778
00:50:57,669 --> 00:51:04,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old school black and white Game Boy.

779
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:05,353
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

780
00:51:05,713 --> 00:51:10,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.

781
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:12,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe black and white does something different that I haven't seen yet.

782
00:51:13,017 --> 00:51:14,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.

783
00:51:14,998 --> 00:51:16,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, black and white, you can collect poop.

784
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yay.

785
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And their poop does special things.

786
00:51:20,607 --> 00:51:21,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hooray.

787
00:51:23,286 --> 00:51:24,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

788
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:25,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow.

789
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:28,150
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

790
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably check that out eventually.

791
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:32,393
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know there's going to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.

792
00:51:32,413 --> 00:51:32,834
[SPEAKER_11]: You know it.

793
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon.

794
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:34,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

795
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:36,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with Pokemon.

796
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:37,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really done.

797
00:51:39,118 --> 00:51:42,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I would never say never because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?

798
00:51:43,102 --> 00:51:44,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's different.

799
00:51:44,022 --> 00:51:46,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.

800
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:48,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.

801
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:51,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.

802
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:54,671
[SPEAKER_04]: There is sort of one that someone made called Pokefarm, like a website.

803
00:51:54,691 --> 00:52:02,518
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I mean official Reggie Fils-Aimé coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.

804
00:52:02,538 --> 00:52:03,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Nintendo wouldn't really do an MMO.

805
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:05,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I have it tied to my harem of women down here.

806
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:07,963
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.

807
00:52:09,424 --> 00:52:16,030
[SPEAKER_11]: If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.

808
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:37,397
[SPEAKER_11]: it'd be something like Animal Crossing I think too a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs because Pokemon is so much for kids like you know it would be an MMO with predetermined phrases that you can say and you know it's it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO but that would be better than nothing but that's just me so

809
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:43,848
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.

810
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I read a list a couple days ago.

811
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:54,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game.

812
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:58,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like, this Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.

813
00:52:59,037 --> 00:52:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Cubone!

814
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:01,338
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Cubone.

815
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:02,198
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

816
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:02,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

817
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: This one is a soul of a dead child who comes back and eats other souls.

818
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:33,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed and it's supposed to be like an alien thing but it's still like dude not cool you know this might be why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that maybe that hits a little close to home especially for kids anyhow let's move on more gaming news Loki

819
00:53:34,964 --> 00:53:36,225
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

820
00:53:54,605 --> 00:54:01,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.

821
00:54:01,993 --> 00:54:05,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're going to have some controller-free racing.

822
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.

823
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:10,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the U-Force?

824
00:54:11,384 --> 00:54:14,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to use Force or like Joyride.

825
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:20,993
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying it's going to support up to 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.

826
00:54:22,114 --> 00:54:25,657
[SPEAKER_09]: They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode.

827
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,083
[SPEAKER_09]: A new career mode involving an automotive world tour.

828
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:35,708
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to increase the variety of challenges and events that you participate in.

829
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:44,958
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and shading models.

830
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I guess they're saying that...

831
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:50,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Head Tracking

832
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:15,237
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

833
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:36,209
[SPEAKER_11]: 9-1-1

834
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:59,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft wanted to correct something saying it's not it's actually not called Ground Zero though it's called Relic Castle maybe it was something to do with the translation one of my friends was saying something but of course you know how rumors go

835
00:56:17,188 --> 00:56:18,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So, alright, fine, there you go.

836
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:20,431
[SPEAKER_11]: A little correction issued there.

837
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:28,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza... Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.

838
00:56:28,479 --> 00:56:30,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

839
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:30,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Head tracking.

840
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:32,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very interested to see...

841
00:56:34,865 --> 00:56:35,806
[SPEAKER_09]: That implemented more games.

842
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:37,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I really think it's a good idea, and it's simple.

843
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:42,051
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to be like, oh, casual.

844
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Head tracking is all you've got to do, and you can even say, hey, look, it puts you in the game, and guess what?

845
00:56:46,334 --> 00:56:49,317
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to use the stupid Kinect stuff if you don't want to.

846
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,077
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

847
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:52,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the cement mixer one.

848
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:09,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Peek-a-Peek.com

849
00:57:28,129 --> 00:57:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: PICA-PIC.com if you want to check this out you can actually play a variety of the Game & Watch LCD games at least until this website gets shut down but really Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game & Watch games I don't know so yeah I'm on it right now I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here let's see what did I find here

850
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Otto's Slalom.

851
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:56,084
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't look like fun.

852
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:57,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play Mario Brothers or something.

853
00:57:58,245 --> 00:57:58,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Cook.

854
00:57:59,026 --> 00:57:59,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I remember this one.

855
00:58:01,368 --> 00:58:02,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Good Times.

856
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can even move back and forth.

857
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:03,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That's done very well.

858
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:10,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S and K. So let me see if I can start.

859
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:11,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

860
00:58:12,396 --> 00:58:13,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Good Times.

861
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen to the sounds of LCD games.

862
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:17,560
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

863
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,982
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.

864
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks like it's Russian.

865
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:25,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.

866
00:58:26,594 --> 00:58:27,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, good times.

867
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:36,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So check that out, pica-pic.com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain you for like five minutes.

868
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:43,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.

869
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness of the romance in Dragon Age 2.

870
00:58:55,731 --> 00:59:01,277
[SPEAKER_04]: And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer and that

871
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:08,547
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't like that, you know, basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.

872
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:10,788
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, we are your demographic.

873
00:59:10,828 --> 00:59:12,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to cater to us.

874
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:15,830
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.

875
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:17,131
[SPEAKER_04]: We play The Sims.

876
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

877
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:23,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us male gamers were happy.

878
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you don't speak for me, I love Dragon Age 2.

879
00:59:30,181 --> 00:59:35,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.

880
00:59:35,143 --> 00:59:38,645
[SPEAKER_04]: He also uses commas very poorly.

881
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:46,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of BioWare.

882
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer, we know you don't.

883
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:01,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight male gamers out there.

884
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:26,141
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically saying you know I'll read a few lines here and there it says the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer they're for everyone we have a lot of fans many of whom are neither straight nor male and they deserve no less attention we have good numbers after all on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of content in DAO and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea that the numbers are not insignificant

885
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:48,182
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically going on you know it's basically saying yeah we don't care you're you need to get your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world and there's one paragraph if you don't mind me reading it go ahead that is like the most awesome thing and I think it applies to the world in general and I think everyone needs to take this to heart and

886
01:00:48,742 --> 01:01:13,335
[SPEAKER_04]: and if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility it has to do with privilege you can write it off as political correctness if you wish but the truth is that privilege always lies with the majority they're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance they don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them what's everyone's fuss all about that's the way it should be anybody else should get used to not getting what they want

887
01:01:15,427 --> 01:01:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

888
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:36,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.

889
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:40,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.

890
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is an insanely popular series with women.

891
01:01:43,469 --> 01:01:44,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara is a big fan.

892
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.

893
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.

894
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:53,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.

895
01:01:54,255 --> 01:01:55,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.

896
01:01:56,556 --> 01:01:57,477
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

897
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:15,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.

898
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:17,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I also don't understand where this dude is coming from.

899
01:02:18,008 --> 01:02:20,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever watched an episode of Will & Grace?

900
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out?

901
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:26,132
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

902
01:02:27,112 --> 01:02:32,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if there really wasn't an option, a good game is still a good game.

903
01:02:32,394 --> 01:02:33,675
[SPEAKER_11]: A good story is a good story.

904
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:35,736
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like, what's your big...

905
01:02:36,136 --> 01:02:57,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I'd say homocentric, is there's got to be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well, this makes me uncomfortable.

906
01:02:57,674 --> 01:03:00,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got to be personal insecurity, I think.

907
01:03:01,797 --> 01:03:01,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

908
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:16,289
[SPEAKER_10]: My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play him with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the male NPCs that you could do a same-sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit.

909
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:20,153
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that the game is set up is to where...

910
01:03:20,974 --> 01:03:25,978
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell, okay, well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.

911
01:03:26,718 --> 01:03:36,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility, even if it's not something that they would RP into the game themselves.

912
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:43,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they basically, if there is a same-sex option, they want it buried so deep that you have to go to GameFAQs and look up how to do it.

913
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:49,075
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game, because they don't like it.

914
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.

915
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:54,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

916
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:01,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna have to get used to, you know, things are gonna happen in life that you're not comfortable with.

917
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:03,137
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

918
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:25,269
[SPEAKER_11]: and I have to play through all these games that have straight storylines.

919
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:30,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these games?

920
01:04:31,013 --> 01:04:32,514
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because they're stories.

921
01:04:33,055 --> 01:04:41,881
[SPEAKER_11]: And like, for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.

922
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:49,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time.

923
01:04:50,066 --> 01:04:53,290
[SPEAKER_11]: was so emotionally moving.

924
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:57,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?

925
01:04:57,915 --> 01:04:58,156
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

926
01:04:58,376 --> 01:05:01,700
[SPEAKER_11]: A good story is a good story.

927
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:02,641
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

928
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:07,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.

929
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:09,472
[SPEAKER_04]: You think about this.

930
01:05:10,052 --> 01:05:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: When you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.

931
01:05:14,053 --> 01:05:20,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's in your character's nature to flirt with a girl, then you stay within your character's nature.

932
01:05:20,994 --> 01:05:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.

933
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:26,836
[SPEAKER_04]: If they are completely...

934
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:34,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Say you're playing the most uptight paladin, they're supposed to get uncomfortable whenever anyone flirts with them.

935
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:35,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the type of thing.

936
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:39,478
[SPEAKER_04]: You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing if it's immersive enough of a game.

937
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:44,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.

938
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

939
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,801
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole point of view, the whole thing is that you are in-game as your character.

940
01:05:52,161 --> 01:05:54,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's saying you are you in the game,

941
01:05:55,905 --> 01:05:59,209
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, you're playing this person that's living in this life at this time.

942
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:05,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable show a little bit of interest?

943
01:06:07,350 --> 01:06:08,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just ridiculous.

944
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:10,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Bro Dude needs to get over it.

945
01:06:10,272 --> 01:06:12,594
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.

946
01:06:12,754 --> 01:06:18,758
[SPEAKER_11]: B, if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're forced to watch anal sex, okay?

947
01:06:18,918 --> 01:06:20,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, let's be real.

948
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:20,859
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fade.

949
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It's artful and, you know, whatever.

950
01:06:24,242 --> 01:06:32,988
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters you're not comfortable with, but there's no game that's tacky like that.

951
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:33,749
[SPEAKER_11]: at all.

952
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:35,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that maybe the guy game?

953
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:37,894
[SPEAKER_11]: How many years ago was that?

954
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:40,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little upset, though, that she didn't look pregnant.

955
01:07:06,997 --> 01:07:07,337
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

956
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:10,918
[SPEAKER_11]: D'Artagnan in our chatroom says, my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.

957
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:12,619
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

958
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:18,181
[SPEAKER_10]: In Final Fantasy X2, they made Lulu a stay-at-home mom.

959
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:20,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally destroyed her form.

960
01:07:20,682 --> 01:07:22,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, X2, that's right.

961
01:07:23,303 --> 01:07:25,904
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates.

962
01:07:25,924 --> 01:07:31,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Some games coming out soon to Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.

963
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:35,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

964
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:41,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming out today, because, well, that's today and not next week.

965
01:07:43,074 --> 01:07:51,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other cool stuff, though, that will be coming our way, WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PSP.

966
01:07:52,717 --> 01:07:58,699
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're looking for an arcade-style WWE game, kind of reminds me of stuff that they had way back on, like,

967
01:07:59,399 --> 01:08:18,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Nintendo NES Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360 Of course, to tie in with the new movie, Hop on Nintendo DS Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii

968
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:33,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition that's coming out on PSP as well.

969
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:40,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

970
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: NASCAR 11 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

971
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:48,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Country Dance.

972
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:52,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it.

973
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:54,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, it's not actually by Ubisoft.

974
01:08:54,775 --> 01:08:57,736
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a knockoff, but same type of thing.

975
01:08:58,797 --> 01:08:59,697
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will be on the Wii.

976
01:09:00,338 --> 01:09:03,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Pinkalicious, based off of some children's book.

977
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:04,740
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on Nintendo DS.

978
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Zuzu Puppies.

979
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:07,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's not hamsters anymore.

980
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:09,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just animals.

981
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:11,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So now that's coming out on Nintendo DS.

982
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:12,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

983
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:30,565
[SPEAKER_11]: and that would be it again the chat's delayed a little bit but I have to read this comment from chat because I love it so much before I get to the Japanese release dates Bochikawa in our chatroom says if it's a choice it's a choice in a game you've got another choice don't play the game

984
01:09:31,845 --> 01:09:32,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Well said, my friend.

985
01:09:33,106 --> 01:09:36,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, on to Japanese release dates and what's coming out in Japan very soon.

986
01:09:36,629 --> 01:09:41,892
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 as well as a game called Nailed.

987
01:09:42,353 --> 01:09:44,494
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that is not a sexual connotation.

988
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:46,616
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually looks like an ATV racing game.

989
01:09:46,676 --> 01:09:49,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah.

990
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:50,759
[SPEAKER_11]: They nailed it.

991
01:09:51,539 --> 01:09:52,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Top Spin 4.

992
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,520
[SPEAKER_11]: The, uh...

993
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:55,183
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

994
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:06,605
[SPEAKER_11]: That controversial at all.

995
01:10:08,426 --> 01:10:14,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, moving on to releases on the PlayStation 3.

996
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Topspin 4 there as well.

997
01:10:19,555 --> 01:10:21,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.

998
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:24,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing, because things have dried up there a little bit.

999
01:10:25,779 --> 01:10:41,728
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 3DS, March 31st, you have to look forward to BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imekai Sakyou Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4-themed stuff.

1000
01:10:42,168 --> 01:10:43,849
[SPEAKER_11]: You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?

1001
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:44,429
[SPEAKER_11]: You got it.

1002
01:10:44,889 --> 01:10:45,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So forth.

1003
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:51,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here because sadly there's like nothing really coming out on the 360 or the PS3.

1004
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:56,195
[SPEAKER_11]: But granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now, I'm sure some things kind of got moved around.

1005
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:56,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know.

1006
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:03,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift 2 is out there as well.

1007
01:11:03,299 --> 01:11:06,000
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, and, Oni Chambara Special.

1008
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:06,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1009
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,001
[SPEAKER_11]: March 31st.

1010
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:10,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on to Europe.

1011
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:12,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not a whole bunch.

1012
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short list.

1013
01:11:14,122 --> 01:11:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 30th, we have Islands of Wakfu and Strania the Stella Machine.

1014
01:11:19,644 --> 01:11:21,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Machina.

1015
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:25,926
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me think of your cat.

1016
01:11:27,096 --> 01:11:28,136
[SPEAKER_09]: The Stellamachina.

1017
01:11:28,476 --> 01:11:29,097
[SPEAKER_04]: The Stellamachina.

1018
01:11:29,117 --> 01:11:30,757
[SPEAKER_09]: She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.

1019
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:31,197
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1020
01:11:31,477 --> 01:11:33,358
[SPEAKER_09]: She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.

1021
01:11:34,478 --> 01:11:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've seen.

1022
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:40,260
[SPEAKER_04]: And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow, Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse.

1023
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, as Loki would have us believe, is awesome.

1024
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:45,081
[SPEAKER_09]: It is very awesome.

1025
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:49,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like, awesome?

1026
01:11:49,582 --> 01:11:50,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

1027
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome, apparently.

1028
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:51,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It is that awesome.

1029
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

1030
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:57,859
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just a little ways away from the classic game of the week.

1031
01:11:58,099 --> 01:11:59,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Real good one this week, too.

1032
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,681
[SPEAKER_11]: One that I think a lot of you have played.

1033
01:12:00,882 --> 01:12:02,903
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll get there after a couple more news stories.

1034
01:12:03,924 --> 01:12:04,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

1035
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:08,328
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this is always fun.

1036
01:12:10,803 --> 01:12:23,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony, and I don't even really know if this is a big deal, but I guess they're transferring the online service operations to a new division of their company, I guess.

1037
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:26,389
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sony Network Entertainment Inc.

1038
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,851
[SPEAKER_09]: instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and that kind of stuff.

1039
01:12:31,672 --> 01:12:32,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1040
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:36,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.

1041
01:12:36,794 --> 01:12:39,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like

1042
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:45,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, the people that run Ragnarok online or something like that.

1043
01:12:45,606 --> 01:12:46,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Although that would be quite funny.

1044
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:51,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Ragnarok.

1045
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,647
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are covering this.

1046
01:12:52,667 --> 01:13:00,469
[SPEAKER_09]: The change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into a new terms of service.

1047
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:02,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Blah, blah, blah.

1048
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:04,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So what?

1049
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:07,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're changing the name of

1050
01:13:08,795 --> 01:13:09,516
[SPEAKER_09]: That division.

1051
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:12,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more of like a consolidation thing.

1052
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:13,459
[SPEAKER_11]: It really doesn't seem like a big deal.

1053
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:18,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot of our listeners do.

1054
01:13:18,463 --> 01:13:23,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always gives us the PSN updates and all that.

1055
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:26,711
[SPEAKER_11]: It's consolidating with the one on the PlayStation 3.

1056
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:28,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And that sounds like a good thing.

1057
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:31,555
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably all moving towards something more unified for PC.

1058
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:54,940
[SPEAKER_11]: The NGP or whatever they ultimately call that thing And honestly if Microsoft does it with the Zune points I guess the Zune isn't around anymore But you know what I mean The points for Microsoft on the 360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune Or on your PC through Windows Media It's just competitive or whatever It's no big deal really

1059
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1060
01:13:57,021 --> 01:14:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.

1061
01:14:02,864 --> 01:14:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.

1062
01:14:05,545 --> 01:14:06,226
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not.

1063
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:07,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just whatever.

1064
01:14:08,047 --> 01:14:09,388
[SPEAKER_09]: They're changing something.

1065
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:11,769
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.

1066
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:17,292
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account or

1067
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:22,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.

1068
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:59,385
[SPEAKER_11]: a Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega if you want to see more information on that go to their blogs blogs.sega.com a Yakuza track jacket there's a lot of a Dreamcast bag there's like I'm sure tons of stuff in here where DarkSakura would be like what?

1069
01:15:00,965 --> 01:15:02,286
[SPEAKER_11]: or she's like I have four of those already

1070
01:15:03,646 --> 01:15:06,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3.

1071
01:15:06,847 --> 01:15:07,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I know she doesn't have that.

1072
01:15:08,848 --> 01:15:10,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Virtua Tennis sweatbands.

1073
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:11,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've seen those before.

1074
01:15:12,209 --> 01:15:15,190
[SPEAKER_11]: But how about an OutRun art signed by Yu Suzuki?

1075
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet Dan would be all over that.

1076
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:19,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.

1077
01:15:19,872 --> 01:15:20,252
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1078
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:23,113
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, it's for Japan relief.

1079
01:15:23,373 --> 01:15:23,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1080
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:24,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, it is a good cause.

1081
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:25,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good cause.

1082
01:15:25,594 --> 01:15:26,194
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great cause.

1083
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:31,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.

1084
01:15:31,638 --> 01:15:36,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that's on Facebook right now and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.

1085
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:36,922
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it?

1086
01:15:37,182 --> 01:15:41,325
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.

1087
01:15:41,725 --> 01:15:46,329
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed to be on TV.

1088
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:47,389
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1089
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,340
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's a whole special thing.

1090
01:16:26,656 --> 01:16:27,777
[SPEAKER_11]: All for a great cause.

1091
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:34,101
[SPEAKER_11]: So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty good.

1092
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:40,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually sounds like an interesting special.

1093
01:16:40,985 --> 01:16:45,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.

1094
01:16:45,608 --> 01:16:46,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So very cool.

1095
01:16:46,849 --> 01:16:47,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of...

1096
01:16:47,709 --> 01:17:15,031
[SPEAKER_11]: it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming industry to like a telethon type thing like you remember when another big tragedy happened Katrina and George Clooney put together all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief this kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a you know different type of tragedy so kind of neat definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds I think it's a good idea

1097
01:17:15,251 --> 01:17:16,952
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1098
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:52,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic game of the week is Darkstalkers which in Japan was known as Vampire and in Europe as Vampire Hunter

1099
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, there was a trilogy of these.

1100
01:17:57,772 --> 01:18:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic, super fun, and one of my favorite games ever.

1101
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:09,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before, where we had the World Cup Soccer and Killer Instinct.

1102
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:11,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this was another game that we had.

1103
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:19,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was this one guy who was super epically awesome at this game, and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did, and I felt so accomplished.

1104
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors, Vampire Savior

1105
01:18:31,992 --> 01:18:35,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a Vampire Hunter 2 and a Vampire Savior 2.

1106
01:18:35,714 --> 01:18:37,315
[SPEAKER_04]: They were sort of upgraded versions.

1107
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:39,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the re-releases which came out later.

1108
01:18:40,116 --> 01:18:49,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this particular universe and hunters.

1109
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:56,745
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've got your vampires, you have your ghosts, your demon possessions, your zombies.

1110
01:18:57,405 --> 01:19:17,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters in the game, there was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbane, who was the werewolf, Victor von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was the succubus, Anakaris, who was a mummy, Felicia, the catwoman, Bishamon, who was this possessed samurai armor.

1111
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:24,444
[SPEAKER_04]: You had Rikuo, who was the fishman, and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch!

1112
01:19:25,665 --> 01:19:26,125
[SPEAKER_04]: What a shock!

1113
01:19:27,441 --> 01:19:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot, like an ancient Aztec robot, and Pyron, who was this flame guy.

1114
01:19:40,015 --> 01:19:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1115
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:10,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors

1116
01:20:30,573 --> 01:20:32,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Super, super awesome game.

1117
01:20:32,675 --> 01:20:36,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the U.S.

1118
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the Japanese version was the same because, I mean, the Saturn had more memory for it.

1119
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:40,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool.

1120
01:20:41,582 --> 01:20:48,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jedha, who was totally my character for a while.

1121
01:20:49,829 --> 01:20:54,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.

1122
01:20:55,954 --> 01:20:57,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And QB, who was always fun.

1123
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:58,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And Baby Bonnie Hood.

1124
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, she actually had a better name in Japan, it was Boletta.

1125
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,291
[SPEAKER_04]: She was super fun to use.

1126
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:09,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love her ending, because it's like, this monster family watching TV.

1127
01:21:10,113 --> 01:21:11,313
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been this massacre!

1128
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Never will watch out for a human person!

1129
01:21:13,514 --> 01:21:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, oh, these humans are so scary!

1130
01:21:15,874 --> 01:21:16,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep us safe, daddy!

1131
01:21:17,115 --> 01:21:18,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll protect you, son!

1132
01:21:18,495 --> 01:21:23,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and everything.

1133
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:24,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1134
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:27,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.

1135
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:33,869
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4Meg RAM cartridge.

1136
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Got this one too.

1137
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:39,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was fully arcade perfect.

1138
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:40,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fantastic.

1139
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:42,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could...

1140
01:21:44,838 --> 01:21:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Play as, uh, there was all kinds of different, you know, bonus characters in it.

1141
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:54,465
[SPEAKER_04]: You had, uh, Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.

1142
01:21:55,385 --> 01:22:03,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Shadow basically was, you could assume the identity of the defeated character in there.

1143
01:22:04,071 --> 01:22:08,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, so like, if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan.

1144
01:22:08,354 --> 01:22:08,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That type of thing.

1145
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:13,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2

1146
01:22:28,605 --> 01:22:55,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they redid some of the sprites for it too if I'm correct and you also had Bishamon and Shadows of Secret Characters and you had Marionette that were basically mirror matches and then there were the re-releases there was Vampire Chronicle which was the one that came out on Dreamcast it was a Dreamcast direct mail order and I believe I have that one too pretty sure I do

1147
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:58,016
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1148
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:21,909
[SPEAKER_04]: There were manga, different comics that came out.

1149
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:31,095
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was DarkSakura's graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards and concept art.

1150
01:23:31,115 --> 01:23:32,115
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was put out by Udon.

1151
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And Udon is fantastic in their Capcom-related art.

1152
01:23:36,839 --> 01:23:39,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.

1153
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,001
[SPEAKER_04]: They are amazing artists.

1154
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:44,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Just their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.

1155
01:23:45,424 --> 01:23:45,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1156
01:23:48,141 --> 01:24:02,717
[SPEAKER_04]: In Love Hina, actually, the main female characters were wearing the costumes of Beletta, Sienko, and Felicia for Halloween in Chapter 86 of the manga.

1157
01:24:03,317 --> 01:24:07,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia, and Sienko.

1158
01:24:08,242 --> 01:24:13,927
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.

1159
01:24:15,248 --> 01:24:24,915
[SPEAKER_04]: UGO ranked it as number 19, and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Darkstalkers coming out.

1160
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:25,795
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

1161
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:33,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how founded that is, but... Well, here's a comment from SSJ100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.

1162
01:24:33,562 --> 01:24:36,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the MVC3 panel at New York Comic Con.

1163
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:40,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone asked the devs if they would consider making a Darkstalker sequel or remake.

1164
01:24:40,527 --> 01:24:45,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting it.

1165
01:24:46,051 --> 01:24:46,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Get on it!

1166
01:24:48,092 --> 01:24:52,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what, imagine, okay, look how well Street Fighter 4 did.

1167
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how well Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.

1168
01:24:55,837 --> 01:24:59,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Darkstalkers game.

1169
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then, you know, throw in some new ones.

1170
01:25:05,442 --> 01:25:08,404
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got all kinds of, you know, supernatural mythos out there.

1171
01:25:08,444 --> 01:25:14,568
[SPEAKER_11]: There's that Street Fighter cross-teching game, though, still on the way that I think has gone to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.

1172
01:25:14,588 --> 01:25:16,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.

1173
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:17,710
[SPEAKER_11]: True, true.

1174
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the classic game.

1175
01:25:20,781 --> 01:25:23,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic.

1176
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot another.

1177
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:25,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Darkstalkers, what's that?

1178
01:25:25,464 --> 01:25:26,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Another hidden character.

1179
01:25:27,065 --> 01:25:31,907
[SPEAKER_04]: D. Which was the fully, you know, Donovan was half Darkstalker.

1180
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was the version of him that was all evil and vampire-y.

1181
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:43,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following around with him, only she's older.

1182
01:25:43,753 --> 01:25:44,954
[SPEAKER_04]: But it fades out and that's his ending.

1183
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:55,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Darkstalkers from the arcade by Capcom, and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Darkstalkers is definitely not forgotten.

1184
01:25:55,719 --> 01:26:03,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com slash olr

1185
01:26:03,866 --> 01:26:07,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news.

1186
01:26:07,571 --> 01:26:15,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we'll get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of the Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.

1187
01:26:16,043 --> 01:26:19,848
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1188
01:26:26,906 --> 01:26:27,667
[SPEAKER_11]: 3DS Launch, BioWare, Forza, etc.

1189
01:26:44,326 --> 01:26:45,247
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1190
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:28,776
[SPEAKER_04]: and uh it's basically comics I do this with Tiara who's you've heard on the show she's hosted before Mar and Marvel and also with um Dan Shadow and we basically discuss comics but we had a special guest to um for our recording today which you can hear on Tuesday downloaded from uh infamous.net n-f-a-m-o-u-s.net

1191
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:31,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Todd Stashwick

1192
01:28:00,052 --> 01:28:00,753
[SPEAKER_04]: He played Dracula.

1193
01:28:01,473 --> 01:28:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

1194
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:04,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a black and white Dracula.

1195
01:28:04,175 --> 01:28:04,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool.

1196
01:28:04,615 --> 01:28:05,996
[SPEAKER_11]: He could have been a character in Darkstalkers.

1197
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:11,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's such a great guy.

1198
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Really fun to talk to and geeked it up with us this morning.

1199
01:28:14,942 --> 01:28:15,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really cool.

1200
01:28:16,103 --> 01:28:16,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

1201
01:28:17,243 --> 01:28:18,644
[SPEAKER_04]: But read Devil Inside.

1202
01:28:19,004 --> 01:28:20,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, it's good.

1203
01:28:20,766 --> 01:28:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Like anyone could get into this.

1204
01:28:22,106 --> 01:28:22,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

1205
01:28:24,068 --> 01:28:29,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the side project I have, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week, but we did have a pretty exciting guest.

1206
01:28:29,191 --> 01:28:33,534
[SPEAKER_11]: If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, or the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

1207
01:28:33,634 --> 01:28:35,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Now with a website, HordeHouse.com.

1208
01:28:35,575 --> 01:28:37,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, we have an official website for the show.

1209
01:28:37,456 --> 01:28:39,658
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and X for talking about it.

1210
01:28:40,058 --> 01:28:48,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And this week we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle Madison from Video Game Outsiders and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network, joined us.

1211
01:28:48,549 --> 01:28:51,472
[SPEAKER_11]: And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.

1212
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:58,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Xtfer and I. And I was really worried that Xtfer was going to make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time.

1213
01:28:58,521 --> 01:28:59,482
[SPEAKER_11]: She really played along with it.

1214
01:28:59,902 --> 01:29:23,026
[SPEAKER_11]: and Michelle had a book come out and congrats to her she is you may not know this but she does the whole her and her sister are behind the damn you autocorrect that is them and they've had a lot of success of that and just had a book come out so please support Michelle and buy that book I think that's great and other great podcasts on the all games network again hoardhouse.com even if you don't like wow apparently I had my buddy Brad from pod culture said I

1215
01:29:23,226 --> 01:29:24,546
[SPEAKER_11]: GameStop was handing out free trial discs.

1216
01:29:50,003 --> 01:29:50,463
[SPEAKER_09]: For a while.

1217
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:51,864
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of neat.

1218
01:29:52,344 --> 01:29:54,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so actual rapid fire news though.

1219
01:29:56,086 --> 01:29:56,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Some pretty cool stuff.

1220
01:29:57,686 --> 01:30:02,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstorm Apocalypse.

1221
01:30:02,228 --> 01:30:04,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end.

1222
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:09,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be in the UK, where it's gotten a release date, March 31st.

1223
01:30:09,431 --> 01:30:12,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So you won't have to wait very long actually to play the game.

1224
01:30:13,113 --> 01:30:13,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1225
01:30:14,907 --> 01:30:28,905
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know if you really die in the play of the game and you're not in the UK it is region free so import away but let me really just give it a couple more weeks but it is really awesome so you should really pick it up um

1226
01:30:30,905 --> 01:30:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1227
01:30:50,956 --> 01:31:09,170
[SPEAKER_09]: and it'll begin the game's, they're calling it the British Invasion and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship and he invites the players back to his homeland where you can create farms there.

1228
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, do you hear that?

1229
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, do you hear it?

1230
01:31:11,811 --> 01:31:13,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.

1231
01:31:17,026 --> 01:31:19,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Farmville News, Loki, what did you expect me to say?

1232
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:21,529
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother cares.

1233
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell her.

1234
01:31:24,891 --> 01:31:31,296
[SPEAKER_09]: After a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.

1235
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:34,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed.

1236
01:31:36,019 --> 01:31:39,541
[SPEAKER_09]: It is still in beta.

1237
01:31:40,242 --> 01:31:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: You might as well have left it offline because it would have been doing people more of a favor than actually letting them play the game.

1238
01:31:46,986 --> 01:31:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: You're terrible, but accurate.

1239
01:31:51,128 --> 01:31:58,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were taking them offline to conserve power in Japan.

1240
01:31:59,031 --> 01:32:16,558
[SPEAKER_09]: They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.

1241
01:32:19,528 --> 01:32:24,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Square Enix is cooking in the dark for benefit of you all to bring the servers back online.

1242
01:32:24,694 --> 01:32:26,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.

1243
01:32:26,876 --> 01:32:28,598
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know.

1244
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,661
[SPEAKER_09]: But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.

1245
01:32:31,721 --> 01:32:33,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a little warm.

1246
01:32:33,483 --> 01:32:34,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Crack a window.

1247
01:32:36,106 --> 01:32:38,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on to other MMOs.

1248
01:32:38,087 --> 01:32:40,068
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a free one online that's pretty popular.

1249
01:32:40,168 --> 01:32:45,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later this year.

1250
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:50,915
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO.

1251
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:55,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, it looks like an old school SNES type of little game.

1252
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:56,618
[SPEAKER_11]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE 1

1253
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:45,692
[SPEAKER_11]: it won't be free to play it's actually going to cost money and this is the other weird thing it might not really be an MMO either because they came out and said and this is from a Microsoft representative it's not a freemium MMORPG it's with online multiplayer features so I don't know set the expectation bar a little low but I don't know it could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade we'll see

1254
01:33:46,753 --> 01:33:47,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Back to the Future Games

1255
01:34:16,466 --> 01:34:17,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And one more story for you guys.

1256
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:20,188
[SPEAKER_11]: The NPD put out a press release this week.

1257
01:34:20,228 --> 01:34:24,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?

1258
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:24,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine Babies.

1259
01:34:25,171 --> 01:34:30,614
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or maybe it was Call of Duty.

1260
01:34:30,654 --> 01:34:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Those games sell like crazy.

1261
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:32,835
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually...

1262
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:34,937
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're canceling the series?

1263
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:56,756
[SPEAKER_11]: 3 was the peak.

1264
01:34:56,836 --> 01:35:00,218
[SPEAKER_11]: It went really downhill fast from there.

1265
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:04,719
[SPEAKER_11]: 3 came out concurrently with Rock Band, which, by the way, was number 5 on the list.

1266
01:35:05,099 --> 01:35:09,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't 3 the guitar hero that had a million different skews?

1267
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:13,805
[SPEAKER_10]: The different combinations of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.

1268
01:35:14,085 --> 01:35:18,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.

1269
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:19,390
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when it got really bad.

1270
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:20,371
[SPEAKER_09]: The band hero.

1271
01:35:20,551 --> 01:35:23,153
[SPEAKER_09]: The three was just guitar, not guitar.

1272
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:27,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't necessarily... It was just like any of the other Guitar Hero games.

1273
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:30,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, prior to that, any of the other Guitar Hero games.

1274
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:37,857
[SPEAKER_09]: It's when they got to, well actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because it was just like rock band.

1275
01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:40,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It was game, guitar game, band.

1276
01:35:42,389 --> 01:35:45,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of, too.

1277
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed that when I was playing the machine.

1278
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:49,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week.

1279
01:35:50,553 --> 01:35:51,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not worth it.

1280
01:35:51,673 --> 01:35:56,896
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it really wasn't, because I failed the song, which pissed me off, because the guitar was broken, and one of the buttons didn't work right.

1281
01:35:59,036 --> 01:35:59,937
[SPEAKER_09]: What a surprise!

1282
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Line if it's not broken.

1283
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:03,458
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1284
01:36:03,879 --> 01:36:06,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.

1285
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:06,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Sakura.

1286
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:12,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.

1287
01:36:13,301 --> 01:36:16,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.

1288
01:36:17,644 --> 01:36:21,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That will have a 900 point price tag.

1289
01:36:22,247 --> 01:36:24,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite RPGs.

1290
01:36:24,329 --> 01:36:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually got an original of this too.

1291
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.

1292
01:36:35,376 --> 01:36:37,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.

1293
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Precisely.

1294
01:36:39,331 --> 01:36:42,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.

1295
01:36:43,154 --> 01:36:47,196
[SPEAKER_04]: There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.

1296
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.

1297
01:36:53,401 --> 01:36:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you want somebody to love?

1298
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:56,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1299
01:36:57,163 --> 01:37:03,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And Santana's Black Magic Woman, which imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.

1300
01:37:03,588 --> 01:37:04,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine that in pro.

1301
01:37:05,409 --> 01:37:06,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be crazy?

1302
01:37:07,074 --> 01:37:13,618
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Dragon Force, Through the Fire and the Flames and Operation Ground and Pound.

1303
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:16,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.

1304
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:21,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of ironic we just had a story about Guitar Hero because that was one of the most memorable songs from that series.

1305
01:37:21,764 --> 01:37:22,644
[SPEAKER_11]: But Rock Band is awesome.

1306
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:24,065
[SPEAKER_09]: And from 3, I think.

1307
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:25,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't it?

1308
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:26,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I think so.

1309
01:37:27,483 --> 01:37:42,193
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii Points for the standard Rock Packs, 160 points, and the Days of Peace Pack will actually be 550 Wii Points or 440 Microsoft Points.

1310
01:37:43,133 --> 01:37:48,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have Pro Guitar and Pro Bass Mode.

1311
01:37:49,558 --> 01:37:52,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii Points or 80 Microsoft Points.

1312
01:37:53,880 --> 01:38:20,077
[SPEAKER_04]: and last but never least we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition and he's on fire he's burning up and he's got some bad red eye problems so he's gonna need some Visine he's burning for you and the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website so

1313
01:38:21,398 --> 01:38:30,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're officially there.

1314
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And the profile is there.

1315
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:33,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will post that into the chat room.

1316
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So what exactly does Evil Ryu do?

1317
01:38:35,545 --> 01:38:37,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, technically he... Evil things.

1318
01:38:38,126 --> 01:38:39,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Technically... He kicks puppies.

1319
01:38:40,487 --> 01:38:42,528
[SPEAKER_04]: He's Satsui no Hado Ryu.

1320
01:38:43,589 --> 01:38:47,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I guess Akuma is always given to your fighting spirit.

1321
01:38:47,651 --> 01:38:48,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1322
01:38:48,172 --> 01:38:48,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Join the dark side.

1323
01:38:49,512 --> 01:38:54,315
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Gouki.

1324
01:38:55,076 --> 01:39:02,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back and it's all torn and he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.

1325
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Whose oni is that?

1326
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:05,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Evil, evil Gouki?

1327
01:39:05,722 --> 01:39:06,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be...

1328
01:39:07,683 --> 01:39:09,163
[SPEAKER_09]: It's evil-er!

1329
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:13,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it to your evil evil.

1330
01:39:13,545 --> 01:39:14,885
[SPEAKER_04]: There's voice samples on there too.

1331
01:39:17,106 --> 01:39:18,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.

1332
01:39:19,546 --> 01:39:20,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post this in the chat room.

1333
01:39:21,867 --> 01:39:23,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun little soundboard to play with there.

1334
01:39:23,587 --> 01:39:24,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the Twitter!

1335
01:39:25,108 --> 01:39:28,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter.com slash OLR and every week we like to read your tweets.

1336
01:39:29,944 --> 01:39:32,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1337
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:33,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's look at some tweets.

1338
01:39:33,527 --> 01:39:44,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Some interesting tweets from 13xForever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.

1339
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:50,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment.

1340
01:39:50,981 --> 01:39:53,783
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a point-and-click adventure computer game.

1341
01:39:53,803 --> 01:39:55,624
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.

1342
01:39:56,825 --> 01:39:58,826
[SPEAKER_11]: It was supposed to be, I think, after Warcraft 2.

1343
01:39:58,907 --> 01:40:00,868
[SPEAKER_11]: It was going to be fourth quarter 97.

1344
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:05,831
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would have been a little bit before StarCraft, kind of in that era.

1345
01:40:05,871 --> 01:40:06,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was like an old game.

1346
01:40:07,432 --> 01:40:10,513
[SPEAKER_11]: But randomly, these YouTubes went up that we got linked to.

1347
01:40:10,613 --> 01:40:12,615
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll just kind of take a quick peek at how this played out.

1348
01:40:12,975 --> 01:40:16,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and those types of games.

1349
01:40:17,057 --> 01:40:18,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the art in this looks pretty cool.

1350
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:25,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks more Scum Engine, but yeah, it's within the Scum Engine, LucasArts, King's Quest vein, that style of gameplay.

1351
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:29,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me.

1352
01:40:29,324 --> 01:40:34,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of that really, like, very jerky motion cell animation stuff.

1353
01:40:35,628 --> 01:40:40,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking cancelled, you know what I mean?

1354
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:42,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there's a trailer here for this game, actually.

1355
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:43,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me click on this.

1356
01:40:44,933 --> 01:40:46,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And take a look at this real quick.

1357
01:40:47,954 --> 01:40:49,915
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an old school trailer from, like, 97.

1358
01:40:49,955 --> 01:40:52,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just take a peek at this.

1359
01:40:52,777 --> 01:40:54,578
[SPEAKER_11]: What could have been, but is not.

1360
01:40:56,329 --> 01:40:57,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, pass the logo.

1361
01:40:57,610 --> 01:40:58,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, people.

1362
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:09,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Three great wars between the Human Alliance and the Orcish invaders have laid waste to the once proud realms of Azeroth.

1363
01:41:09,619 --> 01:41:13,582
[SPEAKER_06]: 22 years have passed since Blackmoor found the young Orcling.

1364
01:41:14,358 --> 01:41:24,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Secretly raising the Orkling within the confines of his prison fortress, Durnold, Blackmoor planned to mold the Orkling into the perfect warrior.

1365
01:41:25,002 --> 01:41:26,963
[SPEAKER_06]: A warrior conditioned to human thinking.

1366
01:41:27,023 --> 01:41:31,925
[SPEAKER_11]: See, this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from what it's supposed to be.

1367
01:41:32,325 --> 01:41:44,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off into the novels so if you're a lore nerd like I am read the books and you'll get all the story from that game

1368
01:42:01,971 --> 01:42:27,552
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya sends us a link greetings true believers I got your first WonderCon scoop right here about a new Spider-Man game in the works DarkTetsuya very excited because he's going to WonderCon and promises to bring back lots of stories for OLR but I guess there is a new Spider-Man game that's supposed to be shown at WonderCon yeah that's as they're saying Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision Spider-Man panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spider-Man game is check that out

1369
01:42:28,493 --> 01:42:31,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Henderson Mann tweets us at Twitter.com slash OLR.

1370
01:42:31,676 --> 01:42:34,319
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you think the iPhone has hurt sales of 3DS?

1371
01:42:34,579 --> 01:42:38,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.

1372
01:42:38,904 --> 01:42:41,566
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy told me I was the only one who even asked.

1373
01:42:41,747 --> 01:42:42,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Should Nintendo be worried?

1374
01:42:44,129 --> 01:42:48,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say no, mostly because it's still early.

1375
01:42:48,473 --> 01:42:51,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And there hasn't been a lot of, like, there haven't been commercials.

1376
01:42:52,037 --> 01:42:55,021
[SPEAKER_11]: They went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.

1377
01:42:55,201 --> 01:42:57,725
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing, though.

1378
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:08,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, unless you're really gung-ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind of like, ooh, I gotta have that.

1379
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:12,443
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good.

1380
01:43:12,563 --> 01:43:19,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of blogs covering all that stuff and saying, hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs, but don't.

1381
01:43:19,689 --> 01:43:23,933
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top.

1382
01:43:25,054 --> 01:43:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.

1383
01:43:32,649 --> 01:43:36,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on Twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305.

1384
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:39,994
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a tweet about Mortal Kombat download characters.

1385
01:43:40,034 --> 01:43:41,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess those were announced just recently.

1386
01:43:41,895 --> 01:43:42,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually very excited.

1387
01:43:42,796 --> 01:43:49,040
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my favorite characters from the series who came out later in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content.

1388
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:54,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Kenshi, that was the blindfolded, he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters.

1389
01:43:54,984 --> 01:43:56,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And a character called Scarlet.

1390
01:43:56,905 --> 01:44:00,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist.

1391
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:02,169
[SPEAKER_11]: She's kind of in that Ermac.

1392
01:44:02,849 --> 01:44:03,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Noob Saboit and Rain

1393
01:44:26,195 --> 01:44:27,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs. Sanrio.

1394
01:44:51,467 --> 01:44:52,868
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the license that I'll play.

1395
01:44:53,028 --> 01:44:53,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Kidiality.

1396
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:57,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad Bats and Roaches.

1397
01:44:57,069 --> 01:44:57,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think Cutality.

1398
01:44:58,369 --> 01:44:58,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

1399
01:44:58,710 --> 01:44:59,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Cutality.

1400
01:44:59,450 --> 01:44:59,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Friendship?

1401
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:00,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Friendship?

1402
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:04,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1403
01:45:04,311 --> 01:45:05,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to make you put down the 3DS, Loki, but...

1404
01:45:06,897 --> 01:45:07,157
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1405
01:45:08,077 --> 01:45:10,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of neat.

1406
01:45:11,358 --> 01:45:18,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of both Resident Evil 4 and Code Veronica.

1407
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:27,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're coming over here as some download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.

1408
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:34,343
[SPEAKER_09]: No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the souped-up visuals, but...

1409
01:45:35,843 --> 01:46:02,534
[SPEAKER_09]: people love their Resident Evil 4 and I know even the Wii version with just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular so I could see this doing pretty well and you know it's kind of the whole HD remake thing has really been popular lately so not surprised to see it happen alright wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?

1410
01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:07,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being talked about as well.

1411
01:46:07,768 --> 01:46:10,989
[SPEAKER_09]: They revealed it in the official Xbox magazine.

1412
01:46:11,709 --> 01:46:17,411
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't really said what's going to take place.

1413
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,932
[SPEAKER_09]: They are saying that you can change the history of Resident Evil.

1414
01:46:24,434 --> 01:46:27,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.

1415
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's interesting.

1416
01:46:33,469 --> 01:46:38,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.

1417
01:46:40,554 --> 01:46:40,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1418
01:46:41,115 --> 01:46:41,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1419
01:46:41,775 --> 01:46:43,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds interesting.

1420
01:46:45,918 --> 01:46:47,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really a series I follow too well.

1421
01:46:49,521 --> 01:46:49,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1422
01:46:50,922 --> 01:46:53,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.

1423
01:46:53,864 --> 01:46:56,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.

1424
01:46:57,546 --> 01:46:57,827
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1425
01:46:59,099 --> 01:46:59,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox Live Arcade

1426
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:24,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, well, there was supposed to be one on the 3DS.

1427
01:47:24,572 --> 01:47:27,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bomberman, which would have been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff.

1428
01:47:27,735 --> 01:47:30,058
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, apparently it is not going to happen.

1429
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:35,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no, no, no, that's not true.

1430
01:47:35,505 --> 01:47:37,687
[SPEAKER_11]: But those are the rumors going around right now.

1431
01:47:38,508 --> 01:47:41,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, Konami went out and told Wired that...

1432
01:47:41,912 --> 01:47:44,414
[SPEAKER_11]: The announcement didn't come from us, so it's not true.

1433
01:47:44,514 --> 01:47:47,977
[SPEAKER_11]: We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.

1434
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:52,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all this stuff.

1435
01:47:52,982 --> 01:47:56,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little bit of controversy going on.

1436
01:47:57,426 --> 01:48:00,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved.

1437
01:48:01,149 --> 01:48:02,030
[SPEAKER_11]: New development house.

1438
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:03,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Either way...

1439
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:04,692
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not seeing them anytime soon.

1440
01:48:05,373 --> 01:48:09,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman wouldn't happen.

1441
01:48:10,017 --> 01:48:13,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's gotta happen at some point.

1442
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably just not gonna happen as soon as you'd like.

1443
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:16,623
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see, though.

1444
01:48:17,884 --> 01:48:27,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over, Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be

1445
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:41,238
[SPEAKER_04]: more than one game announced at E3 so the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5 maybe another Zone of the Enders could be anything wouldn't it be cool if there was another Snatcher?

1446
01:48:42,519 --> 01:48:51,004
[SPEAKER_04]: no hey, you never know you never know so anything could happen what would you like to see?

1447
01:48:51,488 --> 01:48:53,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.

1448
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:55,051
[SPEAKER_11]: What would I like to see?

1449
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:56,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.

1450
01:48:56,892 --> 01:48:59,374
[SPEAKER_11]: From Kojima, anyways, probably that.

1451
01:49:00,796 --> 01:49:01,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.

1452
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:05,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be down with maybe like a metal... I don't know.

1453
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see something new come out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid or Acid.

1454
01:49:11,885 --> 01:49:13,626
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.

1455
01:49:13,666 --> 01:49:16,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.

1456
01:49:17,589 --> 01:49:19,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.

1457
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1458
01:49:45,061 --> 01:49:45,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you imagine that?

1459
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:53,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought he was supposedly ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening there with that.

1460
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember.

1461
01:49:54,932 --> 01:49:55,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1462
01:49:55,553 --> 01:49:56,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on with some more news.

1463
01:49:56,594 --> 01:49:56,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1464
01:49:59,831 --> 01:50:00,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes.

1465
01:50:01,672 --> 01:50:03,333
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of neat.

1466
01:50:04,914 --> 01:50:06,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff, really.

1467
01:50:08,677 --> 01:50:14,981
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or...

1468
01:50:17,133 --> 01:50:19,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Really offensive stuff.

1469
01:50:20,156 --> 01:50:26,061
[SPEAKER_09]: ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half-Life 2 and whatnot.

1470
01:50:26,521 --> 01:50:30,085
[SPEAKER_09]: They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.

1471
01:50:30,465 --> 01:50:33,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, yeah, School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.

1472
01:50:34,608 --> 01:50:37,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Now who would find that offensive?

1473
01:50:37,451 --> 01:50:37,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1474
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:38,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand.

1475
01:50:38,451 --> 01:50:39,692
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't make any sense to me.

1476
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:51,615
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, I guess, the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.

1477
01:50:53,116 --> 01:50:53,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1478
01:50:54,463 --> 01:50:57,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't imagine why they would remove something just so harmless.

1479
01:50:58,106 --> 01:50:58,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

1480
01:50:59,226 --> 01:50:59,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1481
01:50:59,507 --> 01:51:00,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would someone even make that?

1482
01:51:01,008 --> 01:51:04,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Just knowing what... I mean, well, I know why someone would make that.

1483
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:08,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone made that to basically troll because they could, right?

1484
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:10,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's why you make this.

1485
01:51:10,654 --> 01:51:12,455
[SPEAKER_11]: To say like, look what I made.

1486
01:51:12,495 --> 01:51:16,077
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really controversial and I shouldn't be making a game like this, but I did.

1487
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:34,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, apparently, I guess, they're saying, you know, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer run site, the confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.

1488
01:51:35,515 --> 01:51:40,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well.

1489
01:51:41,379 --> 01:51:41,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says...

1490
01:51:43,658 --> 01:51:55,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they have the boring effect that someone took from that Bulletstorm Duty Calls viral game thing that they put in there.

1491
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:58,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.

1492
01:51:59,589 --> 01:52:03,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.

1493
01:52:03,912 --> 01:52:04,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Only a matter of time.

1494
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they were playing school shooter.

1495
01:52:09,475 --> 01:52:10,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

1496
01:52:10,596 --> 01:52:16,523
[SPEAKER_11]: How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game School Shooter by Valve?

1497
01:52:17,344 --> 01:52:23,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban, but they also get Half-Life 2 ban, and that's when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off.

1498
01:52:24,092 --> 01:52:25,454
[SPEAKER_10]: And the game turns you gay.

1499
01:52:25,714 --> 01:52:26,975
[SPEAKER_10]: It turns you gay.

1500
01:52:27,176 --> 01:52:28,878
[SPEAKER_09]: So very gay.

1501
01:52:32,025 --> 01:52:48,966
[SPEAKER_11]: ah all right enough about that silly mods although I have to admit I probably would play it once just just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment all right it's probably dumb I mean well probably a terrible terrible game

1502
01:52:49,326 --> 01:52:50,187
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1503
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:27,706
[SPEAKER_11]: and you now have three people battling for it there's Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie The King of Kong and then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who as we reported last week is going to have his own movie now coming out all this stuff well the three of them were in the same building at this Kong-Off so that's pretty cool so who ended up winning?

1504
01:53:28,226 --> 01:53:35,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong-Off and second place Steve Wiebe seventh place Billy Mitchell

1505
01:53:37,155 --> 01:53:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I would have loved to see the look on his face.

1506
01:53:41,416 --> 01:53:44,957
[SPEAKER_11]: But you are talking about 10 like godly Donkey Kong players.

1507
01:53:45,037 --> 01:53:49,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's so funny how this game is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.

1508
01:53:49,898 --> 01:53:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if the guy I think he like beat the top score of Missile Command and he plays with his feet.

1509
01:53:56,279 --> 01:53:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1510
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:58,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that Captain Awesome?

1511
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his feet.

1512
01:54:03,442 --> 01:54:03,942
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1513
01:54:05,443 --> 01:54:07,044
[SPEAKER_11]: SX in our chatroom says, Kong off?

1514
01:54:07,104 --> 01:54:09,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.

1515
01:54:10,486 --> 01:54:12,027
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's nothing like that.

1516
01:54:12,327 --> 01:54:19,152
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing their Donkey Kong.

1517
01:54:19,172 --> 01:54:20,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.

1518
01:54:22,334 --> 01:54:23,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it, Loki.

1519
01:54:23,914 --> 01:54:24,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop it.

1520
01:54:25,561 --> 01:54:29,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.

1521
01:54:29,085 --> 01:54:32,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.

1522
01:54:32,749 --> 01:54:35,812
[SPEAKER_11]: They've made these, like, special flyers that say the Kong off.

1523
01:54:35,872 --> 01:54:39,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these dudes, like, love Donkey Kong.

1524
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:43,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.

1525
01:54:43,381 --> 01:54:45,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to give kudos for that.

1526
01:54:46,083 --> 01:54:46,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

1527
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:49,732
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're gonna go in, go all in, right?

1528
01:54:50,172 --> 01:54:53,515
[SPEAKER_11]: On this classic stuff, so there's big love for Kong.

1529
01:54:54,235 --> 01:55:00,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, there's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called Listless!

1530
01:55:04,124 --> 01:55:04,424
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1531
01:55:19,861 --> 01:55:22,303
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1532
01:55:41,235 --> 01:55:51,661
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do with the 3DS launch.

1533
01:55:52,062 --> 01:55:52,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is.

1534
01:55:53,182 --> 01:55:54,183
[SPEAKER_11]: The list list tonight.

1535
01:55:54,783 --> 01:55:59,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant buy.

1536
01:56:00,407 --> 01:56:10,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because, you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is it's kind of a lackluster launch title.

1537
01:56:11,153 --> 01:56:11,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Launch titles.

1538
01:56:12,334 --> 01:56:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: So folks are saying, maybe there's some games you should wait for.

1539
01:56:15,195 --> 01:56:23,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch titles would have made the system an instant buy.

1540
01:56:23,738 --> 01:56:24,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go to list list.

1541
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:29,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for the list because...

1542
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:36,264
[SPEAKER_11]: If one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually turn to chat to help us round out the list.

1543
01:56:36,664 --> 01:56:37,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So who wants to start tonight?

1544
01:56:37,645 --> 01:56:38,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we'll go with DarkSakura.

1545
01:56:39,626 --> 01:56:41,267
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you want to start us off tonight.

1546
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:43,729
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the number three item on your list?

1547
01:56:43,909 --> 01:56:44,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not a game.

1548
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:45,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an item.

1549
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:46,211
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1550
01:56:46,391 --> 01:56:47,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a launch title.

1551
01:56:47,732 --> 01:56:48,712
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't mean launch game.

1552
01:56:49,153 --> 01:56:50,273
[SPEAKER_04]: A lenticular photo printer.

1553
01:56:54,496 --> 01:56:56,978
[SPEAKER_11]: And what would the lenticular photo printer do?

1554
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:00,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It would print up your images in 3D.

1555
01:57:00,921 --> 01:57:02,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.

1556
01:57:03,482 --> 01:57:06,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D.

1557
01:57:07,003 --> 01:57:07,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1558
01:57:07,403 --> 01:57:07,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1559
01:57:07,943 --> 01:57:08,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I can roll with that.

1560
01:57:08,543 --> 01:57:11,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would print one layer, print a second layer.

1561
01:57:11,784 --> 01:57:15,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be huge probably, but I still think it would be neat to have something like that.

1562
01:57:16,086 --> 01:57:19,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my wang that I would take.

1563
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,484
[SPEAKER_11]: SalaciousPop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.

1564
01:57:26,944 --> 01:57:29,307
[SPEAKER_11]: The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.

1565
01:57:29,908 --> 01:57:32,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.

1566
01:57:33,456 --> 01:57:33,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd buy that.

1567
01:57:37,538 --> 01:57:41,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And how exactly would Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster work?

1568
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Double physics in 3D.

1569
01:57:44,081 --> 01:57:44,901
[SPEAKER_10]: And you shoot aliens.

1570
01:57:46,562 --> 01:57:52,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And you get grease from your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.

1571
01:57:53,025 --> 01:57:56,146
[SPEAKER_10]: You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.

1572
01:57:56,266 --> 01:57:57,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Brings a whole new meaning to Screw Attack.

1573
01:57:59,288 --> 01:57:59,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1574
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,689
[SPEAKER_11]: F-Zero 3DS

1575
01:58:15,507 --> 01:58:16,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what's your number three answer?

1576
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is more of a serious route.

1577
01:58:19,169 --> 01:58:25,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear that this is in development, because I thought I saw some sort of screenshots or something like this.

1578
01:58:25,653 --> 01:58:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.

1579
01:58:31,477 --> 01:58:32,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Excite Truck is awesome.

1580
01:58:32,738 --> 01:58:34,979
[SPEAKER_09]: None of this Excite Bots bullshit, though.

1581
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:35,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Excite Truck.

1582
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:37,160
[SPEAKER_09]: and Sight Truck.

1583
01:58:37,381 --> 01:58:39,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, you don't even have to do anything different.

1584
01:58:39,282 --> 01:58:43,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks, everything.

1585
01:58:43,304 --> 01:58:47,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I would like it if you did something, but if you don't have to, then fuck it.

1586
01:58:48,206 --> 01:58:56,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and Excite Truck 3DS.

1587
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:57,771
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what's your number two?

1588
01:58:58,666 --> 01:58:59,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Planet Harrier.

1589
01:59:01,307 --> 01:59:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this game.

1590
01:59:02,587 --> 01:59:04,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I have only gotten to play it a few times.

1591
01:59:04,167 --> 01:59:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been no home version released.

1592
01:59:07,048 --> 01:59:10,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think it would be about time for something like that to come on 3DS?

1593
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:16,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.

1594
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:21,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I can see a lot of those old school Sega shooters and I think of 3D World Runner from the NES.

1595
01:59:22,032 --> 01:59:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: but those the sort of first person not kind of first person but those those perspective games would be perfect for that type of screen okay so I'm with you my vote is Planet Harriers all right Salacious Pop your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today Zelda 8-bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition

1596
01:59:43,098 --> 01:59:45,180
[SPEAKER_11]: What exactly is Zelda 8-bit 3DS?

1597
01:59:45,701 --> 01:59:48,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo Edition?

1598
01:59:48,603 --> 01:59:54,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames to make the 3D.

1599
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:58,873
[SPEAKER_10]: They make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have to lay down.

1600
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:04,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image or something.

1601
02:00:04,659 --> 02:00:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They have that already.

1602
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:07,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Ridge Racer.

1603
02:00:10,644 --> 02:00:15,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.

1604
02:00:15,528 --> 02:00:18,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say Breasts 3D.

1605
02:00:20,592 --> 02:00:23,934
[SPEAKER_11]: All it would be would be pictures of breasts in 3D.

1606
02:00:26,059 --> 02:00:53,586
[SPEAKER_11]: and I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that because who doesn't love boobs gay or straight or whatever you are does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it it has the little bead that it can tell so you can shake it it would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again you could motorboat the boobs if you want but it's not just restricted to Samus Aran I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster but I want to see just boobs

1607
02:00:54,307 --> 02:00:57,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Little Boobs, Big Boobs, Lopsided Boobs

1608
02:00:58,598 --> 02:01:00,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Boobs, fake boobs, real boobs.

1609
02:01:01,559 --> 02:01:05,080
[SPEAKER_10]: You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up to a person.

1610
02:01:09,841 --> 02:01:11,161
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be a perfect mode.

1611
02:01:11,381 --> 02:01:19,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It would actually use the whole camera on the back side for those virtual reality type simulations.

1612
02:01:19,864 --> 02:01:23,845
[SPEAKER_11]: If I point the camera at Jamie, just suddenly random boobs will show up.

1613
02:01:25,512 --> 02:01:26,113
[SPEAKER_10]: She's frowning.

1614
02:01:26,133 --> 02:01:26,815
[SPEAKER_10]: She's making frowny faces.

1615
02:01:26,855 --> 02:01:29,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing.

1616
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:29,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1617
02:01:31,504 --> 02:01:32,226
[SPEAKER_04]: My boobs are epic.

1618
02:01:33,635 --> 02:01:35,276
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, your number two pick.

1619
02:01:35,336 --> 02:01:37,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Launch title for the 3DS that would have made you buy one today.

1620
02:01:39,337 --> 02:01:40,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Just what you said made me forget.

1621
02:01:41,517 --> 02:01:43,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It is... Oh, yes, of course.

1622
02:01:43,918 --> 02:01:47,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.

1623
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:50,220
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be so amazing.

1624
02:01:51,361 --> 02:01:52,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I can take Earth Defense Force with me.

1625
02:01:52,661 --> 02:01:54,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the PSP version is not yet announced, come over here.

1626
02:01:55,982 --> 02:01:57,883
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, The New Guardian Legend

1627
02:02:25,259 --> 02:02:26,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh, it's my list.

1628
02:02:27,544 --> 02:02:28,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Guardia legend.

1629
02:02:29,127 --> 02:02:29,507
[SPEAKER_11]: In 3D.

1630
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:30,609
[SPEAKER_04]: In 3D.

1631
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:33,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember you had Guardic and you had Guardia.

1632
02:02:33,976 --> 02:02:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess the Japanese name of this would be Shingardia.

1633
02:02:38,726 --> 02:02:40,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care what the fuck they call it, just put it out already.

1634
02:02:40,969 --> 02:02:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1635
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:44,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, Nintendo, or Compile.

1636
02:02:44,192 --> 02:02:44,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Put out!

1637
02:02:44,552 --> 02:02:47,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize Compile needs to reform somehow, but just do it.

1638
02:02:47,916 --> 02:02:49,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Reform and put out.

1639
02:02:49,257 --> 02:02:49,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1640
02:02:49,878 --> 02:02:50,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1641
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:51,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Please put out.

1642
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:52,461
[SPEAKER_11]: XOXO.

1643
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:54,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop number one, you need it.

1644
02:02:54,984 --> 02:02:56,465
[SPEAKER_11]: You need it now on the 3DS.

1645
02:02:56,745 --> 02:02:59,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer.

1646
02:03:04,540 --> 02:03:08,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And how exactly would Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer work?

1647
02:03:08,322 --> 02:03:11,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

1648
02:03:13,384 --> 02:03:14,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has a built-in calendar.

1649
02:03:14,884 --> 02:03:15,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Days of the week.

1650
02:03:20,066 --> 02:03:20,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I break Rob?

1651
02:03:20,887 --> 02:03:21,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he upset?

1652
02:03:21,892 --> 02:03:23,333
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just regretting some things.

1653
02:03:23,433 --> 02:03:23,713
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1654
02:03:24,613 --> 02:03:25,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

1655
02:03:25,434 --> 02:03:26,514
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

1656
02:03:27,075 --> 02:03:28,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one answer from me.

1657
02:03:29,476 --> 02:03:31,737
[SPEAKER_11]: The 3DS game we most need to see.

1658
02:03:32,217 --> 02:03:33,998
[SPEAKER_11]: What do they call that, the virtual reality?

1659
02:03:34,018 --> 02:03:34,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm calling it wrong.

1660
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:36,400
[SPEAKER_11]: What's it really supposed to be called?

1661
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:39,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the face blaster?

1662
02:03:39,141 --> 02:03:39,541
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

1663
02:03:40,362 --> 02:03:41,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Augmentative reality.

1664
02:03:41,162 --> 02:03:42,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, augmentative reality.

1665
02:03:42,443 --> 02:03:46,725
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the augmentative reality game for you, and I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.

1666
02:03:47,425 --> 02:03:48,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Augmentative reality...

1667
02:03:48,946 --> 02:04:16,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS that's right you can go to Golfland and just you know suddenly the little kids there celebrating their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts you know it's Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS alright Loki number one game you most need to see on the 3DS

1668
02:04:18,796 --> 02:04:20,706
[SPEAKER_09]: An actual innovative game from Nintendo.

1669
02:04:25,851 --> 02:04:54,113
[SPEAKER_09]: you know something that perhaps is not you know funny I don't think this is actually a launch title but just a description an actual innovative game from Nintendo you know like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that they put out like you know like for example Animal Crossing it's been the same for a while now and you know even some of the other like you know they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games they're just oh now they're in 3D I mean come on

1670
02:04:55,795 --> 02:05:01,339
[SPEAKER_10]: This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?

1671
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:01,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Wii Music.

1672
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,260
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Wii Fit.

1673
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:02,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say Wii Fit.

1674
02:05:02,921 --> 02:05:03,521
[SPEAKER_10]: What about WooHoo Island?

1675
02:05:17,074 --> 02:05:17,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Island, Dead Island

1676
02:05:40,917 --> 02:05:44,641
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that void.

1677
02:05:44,801 --> 02:05:46,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

1678
02:05:46,442 --> 02:05:47,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, here we go.

1679
02:05:47,363 --> 02:05:49,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the list as it stands right now.

1680
02:05:49,705 --> 02:05:57,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,

1682
02:06:14,614 --> 02:06:18,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.

1683
02:06:18,355 --> 02:06:23,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start with DarkSakura, but for now, let me read some of the suggestions you guys had in the chatroom.

1684
02:06:23,856 --> 02:06:26,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft suggested Furry vs. Cosplayers 3DS.

1685
02:06:27,317 --> 02:06:30,378

02:06:30,838 --> 02:06:32,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Tigerclaw said DDR 3DS.

1687
02:06:32,178 --> 02:06:32,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, hold on.

1688
02:06:33,018 --> 02:06:33,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop, stop.

1689
02:06:33,779 --> 02:06:33,939
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1690
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:35,179
[SPEAKER_09]: IHOP Restaurant Fighter?

1691
02:06:35,259 --> 02:06:37,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, would that be the actual restaurants fighting?

1692
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that could be very cool.

1693
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:40,800
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually, in my mind, it's Denny's.

1694
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:43,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, go on YouTube and Google, like, Denny's Fight Oakland.

1695
02:06:44,201 --> 02:06:44,741
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

1696
02:06:46,443 --> 02:06:48,264
[SPEAKER_11]: The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes.

1697
02:06:48,644 --> 02:06:49,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.

[SPEAKER_11]: Raydeer in chat says, Rob's Ass 3DS.

1700
02:06:57,049 --> 02:06:58,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey!

1701
02:06:58,751 --> 02:06:59,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1702
02:07:00,272 --> 02:07:02,293
[SPEAKER_11]: AkumaJP says, 3D Cat Ball.

1703
02:07:02,553 --> 02:07:05,155
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer.

1704
02:07:06,115 --> 02:07:16,718
[SPEAKER_11]: SG-100 Matt says Match Game 3DS DJ Blaziken says Space Channel 5 3D SG-100 Matt says Betty White Simulator 3DS What, you'd just be badass the whole time?

1705
02:07:16,838 --> 02:07:17,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what that is?

1706
02:07:18,999 --> 02:07:27,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR technology I am surprised That sounds like an announcement to E3 right there

1707
02:07:27,461 --> 02:07:29,502
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkTetsuya said Gals Panic 3D.

1708
02:07:29,782 --> 02:07:32,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, those were the runners-up, but let's get back to the list.

1709
02:07:32,623 --> 02:07:34,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, it's just the way the game works.

1710
02:07:34,644 --> 02:07:38,646
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all amazing answers, but unfortunately, the way the game works, things have to go.

1711
02:07:39,106 --> 02:07:40,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's part of the process.

1712
02:07:41,207 --> 02:07:43,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

1713
02:07:43,127 --> 02:07:45,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Which of these is not worthy of the list?

1714
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:47,069
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you need an apostrophe and blacks.

1715
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:56,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrate and Vertigo Edition because I have a Virtual Boy.

1716
02:07:57,253 --> 02:08:00,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game's pretty much already out as Ridge Racer.

1717
02:08:00,914 --> 02:08:01,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1718
02:08:01,354 --> 02:08:01,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Touche.

1719
02:08:02,014 --> 02:08:03,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Alan, it has been stricken from the list.

1720
02:08:04,115 --> 02:08:06,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop, your chance for revenge, or you could go for something else.

1721
02:08:06,776 --> 02:08:08,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Which of these items is not worthy of the list?

1722
02:08:11,937 --> 02:08:13,218
[SPEAKER_10]: The Golf Land Birthday Party.

1723
02:08:13,698 --> 02:08:15,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're killing me!

1724
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:16,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you taking that off the list?

1725
02:08:19,241 --> 02:08:26,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's serious answers and there's my smart-ass answers and I can't take down one of mine, so... Alright, there you go.

1726
02:08:27,227 --> 02:08:29,889
[SPEAKER_11]: It is removed from the list, much to the sadness of the chatroom.

1727
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:32,131
[SPEAKER_11]: My turn to strike one from the list.

1728
02:08:32,411 --> 02:08:38,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to do this, but Loki, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it.

1729
02:08:39,997 --> 02:08:43,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1730
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:44,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Lenticular Photo Printer.

1731
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:46,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1732
02:09:02,503 --> 02:09:03,224
[SPEAKER_11]: So here you go.

1733
02:09:03,344 --> 02:09:05,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is what you guys in the chat can vote on.

1734
02:09:05,225 --> 02:09:06,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to read this list one more time.

1735
02:09:06,986 --> 02:09:11,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers.

1736
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,471
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to message me those.

1737
02:09:13,651 --> 02:09:20,576
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to mark them as number one or number two, or I will assume that the one you named first is your number one and the one you named second is your number two.

1738
02:09:20,636 --> 02:09:23,598
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, you're getting booze in the chat room for taking off the offline party.

1739
02:09:23,638 --> 02:09:25,199
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your handle in chat this week?

1740
02:09:25,279 --> 02:09:25,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it?

1741
02:09:25,580 --> 02:09:26,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Sky.

1742
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:26,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, got it back.

1743
02:09:27,181 --> 02:09:27,361
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1744
02:09:27,481 --> 02:09:28,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, yes, I got it back.

1745
02:09:28,582 --> 02:09:30,824
[SPEAKER_11]: So send a private message to Sky with your number one and number two votes.

1746
02:09:30,884 --> 02:09:33,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is the list that you can vote on right now.

1747
02:09:33,486 --> 02:09:50,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier, Breasts 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's Pre-Teen Convertible Off-Road Racer.

1748
02:09:50,742 --> 02:09:52,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe that made it through.

1749
02:09:52,663 --> 02:09:52,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1750
02:09:53,764 --> 02:09:54,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play that.

1751
02:09:55,664 --> 02:09:56,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play as the girl in the braces.

1752
02:09:57,445 --> 02:10:01,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.

1753
02:10:02,286 --> 02:10:04,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's going to do it.

1754
02:10:04,426 --> 02:10:07,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.

1755
02:10:08,047 --> 02:10:08,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Place your votes.

1756
02:10:09,087 --> 02:10:12,608
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.

1757
02:10:13,228 --> 02:10:17,309
[SPEAKER_11]: For now though, we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.

1758
02:10:17,369 --> 02:10:18,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1759
02:10:19,429 --> 02:10:27,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It was looking really thin this morning, so I put a call out on Twitter.

1760
02:10:27,818 --> 02:10:28,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it work?

1761
02:10:28,258 --> 02:10:28,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Did we get some emails?

1762
02:10:28,979 --> 02:10:29,620
[SPEAKER_11]: We have two.

1763
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:31,201
[SPEAKER_11]: That's better than zero.

1764
02:10:31,381 --> 02:10:31,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1765
02:10:32,952 --> 02:10:34,633
[SPEAKER_04]: But not better than F-Zero.

1766
02:10:36,094 --> 02:10:37,836
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero is awesome.

1767
02:10:38,876 --> 02:10:40,057
[SPEAKER_04]: This first one comes from Robaba.

1768
02:10:40,978 --> 02:10:47,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on American TV.

1769
02:10:47,603 --> 02:10:53,547
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever seen them, it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager talking about the things they use their PCs for.

1770
02:10:54,068 --> 02:10:56,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.

1771
02:10:56,329 --> 02:11:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.

1772
02:11:02,834 --> 02:11:03,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your favorite.

1773
02:11:03,354 --> 02:11:03,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1774
02:11:30,536 --> 02:11:35,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.

1775
02:11:35,841 --> 02:11:37,903
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like what autocorrect would do.

1776
02:11:38,203 --> 02:11:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1777
02:11:39,364 --> 02:11:44,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday was great, especially the second round of Laser Tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.

1778
02:11:44,929 --> 02:11:46,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the last 10 to 30 seconds.

1779
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:55,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on the high rise and these three little kids just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off one by one in 1.5 seconds, enacting a triple kill.

1780
02:11:55,899 --> 02:11:56,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1781
02:11:57,290 --> 02:12:03,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp, most of them being from preschool to fourth grade fun times.

1782
02:12:03,933 --> 02:12:04,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Punctuate!

1783
02:12:05,693 --> 02:12:09,675
[SPEAKER_04]: The sad parts of my experience was when I went down, there was no Beatmania 2DX.

1784
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:13,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what 2DX is, person.

1785
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:18,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And Parapara's second mix game would be, and it was nowhere to be found.

1786
02:12:19,321 --> 02:12:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So that they sold it in their place was a faded screen Daytona USA and a four-player Mario Kart.

1787
02:12:25,043 --> 02:12:30,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouted in my head, WTF, first Keyboard Mania, then Pop Music, now Parapara, then Guitar Freaks, now Beatmania, fuck you!

1788
02:12:31,916 --> 02:12:34,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my translation of the all caps.

1789
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:53,957
[SPEAKER_04]: This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play except Drum Mania V3, DDR Max 2, 6th Mix and Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix and In The Group 2.

1790
02:12:54,938 --> 02:13:15,546
[SPEAKER_04]: if only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones like DJ Max Technica and Jubit and dare I say it, Gulp Pump It Up Pro maybe then maybe they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.

1791
02:13:15,947 --> 02:13:17,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Peace out DJ Blaziken.

1792
02:13:17,567 --> 02:13:17,887
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1793
02:13:18,027 --> 02:13:21,429
[SPEAKER_04]: if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced to buy an import.

1794
02:13:21,729 --> 02:13:22,169
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1795
02:13:22,189 --> 02:13:24,510
[SPEAKER_04]: too just to play all the good music games

1796
02:13:24,738 --> 02:13:26,439
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't an arcade like AI anymore.

1797
02:13:26,459 --> 02:13:27,039
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to say it.

1798
02:13:27,799 --> 02:13:28,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It was AI.

1799
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:31,260
[SPEAKER_04]: An AI RIP.

1800
02:13:31,541 --> 02:13:31,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1801
02:13:33,361 --> 02:13:33,661
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1802
02:13:33,982 --> 02:13:37,503
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1803
02:13:37,543 --> 02:13:43,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I put the last call out for listless votes, so hopefully we're going to tally those up.

1804
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:45,506
[SPEAKER_11]: But not before we do some angst.

1805
02:13:46,106 --> 02:13:46,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Grr.

1806
02:13:47,086 --> 02:13:47,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Arg.

1807
02:13:47,587 --> 02:13:48,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Angst time.

1808
02:14:02,817 --> 02:14:17,888
[SPEAKER_04]: FU's of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum so I'm gonna say FU to gluten and meat

1809
02:14:20,442 --> 02:14:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither of them agree with me, no matter how tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is.

1810
02:14:26,647 --> 02:14:28,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm telling them goodbye for a while.

1811
02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:30,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.

1812
02:14:32,032 --> 02:14:34,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I will sort of miss you, but my stomach won't.

1813
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:35,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Done.

1814
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:36,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki!

1815
02:14:56,980 --> 02:14:59,162
[SPEAKER_09]: It just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow.

1816
02:14:59,382 --> 02:15:00,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Or when they're merging lanes.

1817
02:15:01,164 --> 02:15:04,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I love these people that are just like, oh, I'm going to cut in and out lanes.

1818
02:15:04,387 --> 02:15:10,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I have my right turn signal on, but I'm just going to assume that one turn signal on means I can go any way I want.

1819
02:15:10,573 --> 02:15:12,875
[SPEAKER_11]: So, fuck you, the bad drivers.

1820
02:15:16,447 --> 02:15:20,168
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the week.

1821
02:15:20,308 --> 02:15:22,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately.

1822
02:15:23,209 --> 02:15:24,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't complain too much.

1823
02:15:25,009 --> 02:15:27,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday.

1824
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:30,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that was so terrible.

1825
02:15:30,810 --> 02:15:32,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was bad.

1826
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:34,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And my tooth still kind of hurts a little bit.

1827
02:15:34,511 --> 02:15:36,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So FU to pain.

1828
02:15:36,291 --> 02:15:41,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of.

1829
02:15:41,852 --> 02:15:42,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm pretty great.

1830
02:15:43,373 --> 02:15:47,675
[SPEAKER_11]: So F you to paint.

1831
02:15:50,637 --> 02:15:57,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really that angsty, I guess, but just F you to having only two weeks to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do.

1832
02:15:58,661 --> 02:15:59,942
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still a good thing, so.

1833
02:16:00,863 --> 02:16:04,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated.

1834
02:16:04,284 --> 02:16:05,125
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1835
02:16:06,673 --> 02:16:08,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.

1836
02:16:08,755 --> 02:16:16,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will reveal tonight's list list, definitive list, and we will get to the Skype line in just a little bit.

1837
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,061
[SPEAKER_11]: But for now, a couple quick stories.

1838
02:16:18,101 --> 02:16:18,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1839
02:16:18,755 --> 02:16:20,497
[SPEAKER_09]: The Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy

1840
02:16:37,219 --> 02:16:37,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1841
02:16:56,073 --> 02:17:25,142
[SPEAKER_09]: it's neat I guess I think the I want to say that the games at least the Prince of Persia ones are already on the Playstation Network they're $15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving $5 apparently also the Splinter Cell games are going to be available on the Playstation Network as well I'm assuming for probably around the same price $15 each $40 for the compilation if you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so save $5

1842
02:17:27,299 --> 02:17:27,639
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1843
02:17:27,659 --> 02:17:30,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, would you like to be able to play more games on the Mac?

1844
02:17:31,361 --> 02:17:33,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe you can get a thing called Boxer.

1845
02:17:34,482 --> 02:17:37,043
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't like Boxers versus Briefs or anything.

1846
02:17:37,083 --> 02:17:38,324
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually Boxer.

1847
02:17:38,464 --> 02:17:40,865
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a DOS box for the Mac.

1848
02:17:41,325 --> 02:17:41,705
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1849
02:17:41,745 --> 02:17:42,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I did a little joke there.

1850
02:17:43,005 --> 02:17:46,487
[SPEAKER_11]: This will allow you to play old PC games on the Mac.

1851
02:17:46,867 --> 02:17:47,447
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

1852
02:17:47,527 --> 02:17:49,148
[SPEAKER_11]: All joking aside, this is pretty cool.

1853
02:17:49,808 --> 02:17:56,392
[SPEAKER_11]: DOSBox, of course, was an old emulator that will make playing games from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines.

1854
02:17:56,912 --> 02:18:00,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Boxer is kind of this redone for Apple computers.

1855
02:18:00,815 --> 02:18:01,955
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mac series, of course.

1856
02:18:02,415 --> 02:18:06,518
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I like about it is they've kind of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit.

1857
02:18:06,638 --> 02:18:09,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Like you can see XCOM in there, although it's just the demo.

1858
02:18:09,440 --> 02:18:11,981
[SPEAKER_11]: But Doom 2 is playable in this, which is pretty cool.

1859
02:18:12,361 --> 02:18:14,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you own a Mac, I would be checking this out.

1860
02:18:14,582 --> 02:18:15,463
[SPEAKER_11]: BoxerApp.com

1861
02:18:15,623 --> 02:18:20,165
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com is where you can go to check out the Boxer emulator for your old school DOS fix.

1862
02:18:20,245 --> 02:18:21,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And this doesn't come with any games, right?

1863
02:18:21,886 --> 02:18:23,707
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to install your own.

1864
02:18:24,047 --> 02:18:26,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in.

1865
02:18:26,748 --> 02:18:29,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I see Doom 2, it's probably the freeware one.

1866
02:18:29,649 --> 02:18:33,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Underworld, the demo, Ultima Underworld, probably just boxed with some of those.

1867
02:18:34,452 --> 02:18:54,899
[SPEAKER_11]: you can though for the record play PC games on a Mac you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels I think it's called but I think what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important because some of the old DOS games you try to play them on a PC now it's like crazy you can't do it

1868
02:18:55,379 --> 02:19:21,351
[SPEAKER_11]: because you know the first computer I ever had PC was a 16 megahertz computer and it was blazing fast and you know I used to play games like X-Men on it and like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what do computers go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the winner

1869
02:19:23,228 --> 02:19:25,249
[SPEAKER_11]: So here it is, tonight's definitive list.

1870
02:19:25,349 --> 02:19:26,370
[SPEAKER_11]: No arguing, folks.

1871
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:27,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a done deal.

1872
02:19:27,550 --> 02:19:29,111
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very scientific process.

1873
02:19:29,492 --> 02:19:33,174
[SPEAKER_11]: The launch title that would have made you get a 3DS.

1874
02:19:34,494 --> 02:19:37,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Number three, Breasts 3D.

1875
02:19:38,096 --> 02:19:40,758
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, the game with boobs, boobs, and more boobs.

1876
02:19:41,960 --> 02:19:42,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have that game.

1877
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:44,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost as good as the real thing.

1878
02:19:44,441 --> 02:19:45,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I already have that game.

1879
02:19:45,961 --> 02:19:47,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1880
02:19:47,642 --> 02:19:54,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Your number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3DS that would have made you get one today, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.

1881
02:19:55,284 --> 02:19:55,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

1882
02:19:56,004 --> 02:19:56,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I see a pattern.

1883
02:19:57,064 --> 02:19:59,865
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be another Nintendo Tecmo collaboration.

1884
02:20:00,005 --> 02:20:01,486
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1885
02:20:01,706 --> 02:20:02,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

1886
02:20:02,606 --> 02:20:05,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But the number one thing that would have made you buy a 3DS today...

1887
02:20:07,194 --> 02:20:31,176
[SPEAKER_11]: F03DS going for a serious answer there it is F03DS is the winner I thought for sure that it would be the off-road racing game Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being it it was just it was fourth place just shy of the list I'm kind of glad though it won't be etched permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old next week

1888
02:20:32,648 --> 02:20:32,889
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1889
02:20:33,329 --> 02:20:37,632
[SPEAKER_09]: We totally missed out on all the Charlie Sheen references we could have used.

1890
02:20:37,692 --> 02:20:37,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1891
02:20:37,912 --> 02:20:40,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Winning 3DS, but not.

1892
02:20:40,134 --> 02:20:41,155
[SPEAKER_11]: No one cares anymore.

1893
02:20:41,195 --> 02:20:41,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of over it.

1894
02:20:42,055 --> 02:20:43,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't care to begin with.

1895
02:20:44,617 --> 02:20:47,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, we're watching a man self-destruct live on TV.

1896
02:20:47,319 --> 02:20:47,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

1897
02:20:48,039 --> 02:20:50,241
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's different now because it's a man doing it.

1898
02:20:50,501 --> 02:20:51,262
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a while.

1899
02:20:52,923 --> 02:20:56,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll show his kush on TV and people will care.

1900
02:20:56,045 --> 02:20:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1901
02:20:58,351 --> 02:21:00,491
[SPEAKER_11]: As he's getting out of a limo, sure.

1902
02:21:00,751 --> 02:21:01,131
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1903
02:21:01,732 --> 02:21:03,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Skype line is open now.

1904
02:21:03,752 --> 02:21:07,253
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1905
02:21:07,273 --> 02:21:13,994
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call and talk about the 3DS or you want to talk about something we talked about in the news or maybe have a game review, I don't know.

1906
02:21:14,434 --> 02:21:16,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Skype line's open and call.

1907
02:21:17,574 --> 02:21:20,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping we'll get at least one caller tonight we've never had before.

1908
02:21:20,695 --> 02:21:23,355
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to hear from someone shy who never calls us.

1909
02:21:23,875 --> 02:21:26,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, meanwhile, do you have any last minute news for us tonight?

1910
02:21:27,945 --> 02:21:29,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's some stuff we didn't talk about.

1911
02:21:30,007 --> 02:21:35,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, uh, there was a whole thing that they thought that Geohot had fled to South America.

1912
02:21:36,233 --> 02:21:37,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he went to South America.

1913
02:21:37,034 --> 02:21:38,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sick of that fucking story.

1914
02:21:38,315 --> 02:21:38,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

1915
02:21:39,096 --> 02:21:40,257
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, whatever.

1916
02:21:40,678 --> 02:21:43,600
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, uh, yeah, he went to South America, but not for fleeing.

1917
02:21:44,161 --> 02:21:47,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, you know, if he doesn't come back, then he is fleeing, so.

1918
02:21:48,725 --> 02:21:49,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Take it as you will.

1919
02:21:50,968 --> 02:21:51,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1920
02:21:55,327 --> 02:21:56,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man, there's not a lot of stuff.

1921
02:21:57,007 --> 02:21:58,888
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's go to the phones.

1922
02:21:58,908 --> 02:21:59,888
[SPEAKER_11]: When we have phones, take a call.

1923
02:22:00,608 --> 02:22:01,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1924
02:22:01,668 --> 02:22:02,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1925
02:22:02,969 --> 02:22:03,829
[SPEAKER_14]: This is C.D.

1926
02:22:03,889 --> 02:22:04,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Fender.

1927
02:22:05,049 --> 02:22:05,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Say that again?

1928
02:22:05,569 --> 02:22:05,889
[SPEAKER_11]: C.D.

1929
02:22:05,949 --> 02:22:06,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Fidner?

1930
02:22:07,170 --> 02:22:07,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Fender.

1931
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:08,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Fender.

1932
02:22:08,230 --> 02:22:08,550
[SPEAKER_11]: C.D.

1933
02:22:08,610 --> 02:22:08,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Fender.

1934
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:11,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we've had you on the show before.

1935
02:22:11,491 --> 02:22:12,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I got my wish.

1936
02:22:12,251 --> 02:22:12,951
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1937
02:22:14,131 --> 02:22:15,111
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually Fender.

1938
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:16,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Fender.

1939
02:22:16,612 --> 02:22:17,212
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, Fender?

1940
02:22:22,096 --> 02:22:23,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Golden rule of radio.

1941
02:22:23,296 --> 02:22:28,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead and turn down the radio in the background because the echo is going to mess with you like you wouldn't believe.

1942
02:22:28,839 --> 02:22:29,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen to me on your phone.

1943
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:30,680
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

1944
02:22:30,700 --> 02:22:32,741
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you call us for tonight?

1945
02:22:34,642 --> 02:22:38,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have some games to discuss with you guys.

1946
02:22:38,844 --> 02:22:39,104
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1947
02:22:39,144 --> 02:22:39,544
[SPEAKER_14]: What games?

1948
02:22:41,465 --> 02:22:41,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1949
02:22:42,466 --> 02:22:44,267
[SPEAKER_14]: The Resident Evil series.

1950
02:22:44,967 --> 02:22:46,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Just the whole damn series?

1951
02:22:46,408 --> 02:22:46,748
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them?

1952
02:22:49,479 --> 02:22:55,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like Resident Evil 5, I've never played it, but it looks pretty cool.

1953
02:22:55,962 --> 02:22:56,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I might like it.

1954
02:22:58,144 --> 02:22:59,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you think you'd like Resident Evil 5?

1955
02:23:00,865 --> 02:23:08,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I've seen videos of it, and just the graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks cool.

1956
02:23:08,869 --> 02:23:11,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And your partner is a girl, so it can't be that.

1957
02:23:12,717 --> 02:23:18,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Resident Evil 5 has been out for some time, so what's stopping you from just getting the damn game already?

1958
02:23:20,804 --> 02:23:21,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't have the system.

1959
02:23:22,785 --> 02:23:24,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, that happens.

1960
02:23:24,847 --> 02:23:29,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So you are not an owner of any 360 PS3-type consoles?

1961
02:23:30,472 --> 02:23:34,355
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've got a Nintendo GameCube and a Nintendo 64.

1962
02:23:34,615 --> 02:23:35,116
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

1963
02:23:35,136 --> 02:23:36,677
[SPEAKER_11]: That shit's expensive, the new stuff.

1964
02:23:36,697 --> 02:23:38,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So you are kicking it old school.

1965
02:23:39,793 --> 02:23:40,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am.

1966
02:23:40,373 --> 02:23:43,075
[SPEAKER_11]: So what old school games do you enjoy playing?

1967
02:23:44,676 --> 02:23:45,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1968
02:23:45,757 --> 02:23:50,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got the old Rampage games.

1969
02:23:52,782 --> 02:23:56,744
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have Perfect Dark, the one for the 64.

1970
02:23:58,165 --> 02:23:58,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Classic.

1971
02:24:00,027 --> 02:24:02,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have Fighting for 64.

1972
02:24:02,709 --> 02:24:02,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Goal 9-007.

1973
02:24:10,678 --> 02:24:15,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm still living at home and I haven't moved out and I don't think I want to spend my money on that.

1974
02:24:15,322 --> 02:24:18,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I like playing on Wii's, I don't think I want to own one.

1975
02:24:31,024 --> 02:24:34,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you know, it's like The Rent or a Wii.

1976
02:24:34,307 --> 02:24:35,929
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably a good idea.

1977
02:24:35,949 --> 02:24:36,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

1978
02:24:36,710 --> 02:24:37,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1979
02:24:39,172 --> 02:24:44,177
[SPEAKER_14]: And with the GameCube, I've got Die Hard Vendetta.

1980
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:45,519
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if you've heard of that.

1981
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:47,181
[SPEAKER_11]: No, probably not.

1982
02:24:47,221 --> 02:24:48,942
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't really into the Die Hard movies.

1983
02:24:49,062 --> 02:24:50,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, well, I don't know.

1984
02:24:50,043 --> 02:24:51,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, maybe?

1985
02:24:51,545 --> 02:24:51,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1986
02:24:51,945 --> 02:24:53,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we get that in the game?

1987
02:24:54,949 --> 02:24:56,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we get a Yippee-Ki-Yay motherfucker in the game?

1988
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:59,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't played it in such a long time, I've forgotten.

1989
02:25:00,512 --> 02:25:01,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's alright.

1990
02:25:01,772 --> 02:25:04,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, because it's a Nintendo-based product.

1991
02:25:05,134 --> 02:25:07,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's an M-rated game, so you never know.

1992
02:25:08,255 --> 02:25:08,736
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

1993
02:25:08,936 --> 02:25:10,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here's my thing, though.

1994
02:25:10,556 --> 02:25:12,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Resident Evil you brought up, Resident Evil 5.

1995
02:25:12,157 --> 02:25:15,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made was Resident Evil 4.

1996
02:25:16,239 --> 02:25:17,940
[SPEAKER_11]: So, have you checked that out on GameCube?

1997
02:25:19,903 --> 02:25:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I do want to buy that.

1998
02:25:22,565 --> 02:25:25,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they made that game for the Wii as well, but it's the same.

1999
02:25:26,127 --> 02:25:27,547
[SPEAKER_14]: The graphics are still the same.

2000
02:25:27,708 --> 02:25:28,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, pretty much.

2001
02:25:28,448 --> 02:25:31,950
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the Wii's just two GameCubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway.

2002
02:25:33,411 --> 02:25:34,491
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty good description.

2003
02:25:35,712 --> 02:25:36,552
[SPEAKER_11]: How's your PC?

2004
02:25:36,572 --> 02:25:41,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Because some folks in chat are kind of commenting, wow, this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago.

2005
02:25:41,655 --> 02:25:42,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe he should game on the PC.

2006
02:25:43,296 --> 02:25:44,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you tried gaming on PC?

2007
02:25:44,857 --> 02:25:44,897
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2008
02:25:45,816 --> 02:25:46,516
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a PC.

2009
02:25:46,577 --> 02:25:49,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually using a Mac laptop right now.

2010
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:53,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we just talked about DOSBox on the Mac.

2011
02:25:53,141 --> 02:25:54,221
[SPEAKER_11]: That might be an option for you.

2012
02:25:54,281 --> 02:25:54,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2013
02:25:55,903 --> 02:26:01,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I actually have the original one version of the original Doom for the 64.

2014
02:26:02,387 --> 02:26:02,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

2015
02:26:04,388 --> 02:26:07,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you might have to check out Steam for the Mac or something.

2016
02:26:07,370 --> 02:26:07,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2017
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:09,051
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an option for you.

2018
02:26:09,091 --> 02:26:10,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we've got to take some more calls.

2019
02:26:10,212 --> 02:26:12,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other last minute thoughts before we let you go?

2020
02:26:14,003 --> 02:26:17,685
[SPEAKER_14]: No, just that you guys do a really good job and keep doing what you're doing.

2021
02:26:17,885 --> 02:26:18,305
[SPEAKER_14]: We will.

2022
02:26:18,505 --> 02:26:19,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2023
02:26:19,146 --> 02:26:19,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2024
02:26:19,726 --> 02:26:20,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much.

2025
02:26:20,586 --> 02:26:20,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, buddy.

2026
02:26:21,007 --> 02:26:21,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2027
02:26:21,427 --> 02:26:21,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2028
02:26:23,048 --> 02:26:26,569
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, not everybody can take the plunge.

2029
02:26:26,589 --> 02:26:28,310
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking about $200 for a Nintendo Wii.

2030
02:26:28,470 --> 02:26:31,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Because some folks in the chat room are like, is that call from like three years ago?

2031
02:26:31,492 --> 02:26:32,052
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on?

2032
02:26:32,072 --> 02:26:36,674
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's like, you know, it's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody gets to just take the plunge.

2033
02:26:36,814 --> 02:26:37,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I should have asked how old he was.

2034
02:26:38,575 --> 02:26:38,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's up, guys?

2035
02:26:38,995 --> 02:26:39,335
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Kaijudo.

2036
02:26:39,355 --> 02:26:41,316
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to call real quick about Pokemon, black and white.

2037
02:26:41,336 --> 02:26:43,597
[SPEAKER_11]: But before I say that, yeah, I have it.

2038
02:26:43,617 --> 02:26:44,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I have both, actually.

2039
02:27:06,636 --> 02:27:36,316
[SPEAKER_13]: but before I go on to that I just want to say that previous caller Die Hard Vendetta he called it it does have a lot of cursing in it it was actually a big deal they were trying to go after Nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many F-bombs in that game you wouldn't believe it but anyway so Pokemans show us your Pokemans yeah I definitely recommend it I mean I think if you haven't played Pokemon in a while I think you should definitely pick this one up I mean they always add something new

2040
02:27:37,151 --> 02:27:37,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Mudkip 2.0?

2041
02:27:37,491 --> 02:27:37,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Mudkip 2.0?

2042
02:28:09,163 --> 02:28:10,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trolling, don't listen to me.

2043
02:28:37,225 --> 02:28:39,025
[SPEAKER_13]: about how much they added to the game.

2044
02:28:39,085 --> 02:28:40,266
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really a great game.

2045
02:28:40,426 --> 02:28:44,986
[SPEAKER_11]: So my ignorant ass earlier in the show should not have said that the Pokemon games haven't really changed in a while.

2046
02:28:45,827 --> 02:28:48,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, it's your opinion, but actually they have changed.

2047
02:28:48,627 --> 02:28:51,248
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that you mentioned, the Ruby, what was it?

2048
02:28:51,408 --> 02:28:52,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Ruby Silver?

2049
02:28:52,168 --> 02:28:52,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2050
02:28:52,788 --> 02:28:54,648
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Ruby Emerald.

2051
02:28:55,088 --> 02:29:05,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but what I think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases, which they didn't have in the original, which was, I think,

2052
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:06,921
[SPEAKER_13]: What was it, Red and Blue or some shit?

2053
02:29:07,001 --> 02:29:12,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but to be fair, I mean, how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game?

2054
02:29:12,163 --> 02:29:13,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, maybe a little bit.

2055
02:29:13,263 --> 02:29:21,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it does, because, I mean, certain Pokemon you couldn't catch, you know, you have to catch them at certain days of the week, you have to catch them at certain, you know, either day or night.

2056
02:29:21,787 --> 02:29:24,728
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, I mean, they really do innovative stuff with it.

2057
02:29:24,748 --> 02:29:31,831
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, it may not be something that's going to, like, change how you think about Pokemon, but, I mean, they always consider the fans and they...

2058
02:29:33,077 --> 02:29:35,518
[SPEAKER_13]: They kind of cater to what the fans want.

2059
02:29:35,538 --> 02:29:39,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever the fans are asking for, you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next Pokemon game.

2060
02:29:40,199 --> 02:29:48,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask one of the fanboy questions of the year, and I don't know how many times we brought this up on the show, but why do you think Nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a Pokemon MMO?

2061
02:29:49,402 --> 02:29:51,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I would even fucking play a Pokemon MMO.

2062
02:29:52,163 --> 02:30:01,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you mentioned earlier, like I said, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but they do have this website thing that's coming out on March 30th.

2063
02:30:02,452 --> 02:30:05,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess you could say it's kind of like an MMO.

2064
02:30:05,773 --> 02:30:13,575
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to have some kind of Pokefarm and you can raise your Pokemon slaves there and make them fight.

2065
02:30:13,675 --> 02:30:14,795
[SPEAKER_13]: All that type of stuff.

2066
02:30:14,815 --> 02:30:17,796
[SPEAKER_13]: They do have some type of MMO thing going on.

2067
02:30:17,816 --> 02:30:25,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them in a while, but you'll be able to link up with maybe 10 people in a room.

2068
02:30:26,798 --> 02:30:50,817
[SPEAKER_13]: and you can all like chat and you know exchange you can tie razor blades to their feet and all that shit this sounds like you're turning cockfighting into a video game but you've just replaced the cocks with Pikachu that's pretty much what Pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it you're basically catching these things and making them like yeah it's cockfighting pretty much but I mean it's great you know I mean I don't mind it get your Pikachu out of my cockfighting game it's better than getting real cock

2069
02:30:51,929 --> 02:30:53,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, we're having too much fun.

2070
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:56,371
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's better than getting real roosters and having them beat the crap out of each other.

2071
02:30:56,391 --> 02:30:57,132
[SPEAKER_13]: You could do it virtually.

2072
02:30:57,472 --> 02:30:57,792
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2073
02:30:58,132 --> 02:31:01,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty much what the main story is about in this game.

2074
02:31:01,293 --> 02:31:07,977
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a guy who wants to free all the Pokemon because he's like, oh, you know, we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy shit.

2075
02:31:08,077 --> 02:31:09,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's basically PETA.

2076
02:31:10,458 --> 02:31:11,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

2077
02:31:13,799 --> 02:31:14,059
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2078
02:31:14,079 --> 02:31:15,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be pee-pee?

2079
02:31:15,660 --> 02:31:18,281
[SPEAKER_11]: People for the ethical treatment of Pokemon?

2080
02:31:18,802 --> 02:31:19,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Pee-pee?

2081
02:31:21,436 --> 02:31:27,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Any quick last shoutouts before we let you go?

2082
02:31:29,143 --> 02:31:43,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Shoutout to everyone listening Shoutout to Raichu, I love you man I'm not gonna Raichu a love song Oh god Have you seen that t-shirt?

2083
02:31:43,936 --> 02:31:47,579
[SPEAKER_10]: No I'm not gonna and then the picture of Raichu and then love song

2084
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:58,681
[SPEAKER_11]: SX in our chatroom says, no one show this game to Michael Vick.

2085
02:31:58,801 --> 02:31:59,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, ouch.

2086
02:32:00,841 --> 02:32:01,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about that.

2087
02:32:01,382 --> 02:32:05,703
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, 1877GAMEOLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2088
02:32:08,764 --> 02:32:10,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I can't deal with it tonight.

2089
02:32:10,364 --> 02:32:11,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to some more calls.

2090
02:32:11,664 --> 02:32:12,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:18,393 --> 02:32:19,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, this is Actdeft.

02:32:19,454 --> 02:32:21,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Actdeft running to the mic.

2095
02:32:21,034 --> 02:32:21,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit, shit, shit.

2096
02:32:21,815 --> 02:32:22,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, what's up, Actdeft?

2097
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:27,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to pull up the last call about Pokemon.

2098
02:32:27,698 --> 02:32:28,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what's up?

2099
02:32:29,559 --> 02:32:36,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I pretty much, well, it has changed a lot since the Game Boy Advance games.

2100
02:32:36,763 --> 02:32:37,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2101
02:32:37,123 --> 02:32:37,584
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot.

2102
02:32:39,425 --> 02:32:41,025
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's all changed?

2103
02:32:41,946 --> 02:32:45,628
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I missing by not experiencing Pokemon Black and White?

2104
02:32:47,253 --> 02:32:50,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you have more stuff to do with Pokemon.

2105
02:32:50,676 --> 02:32:56,902
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to watch out for stats like special attack and defense.

2106
02:32:57,683 --> 02:33:02,127
[SPEAKER_12]: You also have to raise some certain Pokemon to obtain them.

2107
02:33:04,810 --> 02:33:06,331
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to work that Pokemon.

2108
02:33:06,351 --> 02:33:07,212
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to train them.

2109
02:33:07,913 --> 02:33:10,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you whip your Pokemon like the Derby Owners Club?

2110
02:33:13,341 --> 02:33:16,563
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're a competitive player, pretty much you have to do that.

2111
02:33:19,745 --> 02:33:24,449
[SPEAKER_12]: And also about Nintendo not doing the Pokemon MMO.

2112
02:33:25,990 --> 02:33:30,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much Nintendo, I think, has said that they don't want to do it because it's...

2113
02:33:32,134 --> 02:33:37,839
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very big project, and I think they said that it couldn't work.

2114
02:33:38,059 --> 02:33:38,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, fuck them!

2115
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:40,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me what I want!

2116
02:33:41,222 --> 02:33:42,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that too much to ask?

2117
02:33:42,042 --> 02:33:43,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know.

2118
02:33:43,543 --> 02:33:45,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone would play it, I know.

2119
02:33:45,185 --> 02:33:50,289
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't play MMOs, I don't like them, but I know I would play a Pokemon MMO.

2120
02:33:51,029 --> 02:33:54,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I dare somebody to call in and say they wouldn't play the Pokemon MMO.

2121
02:33:54,171 --> 02:33:54,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone in this room?

2122
02:33:54,971 --> 02:33:57,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Would anyone in this room not play the Pokemon MMO?

2123
02:33:57,872 --> 02:33:58,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Or at least give it a try?

2124
02:33:59,052 --> 02:33:59,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd try.

2125
02:33:59,393 --> 02:34:00,893
[SPEAKER_11]: I would not play the Pokemon MMO.

2126
02:34:00,973 --> 02:34:02,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, hater, why?

2127
02:34:02,334 --> 02:34:03,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't like Pokemon.

2128
02:34:03,754 --> 02:34:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't shoot Pokemon.

2129
02:34:05,515 --> 02:34:06,756
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I don't like it.

2130
02:34:06,796 --> 02:34:11,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a stupid series that certain people over age... Hold on, hold on.

2131
02:34:11,918 --> 02:34:13,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, I have to know.

2132
02:34:13,538 --> 02:34:16,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't you bought every single Animal Crossing game they've ever made?

2133
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:16,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2134
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:17,400
Yes.

2135
02:34:18,020 --> 02:34:19,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand you at all.

2136
02:34:19,641 --> 02:34:20,642
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't like them.

2137
02:34:21,502 --> 02:34:22,583
[SPEAKER_11]: But you buy them.

2138
02:34:22,923 --> 02:34:25,645
[SPEAKER_11]: You hate, you hate, you hate, you hate, and yet you buy.

2139
02:34:25,665 --> 02:34:26,986
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife wanted to play them.

2140
02:34:27,006 --> 02:34:28,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, likely story.

2141
02:34:28,427 --> 02:34:29,307
[SPEAKER_11]: It is likely.

2142
02:34:29,927 --> 02:34:32,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe Josh wants to play Pokemon MMO.

2143
02:34:33,129 --> 02:34:35,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Nintendogs, and I hate it, and I'm getting rid of it.

2144
02:34:35,851 --> 02:34:36,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what?

2145
02:34:37,872 --> 02:34:38,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

2146
02:34:38,874 --> 02:34:41,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play Nintendogs.

2147
02:34:41,176 --> 02:34:41,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy it.

2148
02:34:41,957 --> 02:34:43,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you want to play the new Nintendogs?

2149
02:34:43,739 --> 02:34:45,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Boot up the old Nintendogs.

2150
02:34:46,202 --> 02:34:47,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And get drunk.

2151
02:34:47,403 --> 02:34:47,904
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be in 3D.

2152
02:34:47,964 --> 02:34:50,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2153
02:34:50,707 --> 02:34:53,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want someone to convince my husband to get me my 3DS.

2154
02:34:57,010 --> 02:34:58,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Look what you started, Actdeft.

2155
02:34:58,391 --> 02:34:59,131
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all fighting.

2156
02:34:59,292 --> 02:35:00,372
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all in fighting tonight.

2157
02:35:00,432 --> 02:35:03,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I know OLR is going to break up tonight, and it's all because of your call.

2158
02:35:03,314 --> 02:35:04,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want you to know that.

2159
02:35:04,354 --> 02:35:04,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

2160
02:35:04,855 --> 02:35:05,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry about that.

2161
02:35:06,015 --> 02:35:06,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

2162
02:35:06,916 --> 02:35:07,736
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no.

2163
02:35:07,756 --> 02:35:25,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, Nintendo said the most principal thing, they don't want to do it because it's a big infrastructure, and it's, like I said, a very big project for them to handle, and they don't want to do it.

2164
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:26,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

2165
02:35:26,341 --> 02:35:33,368
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the number one selling console in the motherfucking world, yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a Pokemon MMO.

2166
02:35:33,769 --> 02:35:39,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Little old Microsoft, I have no idea how they're doing it, and Sony, jeez, boy, they're sure suckers.

2167
02:35:39,975 --> 02:35:46,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to their defense, Microsoft doesn't have an MMO.

2168
02:35:49,045 --> 02:35:52,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But they have an online infrastructure, which is more than Nintendo has.

2169
02:35:52,647 --> 02:35:53,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Debatable.

2170
02:35:53,848 --> 02:35:55,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they did have Final Fantasy XI.

2171
02:35:55,489 --> 02:35:56,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I'm always going to whip out that card.

2172
02:35:57,111 --> 02:35:58,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And Phantasy Star Universe.

2173
02:35:58,251 --> 02:35:58,912
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

2174
02:35:59,072 --> 02:36:00,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, fine.

2175
02:36:00,273 --> 02:36:01,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Then they already have more than Nintendo does.

2176
02:36:02,815 --> 02:36:05,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft just is opposed to MMOs for some reason.

2177
02:36:05,897 --> 02:36:07,358
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some weird thing going on.

2178
02:36:07,418 --> 02:36:11,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they were just burned by Final Fantasy XI or what, but I don't know.

2179
02:36:11,841 --> 02:36:13,924
[SPEAKER_11]: or maybe it has something to do with their next system.

2180
02:36:14,064 --> 02:36:16,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe their next system is all going to be about MMOs.

2181
02:36:16,507 --> 02:36:16,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

2182
02:36:17,369 --> 02:36:18,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making shit up now.

2183
02:36:20,473 --> 02:36:20,753
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2184
02:36:21,173 --> 02:36:27,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, before I let you go, since we've completely derailed your phone calls many times, anything else you want to share with our folks tonight?

2185
02:36:28,444 --> 02:36:30,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, just one last question.

2186
02:36:31,707 --> 02:36:36,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you pay around $525 for a 3DS?

2187
02:36:37,451 --> 02:36:38,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell no, I wouldn't.

2188
02:36:38,993 --> 02:36:39,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Not right now.

2189
02:36:39,713 --> 02:36:40,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Not until more games come out.

2190
02:36:41,014 --> 02:36:43,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me guess, that's how much you're having to pay in Mexico, huh?

2191
02:36:43,496 --> 02:36:43,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2192
02:36:45,683 --> 02:36:45,963
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

2193
02:37:09,606 --> 02:37:11,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are pretty much screwed.

2194
02:37:11,349 --> 02:37:14,555
[SPEAKER_12]: They're paying 6,000 pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3DS.

2195
02:37:14,575 --> 02:37:15,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Unbelievable.

2196
02:37:20,598 --> 02:37:24,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Actdeft, we hope it gets to a more reasonable level in Mexico soon.

2197
02:37:24,661 --> 02:37:25,842
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is launch day.

2198
02:37:25,882 --> 02:37:27,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, give it a few weeks to stabilize.

2199
02:37:27,764 --> 02:37:33,448
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if the sales are not so hot, or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought, maybe the price will drop pretty quickly.

2200
02:37:33,728 --> 02:37:34,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2201
02:37:34,769 --> 02:37:36,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt it, but, well, let's see.

2202
02:37:36,831 --> 02:37:37,131
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

2203
02:37:37,531 --> 02:37:38,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2204
02:37:39,433 --> 02:37:39,753
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

2205
02:37:39,953 --> 02:37:40,194
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

2206
02:37:40,916 --> 02:37:41,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2207
02:37:58,906 --> 02:38:00,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to one or two more calls.

2208
02:38:00,727 --> 02:38:01,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2209
02:38:01,568 --> 02:38:01,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2210
02:38:02,508 --> 02:38:03,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, it's Ranma.

2211
02:38:03,289 --> 02:38:04,289
[SPEAKER_08]: How's everyone doing tonight?

2212
02:38:04,309 --> 02:38:05,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, good, Ranma.

2213
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:06,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say real quick to this.

2214
02:38:06,731 --> 02:38:08,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Our phones are like packed tonight.

2215
02:38:08,092 --> 02:38:08,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's weird.

2216
02:38:08,632 --> 02:38:11,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's just constantly lit up the whole screen.

2217
02:38:11,314 --> 02:38:14,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't get through tonight, don't get sand in your vagina.

2218
02:38:14,455 --> 02:38:15,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Just send us an email.

2219
02:38:15,196 --> 02:38:18,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com because millions of people will call, but yet no one will email us.

2220
02:38:19,038 --> 02:38:19,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand.

2221
02:38:19,979 --> 02:38:21,039
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, but Ranma, you got through.

2222
02:38:21,079 --> 02:38:21,720
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind tonight?

2223
02:38:22,532 --> 02:38:23,152
[SPEAKER_08]: A few things.

2224
02:38:23,533 --> 02:38:37,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, I know the music is out on the podcast, but when you were playing music from Space Channel 5, I had mentioned that about two years ago, I was in a skit where it was Dance Dance Revolution versus Space Channel 5.

2225
02:38:37,961 --> 02:38:41,523
[SPEAKER_11]: It had to have been at least ten years ago when DDR was popular.

2226
02:38:43,364 --> 02:38:44,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

2227
02:38:44,505 --> 02:38:46,626
[SPEAKER_08]: It was close to seven.

2228
02:38:46,686 --> 02:38:49,408
[SPEAKER_11]: What was this DDR versus Space Channel 5 skit?

2229
02:38:50,655 --> 02:38:57,121
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty much a dance-off between which was better, the characters from Space Channel 5 or DDR.

2230
02:38:57,461 --> 02:39:09,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But what had happened was, after the dance-off, the main villain from Space Channel 5 Part 2 comes out, tries to take over the convention, both sides join forces, and do another dance-off to destroy him.

2231
02:39:09,972 --> 02:39:12,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But we cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together.

2232
02:39:13,715 --> 02:39:15,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, which character did you play?

2233
02:39:15,416 --> 02:39:16,757
[SPEAKER_11]: And please don't say Space Michael.

2234
02:39:17,618 --> 02:39:17,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Rage.

2235
02:39:18,478 --> 02:39:19,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Rage.

2236
02:39:19,419 --> 02:39:19,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2237
02:39:19,659 --> 02:39:20,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you wear pants?

2238
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:22,761
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't.

2239
02:39:22,781 --> 02:39:23,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the hair.

2240
02:39:23,441 --> 02:39:25,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have time to throw that together.

2241
02:39:26,943 --> 02:39:28,324
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't go as pantsless, Rage?

2242
02:39:29,165 --> 02:39:29,665
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2243
02:39:29,765 --> 02:39:30,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an old school LR joke.

2244
02:39:30,806 --> 02:39:31,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Old school.

2245
02:39:31,586 --> 02:39:32,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Old school.

2246
02:39:33,027 --> 02:39:33,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

2247
02:39:33,367 --> 02:39:34,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You wore pants.

2248
02:39:35,268 --> 02:39:36,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, indeed.

2249
02:39:36,769 --> 02:39:38,731
[SPEAKER_11]: So who ultimately ended up being victorious?

2250
02:39:38,791 --> 02:39:40,872
[SPEAKER_11]: The DDR people or the Space Channel 5 people?

2251
02:39:43,180 --> 02:39:49,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't know because it just ended up like a tie per se, but we still ended up winning an award, which was pretty cool.

2252
02:39:49,581 --> 02:39:51,122
[SPEAKER_11]: It was open to interpretation.

2253
02:39:51,922 --> 02:39:52,482
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it was.

2254
02:39:52,782 --> 02:39:52,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2255
02:39:53,282 --> 02:39:55,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you wanted to happen, you as the viewer.

2256
02:39:56,183 --> 02:39:57,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So what cons are coming up, Rama?

2257
02:39:57,623 --> 02:39:58,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Any cons you're going to do soon?

2258
02:39:58,863 --> 02:39:59,823
[SPEAKER_11]: You're the con king.

2259
02:40:01,003 --> 02:40:03,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Anime Boston, but you know, that's them.

2260
02:40:03,904 --> 02:40:06,985
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do have a couple more things I want to cover that I'm going to be on my merry little way.

2261
02:40:07,165 --> 02:40:07,405
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2262
02:40:08,065 --> 02:40:08,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one.

2263
02:40:09,185 --> 02:40:16,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you mentioned what's the point of having projectors with video games and stuff like that.

2264
02:40:16,597 --> 02:40:19,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Something tells me you've never seen gaming tournaments.

2265
02:40:20,529 --> 02:40:22,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed like half of what you just said there.

2266
02:40:22,270 --> 02:40:25,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you botched up a little bit.

2267
02:40:25,132 --> 02:40:27,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know the connection, but let me just repeat a little bit.

2268
02:40:28,053 --> 02:40:34,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma's basically saying a couple weeks ago on the show, I don't even remember when you said it, but you talked about projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles.

2269
02:40:34,617 --> 02:40:38,599
[SPEAKER_11]: But Ranma's saying, well, what about gaming tournaments or anime cons?

2270
02:40:38,619 --> 02:40:41,380
[SPEAKER_11]: He does conventions and probably sees DDR on projectors all the time.

2271
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:44,362
[SPEAKER_04]: At the Atari party, they had games on projector.

2272
02:40:45,768 --> 02:40:46,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Projector is basically a TV.

2273
02:41:15,268 --> 02:41:16,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe pretty much.

2274
02:41:16,349 --> 02:41:18,990
[SPEAKER_11]: You use it for certain scenarios.

2275
02:41:19,850 --> 02:41:21,251
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's where Loki's coming from, eh?

2276
02:41:21,531 --> 02:41:33,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, you know, if they come out with some sort of 3D holographic system or something like that that requires some special display that's not out there... Holodeck in a box.

2277
02:41:33,577 --> 02:41:35,639
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you want one.

2278
02:41:36,119 --> 02:41:42,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's just like, oh look, it's this console with a Pico projector built in, it's kind of...

2279
02:41:44,543 --> 02:41:44,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2280
02:41:45,644 --> 02:41:49,406
[SPEAKER_09]: It's neat, I guess, but it's impractical.

2281
02:41:51,187 --> 02:41:58,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless, of course, it runs on batteries, and that might be pretty cool, because then you can at least take it places and play stuff, but I don't know.

2282
02:41:59,512 --> 02:42:00,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Ranma, anything else?

2283
02:42:00,472 --> 02:42:03,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I had something else, but I'll save that for another time.

2284
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:04,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2285
02:42:04,900 --> 02:42:05,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2286
02:42:05,260 --> 02:42:05,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you can email.

2287
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:06,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Hint, hint.

2288
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: We need more emails.

2289
02:42:07,141 --> 02:42:07,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2290
02:42:07,981 --> 02:42:08,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do.

2291
02:42:08,642 --> 02:42:09,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma, take care, buddy.

2292
02:42:09,803 --> 02:42:10,183
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

2293
02:42:10,283 --> 02:42:10,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

2294
02:42:10,683 --> 02:42:10,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2295
02:42:11,624 --> 02:42:12,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun at Anime Boston.

2296
02:42:13,805 --> 02:42:14,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Be good times.

2297
02:42:15,126 --> 02:42:15,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

2298
02:42:16,567 --> 02:42:18,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go ahead and get to some more calls.

2299
02:42:18,748 --> 02:42:21,330
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lunch Radio.

2300
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:22,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do at least one more call, right?

2301
02:42:22,771 --> 02:42:23,051
[SPEAKER_11]: One more?

2302
02:42:23,635 --> 02:42:24,176
[SPEAKER_11]: One more call?

2303
02:42:24,316 --> 02:42:24,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2304
02:42:24,716 --> 02:42:25,357
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, one more call.

2305
02:42:25,877 --> 02:42:26,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Salacious Pop says yes.

2306
02:42:26,758 --> 02:42:27,439
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to take a call?

2307
02:42:27,459 --> 02:42:27,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

2308
02:42:28,340 --> 02:42:28,480
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2309
02:42:28,881 --> 02:42:29,061
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2310
02:42:31,584 --> 02:42:32,004
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2311
02:42:32,124 --> 02:42:32,825
[SPEAKER_11]: See, it was lighting up.

2312
02:42:32,905 --> 02:42:33,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's not.

2313
02:42:33,225 --> 02:42:34,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it takes about a minute.

2314
02:42:34,347 --> 02:42:36,048
[SPEAKER_11]: In about a minute, it's going to light up completely.

2315
02:42:36,489 --> 02:42:38,671
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, is there any last-minute stories?

2316
02:42:38,691 --> 02:42:42,195
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're just getting into that OK Go video, but is there any last-minute stories?

2317
02:42:42,375 --> 02:42:48,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, actually, it's a series that's on the iOS system, Real Racing.

2318
02:42:49,217 --> 02:42:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got Real Racing 2 HD that's going to be getting an iPad 2 update that's actually going to turn the iPad 2 into almost like a console.

2319
02:42:57,620 --> 02:42:58,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2320
02:43:13,513 --> 02:43:22,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me go to the phones because we, like clockwork, like almost exactly a certain number of seconds after I said we're done, the buffer caught up and we got another lit up board.

2321
02:43:22,218 --> 02:43:23,859
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be the last call though, guys.

2322
02:43:24,199 --> 02:43:25,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you didn't get through again, please email.

2323
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:26,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

2324
02:43:26,801 --> 02:43:27,041
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2325
02:43:27,281 --> 02:43:27,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, caller.

2326
02:43:27,681 --> 02:43:28,062
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on the air.

2327
02:43:28,082 --> 02:43:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

2328
02:43:29,002 --> 02:43:29,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2329
02:43:29,762 --> 02:43:31,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?

2330
02:43:31,423 --> 02:43:32,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, nothing much.

2331
02:43:32,923 --> 02:43:34,843
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I'm very proud of my stepdaughter.

2332
02:43:35,024 --> 02:43:44,886
[SPEAKER_01]: She's 11, and she's already been in less than about a month and a half been through the first two games of the Professor Layton series and only needed help like once or twice with one or two of the puzzles.

2333
02:43:45,026 --> 02:43:46,846
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really amazing for me to see her do that.

2334
02:43:46,866 --> 02:43:48,907
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very cerebral game, so awesome for her.

2335
02:43:49,147 --> 02:43:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's very smart, and she loves this type of puzzle game, so I'm looking forward to getting her the third one.

2336
02:43:53,908 --> 02:43:55,709
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a kid genius on your hand.

2337
02:43:55,889 --> 02:43:56,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Mensa test.

2338
02:43:57,526 --> 02:43:58,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really, no joke.

2339
02:43:59,447 --> 02:44:02,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Pokemon Black the day it came out, and I really loved it.

2340
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:04,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't played Pokemon for quite a while.

2341
02:44:04,891 --> 02:44:07,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I really pissed off the Pokemon fans tonight, didn't I?

2342
02:44:07,993 --> 02:44:14,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason why I got it was because a lot of my friends that I knew was getting either getting the black or getting white.

2343
02:44:14,758 --> 02:44:16,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided, well, why not?

2344
02:44:16,179 --> 02:44:18,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and try it out.

2345
02:44:18,901 --> 02:44:19,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really enjoying it.

2346
02:44:19,781 --> 02:44:21,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated.

2347
02:44:22,083 --> 02:44:26,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the movesets have changed around, and the different ways they're doing the Wi-Fi connection.

2348
02:44:27,469 --> 02:44:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

2349
02:44:46,775 --> 02:44:53,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you could put your Pokemon and put them in a dream world, which is kind of like a web browser game type thing.

2350
02:44:53,939 --> 02:45:00,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it won't be coming anytime soon because of the fact that over in Japan with the earthquake, they had to shut down the servers for it.

2351
02:45:00,642 --> 02:45:10,688
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came out with a release saying, though it was supposed to come on on the 30th for North America and Europe, there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up.

2352
02:45:11,068 --> 02:45:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

2353
02:45:12,916 --> 02:45:20,502
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was the one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there has been a delay and they have released statements about that so

2354
02:45:21,516 --> 02:45:25,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask you the same fanboy question I've been asking everybody else about the whole Pokemon MMO.

2355
02:45:26,459 --> 02:45:28,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you leave Warcraft for a Pokemon MMO?

2356
02:45:29,301 --> 02:45:29,501
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2357
02:45:30,362 --> 02:45:30,582
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

2358
02:45:31,002 --> 02:45:31,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?

2359
02:45:32,343 --> 02:45:38,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be more towards smaller kids and stuff, kind of like the free realm is for Sony.

2360
02:45:39,047 --> 02:45:42,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't see it being more towards adults.

2361
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:47,693
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't mind playing it just for LOLs or if it's for a good price, but

2362
02:45:48,413 --> 02:45:55,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't really see me playing a Pokemon MMO when I just can go online and just do the same things as a regular Pokemon and just challenge somebody over Wi-Fi.

2363
02:45:57,117 --> 02:46:00,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they're going to offer a bunch more stuff to it.

2364
02:46:00,618 --> 02:46:04,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2365
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't really see myself doing that.

2366
02:46:07,361 --> 02:46:09,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Nintendo wants to do it, it would be a good cash cow.

2367
02:46:10,002 --> 02:46:10,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.

2368
02:46:10,523 --> 02:46:12,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably give WoW a run for their money.

2369
02:46:13,544 --> 02:46:16,105
[SPEAKER_01]: If they can play it off and do it right, that is.

2370
02:46:17,029 --> 02:46:22,830
[SPEAKER_01]: and also coming into the straight mail too for the Bioware, sorry, really quickly.

2371
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get offended when I would play games, say like Dragon Age, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect and had a quote-unquote gay sex scene would happen.

2372
02:46:33,832 --> 02:46:35,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be like, oh my god, I can't believe I'm seeing this.

2373
02:46:36,093 --> 02:46:43,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and said for all the straight mail, sorry, not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that, so...

2374
02:46:44,292 --> 02:46:45,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't like something, I just don't play it.

2375
02:46:46,013 --> 02:46:47,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as that.

2376
02:46:47,754 --> 02:46:49,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2377
02:46:52,135 --> 02:46:53,436
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a weird story.

2378
02:46:54,116 --> 02:46:58,238
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of cool, though, that Bioware came out and just totally defended it.

2379
02:46:58,318 --> 02:47:04,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad that if they're going to go all-in like that, they really go all-in and stand by it and the artistic stuff behind it.

2380
02:47:05,301 --> 02:47:05,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Precisely.

2381
02:47:06,102 --> 02:47:07,502
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see any reason as to why.

2382
02:47:07,562 --> 02:47:08,663
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't cause an outcry.

2383
02:47:08,703 --> 02:47:10,664
[SPEAKER_01]: People knew about this way before.

2384
02:47:10,684 --> 02:47:13,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as soon as the game hits, people knew about this.

2385
02:47:14,065 --> 02:47:16,746
[SPEAKER_01]: They warned people and they were like, oh, we're putting all this stuff in.

2386
02:47:16,766 --> 02:47:18,067
[SPEAKER_01]: We're showing you some of the scenes.

2387
02:47:18,667 --> 02:47:19,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're letting people know.

2388
02:47:19,768 --> 02:47:21,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it was your choice.

2389
02:47:21,769 --> 02:47:26,051
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either A, buy it knowing what was in it, or B, don't buy it.

2390
02:47:26,111 --> 02:47:27,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it at all.

2391
02:47:27,311 --> 02:47:28,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And just don't get all up.

2392
02:47:29,132 --> 02:47:30,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make those decisions.

2393
02:47:30,293 --> 02:47:36,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was said before, you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen.

2394
02:47:37,036 --> 02:47:40,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would know because of by the reaction of the people and what they say.

2395
02:47:41,058 --> 02:47:42,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of obvious.

2396
02:47:43,159 --> 02:47:43,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2397
02:47:44,451 --> 02:47:45,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll leave it on that for now.

2398
02:47:46,164 --> 02:47:46,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

2399
02:47:46,486 --> 02:47:47,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much for the call.

2400
02:47:48,632 --> 02:47:49,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Enjoy your Pokemans.

2401
02:47:50,173 --> 02:47:50,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I will.

2402
02:47:51,713 --> 02:47:52,474
[SPEAKER_11]: See ya.

2403
02:47:52,974 --> 02:47:55,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Kinda surprised he didn't say anything about the stepdaughter playing Pokemon.

2404
02:47:56,275 --> 02:48:02,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so clearly I angered the Pokemon fans across America tonight, so I would like to apologize.

2405
02:48:02,678 --> 02:48:06,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm deeply sorry to those Pokemon fans I may have offended.

2406
02:48:06,319 --> 02:48:07,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me play you a little something in tribute.

2407
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:12,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Goddammit, I hate it when people mislabel YouTube things.

2408
02:48:13,002 --> 02:48:14,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be something else.

2409
02:48:15,302 --> 02:48:15,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Fail.

2410
02:48:15,943 --> 02:48:16,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe this one?

2411
02:48:19,332 --> 02:48:20,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I know something that you can pull up.

2412
02:48:20,633 --> 02:48:22,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to play the Jigglypuff song.

2413
02:48:22,614 --> 02:48:23,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me try this.

2414
02:48:32,439 --> 02:48:36,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Search for, it's a bumper from WB's Cartoon Afternoon.

2415
02:48:37,222 --> 02:48:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Batman sings Jigglypuff.

2416
02:48:40,284 --> 02:48:43,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

2417
02:48:44,386 --> 02:48:45,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Jiggly Batman, is that it?

2418
02:48:46,307 --> 02:48:46,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

2419
02:48:50,129 --> 02:48:51,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Time for bed.

2420
02:48:51,851 --> 02:48:53,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, but a deal's a deal.

2421
02:48:54,153 --> 02:48:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

2422
02:48:54,933 --> 02:48:55,914
[SPEAKER_00]: You promised.

2423
02:48:57,896 --> 02:49:05,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.

2424
02:49:07,764 --> 02:49:09,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, can I... The whole thing.

2425
02:49:13,553 --> 02:49:16,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Next on Kids WB Very nice.

2426
02:49:16,895 --> 02:49:17,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

2427
02:49:17,556 --> 02:49:18,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that one.

2428
02:49:19,117 --> 02:49:19,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

2429
02:49:20,658 --> 02:49:22,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, as we put the listeners to sleep even more.

2430
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:25,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, wake up because we're about to wrap up the show here.

2431
02:49:26,162 --> 02:49:27,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to you guys who called in tonight.

2432
02:49:28,003 --> 02:49:30,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to those who didn't get through, but remember we do have an email.

2433
02:49:30,325 --> 02:49:33,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright.

2434
02:49:34,948 --> 02:49:36,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki?

2435
02:49:37,426 --> 02:50:02,944
[SPEAKER_09]: No, um, but I did want to mention one thing, though, and just after watching the updated, you know, system update thing for, uh, the OK Go video, if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for Nintendogs, they are really, like, really just missing the boat here, because it's with friends, which, because all the games are Nintendogs and cats, you know, with friends, um, and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video, and it's in 3D.

2436
02:50:03,484 --> 02:50:04,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on!

2437
02:50:04,885 --> 02:50:05,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo!

2438
02:50:07,210 --> 02:50:10,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, here you go, great ad campaign.

2439
02:50:10,613 --> 02:50:11,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't have to do anything.

2440
02:50:11,453 --> 02:50:13,335
[SPEAKER_09]: You just go.

2441
02:50:13,675 --> 02:50:14,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Go with it.

2442
02:50:14,576 --> 02:50:14,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

2443
02:50:15,197 --> 02:50:15,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Go.

2444
02:50:16,097 --> 02:50:17,238
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but seriously, though, I'm surprised.

2445
02:50:17,258 --> 02:50:24,404
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have, if they wanted to be kind of hip and cool about it, they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with LittleBigPlanet where it was with live actors and stuff like that.

2446
02:50:24,424 --> 02:50:25,665
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been pretty awesome.

2447
02:50:26,646 --> 02:50:29,408
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, the game is just a rehash of the last game.

2448
02:50:29,508 --> 02:50:32,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Or they just need to get Oprah to give away 3DSs on her last show.

2449
02:50:32,351 --> 02:50:33,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get a 3DS.

2450
02:50:33,191 --> 02:50:33,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get a 3DS.

2451
02:50:36,008 --> 02:50:37,669
[SPEAKER_11]: It's by Nintendo!

2452
02:50:39,069 --> 02:50:41,310
[SPEAKER_10]: She already had her last Favorite Things episode, though.

2453
02:50:41,550 --> 02:50:43,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And the audience completely just lost their minds.

2454
02:50:43,971 --> 02:50:44,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course they did.

2455
02:50:44,852 --> 02:50:45,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

2456
02:50:45,192 --> 02:50:46,813
[SPEAKER_11]: You would, too, if you'd been in that audience.

2457
02:50:48,213 --> 02:50:48,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold me.

2458
02:50:48,673 --> 02:50:50,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have been you if you got to go to the Britney concert today.

2459
02:50:50,994 --> 02:50:54,396
[SPEAKER_10]: She totally trolled them, too, because she never says that it's a giveaway episode.

2460
02:50:54,856 --> 02:50:57,657
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like, oh, we're going to talk about to cancer patients.

2461
02:50:57,697 --> 02:50:58,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very sad.

2462
02:50:58,197 --> 02:51:01,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Then all of a sudden all the big balloons fall out of the sky and everyone falls out.

2463
02:51:01,739 --> 02:51:02,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Celebrate cancer!

2464
02:51:02,979 --> 02:51:03,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

2465
02:51:04,420 --> 02:51:04,920
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyhow.

2466
02:51:05,549 --> 02:51:08,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:51:08,131 --> 02:51:10,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.

2468
02:51:11,314 --> 02:51:15,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.

2469
02:51:15,458 --> 02:51:17,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2470
02:51:17,139 --> 02:51:19,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Word of mouth is what we need because you know what?

2471
02:51:19,181 --> 02:51:20,502
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a big website.

2472
02:51:20,522 --> 02:51:21,583
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not a magazine.

2473
02:51:21,943 --> 02:51:23,225
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not corporate owned.

2474
02:51:23,705 --> 02:51:26,948
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just frenzies doing this show because we enjoy it.

2475
02:51:27,348 --> 02:51:29,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2476
02:51:29,389 --> 02:51:30,990
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll start off with Salacious Pop.

2477
02:51:31,030 --> 02:51:32,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you once again for sitting in on the show tonight.

2478
02:51:32,952 --> 02:51:33,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2479
02:51:33,372 --> 02:51:34,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Great list list tonight.

2480
02:51:34,553 --> 02:51:36,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2481
02:51:36,894 --> 02:51:37,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Tacos.

2482
02:51:38,855 --> 02:51:39,155
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2483
02:51:39,255 --> 02:51:40,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll go to Loki.

2484
02:51:40,756 --> 02:51:41,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Any final thoughts for you tonight?

2485
02:51:42,179 --> 02:51:48,462
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is this, and I don't know if anyone's really noticed, there's an infrared camera on the 3DS.

2486
02:51:49,042 --> 02:51:51,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Infrared camera plus motion controls, what does that equal?

2487
02:51:52,344 --> 02:51:53,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii integration!

2488
02:51:54,425 --> 02:51:55,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

2489
02:51:56,606 --> 02:51:57,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Dance party.

2490
02:51:57,946 --> 02:51:58,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance party.

2491
02:51:58,907 --> 02:52:03,229
[SPEAKER_10]: All you need people is playing some Wii game and they just fling their 3DS out of their hand and it's just gone.

2492
02:52:03,329 --> 02:52:04,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up is the 3DS condom.

2493
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:10,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, my final thought for the night is care packages from Japan rock.

2494
02:52:11,239 --> 02:52:15,328
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, you have a final thought tonight?

2495
02:52:15,348 --> 02:52:18,615
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2496
02:52:19,537 --> 02:52:19,658
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2497
02:52:21,195 --> 02:52:21,775
[SPEAKER_11]: No means no.

2498
02:52:22,056 --> 02:52:22,196
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2499
02:52:22,876 --> 02:52:23,176
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2500
02:52:23,536 --> 02:52:26,058
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, guys, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2501
