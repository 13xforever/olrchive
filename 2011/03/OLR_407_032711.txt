2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have some 3DS titles already been cancelled?
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.
My name is Rob Roberts.
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Woo!
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
Woo!
Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?
Ugh!
Yeah.
I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smushage.
It looks like boob smash.
Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.
Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute, but of course we can't do a show without Techmaster Loki!
See, the reason they canceled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.
Did she?
She very well could have.
No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.
I don't know.
I can't explain it.
So how are you doing, Loki?
What's new with you?
Oh, no, you're right, you're right.
I'm confusing her with Chyna.
My mistake.
I should never do that.
That's because Chyna did enough steroids.
Not the country, but the wrestler.
No, the wrestler, yes.
Yes, I should never.
I apologize, Lucy Lawless.
Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.
Lucy Lawless could play Chyna.
No, she's awesome.
In like a Lifetime movie.
Chyna is a man beast, okay?
No, it's because of steroids.
I understand it's because of steroids, but yes.
Oh, man.
Do I feel bad?
Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Say hello to Salacious Pop.
What up?
How you doing?
Doing good.
Yeah?
You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?
Do you watch any TV at all?
No.
I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.
There's no like, you know, Hulu that you watch?
Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.
You watch Archer.
You got me hooked on that show.
That show's funny.
I like that show on FX.
Really?
You think it's funny?
Yeah.
I tried watching a few episodes of that to see because, you know, it looked really funny and it was terrible.
Really?
It was just terrible.
No, I love Archer.
It's funny.
Maybe I gotta go back and watch it, but the first few episodes just annoyed me because it wasn't funny enough.
Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes, I don't know.
Maybe, I don't know.
But every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.
It's very dark, the secretary that wants to bang everybody, because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.
Just really, like, wow.
Yeah.
A lot of awesome stuff.
where you can join us in the live chat room.
We do interact with the audience.
For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, Why is the State Theater near my house doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week?
WTF.
People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff and I'm so over it.
Just like Rebecca Black.
Rebecca Black was cool a week ago and now I think I'm finally getting over it.
Now it's become a parody of itself in a way.
And Charlie Sheen, is your buddy doing a live tour or something?
No thanks.
I'll go watch Hot Shots again.
I never actually watched the interview.
or heard anything.
I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.
Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?
Either of them.
I watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.
What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?
That was... Alan, what was that you posted on the walls?
There's a group called... I don't want to get their name wrong.
Bad Lip Sync?
Bad Lip Reading?
Yeah, that was it.
So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth and then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how... And then if you look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what it looks like she's saying.
And it's pretty awesome.
As you're queuing up the video.
I would try to play some of it here, but YouTube's acting ignorant right now.
It's terrible.
It's very ignorant right now.
I can't believe this.
Such ignorance.
There it goes.
Let's see if I can play some of this here.
I'm gonna see it get nasty.
Awesome.
That should be the theme song to River City Ransom Part 2, which we were talking about last week.
About fighting and chickens.
Barney.
We got party hats.
Barney, Barney.
I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.
It's actually much... I could listen to that.
I would buy that on iTunes.
It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, earworm than the original is.
Because I'll be in the shower.
It's like, stop it.
I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.
Alright, let's talk about actual video games.
I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen and Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes of our show.
That's way too much.
Let's talk about actual video games and how was your gaming week?
Ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was epic.
Well, in the terms of RPGs, because Dan and I are playing, well more like Dan's playing through it and I'm watching him while I crochet.
we're playing through Final Fantasy and we're halfway through the first game and when we're done with that we're going to go to 2 and then since we don't have a home version of 3 that we can play on the TV we're going to skip on to 4 and then we're going to do 5 which we've got a couple versions of now 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2 11 was crap and not really a game I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while
I played it for three years and never got to level cap.
What about 12-2?
12.2 was on the DS.
And it wasn't really 12.2, it was a side story.
There's a 12.2 that we saw.
13.2.
So there's two damn many games now.
Now, are you going to be playing the Final Fantasy 4, was it the After Years or whatever?
It may be out by the time we get to it.
We just might hook up the SNES.
I don't know.
Well, you can put it on the Wii.
We loaned out our Wii.
Our Wii's on loan.
If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.
I don't know.
We've got anthology versions.
I think I have one if you need to borrow one.
We've got anthology versions.
We've got the Super Nintendo versions.
Really, we've got, I think, three different versions of that game that we could play.
Let me back up a little bit.
Why are you doing this?
because this is romantic.
Well, back in the day, I say that like it was so long ago, but Dan would play it through Resident Evil 2 and I would be his navigator.
It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because it's been a long time since I've played the first one and when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.
I'm a Wonderswan But with the souped up music
The Warrior, The Monk, The Thief, and Red Mage
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hi, I'm versatile and can cast Fire 3.
Then our friend Becky, he's named our monk because Becky kicks ass.
And then Mystique is the thief because it's Mystique.
And the thief is always asleep or dead.
Which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what Mystique's like whenever we have work to do.
And she's been on the show.
People have heard her.
um so it's pretty fun and like I was yelling at the husband the other day I'm playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 3 mostly at school like before class when I get a chance to and uh playing wow and um I made a new character Rebecca Black just because I thought it would be funny and I like now you're stuck with it
Well, I like running through Stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?
And I'm like, yeah.
Just because it's fun.
It's my own version of trolling.
No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.
I brought this chicken for us to eat.
Anything else for your gaming week?
Pinball.
I actually played some pinball.
Good times.
I played some World Cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.
And then I, like, drained them on my last two balls.
It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck.
Whee!
Whee!
Goal!
Suck.
That was what my game was like.
And Dan's my witness.
He can vouch for me.
That's my gaming week.
Awesome.
And I crocheted.
Loki, how about you and your gaming week?
Um, what did I play this week?
Uh, Motorstorm Apocalypse.
I finished the rookie, uh, story mode thing.
Um, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.
It's really hard as it is.
So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually kind of an archer type intro for.
Um, so I'm interested to see where that goes.
And then, um, what else did I play?
I played...
More Ridge Racer, because it's fun.
I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.
I got my US 3DS now, and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it should be sold this week.
And got some Pilotwings and Super Street Fighter 4.
So, those are kind of the games to get, I guess.
Um...
And that's really what I'm getting for a while.
I still kinda sorta want one.
There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.
A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.
Beyond that, might as well wait.
I mean, seriously, it's
It's not a Wii situation right now.
And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.
And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.
You know, I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo really seemed hellbent on getting this thing out in March.
And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we really start ramping up for the holiday season?
Like, part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had the Kid Icarus and some of these other games...
Maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many third parties on board.
Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is the movies, the entertainment package and everything.
If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the summer, kids' graduation presents and things like that.
Let's say they sell a million of these, if not more, by summertime.
Then there's already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey...
How about putting out that Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?
I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.
I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.
And by putting it out just before the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're going to sell all their first batch of systems probably within the first week.
And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their investors.
That's all I really think the reason why they did it.
Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here.
Actually, it's out in all regions now.
Thanks for watching!
That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.
Yeah, you still bought one, like a lamb to the slaughter.
You were in line.
I don't care about their crappy web browser.
Or their store, because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.
Although, I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had, and they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music, but
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.
All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer and then the background was on the back layer.
I mean, but I'm not going to lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming to get done?
Probably not.
No, they just built an emulator and it runs ROMs and that's it.
You're done.
A question from Tigerclaw in our chat room.
I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they are going to do on the 3DS browser.
Do you think any at all?
Probably not, if anything.
Maybe something in Flash?
I don't know.
Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit, they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.
They supported Flash, or no, they didn't support Flash.
I can't remember what they supported.
They supported something with it.
It was very basic.
It was just like the PSP was, where it supported... It used Basic.
Basic.
it supports flash but very little flash because of the kits that they had but I think if anything what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that those 3D pictures are in so like say if I post that on my wall or something like that somewhere in a webpage it would be in 3D on yours
Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing Nintendo games in Flash on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games on my 3D.
It would be very meta.
No, you couldn't.
And the reason why you couldn't is because it doesn't have the processing power to handle something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like that either.
So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP.
You'd never be able to build something like that.
I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room.
The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.
I did hear about that.
Yeah, that's interesting.
It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know.
It's more of a show-off thing, right?
It's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D.
Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, go ahead.
For the record, Okay Go is a good band.
No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.
Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in Rock Band.
All their videos since then have been amazing.
Oh, yeah, and that one that was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing video.
Well, there's the one with the dogs, the one with them in the park, with the stop motion.
The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there.
Okay.
Okay.
So it's like they're on the cutting edge of music videos.
It's like them and Lady Gaga right there.
They should collaborate.
I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.
Really?
Good show.
Good times.
Another good band.
Alright, so is that it for your Gaming Week, Loki?
Some 3DS rants and so forth?
Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday, which, I don't know why all the hate, really.
Everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever.
This is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.
It was entertaining.
Oh damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertainment movies?
I don't understand.
See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really?
It's alright.
It's what you want to see?
Let me put it this way.
It's kind of funny because a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of different games.
Like, they have this one scene that you've probably seen there where they're in a mech and stuff, and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from Killzone.
I mean, it's...
It's pretty much that.
It looks so much like it.
It's ridiculous.
Are there lots of boobs?
Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.
It's PG-13.
Oh, come on!
No, but it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train.
And it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy XIII where they're fighting soldiers and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.
It's badass, but seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?
This would be really awesome as a game.
Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.
I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.
I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.
He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.
The 300...
Problematic but awesome.
Then Watchmen.
I love the novel, but now this.
So Superman's going to be great.
It was cool, but I see people's complaints.
They're like, well, the first part of the movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.
So what?
So it didn't have dialogue in it.
Neither did WALL-E.
So that argument is null and void because WALL-E is one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years.
Sort of the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001.
Yeah.
But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.
And, whatever, who cares?
It doesn't matter because if it was just like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution and stuff.
It's basically her coping with whatever is going on because apparently, you know, there's...
Stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as a burlesque type place.
The way she copes with it goes into this imaginary world thing where she's solving how she's going to escape.
You see how she's going to figure that out right in the very beginning.
She figured it all out, but this is just all very quick.
Kind of like Inception where there's a lot of stuff taking place in a very short period of time.
and Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.
Boobies in 3D.
Is there any porn in 3D?
Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and you can download it to your flashcard.
It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.
And it would not be difficult to do that.
I would say otherwise your biggest hope would be Netflix when it comes out if they start doing the 3D movies and then like Piranha 3D is going to be like your boobies in 3D or whatever else.
Well once they have it where you can say take video with your 3DS and stuff they'll find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and
Ta-da!
You know what I mean?
It'll be done.
But then again, I don't know.
It'd be hard to do 3D.
There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays, and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet, so I don't know.
It might be a while.
But boobies in 3D.
I mean, that's a great use of 3D.
But once again, though, that's just to get people in seats for, like, Piranha 3D.
I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's...
It is interesting.
I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and it's got a lot of gore in it.
That sounds awesome.
Alright, whatever.
You're part of the problem!
No, no, okay.
There is something I can't remember.
I'm trying to think if we're actually going to get into it tonight.
God, I had a Nintendo thing.
I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something
I have to refresh my memory while I was pissed off.
It's pretty good.
I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2 because I have to revisit that game every couple months.
My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is the very beginning when you're on the train.
play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm.
Which is the very scary, gory Resident Evil inspired.
I think the developers of Valve said that Resident Evil influenced that zone.
I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.
That's where I'm at right now.
I played some Warcraft 3.
The RTS from 2003.
I'm starting to use cheat codes now.
Just so I can see the story.
And uh
Wow, World of Warcraft.
That's about it.
When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?
Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.
If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.
Boy band or adult diaper?
Something like that?
I don't know.
I want to ruin the game for you guys.
It was great.
Laughed.
It's just a fun party game.
Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played You Don't Know Jack.
It called me an idiot to my face.
Yeah, that's right.
The game called you an idiot.
I forgot about that.
What was the question?
Something about...
Which one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Blarney Stone?
And it was like, the correct answer was the kiss from Spider-Man, because you're supposed to kiss the Blarney Stone upside down.
But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp, and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer goes, Yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Blarney Stone, idiot.
He ended up winning the round anyway.
Yeah, I took it home at the end.
We couldn't hear any follow-up because Grandpa Warcraft, who we were playing with, and I were laughing so loud we couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an idiot.
Great.
um otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade and every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that he's like why aren't you playing this on PC but I don't know I want the achievements don't judge me um and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade I once knew you know we've had a bunch of sad news about you know we had the Chinatown Arcade in New York City closed Arcade Infinity closed as far as I'm concerned Roseville Golf Land closed too that place is dead to me
I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.
He's gonna hear me fuss.
There's no Beatmania anymore.
There's no DJ Max Technica.
They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.
All they have is... DDR Disney.
Yeah, Disney and Max 2, and then the Drum Freaks guitar hero, which I'm not even into that anymore.
They have Guitar Freaks and Drum Freaks that beat the hell up, but they're there at least.
Yeah, they're beat.
but I'm just you know I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of I mean I would be cool if there were some fun fighting games no Capcom SNK to be found no Soul Calibur nothing it's they have an original Soul Calibur 2 where the hell was that it was hidden somewhere and they also have an SNK it's like um three different King of Fighters and then a Metal Slug one of those four-in-one boxes when I played that a couple months ago and I was last there I was
on the right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.
Yeah, this is sad.
The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because that is one racing game I do really like.
I'll play that.
They had Initial D5, which there's a lot of people really into that series.
I'm sure we're playing that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You know, like the Sega Rambo game.
That game is kind of fun.
Some dad swiped his card for his little girl.
She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun as big as she is playing Rambo.
She wasn't doing that well.
I was like, that is awesome.
You kill all those mercenaries.
You just, yeah.
You go ahead, girl.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Giovedea has a warning about the Blarney Stone.
Don't kiss the stone.
All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.
That's probably some good advice.
You know what?
I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle.
I've got video of my uncle doing it.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
No, not peeing on it.
Your uncle kissed pee.
He went for his honeymoon.
Oh, okay.
And kissed pee.
No.
Like Lady and the Tramp?
I don't think... I really don't think there's any way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.
You know what?
That's what boys like to do is pee on things.
So where there's a will, there's a pee.
Anyway, what else did I play this week otherwise?
That was... I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.
Oh!
Final Fantasy III on the iPhone came out this week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So if that ends up being the case of Final Fantasy 3, you can just move your thumb to the upper right and have your analog stick be there.
It's a very small little improvement that I really like.
The only tricky, touchy price is the price.
$15.99 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.
So it's a little high, but then you gotta... What a game is worth...
is really up in the air right now and this is where a lot of controversy comes in which you've heard about you know a game developers conference where Nintendo was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and sold 99 cents for a game and you know all this so I mean $15.99 yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game but at the same time
The quality is pretty great and you're getting a port or remake, whatever you want to call it, of a $35 DS game.
I mean, I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.
I mean, it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this if you're a Final Fantasy fan.
I mean, you already know if this game is for you or not.
Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.
But it looks beautiful, and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't really see for yourself.
The very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out the 4 remake as well, but at the same time, with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with the After Years.
So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.
What if they put it out with the remake and the After Years?
On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.
And even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like five years ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4.
So I'm probably not going to get that on the iPhone.
Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.
If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like $10 whenever the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.
So...
Anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.
So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.
Actually, it's just what you were talking about.
How Nintendo was poo-pooing on the developers and stuff like that.
The indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.
They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system.
Is their quote.
You know, people that... They want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers.
Just people that make games, I guess.
Because they don't want crappy games coming out on their system.
Yeah.
Excuse me!
Crappy games coming out of your system.
The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.
There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers and legitimate publishers.
I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there.
Somebody that, I don't know, might add some innovation to something instead of, say, licensing Jelly Belly or licensing Smiley Face.
The icon of the 60s, 70s?
Woo, that's current.
You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.
I don't think... See, once again, this kind of goes back to they don't understand...
The whole online business.
They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to the online thing, they're just lost.
It's like they just don't know what they're doing.
And it's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?
You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.
I mean, how do you not put virtual console stuff out there for $4, $5, $6, $7 and put it all out for $9?
I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just crazy amounts of games.
Well, the other thing, too, is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?
They have to buy the SDK, right?
I think so.
Well, actually, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit, because I think you can just download that.
Yes.
There is a license.
There is.
So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless of if the developers are making the money or not.
The only thing they have to worry about is if anything is going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.
I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have set up.
So, really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry about.
Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.
Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is it something they're going to do to make money?
It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with because Nintendo doesn't have to deal with the same clientele.
Here's the problem with Nintendo, and what they're worried about is the fact that they're a first-party developer as well.
I mean, they put out their own games.
Apple doesn't put out their own games.
They don't care.
And also, I mean, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.
They can put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.
There's so much garbage on there.
Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.
There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see what's garbage and what's not garbage.
So, they've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.
It's just they're not willing to embrace that.
It's tricky to say, too, where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super Meat Boy, and that was kind of a, I mean, I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer, but it was definitely in that middle ground.
I mean, it was basically two guys that made that whole game.
Despite maybe they had somebody else do the music and so forth.
But the core of the game was two guys.
And it's probably one of the best arcade games to have come out in the past year.
Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?
Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.
And I don't have a problem with that.
What if people want to buy fart apps?
That's fine.
You know what?
No one's going to say, oh, well, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.
Then you don't buy it, okay?
That's not a big deal.
Well, and the whole point, too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only really work on something like a phone.
Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.
Would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the Wii?
No?
Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring out your phone and do it.
Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.
Yeah.
But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer is do people like their games?
Because that's really the only difference to them.
Oh, two people developing out of a garage made a popular game.
Oh, well, they're an indie developer.
You know, large company makes fart app.
Oh, well, they're a garage developer.
That's really, I think, the only... That's their only excuse.
Yeah.
Really, it just comes down to that they're just not embracing what they need to be embracing.
The business model that's going to make them money.
Some interesting comments from chat room.
Blackwolf says, XNA indie games sold so well too.
Or wait.
I would say, though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft really advertised it at first.
Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the real arcade?
They do that.
Do they?
They do that, but it's so rare, though.
Because I know that Dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing.
It's a competition that they hold each year, and the top few games actually do get published as Xbox Live Arcade games.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.
People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store where you can say, okay, well, the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just crap, you know, I rated it one star.
It's, okay, this game is glitchy and it doesn't load or this game is broken or whatever.
The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.
It's a clunky way to find good games and it really screws over those developers who don't land in the top spots.
It's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.
That's my only thing with XNA.
There's so many games on there, I don't know where to begin.
And a lot of the top stuff is poop.
And a lot of people probably look at that and go, really?
If this is the top stuff on XNA?
Not all of it.
There's some good stuff that gets in there, but I don't know.
I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong.
And it's just the presentation of it all.
And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.
I get why they put it where they do.
But there's ways they could feature it better than they do.
You know what I mean?
But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony is going to try with PlayStation Suite.
And that is something that's on the horizon.
PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.
DarkSakura,
I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leads to Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make games.
And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny.
I'm going to download that.
But that's fine.
You don't have to download that.
And that's the thing Nintendo has to understand.
Even the stuff that they have people paying.
Seriously, they have the Major League Eating game.
I mean, come on.
I mean, come on.
Is that really Nintendo quality?
I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League Eating on our system.
Or like the Beer Pong game or something like that.
There's a lot of crap on there.
And the fact that they're just coming out saying, oh, well, we don't want these garage developers ruining our system.
I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.
Alright, well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news, but that's okay.
We're talking about games.
That's how we roll.
No, we haven't got the video, or the news.
We want to get to more of the news.
But that's okay.
Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.
Of course, you can always add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
That's how you can keep tabs with us online, or visit our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.
Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.
Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.
Let's get into some video game news for the week.
Loki, start us off.
Yummy, yummy, yummy news.
Now, this is kind of funny.
I kind of laughed a little bit, but it's not that big a deal, and I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.
Duke Nukem Forever, delayed.
It's only delayed a month, and that's not a big deal.
And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.
It was coming out in May.
Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.
Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A.
Noire, then there's Brink, and then Fear 3, and Hunted the Demon's Forge, Dungeon Siege 3, MX vs. ATV Alive.
I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.
Oh, LEGO, I mean, it's not really direct competition,
Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.
So, I mean... School's letting out, right?
So it's like school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.
But it's not typical that May's a busy month.
Usually June is a little bit busier, May's kind of eh, and then April's is dead, which April is still dead, but like last year they had a lot of good games come out in May and it kind of worked out for them, so they're kind of doing that again.
but it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June for them at least because June right now doesn't have much coming out it has a few AAA games and that's it I mean there's stuff that's not announced yet but very few games compared to May coming out so whatever it's a month it's not like 10 years now if it's delayed again and again and again and again then well you know there's not really anything we can say about that but did you watch the little video
I just watched the video, it was funny.
The video was funny.
Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know here.
You know, it was pretty funny.
Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.
But, you know, see, here's the thing.
I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in development only as long as Gearbox has had it.
Because I don't...
and DarkSakura.
And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.
I mean, they could have... It could have just, like, no one could have bought it.
They just said, eh, forget it, you know.
Duke Nukem's 10 years ago, who cares?
Right.
Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something, but... Oh, hell no, that wouldn't work.
Yeah, I know.
It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point, you just have to put it out.
Yes, I have an idea.
Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.
Bochikawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem forever if it wasn't delayed at least one more time.
And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.
And of course, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced.
Duke Match, Team Duke Match.
But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.
And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.
But the babe will sporadically freak out and you have to...
Bitch, please.
I don't want to be a widower at 33
Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?
Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.
I don't know.
Perhaps.
No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.
Come on, people.
I don't know.
Duke Nukem made me very happy.
I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.
I'm looking forward to this new one even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.
I'm going to be so, so very disappointed but I swear I don't care.
It's like
Death Race 3000 Death Race 2000
All right, well, moving on to something a little more artful.
Maybe you're familiar with a company called the Weinstein Company.
This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting into films when they left Miramax.
They went their separate ways, right?
And they actually put out or they distributed.
They don't.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Halloween, Hellraiser,
Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids, all of these would now fall under this possible TWC games label.
Because Spy Kids is frightening.
Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.
I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand they're what, James Bond for kids, right?
Pretty much?
It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.
There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became what, Lava Girl and Shark Boy?
And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.
He was Shark Boy.
Oh, really?
You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.
That kind of frightens me.
And it was the origin of Machete.
Oh, okay.
Well, that's okay.
Does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under Miramax?
They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.
Pulp Fiction was Miramax.
I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.
So where's my Kill Bill video game?
Maybe that could be a part of this.
I don't know.
It very well could be.
Very well could be.
Especially if they do a sequel, which they were talking about doing.
Yeah.
so that's it you know obviously no game announcements right now but they are exploring these brands in the video game universe I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense and yes I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago and you may remember I mean it's not unlike you know
Movie Studios to get into the game business.
Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.
Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot.
They don't do anything console-wise right now.
They like some online downloadable games, but Warner Games is a big one for sure.
And Disney.
Disney Interactive.
All right.
Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future.
But right now, nothing but an announcement.
And who knows?
Maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5 or 6 or 21.
Whatever.
Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.
Which I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies like Saw and all that stuff.
But to me, Scream is like...
I don't know, like, Scream is okay.
I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not, like, soft-sick.
I didn't mind the Scream movies, actually.
Yeah, Scream's cute.
I just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?
Showgirls.
Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.
I'll see those.
I just hope that Hayden Pantera is the before-the-credits killing.
No spoilers in chat, I will destroy you.
Alright, DarkSakura.
Well, speaking of kids, movies, and scary, Pokemons!
Yay!
Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold 2 million units in the first two weeks in the US.
And 5 million plus copies in Japan.
So, yeah, they've made their money.
7 million people playing the game.
Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.
Well, we were at Dimple, which is a local resale place, and they're saying that basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.
Oh, I'm sure.
Yeah, so... Kids eat this shit up.
How adults eat this stuff up, too.
Like, you know, Miklatov, who's been on this show in the past.
He was playing Black and White.
He imported it, and he got the regular ones.
But you know what?
Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?
Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.
Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.
Whatever I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old school black and white Game Boy.
You know what I mean?
Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.
Maybe black and white does something different that I haven't seen yet.
I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.
Oh, black and white, you can collect poop.
Oh, yay.
And their poop does special things.
Oh, hooray.
So, yeah.
Anyhow.
So, yeah.
I'll probably check that out eventually.
But you know there's going to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.
You know it.
Pokemon.
You know what?
I'm done with Pokemon.
I'm really done.
I would never say never because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?
Okay, that's different.
But I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.
Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.
I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.
There is sort of one that someone made called Pokefarm, like a website.
No, I mean official Reggie Fils-Aimé coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.
You know Nintendo wouldn't really do an MMO.
I have it tied to my harem of women down here.
You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.
If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.
it'd be something like Animal Crossing I think too a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs because Pokemon is so much for kids like you know it would be an MMO with predetermined phrases that you can say and you know it's it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO but that would be better than nothing but that's just me so
The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.
I read a list a couple days ago.
It was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game.
And it's like, this Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.
Cubone!
It was Cubone.
What?
Really?
This one is a soul of a dead child who comes back and eats other souls.
I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed and it's supposed to be like an alien thing but it's still like dude not cool you know this might be why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that maybe that hits a little close to home especially for kids anyhow let's move on more gaming news Loki
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.
So they're going to have some controller-free racing.
I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.
Like the U-Force?
I'd like to use Force or like Joyride.
They're saying it's going to support up to 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.
They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode.
A new career mode involving an automotive world tour.
They're going to increase the variety of challenges and events that you participate in.
The game is going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and shading models.
Also, I guess they're saying that...
Head Tracking
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9-1-1
Actdeft wanted to correct something saying it's not it's actually not called Ground Zero though it's called Relic Castle maybe it was something to do with the translation one of my friends was saying something but of course you know how rumors go
So, alright, fine, there you go.
A little correction issued there.
Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza... Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.
I don't know.
Head tracking.
I'm very interested to see...
That implemented more games.
I really think it's a good idea, and it's simple.
If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to be like, oh, casual.
Head tracking is all you've got to do, and you can even say, hey, look, it puts you in the game, and guess what?
You don't have to use the stupid Kinect stuff if you don't want to.
That's awesome.
I had the cement mixer one.
Peek-a-Peek.com
PICA-PIC.com if you want to check this out you can actually play a variety of the Game & Watch LCD games at least until this website gets shut down but really Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game & Watch games I don't know so yeah I'm on it right now I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here let's see what did I find here
Otto's Slalom.
That doesn't look like fun.
I want to play Mario Brothers or something.
Mary Cook.
Oh, I remember this one.
Good Times.
Oh, you can even move back and forth.
That's done very well.
Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S and K. So let me see if I can start.
Here we go.
Good Times.
Listen to the sounds of LCD games.
That's right.
This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.
Oh, it looks like it's Russian.
Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.
Anyhow, good times.
So check that out, pica-pic.com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain you for like five minutes.
Well, let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.
There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness of the romance in Dragon Age 2.
And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer and that
He didn't like that, you know, basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.
He's like, we are your demographic.
You need to cater to us.
You know, basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.
We play The Sims.
Yeah.
And it's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us male gamers were happy.
Now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you don't speak for me, I love Dragon Age 2.
But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.
He also uses commas very poorly.
So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of BioWare.
Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer, we know you don't.
I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight male gamers out there.
and basically saying you know I'll read a few lines here and there it says the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer they're for everyone we have a lot of fans many of whom are neither straight nor male and they deserve no less attention we have good numbers after all on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of content in DAO and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea that the numbers are not insignificant
and basically going on you know it's basically saying yeah we don't care you're you need to get your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world and there's one paragraph if you don't mind me reading it go ahead that is like the most awesome thing and I think it applies to the world in general and I think everyone needs to take this to heart and
and if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility it has to do with privilege you can write it off as political correctness if you wish but the truth is that privilege always lies with the majority they're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance they don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them what's everyone's fuss all about that's the way it should be anybody else should get used to not getting what they want
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.
And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.
I mean, this is an insanely popular series with women.
Tiara is a big fan.
Oh yeah.
I mean, I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.
And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.
I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.
I also don't understand where this dude is coming from.
Have you ever watched an episode of Will & Grace?
Did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out?
You know what I mean?
Even if there really wasn't an option, a good game is still a good game.
A good story is a good story.
It's kind of like, what's your big...
And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I'd say homocentric, is there's got to be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well, this makes me uncomfortable.
And it's got to be personal insecurity, I think.
Yeah.
My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play him with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the male NPCs that you could do a same-sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit.
The way that the game is set up is to where...
You can tell, okay, well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.
I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility, even if it's not something that they would RP into the game themselves.
Like, they basically, if there is a same-sex option, they want it buried so deep that you have to go to GameFAQs and look up how to do it.
They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game, because they don't like it.
and you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.
It doesn't matter.
They're gonna have to get used to, you know, things are gonna happen in life that you're not comfortable with.
DarkSakura.com
and I have to play through all these games that have straight storylines.
Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these games?
No, because they're stories.
And like, for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.
Like, I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time.
was so emotionally moving.
Was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?
No.
A good story is a good story.
You know what I mean?
I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.
You think about this.
When you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.
And if it's in your character's nature to flirt with a girl, then you stay within your character's nature.
If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.
If they are completely...
Say you're playing the most uptight paladin, they're supposed to get uncomfortable whenever anyone flirts with them.
That's the type of thing.
You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing if it's immersive enough of a game.
And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.
I don't know.
But the whole point of view, the whole thing is that you are in-game as your character.
Unless it's saying you are you in the game,
But no, you're playing this person that's living in this life at this time.
I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable show a little bit of interest?
It's just ridiculous.
Bro Dude needs to get over it.
And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.
B, if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're forced to watch anal sex, okay?
I mean, let's be real.
It's a fade.
It's artful and, you know, whatever.
It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters you're not comfortable with, but there's no game that's tacky like that.
at all.
Is that maybe the guy game?
How many years ago was that?
I was a little upset, though, that she didn't look pregnant.
That's true.
D'Artagnan in our chatroom says, my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.
There you go.
In Final Fantasy X2, they made Lulu a stay-at-home mom.
Totally destroyed her form.
Oh, X2, that's right.
All right, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates.
Some games coming out soon to Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.
Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming out today, because, well, that's today and not next week.
Some other cool stuff, though, that will be coming our way, WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PSP.
If you're looking for an arcade-style WWE game, kind of reminds me of stuff that they had way back on, like,
Super Nintendo NES Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360 Of course, to tie in with the new movie, Hop on Nintendo DS Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii
Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition that's coming out on PSP as well.
Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
NASCAR 11 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Country Dance.
Taking the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it.
Of course, it's not actually by Ubisoft.
It's kind of a knockoff, but same type of thing.
And that will be on the Wii.
Pinkalicious, based off of some children's book.
That's on Nintendo DS.
Zuzu Puppies.
Yes, it's not hamsters anymore.
It's just animals.
So now that's coming out on Nintendo DS.
And...
and that would be it again the chat's delayed a little bit but I have to read this comment from chat because I love it so much before I get to the Japanese release dates Bochikawa in our chatroom says if it's a choice it's a choice in a game you've got another choice don't play the game
Well said, my friend.
Alright, on to Japanese release dates and what's coming out in Japan very soon.
On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 as well as a game called Nailed.
No, that is not a sexual connotation.
It actually looks like an ATV racing game.
I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah.
They nailed it.
Top Spin 4.
The, uh...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That controversial at all.
Also, moving on to releases on the PlayStation 3.
Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Topspin 4 there as well.
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
Nothing, because things have dried up there a little bit.
On the 3DS, March 31st, you have to look forward to BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imekai Sakyou Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4-themed stuff.
You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?
You got it.
So forth.
Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here because sadly there's like nothing really coming out on the 360 or the PS3.
But granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now, I'm sure some things kind of got moved around.
So, you know.
Lastly, on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift 2 is out there as well.
And, and, and, Oni Chambara Special.
Yeah.
March 31st.
Let's move on to Europe.
Well, not a whole bunch.
It's a short list.
On the 30th, we have Islands of Wakfu and Strania the Stella Machine.
I guess Machina.
That makes me think of your cat.
The Stellamachina.
The Stellamachina.
She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.
No.
She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.
So I've seen.
And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow, Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse.
Which, as Loki would have us believe, is awesome.
It is very awesome.
Is it like, awesome?
Yes, it is.
It's awesome, apparently.
It is that awesome.
Alright, let's move on with some more news.
We're just a little ways away from the classic game of the week.
Real good one this week, too.
One that I think a lot of you have played.
But we'll get there after a couple more news stories.
Ah, yes.
So, this is always fun.
Sony, and I don't even really know if this is a big deal, but I guess they're transferring the online service operations to a new division of their company, I guess.
The Sony Network Entertainment Inc.
instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and that kind of stuff.
I don't know.
Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.
It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like
I don't know, the people that run Ragnarok online or something like that.
Although that would be quite funny.
I love Ragnarok.
A lot of people are covering this.
The change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into a new terms of service.
Blah, blah, blah.
So what?
So they're changing the name of
That division.
It's more of like a consolidation thing.
It really doesn't seem like a big deal.
I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot of our listeners do.
I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always gives us the PSN updates and all that.
It's consolidating with the one on the PlayStation 3.
And that sounds like a good thing.
It's probably all moving towards something more unified for PC.
The NGP or whatever they ultimately call that thing And honestly if Microsoft does it with the Zune points I guess the Zune isn't around anymore But you know what I mean The points for Microsoft on the 360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune Or on your PC through Windows Media It's just competitive or whatever It's no big deal really
I don't know.
But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.
I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.
No, it's not.
It's just whatever.
They're changing something.
They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.
They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account or
Hey, be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.
a Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega if you want to see more information on that go to their blogs blogs.sega.com a Yakuza track jacket there's a lot of a Dreamcast bag there's like I'm sure tons of stuff in here where DarkSakura would be like what?
or she's like I have four of those already
Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3.
I know she doesn't have that.
Or Virtua Tennis sweatbands.
I don't think I've seen those before.
But how about an OutRun art signed by Yu Suzuki?
I bet Dan would be all over that.
I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.
All right.
But still, it's for Japan relief.
I know.
So, you know, it is a good cause.
It's a good cause.
It's a great cause.
Also, going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.
It's something that's on Facebook right now and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.
What is it?
It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.
It's going to be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed to be on TV.
DarkSakura.com
and that's a whole special thing.
All for a great cause.
So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty good.
Even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually sounds like an interesting special.
And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.
So very cool.
I kind of...
it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming industry to like a telethon type thing like you remember when another big tragedy happened Katrina and George Clooney put together all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief this kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a you know different type of tragedy so kind of neat definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds I think it's a good idea
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
Classic game of the week is Darkstalkers which in Japan was known as Vampire and in Europe as Vampire Hunter
Ooh, there was a trilogy of these.
Fantastic, super fun, and one of my favorite games ever.
I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before, where we had the World Cup Soccer and Killer Instinct.
Well, this was another game that we had.
And there was this one guy who was super epically awesome at this game, and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did, and I felt so accomplished.
Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors, Vampire Savior
And then there was a Vampire Hunter 2 and a Vampire Savior 2.
They were sort of upgraded versions.
And then the re-releases which came out later.
So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this particular universe and hunters.
But you've got your vampires, you have your ghosts, your demon possessions, your zombies.
The characters in the game, there was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbane, who was the werewolf, Victor von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was the succubus, Anakaris, who was a mummy, Felicia, the catwoman, Bishamon, who was this possessed samurai armor.
You had Rikuo, who was the fishman, and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch!
What a shock!
And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot, like an ancient Aztec robot, and Pyron, who was this flame guy.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors
Super, super awesome game.
It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the U.S.
And of course the Japanese version was the same because, I mean, the Saturn had more memory for it.
It was really cool.
So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jedha, who was totally my character for a while.
And Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.
And QB, who was always fun.
And Baby Bonnie Hood.
Which, she actually had a better name in Japan, it was Boletta.
She was super fun to use.
And I love her ending, because it's like, this monster family watching TV.
There's been this massacre!
Never will watch out for a human person!
They're like, oh, these humans are so scary!
Keep us safe, daddy!
I'll protect you, son!
And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and everything.
Anyway.
Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.
And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4Meg RAM cartridge.
Got this one too.
And so it was fully arcade perfect.
It was fantastic.
And you could...
Play as, uh, there was all kinds of different, you know, bonus characters in it.
You had, uh, Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.
Um, Shadow basically was, you could assume the identity of the defeated character in there.
And then, um, so like, if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan.
That type of thing.
Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2
I think that they redid some of the sprites for it too if I'm correct and you also had Bishamon and Shadows of Secret Characters and you had Marionette that were basically mirror matches and then there were the re-releases there was Vampire Chronicle which was the one that came out on Dreamcast it was a Dreamcast direct mail order and I believe I have that one too pretty sure I do
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
There were manga, different comics that came out.
And then there was DarkSakura's graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards and concept art.
But that was put out by Udon.
And Udon is fantastic in their Capcom-related art.
I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.
They are amazing artists.
Just their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.
And then...
In Love Hina, actually, the main female characters were wearing the costumes of Beletta, Sienko, and Felicia for Halloween in Chapter 86 of the manga.
And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia, and Sienko.
This is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.
UGO ranked it as number 19, and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Darkstalkers coming out.
That would be awesome.
I don't know how founded that is, but... Well, here's a comment from SSJ100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.
I remember the MVC3 panel at New York Comic Con.
Someone asked the devs if they would consider making a Darkstalker sequel or remake.
Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting it.
Get on it!
Well, you know what, imagine, okay, look how well Street Fighter 4 did.
Look how well Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.
It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Darkstalkers game.
You know, bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then, you know, throw in some new ones.
You've got all kinds of, you know, supernatural mythos out there.
There's that Street Fighter cross-teching game, though, still on the way that I think has gone to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.
Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.
True, true.
That's the classic game.
Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic.
Oh, I forgot another.
Darkstalkers, what's that?
Another hidden character.
D. Which was the fully, you know, Donovan was half Darkstalker.
Well, there was the version of him that was all evil and vampire-y.
And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following around with him, only she's older.
But it fades out and that's his ending.
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Darkstalkers from the arcade by Capcom, and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Darkstalkers is definitely not forgotten.
Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com slash olr
Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news.
Then we'll get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of the Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.
We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
3DS Launch, BioWare, Forza, etc.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and uh it's basically comics I do this with Tiara who's you've heard on the show she's hosted before Mar and Marvel and also with um Dan Shadow and we basically discuss comics but we had a special guest to um for our recording today which you can hear on Tuesday downloaded from uh infamous.net n-f-a-m-o-u-s.net
Todd Stashwick
He played Dracula.
That was cool.
Like a black and white Dracula.
It was really cool.
He could have been a character in Darkstalkers.
But he's such a great guy.
Really fun to talk to and geeked it up with us this morning.
So it was really cool.
Awesome.
But read Devil Inside.
Seriously, it's good.
Like anyone could get into this.
It's so good.
Well, the side project I have, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week, but we did have a pretty exciting guest.
If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, or the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
Now with a website, HordeHouse.com.
Finally, we have an official website for the show.
So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and X for talking about it.
And this week we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle Madison from Video Game Outsiders and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network, joined us.
And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.
Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Xtfer and I. And I was really worried that Xtfer was going to make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time.
She really played along with it.
and Michelle had a book come out and congrats to her she is you may not know this but she does the whole her and her sister are behind the damn you autocorrect that is them and they've had a lot of success of that and just had a book come out so please support Michelle and buy that book I think that's great and other great podcasts on the all games network again hoardhouse.com even if you don't like wow apparently I had my buddy Brad from pod culture said I
GameStop was handing out free trial discs.
For a while.
It's kind of neat.
Anyways, so actual rapid fire news though.
Some pretty cool stuff.
Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstorm Apocalypse.
Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end.
And that would be in the UK, where it's gotten a release date, March 31st.
So you won't have to wait very long actually to play the game.
Um...
and you know if you really die in the play of the game and you're not in the UK it is region free so import away but let me really just give it a couple more weeks but it is really awesome so you should really pick it up um
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and it'll begin the game's, they're calling it the British Invasion and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship and he invites the players back to his homeland where you can create farms there.
Wait, wait, do you hear that?
Wait, do you hear it?
Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.
Farmville News, Loki, what did you expect me to say?
My mother cares.
Don't tell her.
After a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.
Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed.
It is still in beta.
You might as well have left it offline because it would have been doing people more of a favor than actually letting them play the game.
You're terrible, but accurate.
Apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were taking them offline to conserve power in Japan.
They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.
Square Enix is cooking in the dark for benefit of you all to bring the servers back online.
Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.
No, I know.
But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.
It might be a little warm.
Crack a window.
Alright, moving on to other MMOs.
This is a free one online that's pretty popular.
Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later this year.
If you've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO.
And it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, it looks like an old school SNES type of little game.
XBOX LIVE ARCADE 1
it won't be free to play it's actually going to cost money and this is the other weird thing it might not really be an MMO either because they came out and said and this is from a Microsoft representative it's not a freemium MMORPG it's with online multiplayer features so I don't know set the expectation bar a little low but I don't know it could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade we'll see
Back to the Future Games
And one more story for you guys.
The NPD put out a press release this week.
Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?
Imagine Babies.
No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or maybe it was Call of Duty.
Those games sell like crazy.
Actually...
And they're canceling the series?
3 was the peak.
It went really downhill fast from there.
3 came out concurrently with Rock Band, which, by the way, was number 5 on the list.
Wasn't 3 the guitar hero that had a million different skews?
The different combinations of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.
Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.
That's when it got really bad.
The band hero.
The three was just guitar, not guitar.
It wasn't necessarily... It was just like any of the other Guitar Hero games.
Well, prior to that, any of the other Guitar Hero games.
It's when they got to, well actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because it was just like rock band.
It was game, guitar game, band.
Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of, too.
I noticed that when I was playing the machine.
I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week.
Probably not worth it.
No, it really wasn't, because I failed the song, which pissed me off, because the guitar was broken, and one of the buttons didn't work right.
What a surprise!
Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Line if it's not broken.
All right.
Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.
Dark Sakura.
Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.
Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.
That will have a 900 point price tag.
It's one of my favorite RPGs.
I've actually got an original of this too.
Nothing about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.
Hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.
Precisely.
And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.
There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.
It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.
Don't you want somebody to love?
Yeah.
And Santana's Black Magic Woman, which imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.
Imagine that in pro.
Wouldn't that be crazy?
and then Dragon Force, Through the Fire and the Flames and Operation Ground and Pound.
So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.
Kind of ironic we just had a story about Guitar Hero because that was one of the most memorable songs from that series.
But Rock Band is awesome.
And from 3, I think.
Wasn't it?
I think so.
At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii Points for the standard Rock Packs, 160 points, and the Days of Peace Pack will actually be 550 Wii Points or 440 Microsoft Points.
And then Through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have Pro Guitar and Pro Bass Mode.
And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii Points or 80 Microsoft Points.
and last but never least we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition and he's on fire he's burning up and he's got some bad red eye problems so he's gonna need some Visine he's burning for you and the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website so
Definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're officially there.
And the profile is there.
And I will post that into the chat room.
So what exactly does Evil Ryu do?
Well, technically he... Evil things.
Technically... He kicks puppies.
He's Satsui no Hado Ryu.
Because I guess Akuma is always given to your fighting spirit.
Okay.
Join the dark side.
If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Gouki.
I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back and it's all torn and he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.
Whose oni is that?
Evil, evil Gouki?
I think that would be...
It's evil-er!
Give it to your evil evil.
There's voice samples on there too.
Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.
I'm going to post this in the chat room.
Fun little soundboard to play with there.
Let's go to the Twitter!
Twitter.com slash OLR and every week we like to read your tweets.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Let's look at some tweets.
Some interesting tweets from 13xForever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.
Now, before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment.
It was a point-and-click adventure computer game.
It was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.
It was supposed to be, I think, after Warcraft 2.
It was going to be fourth quarter 97.
So that would have been a little bit before StarCraft, kind of in that era.
So this was like an old game.
But randomly, these YouTubes went up that we got linked to.
So I'll just kind of take a quick peek at how this played out.
So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and those types of games.
Oh, the art in this looks pretty cool.
Looks more Scum Engine, but yeah, it's within the Scum Engine, LucasArts, King's Quest vein, that style of gameplay.
Actually, the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me.
Kind of that really, like, very jerky motion cell animation stuff.
It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking cancelled, you know what I mean?
Oh, there's a trailer here for this game, actually.
Let me click on this.
And take a look at this real quick.
This is an old school trailer from, like, 97.
Let me just take a peek at this.
What could have been, but is not.
Let's see, pass the logo.
Come on, people.
Three great wars between the Human Alliance and the Orcish invaders have laid waste to the once proud realms of Azeroth.
22 years have passed since Blackmoor found the young Orcling.
Secretly raising the Orkling within the confines of his prison fortress, Durnold, Blackmoor planned to mold the Orkling into the perfect warrior.
A warrior conditioned to human thinking.
See, this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from what it's supposed to be.
I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off into the novels so if you're a lore nerd like I am read the books and you'll get all the story from that game
DarkTetsuya sends us a link greetings true believers I got your first WonderCon scoop right here about a new Spider-Man game in the works DarkTetsuya very excited because he's going to WonderCon and promises to bring back lots of stories for OLR but I guess there is a new Spider-Man game that's supposed to be shown at WonderCon yeah that's as they're saying Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision Spider-Man panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spider-Man game is check that out
Henderson Mann tweets us at Twitter.com slash OLR.
How do you think the iPhone has hurt sales of 3DS?
I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.
The guy told me I was the only one who even asked.
Should Nintendo be worried?
I would say no, mostly because it's still early.
And there hasn't been a lot of, like, there haven't been commercials.
They went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.
There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing, though.
I mean, unless you're really gung-ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind of like, ooh, I gotta have that.
There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good.
And there's a lot of blogs covering all that stuff and saying, hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs, but don't.
It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top.
And yes, as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.
And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on Twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305.
This is a tweet about Mortal Kombat download characters.
I guess those were announced just recently.
I'm actually very excited.
One of my favorite characters from the series who came out later in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content.
Kenshi, that was the blindfolded, he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters.
And a character called Scarlet.
Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist.
She's kind of in that Ermac.
Noob Saboit and Rain
I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs. Sanrio.
That's the license that I'll play.
Kidiality.
Bad Bats and Roaches.
I would think Cutality.
Huh?
Cutality.
Friendship?
Friendship?
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
Sorry to make you put down the 3DS, Loki, but...
All right.
So this is kind of neat.
Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of both Resident Evil 4 and Code Veronica.
And they're coming over here as some download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.
No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the souped-up visuals, but...
people love their Resident Evil 4 and I know even the Wii version with just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular so I could see this doing pretty well and you know it's kind of the whole HD remake thing has really been popular lately so not surprised to see it happen alright wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?
Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being talked about as well.
They revealed it in the official Xbox magazine.
They haven't really said what's going to take place.
They are saying that you can change the history of Resident Evil.
I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.
So it's interesting.
I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.
Hmm.
I don't know.
It sounds interesting.
Not really a series I follow too well.
I don't know.
I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.
Yeah, I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.
All right.
Xbox Live Arcade
Oh yeah, well, there was supposed to be one on the 3DS.
And Bomberman, which would have been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff.
But yeah, apparently it is not going to happen.
Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no, no, no, that's not true.
But those are the rumors going around right now.
Apparently, Konami went out and told Wired that...
The announcement didn't come from us, so it's not true.
We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.
Now, the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all this stuff.
I mean, they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little bit of controversy going on.
I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved.
New development house.
Either way...
You're not seeing them anytime soon.
I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman wouldn't happen.
Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's gotta happen at some point.
It's probably just not gonna happen as soon as you'd like.
We'll see, though.
Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over, Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be
more than one game announced at E3 so the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5 maybe another Zone of the Enders could be anything wouldn't it be cool if there was another Snatcher?
no hey, you never know you never know so anything could happen what would you like to see?
Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.
What would I like to see?
I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.
From Kojima, anyways, probably that.
Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.
I would be down with maybe like a metal... I don't know.
I want to see something new come out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid or Acid.
It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.
I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.
I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.
Alright.
Could you imagine that?
I thought he was supposedly ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening there with that.
I don't remember.
Alright.
Let's move on with some more news.
Loki.
Ah, yes.
This is kind of neat.
I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff, really.
It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or...
Really offensive stuff.
ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half-Life 2 and whatnot.
They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.
It's basically, yeah, School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.
Now who would find that offensive?
I know.
I don't understand.
That doesn't make any sense to me.
But apparently, I guess, the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.
Yeah.
I can't imagine why they would remove something just so harmless.
I know, right?
Really?
Why would someone even make that?
Just knowing what... I mean, well, I know why someone would make that.
Someone made that to basically troll because they could, right?
I mean, that's why you make this.
To say like, look what I made.
It's really controversial and I shouldn't be making a game like this, but I did.
Yes, apparently, I guess, they're saying, you know, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer run site, the confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.
And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well.
And it says...
I guess they have the boring effect that someone took from that Bulletstorm Duty Calls viral game thing that they put in there.
I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.
Really, that's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.
Only a matter of time.
Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they were playing school shooter.
Oh my god.
How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game School Shooter by Valve?
Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban, but they also get Half-Life 2 ban, and that's when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off.
And the game turns you gay.
It turns you gay.
So very gay.
ah all right enough about that silly mods although I have to admit I probably would play it once just just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment all right it's probably dumb I mean well probably a terrible terrible game
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and you now have three people battling for it there's Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie The King of Kong and then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who as we reported last week is going to have his own movie now coming out all this stuff well the three of them were in the same building at this Kong-Off so that's pretty cool so who ended up winning?
Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong-Off and second place Steve Wiebe seventh place Billy Mitchell
Oh, I would have loved to see the look on his face.
But you are talking about 10 like godly Donkey Kong players.
And it's so funny how this game is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.
I wonder if the guy I think he like beat the top score of Missile Command and he plays with his feet.
Seriously.
Is that Captain Awesome?
They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his feet.
That's awesome.
SX in our chatroom says, Kong off?
Sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.
No, no, it's nothing like that.
But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing their Donkey Kong.
I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.
Stop it, Loki.
Stop it.
Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.
I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.
They've made these, like, special flyers that say the Kong off.
I mean, these dudes, like, love Donkey Kong.
I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.
I have to give kudos for that.
I mean...
If you're gonna go in, go all in, right?
On this classic stuff, so there's big love for Kong.
Alright, there's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called Listless!
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do with the 3DS launch.
So here it is.
The list list tonight.
Fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant buy.
I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because, you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is it's kind of a lackluster launch title.
Launch titles.
So folks are saying, maybe there's some games you should wait for.
Well, tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch titles would have made the system an instant buy.
Alright, here we go to list list.
And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for the list because...
If one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually turn to chat to help us round out the list.
So who wants to start tonight?
I guess we'll go with DarkSakura.
DarkSakura, you want to start us off tonight.
What is the number three item on your list?
Well, it's not a game.
It's an item.
That's fine.
It's a launch title.
It doesn't mean launch game.
A lenticular photo printer.
And what would the lenticular photo printer do?
It would print up your images in 3D.
Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.
So kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D.
Yeah.
Okay.
I can roll with that.
So it would print one layer, print a second layer.
It'd be huge probably, but I still think it would be neat to have something like that.
I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my wang that I would take.
SalaciousPop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.
The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.
Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.
I'd buy that.
And how exactly would Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster work?
Double physics in 3D.
And you shoot aliens.
And you get grease from your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.
You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.
Brings a whole new meaning to Screw Attack.
Alright.
F-Zero 3DS
Loki, what's your number three answer?
Well, this is more of a serious route.
I swear that this is in development, because I thought I saw some sort of screenshots or something like this.
But Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.
Excite Truck is awesome.
None of this Excite Bots bullshit, though.
Excite Truck.
and Sight Truck.
Hell, you don't even have to do anything different.
Put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks, everything.
Although, I would like it if you did something, but if you don't have to, then fuck it.
Alright, so far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and Excite Truck 3DS.
DarkSakura, what's your number two?
Planet Harrier.
I love this game.
I have only gotten to play it a few times.
There's been no home version released.
Don't you think it would be about time for something like that to come on 3DS?
It's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.
I can see a lot of those old school Sega shooters and I think of 3D World Runner from the NES.
but those the sort of first person not kind of first person but those those perspective games would be perfect for that type of screen okay so I'm with you my vote is Planet Harriers all right Salacious Pop your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today Zelda 8-bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition
What exactly is Zelda 8-bit 3DS?
I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo Edition?
Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames to make the 3D.
They make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have to lay down.
Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image or something.
They have that already.
It's called Ridge Racer.
Game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.
I'm going to say Breasts 3D.
All it would be would be pictures of breasts in 3D.
and I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that because who doesn't love boobs gay or straight or whatever you are does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it it has the little bead that it can tell so you can shake it it would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again you could motorboat the boobs if you want but it's not just restricted to Samus Aran I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster but I want to see just boobs
Little Boobs, Big Boobs, Lopsided Boobs
Boobs, fake boobs, real boobs.
You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up to a person.
That would be a perfect mode.
It would actually use the whole camera on the back side for those virtual reality type simulations.
If I point the camera at Jamie, just suddenly random boobs will show up.
She's frowning.
She's making frowny faces.
Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing.
Thank you.
My boobs are epic.
All right, Loki, your number two pick.
Launch title for the 3DS that would have made you buy one today.
Just what you said made me forget.
It is... Oh, yes, of course.
Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.
That would be so amazing.
I can take Earth Defense Force with me.
Since the PSP version is not yet announced, come over here.
DarkSakura, The New Guardian Legend
Duh, it's my list.
The new Guardia legend.
In 3D.
In 3D.
Because remember you had Guardic and you had Guardia.
So I guess the Japanese name of this would be Shingardia.
I don't care what the fuck they call it, just put it out already.
I know, right?
Damn it, Nintendo, or Compile.
Put out!
I realize Compile needs to reform somehow, but just do it.
Reform and put out.
Alright.
Thank you.
Please put out.
XOXO.
Salacious Pop number one, you need it.
You need it now on the 3DS.
Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer.
And how exactly would Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer work?
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
And it has a built-in calendar.
Days of the week.
Did I break Rob?
Is he upset?
No, I'm just regretting some things.
All right.
I'm kidding.
All right, let's move on.
Number one answer from me.
The 3DS game we most need to see.
What do they call that, the virtual reality?
I'm calling it wrong.
What's it really supposed to be called?
Like the face blaster?
What is that?
Augmentative reality.
Thank you, augmentative reality.
I have the augmentative reality game for you, and I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.
Augmentative reality...
Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS that's right you can go to Golfland and just you know suddenly the little kids there celebrating their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts you know it's Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS alright Loki number one game you most need to see on the 3DS
An actual innovative game from Nintendo.
you know something that perhaps is not you know funny I don't think this is actually a launch title but just a description an actual innovative game from Nintendo you know like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that they put out like you know like for example Animal Crossing it's been the same for a while now and you know even some of the other like you know they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games they're just oh now they're in 3D I mean come on
This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?
Wii Music.
No, Wii Fit.
I would say Wii Fit.
What about WooHoo Island?
Dead Island, Dead Island
It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that void.
Alright, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
Alright, here we go.
Here's the list as it stands right now.
Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,
Zelda 8-bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition, Breasts 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, Rebecca Black's Preteen Convertible Off-Road Racer, Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS, and Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.
We're going to start with DarkSakura, but for now, let me read some of the suggestions you guys had in the chatroom.
Actdeft suggested Furry vs. Cosplayers 3DS.
SSJ100Matt suggested IHOP Restaurant Fighter 3DS.
Tigerclaw said DDR 3DS.
Whoa, hold on.
Stop, stop.
What?
IHOP Restaurant Fighter?
Now, would that be the actual restaurants fighting?
Because that could be very cool.
No, actually, in my mind, it's Denny's.
Like, go on YouTube and Google, like, Denny's Fight Oakland.
That's great.
The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes.
Amazing.
Sjo900Matt says, Killer Instincts 3DS.
Raydeer in chat says, Rob's Ass 3DS.
Hey!
Let's see.
AkumaJP says, 3D Cat Ball.
You know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer.
SG-100 Matt says Match Game 3DS DJ Blaziken says Space Channel 5 3D SG-100 Matt says Betty White Simulator 3DS What, you'd just be badass the whole time?
Is that what that is?
Actdeft says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR technology I am surprised That sounds like an announcement to E3 right there
and DarkTetsuya said Gals Panic 3D.
Alright, those were the runners-up, but let's get back to the list.
Unfortunately, it's just the way the game works.
These are all amazing answers, but unfortunately, the way the game works, things have to go.
It's part of the process.
So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
First of all, you need an apostrophe and blacks.
Um, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrate and Vertigo Edition because I have a Virtual Boy.
And the game's pretty much already out as Ridge Racer.
Alright.
Touche.
Sorry, Alan, it has been stricken from the list.
Salacious Pop, your chance for revenge, or you could go for something else.
Which of these items is not worthy of the list?
The Golf Land Birthday Party.
Oh, you're killing me!
Why are you taking that off the list?
Well, there's serious answers and there's my smart-ass answers and I can't take down one of mine, so... Alright, there you go.
It is removed from the list, much to the sadness of the chatroom.
My turn to strike one from the list.
I'm sorry to do this, but Loki, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it.
Alright, so Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
Lenticular Photo Printer.
Thanks for watching!
So here you go.
Here is what you guys in the chat can vote on.
I'm going to read this list one more time.
You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers.
You got to message me those.
You need to mark them as number one or number two, or I will assume that the one you named first is your number one and the one you named second is your number two.
By the way, you're getting booze in the chat room for taking off the offline party.
What's your handle in chat this week?
Is it?
It's Sky.
Okay, got it back.
All right.
Alright, yes, I got it back.
So send a private message to Sky with your number one and number two votes.
Here is the list that you can vote on right now.
Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier, Breasts 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's Pre-Teen Convertible Off-Road Racer.
I can't believe that made it through.
Alright.
I would play that.
I would play as the girl in the braces.
Yeah, I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.
So yeah, that's going to do it.
Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.
Place your votes.
And we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.
For now though, we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It was looking really thin this morning, so I put a call out on Twitter.
Did it work?
Did we get some emails?
We have two.
That's better than zero.
Alright.
But not better than F-Zero.
F-Zero is awesome.
This first one comes from Robaba.
I'm surprised that Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on American TV.
If you've ever seen them, it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager talking about the things they use their PCs for.
Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.
Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.
Yeah, your favorite.
Yeah.
And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.
That sounds like what autocorrect would do.
I know.
Yesterday was great, especially the second round of Laser Tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.
It was the last 10 to 30 seconds.
I was on the high rise and these three little kids just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off one by one in 1.5 seconds, enacting a triple kill.
Nice.
It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp, most of them being from preschool to fourth grade fun times.
Punctuate!
The sad parts of my experience was when I went down, there was no Beatmania 2DX.
I know what 2DX is, person.
And Parapara's second mix game would be, and it was nowhere to be found.
So that they sold it in their place was a faded screen Daytona USA and a four-player Mario Kart.
I shouted in my head, WTF, first Keyboard Mania, then Pop Music, now Parapara, then Guitar Freaks, now Beatmania, fuck you!
That's my translation of the all caps.
This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play except Drum Mania V3, DDR Max 2, 6th Mix and Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix and In The Group 2.
if only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones like DJ Max Technica and Jubit and dare I say it, Gulp Pump It Up Pro maybe then maybe they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.
Peace out DJ Blaziken.
P.S.
if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced to buy an import.
P.S.
too just to play all the good music games
There isn't an arcade like AI anymore.
I hate to say it.
It was AI.
An AI RIP.
Yeah.
All right.
If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
I put the last call out for listless votes, so hopefully we're going to tally those up.
But not before we do some angst.
Grr.
Arg.
Angst time.
FU's of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum so I'm gonna say FU to gluten and meat
Neither of them agree with me, no matter how tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is.
So I'm telling them goodbye for a while.
Goodbye.
I will sort of miss you, but my stomach won't.
Done.
Loki!
It just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow.
Or when they're merging lanes.
I love these people that are just like, oh, I'm going to cut in and out lanes.
I have my right turn signal on, but I'm just going to assume that one turn signal on means I can go any way I want.
So, fuck you, the bad drivers.
My FU of the week.
Actually, I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately.
I can't complain too much.
But I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday.
Oh my god, that was so terrible.
Yeah, that was bad.
And my tooth still kind of hurts a little bit.
So FU to pain.
Even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of.
So I'm pretty great.
So F you to paint.
It's not really that angsty, I guess, but just F you to having only two weeks to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do.
But it's still a good thing, so.
Nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated.
All right.
Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.
Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will reveal tonight's list list, definitive list, and we will get to the Skype line in just a little bit.
But for now, a couple quick stories.
Loki.
The Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy
Thanks for watching!
it's neat I guess I think the I want to say that the games at least the Prince of Persia ones are already on the Playstation Network they're $15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving $5 apparently also the Splinter Cell games are going to be available on the Playstation Network as well I'm assuming for probably around the same price $15 each $40 for the compilation if you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so save $5
All right.
Well, would you like to be able to play more games on the Mac?
Well, maybe you can get a thing called Boxer.
This isn't like Boxers versus Briefs or anything.
This is actually Boxer.
It's a DOS box for the Mac.
That's right.
I did a little joke there.
This will allow you to play old PC games on the Mac.
But you know what?
All joking aside, this is pretty cool.
DOSBox, of course, was an old emulator that will make playing games from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines.
Boxer is kind of this redone for Apple computers.
The Mac series, of course.
And what I like about it is they've kind of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit.
Like you can see XCOM in there, although it's just the demo.
But Doom 2 is playable in this, which is pretty cool.
So if you own a Mac, I would be checking this out.
BoxerApp.com
DarkSakura.com is where you can go to check out the Boxer emulator for your old school DOS fix.
And this doesn't come with any games, right?
You have to install your own.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in.
Like I see Doom 2, it's probably the freeware one.
And then Underworld, the demo, Ultima Underworld, probably just boxed with some of those.
you can though for the record play PC games on a Mac you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels I think it's called but I think what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important because some of the old DOS games you try to play them on a PC now it's like crazy you can't do it
because you know the first computer I ever had PC was a 16 megahertz computer and it was blazing fast and you know I used to play games like X-Men on it and like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what do computers go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the winner
So here it is, tonight's definitive list.
No arguing, folks.
It's a done deal.
This is a very scientific process.
The launch title that would have made you get a 3DS.
Number three, Breasts 3D.
That's right, the game with boobs, boobs, and more boobs.
I already have that game.
Almost as good as the real thing.
I already have that game.
Alright.
Your number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3DS that would have made you get one today, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.
Woohoo!
I see a pattern.
It could be another Nintendo Tecmo collaboration.
There you go.
Absolutely.
But the number one thing that would have made you buy a 3DS today...
F03DS going for a serious answer there it is F03DS is the winner I thought for sure that it would be the off-road racing game Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being it it was just it was fourth place just shy of the list I'm kind of glad though it won't be etched permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old next week
All right.
We totally missed out on all the Charlie Sheen references we could have used.
I know.
Winning 3DS, but not.
No one cares anymore.
I'm kind of over it.
I didn't care to begin with.
Yay, we're watching a man self-destruct live on TV.
It's great.
But it's different now because it's a man doing it.
It's been a while.
Maybe he'll show his kush on TV and people will care.
Yeah.
As he's getting out of a limo, sure.
All right.
Skype line is open now.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
If you want to give us a call and talk about the 3DS or you want to talk about something we talked about in the news or maybe have a game review, I don't know.
Skype line's open and call.
I'm hoping we'll get at least one caller tonight we've never had before.
I want to hear from someone shy who never calls us.
Loki, meanwhile, do you have any last minute news for us tonight?
Um, there's some stuff we didn't talk about.
Like, uh, there was a whole thing that they thought that Geohot had fled to South America.
Yes, he went to South America.
I'm just sick of that fucking story.
Yeah, I know.
It's, whatever.
You know, uh, yeah, he went to South America, but not for fleeing.
Of course, you know, if he doesn't come back, then he is fleeing, so.
Take it as you will.
Um...
Yeah, man, there's not a lot of stuff.
All right, let's go to the phones.
When we have phones, take a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is C.D.
Fender.
Say that again?
C.D.
Fidner?
Fender.
Fender.
C.D.
Fender.
I don't think we've had you on the show before.
I got my wish.
What's on your mind, buddy?
It's actually Fender.
Oh, Fender.
What's up, Fender?
Golden rule of radio.
Go ahead and turn down the radio in the background because the echo is going to mess with you like you wouldn't believe.
Listen to me on your phone.
What's up?
What did you call us for tonight?
Well, I have some games to discuss with you guys.
All right.
What games?
Let's see.
The Resident Evil series.
Just the whole damn series?
All of them?
Well, like Resident Evil 5, I've never played it, but it looks pretty cool.
I think I might like it.
Why do you think you'd like Resident Evil 5?
Well, I've seen videos of it, and just the graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks cool.
And your partner is a girl, so it can't be that.
Now, Resident Evil 5 has been out for some time, so what's stopping you from just getting the damn game already?
Well, I don't have the system.
Oh, well, that happens.
So you are not an owner of any 360 PS3-type consoles?
No, I've got a Nintendo GameCube and a Nintendo 64.
That's all right.
That shit's expensive, the new stuff.
So you are kicking it old school.
Yes, I am.
So what old school games do you enjoy playing?
Let's see.
I've got the old Rampage games.
And I have Perfect Dark, the one for the 64.
Classic.
I also have Fighting for 64.
Goal 9-007.
Well, I'm still living at home and I haven't moved out and I don't think I want to spend my money on that.
Even though I like playing on Wii's, I don't think I want to own one.
Yeah, you know, it's like The Rent or a Wii.
It's probably a good idea.
I mean, seriously.
I know.
And with the GameCube, I've got Die Hard Vendetta.
I'm not sure if you've heard of that.
No, probably not.
I wasn't really into the Die Hard movies.
Although, well, I don't know.
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, maybe?
I don't know.
Do we get that in the game?
Do we get a Yippee-Ki-Yay motherfucker in the game?
I haven't played it in such a long time, I've forgotten.
Okay, that's alright.
Probably not, because it's a Nintendo-based product.
Well, it's an M-rated game, so you never know.
That's true.
Okay, here's my thing, though.
Resident Evil you brought up, Resident Evil 5.
Now, one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made was Resident Evil 4.
So, have you checked that out on GameCube?
I think I do want to buy that.
I think they made that game for the Wii as well, but it's the same.
The graphics are still the same.
Yeah, pretty much.
I mean, the Wii's just two GameCubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway.
That's a pretty good description.
How's your PC?
Because some folks in chat are kind of commenting, wow, this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago.
Maybe he should game on the PC.
Have you tried gaming on PC?
No.
I don't have a PC.
I'm actually using a Mac laptop right now.
Well, we just talked about DOSBox on the Mac.
That might be an option for you.
I don't know.
Yeah, I actually have the original one version of the original Doom for the 64.
I see.
Well, you might have to check out Steam for the Mac or something.
I don't know.
It's an option for you.
Alright, we've got to take some more calls.
Any other last minute thoughts before we let you go?
No, just that you guys do a really good job and keep doing what you're doing.
We will.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thanks so much.
Take care, buddy.
Bye.
Bye.
You know, not everybody can take the plunge.
You're talking about $200 for a Nintendo Wii.
Because some folks in the chat room are like, is that call from like three years ago?
What's going on?
But it's like, you know, it's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody gets to just take the plunge.
I should have asked how old he was.
Hey, what's up, guys?
This is Kaijudo.
But I just wanted to call real quick about Pokemon, black and white.
But before I say that, yeah, I have it.
I have both, actually.
but before I go on to that I just want to say that previous caller Die Hard Vendetta he called it it does have a lot of cursing in it it was actually a big deal they were trying to go after Nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many F-bombs in that game you wouldn't believe it but anyway so Pokemans show us your Pokemans yeah I definitely recommend it I mean I think if you haven't played Pokemon in a while I think you should definitely pick this one up I mean they always add something new
Mudkip 2.0?
Mudkip 2.0?
I'm just trolling, don't listen to me.
about how much they added to the game.
It's really a great game.
So my ignorant ass earlier in the show should not have said that the Pokemon games haven't really changed in a while.
Well, I mean, it's your opinion, but actually they have changed.
The one that you mentioned, the Ruby, what was it?
Ruby Silver?
Yeah.
No, Ruby Emerald.
Yeah, I mean, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but what I think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases, which they didn't have in the original, which was, I think,
What was it, Red and Blue or some shit?
Okay, but to be fair, I mean, how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game?
I mean, maybe a little bit.
Well, it does, because, I mean, certain Pokemon you couldn't catch, you know, you have to catch them at certain days of the week, you have to catch them at certain, you know, either day or night.
I mean, you know, I mean, they really do innovative stuff with it.
I mean, you know, it may not be something that's going to, like, change how you think about Pokemon, but, I mean, they always consider the fans and they...
They kind of cater to what the fans want.
Whatever the fans are asking for, you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next Pokemon game.
Let me ask one of the fanboy questions of the year, and I don't know how many times we brought this up on the show, but why do you think Nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a Pokemon MMO?
I would even fucking play a Pokemon MMO.
Well, you mentioned earlier, like I said, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but they do have this website thing that's coming out on March 30th.
I guess you could say it's kind of like an MMO.
You're going to have some kind of Pokefarm and you can raise your Pokemon slaves there and make them fight.
All that type of stuff.
They do have some type of MMO thing going on.
I don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them in a while, but you'll be able to link up with maybe 10 people in a room.
and you can all like chat and you know exchange you can tie razor blades to their feet and all that shit this sounds like you're turning cockfighting into a video game but you've just replaced the cocks with Pikachu that's pretty much what Pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it you're basically catching these things and making them like yeah it's cockfighting pretty much but I mean it's great you know I mean I don't mind it get your Pikachu out of my cockfighting game it's better than getting real cock
Sorry, we're having too much fun.
Yeah, it's better than getting real roosters and having them beat the crap out of each other.
You could do it virtually.
All right.
And that's pretty much what the main story is about in this game.
There's actually a guy who wants to free all the Pokemon because he's like, oh, you know, we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy shit.
So he's basically PETA.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Wouldn't that be pee-pee?
People for the ethical treatment of Pokemon?
Pee-pee?
Any quick last shoutouts before we let you go?
Shoutout to everyone listening Shoutout to Raichu, I love you man I'm not gonna Raichu a love song Oh god Have you seen that t-shirt?
No I'm not gonna and then the picture of Raichu and then love song
SX in our chatroom says, no one show this game to Michael Vick.
Ooh, ouch.
I don't know about that.
All right, 1877GAMEOLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Oh, I can't deal with it tonight.
Let's get to some more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, this is Actdeft.
Hey, Actdeft running to the mic.
Shit, shit, shit.
Hi, what's up, Actdeft?
I just want to pull up the last call about Pokemon.
Yeah, what's up?
Well, I pretty much, well, it has changed a lot since the Game Boy Advance games.
Okay.
A lot.
So what's all changed?
What am I missing by not experiencing Pokemon Black and White?
Well, you have more stuff to do with Pokemon.
You have to watch out for stats like special attack and defense.
You also have to raise some certain Pokemon to obtain them.
You have to work that Pokemon.
You have to train them.
Can you whip your Pokemon like the Derby Owners Club?
If you're a competitive player, pretty much you have to do that.
And also about Nintendo not doing the Pokemon MMO.
Pretty much Nintendo, I think, has said that they don't want to do it because it's...
It's a very big project, and I think they said that it couldn't work.
Well, fuck them!
Give me what I want!
Is that too much to ask?
Yeah, I know.
Everyone would play it, I know.
I don't play MMOs, I don't like them, but I know I would play a Pokemon MMO.
I dare somebody to call in and say they wouldn't play the Pokemon MMO.
Anyone in this room?
Would anyone in this room not play the Pokemon MMO?
Or at least give it a try?
I'd try.
I would not play the Pokemon MMO.
Okay, hater, why?
Because I don't like Pokemon.
Because you can't shoot Pokemon.
No, because I don't like it.
I think it's a stupid series that certain people over age... Hold on, hold on.
I just, I have to know.
Haven't you bought every single Animal Crossing game they've ever made?
Yes.
Yes.
I don't understand you at all.
And I don't like them.
But you buy them.
You hate, you hate, you hate, you hate, and yet you buy.
My wife wanted to play them.
Yeah, likely story.
It is likely.
Well, maybe Josh wants to play Pokemon MMO.
I bought Nintendogs, and I hate it, and I'm getting rid of it.
So you know what?
It doesn't matter.
I want to play Nintendogs.
Buy it.
Oh, you want to play the new Nintendogs?
Boot up the old Nintendogs.
And get drunk.
It'll be in 3D.
I don't know.
I just want someone to convince my husband to get me my 3DS.
Look what you started, Actdeft.
We're all fighting.
It's all in fighting tonight.
I know OLR is going to break up tonight, and it's all because of your call.
I just want you to know that.
I'm kidding.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm kidding.
No, no, no.
Basically, Nintendo said the most principal thing, they don't want to do it because it's a big infrastructure, and it's, like I said, a very big project for them to handle, and they don't want to do it.
I see.
They're the number one selling console in the motherfucking world, yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a Pokemon MMO.
Little old Microsoft, I have no idea how they're doing it, and Sony, jeez, boy, they're sure suckers.
Well, to their defense, Microsoft doesn't have an MMO.
But they have an online infrastructure, which is more than Nintendo has.
Debatable.
I mean, they did have Final Fantasy XI.
You know I'm always going to whip out that card.
And Phantasy Star Universe.
That's true.
Alright, fine.
Then they already have more than Nintendo does.
Microsoft just is opposed to MMOs for some reason.
There's some weird thing going on.
I don't know if they were just burned by Final Fantasy XI or what, but I don't know.
or maybe it has something to do with their next system.
Maybe their next system is all going to be about MMOs.
Who knows?
I'm making shit up now.
All right.
Actdeft, before I let you go, since we've completely derailed your phone calls many times, anything else you want to share with our folks tonight?
Well, just one last question.
Would you pay around $525 for a 3DS?
Hell no, I wouldn't.
Not right now.
Not until more games come out.
Let me guess, that's how much you're having to pay in Mexico, huh?
Yep.
DarkSakura.com
Those are pretty much screwed.
They're paying 6,000 pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3DS.
Unbelievable.
Alright, well, Actdeft, we hope it gets to a more reasonable level in Mexico soon.
But it is launch day.
I mean, give it a few weeks to stabilize.
You know, if the sales are not so hot, or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought, maybe the price will drop pretty quickly.
We'll see.
I doubt it, but, well, let's see.
We'll see.
Alright, take care, buddy.
Take care.
You too.
Thanks for watching!
Let's go to one or two more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Ranma.
How's everyone doing tonight?
Hey, good, Ranma.
I just want to say real quick to this.
Our phones are like packed tonight.
It's weird.
Like it's just constantly lit up the whole screen.
So if you don't get through tonight, don't get sand in your vagina.
Just send us an email.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com because millions of people will call, but yet no one will email us.
I don't understand.
All right, but Ranma, you got through.
What's on your mind tonight?
A few things.
Number one, I know the music is out on the podcast, but when you were playing music from Space Channel 5, I had mentioned that about two years ago, I was in a skit where it was Dance Dance Revolution versus Space Channel 5.
It had to have been at least ten years ago when DDR was popular.
I'm just kidding.
It was close to seven.
What was this DDR versus Space Channel 5 skit?
It was pretty much a dance-off between which was better, the characters from Space Channel 5 or DDR.
But what had happened was, after the dance-off, the main villain from Space Channel 5 Part 2 comes out, tries to take over the convention, both sides join forces, and do another dance-off to destroy him.
But we cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together.
Now, which character did you play?
And please don't say Space Michael.
Rage.
Rage.
Nice.
Did you wear pants?
No, I didn't.
I had the hair.
I didn't have time to throw that together.
You didn't go as pantsless, Rage?
No.
It's an old school LR joke.
Old school.
Old school.
Good.
You wore pants.
Yes, indeed.
So who ultimately ended up being victorious?
The DDR people or the Space Channel 5 people?
I really don't know because it just ended up like a tie per se, but we still ended up winning an award, which was pretty cool.
It was open to interpretation.
That's what it was.
Yes.
Whatever you wanted to happen, you as the viewer.
So what cons are coming up, Rama?
Any cons you're going to do soon?
You're the con king.
Anime Boston, but you know, that's them.
But I do have a couple more things I want to cover that I'm going to be on my merry little way.
All right.
Number one.
Loki, you mentioned what's the point of having projectors with video games and stuff like that.
Something tells me you've never seen gaming tournaments.
I missed like half of what you just said there.
Yeah, you botched up a little bit.
I don't know the connection, but let me just repeat a little bit.
Ranma's basically saying a couple weeks ago on the show, I don't even remember when you said it, but you talked about projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles.
But Ranma's saying, well, what about gaming tournaments or anime cons?
He does conventions and probably sees DDR on projectors all the time.
At the Atari party, they had games on projector.
Projector is basically a TV.
Yeah, maybe pretty much.
You use it for certain scenarios.
I guess that's where Loki's coming from, eh?
I'm just saying, you know, if they come out with some sort of 3D holographic system or something like that that requires some special display that's not out there... Holodeck in a box.
You know you want one.
But if it's just like, oh look, it's this console with a Pico projector built in, it's kind of...
I don't know.
It's neat, I guess, but it's impractical.
Unless, of course, it runs on batteries, and that might be pretty cool, because then you can at least take it places and play stuff, but I don't know.
Alright, Ranma, anything else?
I had something else, but I'll save that for another time.
Alright.
Fair enough.
Or you can email.
Hint, hint.
We need more emails.
Alright.
We'll do.
Ranma, take care, buddy.
No problem.
Later.
Bye.
Have fun at Anime Boston.
Be good times.
Alright.
Let's go ahead and get to some more calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lunch Radio.
We can do at least one more call, right?
One more?
One more call?
Yeah.
All right, one more call.
Salacious Pop says yes.
You want to take a call?
It'll be fun.
No.
All right.
All right.
See, it was lighting up.
Now it's not.
Well, it takes about a minute.
In about a minute, it's going to light up completely.
All right, Loki, is there any last-minute stories?
I know you're just getting into that OK Go video, but is there any last-minute stories?
Yeah, actually, it's a series that's on the iOS system, Real Racing.
They've got Real Racing 2 HD that's going to be getting an iPad 2 update that's actually going to turn the iPad 2 into almost like a console.
Thanks for watching!
Let me go to the phones because we, like clockwork, like almost exactly a certain number of seconds after I said we're done, the buffer caught up and we got another lit up board.
This is going to be the last call though, guys.
So if you didn't get through again, please email.
Sorry.
All right.
Hi, caller.
You're on the air.
Who's this?
Hey, this is X-Link.
Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
Hey, nothing much.
First off, I'm very proud of my stepdaughter.
She's 11, and she's already been in less than about a month and a half been through the first two games of the Professor Layton series and only needed help like once or twice with one or two of the puzzles.
That is really amazing for me to see her do that.
That's a very cerebral game, so awesome for her.
Yeah, she's very smart, and she loves this type of puzzle game, so I'm looking forward to getting her the third one.
You got a kid genius on your hand.
Mensa test.
Yeah, really, no joke.
I bought Pokemon Black the day it came out, and I really loved it.
And I haven't played Pokemon for quite a while.
I really pissed off the Pokemon fans tonight, didn't I?
And the only reason why I got it was because a lot of my friends that I knew was getting either getting the black or getting white.
So I decided, well, why not?
So, you know, and try it out.
I'm really enjoying it.
I'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated.
Some of the movesets have changed around, and the different ways they're doing the Wi-Fi connection.
Thanks for watching!
Where you could put your Pokemon and put them in a dream world, which is kind of like a web browser game type thing.
Unfortunately, it won't be coming anytime soon because of the fact that over in Japan with the earthquake, they had to shut down the servers for it.
And they came out with a release saying, though it was supposed to come on on the 30th for North America and Europe, there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up.
Hmm.
so that was the one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there has been a delay and they have released statements about that so
Let me ask you the same fanboy question I've been asking everybody else about the whole Pokemon MMO.
Would you leave Warcraft for a Pokemon MMO?
No.
No?
Why is that?
I think that would be more towards smaller kids and stuff, kind of like the free realm is for Sony.
I really don't see it being more towards adults.
I wouldn't mind playing it just for LOLs or if it's for a good price, but
I just don't really see me playing a Pokemon MMO when I just can go online and just do the same things as a regular Pokemon and just challenge somebody over Wi-Fi.
Unless they're going to offer a bunch more stuff to it.
I don't know.
I couldn't really see myself doing that.
But if Nintendo wants to do it, it would be a good cash cow.
Go for it.
It would probably give WoW a run for their money.
If they can play it off and do it right, that is.
and also coming into the straight mail too for the Bioware, sorry, really quickly.
I don't get offended when I would play games, say like Dragon Age, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect and had a quote-unquote gay sex scene would happen.
I'm not going to be like, oh my god, I can't believe I'm seeing this.
I mean, I couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and said for all the straight mail, sorry, not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that, so...
And if I don't like something, I just don't play it.
It's as simple as that.
Right.
It was a weird story.
It's kind of cool, though, that Bioware came out and just totally defended it.
And I'm glad that if they're going to go all-in like that, they really go all-in and stand by it and the artistic stuff behind it.
Precisely.
And I don't see any reason as to why.
It didn't cause an outcry.
People knew about this way before.
I mean, as soon as the game hits, people knew about this.
They warned people and they were like, oh, we're putting all this stuff in.
We're showing you some of the scenes.
And they're letting people know.
And it's like, it was your choice.
You can either A, buy it knowing what was in it, or B, don't buy it.
Don't worry about it at all.
And just don't get all up.
Don't make those decisions.
Like it was said before, you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen.
And you would know because of by the reaction of the people and what they say.
I mean, it's kind of obvious.
All right.
Well, we'll leave it on that for now.
Excellent.
Thanks so much for the call.
Enjoy your Pokemans.
Oh, I will.
See ya.
Kinda surprised he didn't say anything about the stepdaughter playing Pokemon.
Alright, so clearly I angered the Pokemon fans across America tonight, so I would like to apologize.
I'm deeply sorry to those Pokemon fans I may have offended.
Let me play you a little something in tribute.
Goddammit, I hate it when people mislabel YouTube things.
It's supposed to be something else.
Fail.
Maybe this one?
I know something that you can pull up.
I was trying to play the Jigglypuff song.
Let me try this.
Search for, it's a bumper from WB's Cartoon Afternoon.
Batman sings Jigglypuff.
It's awesome.
Jiggly Batman, is that it?
Here we go.
Time for bed.
Alright, but a deal's a deal.
No way.
You promised.
Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
Alright, can I... The whole thing.
Pokemon Next on Kids WB Very nice.
Very good.
I like that one.
Nice.
Alright, as we put the listeners to sleep even more.
Alright, wake up because we're about to wrap up the show here.
Thanks to you guys who called in tonight.
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but remember we do have an email.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright.
Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki?
No, um, but I did want to mention one thing, though, and just after watching the updated, you know, system update thing for, uh, the OK Go video, if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for Nintendogs, they are really, like, really just missing the boat here, because it's with friends, which, because all the games are Nintendogs and cats, you know, with friends, um, and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video, and it's in 3D.
Come on!
Nintendo!
It's like, here you go, great ad campaign.
Don't have to do anything.
You just go.
Go with it.
Okay?
Go.
No, but seriously, though, I'm surprised.
They should have, if they wanted to be kind of hip and cool about it, they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with LittleBigPlanet where it was with live actors and stuff like that.
That would have been pretty awesome.
But then again, the game is just a rehash of the last game.
Or they just need to get Oprah to give away 3DSs on her last show.
And you get a 3DS.
And you get a 3DS.
It's by Nintendo!
She already had her last Favorite Things episode, though.
And the audience completely just lost their minds.
Of course they did.
Awesome.
You would, too, if you'd been in that audience.
Hold me.
I would have been you if you got to go to the Britney concert today.
She totally trolled them, too, because she never says that it's a giveaway episode.
So it's like, oh, we're going to talk about to cancer patients.
And it's very sad.
Then all of a sudden all the big balloons fall out of the sky and everyone falls out.
Celebrate cancer!
Woo!
All right, anyhow.
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.
Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.
Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
Word of mouth is what we need because you know what?
We don't have a big website.
We're not a magazine.
We're not corporate owned.
We're just frenzies doing this show because we enjoy it.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
We'll start off with Salacious Pop.
Thank you once again for sitting in on the show tonight.
Thank you.
Great list list tonight.
And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Tacos.
All right.
And we'll go to Loki.
Any final thoughts for you tonight?
My final thought is this, and I don't know if anyone's really noticed, there's an infrared camera on the 3DS.
Infrared camera plus motion controls, what does that equal?
Wii integration!
Yay!
Dance party.
Dance party.
All you need people is playing some Wii game and they just fling their 3DS out of their hand and it's just gone.
Next up is the 3DS condom.
Alright, my final thought for the night is care packages from Japan rock.
DarkSakura, you have a final thought tonight?
No.
No.
No means no.
No.
All right.
That's it, guys, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll be back to do it all again next week, though.
