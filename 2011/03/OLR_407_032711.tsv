0	20720	Tonight, March 27, 2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have
20720	31440	some 3DS titles already been cancelled?
31440	34860	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
34860	38680	Lounge Radio, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38680	43160	It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.
43160	46620	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
46620	49680	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49680	50680	Woo!
50680	51680	How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
51680	52680	Woo!
52680	55680	Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?
55680	56680	Ugh!
56680	57680	Yeah.
57680	61680	I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smooshage.
61680	63680	Smooshage.
63680	66520	It looks like boob smash.
66520	69440	You think maybe we'll get a video game out of this new series if it does well?
69440	70440	Probably.
70440	71440	It'd do well if they...
71440	72440	Okay.
72440	74220	Of course there's DC Universe, that is kind of a Wonder Woman game.
74220	77480	There was this one outfit that they had her in that was sort of this Xena looking loin
77480	80200	cloth-y thing that looked cool.
80200	81200	Why didn't they stick with that?
81200	82200	I don't know.
82200	84720	It was leathery and hardcore and cool.
84720	87400	Actually the hell with this Wonder Woman stuff, let's get Xena back on TV.
87400	90560	No, but AKA Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.
90560	91560	Alright.
91560	94560	Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute.
94560	98120	But of course we can't do a show without Tech Master Loki!
98120	102760	See, the reason they cancelled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.
102760	103760	Did she?
103760	104760	No.
104760	106520	She very well could have.
106520	110040	No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.
110040	111040	I don't know.
111040	112560	I can't explain it.
112560	113560	So how you doing, Loki?
113560	114560	What's new with you?
114560	115560	Oh, no.
115560	116560	You're right, you're right.
116560	117560	I'm confusing her with China.
117560	118560	My mistake.
118560	119560	That...
119560	120560	I should never do that.
120560	121560	That's because China did enough steroids.
121560	122560	Not the country, but the wrestler.
122560	123560	No, the wrestler.
123560	124560	Yes.
124560	125560	Yes.
125560	126560	I should never...
126560	127560	I apologize, Lucy Lawless.
127560	128560	Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.
128560	129560	Lucy Lawless could play China.
129560	130560	She's awesome.
130560	131560	No, she's awesome.
131560	132560	In like a lifetime movie.
132560	135560	China is a man beast, okay?
135560	136560	So...
136560	137560	No.
137560	138560	Well, it's...
138560	140200	It's because of steroids.
140200	143040	I understand it's because of steroids, but...
143040	144040	Yes.
144040	145040	Oh, man.
145040	146040	I...
146040	147040	Do I feel bad?
147040	150500	Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange
150500	151500	Lawn Radio.
151500	152500	Say hello to Salacious Pop.
152500	153500	What up?
153500	154500	How you doing?
154500	155500	Doing good.
155500	156500	Yeah?
156500	158840	You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?
158840	160080	Do you watch any TV at all?
160080	161080	No.
161080	164940	I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.
164940	167680	There's no like Hulu that you watch.
167680	169520	Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.
169520	170520	You watch Archer.
170520	171520	You got me hooked on that show.
171520	172520	That show's funny.
172520	174120	I like that show on FX.
174120	175120	Really?
175120	176120	You think it's funny?
176120	177120	Yeah.
177120	178120	I thought...
178120	181960	I tried watching a few episodes of that to see it, because it looked really funny, and
181960	182960	it was terrible.
182960	183960	Really?
183960	184960	It was just terrible.
184960	185960	No, I love Archer.
185960	186960	It's funny.
186960	190040	I mean, I got to go back and watch it, but like the first few episodes just annoyed me
190040	192100	because it wasn't funny enough.
192100	193100	Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes.
193100	194100	I don't know.
194100	195100	Maybe.
195100	196100	I don't know.
196100	197100	But I don't know.
197100	198100	Every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.
198100	199100	It's very dark.
199100	202360	The secretary that wants to bang everybody, and then when she...
202360	205800	Because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise
205800	208160	marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.
208160	209960	Just like really like, wow.
209960	210960	Yeah.
210960	212360	A lot of awesome stuff.
212360	213360	All right.
213360	215840	Anyhow, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?
215840	217560	We always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week?
217560	219500	But I need to introduce, of course, the chat room.
219500	222660	We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
222660	226480	after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
226480	230920	And if you want to join us live in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, where you
230920	235160	can join us in the live chat room where we do interact with the audience.
235160	239640	For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, why is the State Theater near my house
239640	243960	doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week, WTF?
243960	247040	People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff, and I'm kind of like, I'm so
247040	249040	over it.
249040	250040	Just like Rebecca Black.
250040	253880	You know, like Rebecca Black was cool like a week ago and now, now I think I'm finally
253880	254880	getting over it.
254880	257560	Like now, now it's become a parody of itself in a way.
257560	261660	And Charlie Sheen, like this whole, is he doing like a live tour or something?
261660	262660	No thanks.
262660	265460	I'll go watch Hot Shots again.
265460	270160	I never actually watched the interview or heard anything.
270160	272120	I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.
272120	274360	Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?
274360	275360	Either of them.
275360	276360	Either of them.
276360	277360	Oh, sorry.
277360	281040	I've watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.
281040	285200	What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?
285200	286200	That was, yeah.
286200	287200	That was Alan.
287200	288200	What was that you posted on my walls?
288200	289200	I got it.
289200	291280	There's a group called, uh, I don't want to get their name wrong.
291280	292280	Bad Lip Sync?
292280	293280	Bad, Bad Lip Reading?
293280	294440	Yeah, that was it.
294440	299480	So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's
299480	301520	saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth.
301520	306280	And then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how,
306280	310440	and then if you look at her, look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what
310440	312040	it looks like she's saying.
312040	316200	And it's pretty awesome.
316200	317200	As you're queuing up the video.
317200	321700	I would try to play some of it here, but I don't, it's YouTube's, YouTube's acting ignorant
321700	322700	right now.
322700	323800	It's terrible.
323800	325000	It's very ignorant right now.
325000	328280	I can't believe this, such ignorance.
328280	329840	There it goes.
329840	352320	Let's see if I can play some of this here.
352320	355720	That should be the theme song to River City Ransom part two, which we were talking about
355720	358880	last week.
358880	363280	We got party hats, Barney, Barney.
363280	366040	I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.
366040	368080	It's actually much, I could listen to that.
368080	369680	I would buy that on iTunes.
369680	374460	It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, ear worm than the original is.
374460	375460	Cause I'll be in the shower.
375460	376460	Gang, fight, gang.
376460	377460	It's like, stop it.
377460	380240	I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.
380240	383440	All right, let's talk about actual video games.
383440	387320	I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen, Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes
387320	388320	of our show.
388320	389320	Thank you so much.
389320	390320	Let's talk about actual video games.
390320	391720	And how was your gaming week?
391720	392720	Ladies first, Dark Soccer.
392720	394440	How was your gaming week?
394440	397680	My gaming week was, um, epic.
397680	402780	Well, in the terms of RPGs, cause Dan and I are playing, well, more like Dan's playing
402780	407840	through it and I'm watching him while I crochet, um, playing through Final Fantasy and we're
407840	411640	halfway through the first game and when we're done with that, we're going to go to two.
411640	415640	And then since we don't have a home version of three, you know, that's like, that we can
415640	419520	play on the TV, we're going to skip onto four and then we're going to do five, which we've
419520	430640	got a couple of versions of now, um, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 10 to 11 was crap
430640	431640	and not really a game.
431640	436360	I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while cause of that whole, you know, I don't
436360	439640	know, 12 years and never got to level cap.
439640	440640	I know.
440640	445400	Well, like it's not going to be, well, you know, I'm just saying.
445400	451400	And then we're going to play 12 and I guess I'll get your 13 back from you again.
451400	454200	Cause I should, I should probably give that to you today.
454200	459640	What about 12, two, uh, 12, two was on the DS, but then there's, well, and it wasn't
459640	460640	really 12, two.
460640	462640	It was like a side story.
462640	468080	There's a 12, two that we saw the, um, 13, two, 13, two that was too damn many games.
468080	473040	Now are you going to be playing, um, the, uh, was it the Final Fantasy four?
473040	478080	Was it the after years or whatever we, it may be out by the time we get to it, we just
478080	479680	might hook up the SNES.
479680	480680	I don't know.
480680	487000	Well, you can put it on the Wii cause it's, uh, we loaned out our Wii, our Wii's on loan.
487000	491160	If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.
491160	496280	I don't know, but we've got like anthology versions and I have one if you need to borrow
496280	497280	one.
497280	500440	Well, we've, we've got anthology versions, we've got the super Nintendo versions.
500440	504600	I mean, really we've got, I think three different versions of that game that we could play.
504600	505600	And let me back up a little bit.
505600	507080	Why are you doing this?
507080	510280	Because this is romantic.
510280	516320	Well, back in the day, like I say that like it was like so long ago, but Dan and Dan will
516320	520480	play it through, um, Resident Evil two and I would be his navigator.
520480	525160	It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because
525160	527480	it's been a long time since I've played the first one.
527480	530280	And when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.
530280	531600	I'm a wondrous one.
531600	533480	So are you doing like purist?
533480	537800	Are you doing the NES version or are you playing like the remade one on PlayStation one or
537800	538800	something?
538800	539800	This is the remade PlayStation one.
539800	540800	The, was it origins or?
540800	541800	Yeah.
541800	542800	Yeah.
542800	546080	And, um, which is really just like the wondrous one one in terms of the graphics.
546080	547320	But with the souped up music.
547320	548320	Yeah.
548320	549320	It's not, it's nice.
549320	551320	It's very super Nintendo-y.
551320	564560	And, um, our party is, uh, the warrior, the monk or black belt of the thief and red mage.
564560	567040	So we have, we're offensive.
567040	573440	We know they go out and tell bad jokes and then, you know, get experience for it, I guess.
573440	576880	But Dan likes to name, um, the party after people that he knows.
576880	583920	So the warrior is Dan and I'm the red mage because hi, I'm versatile and can cast fire
583920	584920	three.
584920	592400	Um, then, uh, our friend Becky, he's named, uh, our, uh, monk because Becky kicks ass
592400	598280	and then, uh, mystique is the thief because it's mystique and the thief is always asleep
598280	599280	or dead.
599280	603960	So, which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what mystique is like
603960	608040	whenever we have work to do, um, and she's been on the show.
608040	609040	People have heard her.
609040	610920	Um, so it's pretty fun.
610920	614240	And like I was yelling at the husband the other day, I'm playing a little bit of final
614240	620280	fantasy three, mostly at school, like before class when I get a chance to and, uh, playing
620280	621280	well.
621280	630360	And, um, I made a new character, Rebecca black, just because I thought it would be funny.
630360	632400	And I like, now you're stuck with it.
632400	637200	I, well, I like going, running through stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?
637200	641920	And I'm like, yeah, just because it's fun.
641920	643240	It's my own version of trolling.
643240	649080	No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.
649080	651440	I brought this chicken for us to eat.
651440	653600	Anything else for your gaming week?
653600	659140	Uh, pinball, I actually played some pinball.
659140	660140	Good times.
660140	664940	I played some world cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I
664940	668360	apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.
668360	670760	And then I like drained them on my last two balls.
670760	677720	It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.
677720	679520	That was what my game was like.
679520	680520	And Dan's my witness.
680520	682320	He can vouch for me.
682320	683800	That was, that's my gaming week.
683800	684800	Awesome.
684800	685800	And I crocheted.
685800	691640	How about you and your gaming week?
691640	692640	Motorstorm apocalypse.
692640	700560	I finished the rookie story mode thing, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.
700560	702000	It's really hard as it is.
702000	707440	So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually
707440	711440	kind of an Archer type intro for.
711440	713400	So I'm interested to see where that goes.
713400	716800	And then what else did I play?
716800	720920	I played more Ridge Racer because it's fun.
720920	725600	I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.
725600	733680	I got my, you know, my US 3DS now and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it
733680	736080	should be sold this week.
736080	740320	And got some pilot wings in Super Street Fighter IV.
740320	746680	So those are kind of the, kind of the games to get I guess.
746680	748200	That's really what I'm getting for a while.
748200	754200	I mean the only other game that kind of looked interesting was that Dream Trigger, but beyond
754200	757440	that, I don't see anything until like the fourth quarter.
757440	759980	So I don't know.
759980	765840	And just from my experience today, it is not difficult to find a 3DS, at least in the first
765840	766840	few days.
766840	772200	When I talked to somebody at Gamestop, they had a couple left and they said they were
772200	773560	getting more on Friday.
773560	780840	And then there was a Toys R Us, they had at least seven left, you know, quite a few.
780840	783960	And no one was even interested, there was no one there.
783960	787200	So maybe just because no one thinks of Toys R Us anymore for games.
787200	788920	I still kind of sort of want one.
788920	792200	There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.
792200	798840	A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.
798840	800920	Beyond that, might as well wait.
800920	805760	I mean seriously, it's not a Wii situation right now.
805760	809640	And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.
809640	814400	And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.
814400	818100	You know I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo
818100	820320	really seemed hell bent on getting this thing out in March.
820320	824600	And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we
824600	826720	really start ramping up for the holiday season?
826720	830140	Like part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had
830140	833440	the Kid Icarus and some of these other games, maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many
833440	834840	third parties on board.
834840	838960	Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is like the movies,
838960	841680	the entertainment package and everything.
841680	846360	If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the
846360	849440	summer, kids graduation presents and things like that.
849440	853760	You know, let's say they sell a million of these if not more by summertime, then there's
853760	858280	already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey,
858280	865180	how about putting out that, you know, Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?
865180	867520	I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.
867520	871560	I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.
871560	876000	And by putting it out just before, you know, the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're
876000	881320	gonna sell all their, you know, first batch of systems probably within the first week.
881320	885480	And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their
885480	886480	investors.
886480	888600	That's all I really think the reason why that they did it.
888600	892600	Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here, actually it's out
892600	896820	in all regions now, yet not everything's done yet.
896820	898600	Like they don't have the internet browser yet.
898600	901080	They don't have like the store up yet.
901080	902360	That's coming in May.
902360	904460	Because it's not done yet!
904460	908600	So they just put it out to get it out there for people, and it'll be like saying, hey,
908600	910160	that's an awesome car that you bought.
910160	911160	Tires!
911160	912880	Those are coming in May!
912880	913880	It's awesome!
913880	919120	I mean, you could drive around in it now, it sparks a lot, but man, once those tires
919120	923840	hit in, that's gonna be awesome.
923840	929120	That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.
929120	932040	But yet you still bought one like a lamb to the slaughter.
932040	934080	You were in line.
934080	936600	I don't care about their crappy web browser.
936600	937600	Or their store!
937600	939960	Because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.
939960	945920	Although I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had.
945920	950440	And they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music.
950440	957440	But it's totally what I expected that, I have a feeling that's exactly what their 3D remakes
957440	959880	of these classic games are gonna look like.
959880	963760	It's basically taking the sprite layers and just kind of offsetting them a little bit.
963760	967480	So when you have a background layer 4 or whatever, it's back further.
967480	969320	So they're just gonna build an emulator.
969320	973760	One of the games that I played at E3 last year I think was Xevious, the old school 8-bit
973760	977240	game, which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.
977240	981160	All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer, and then the background
981160	982160	was on the back layer.
982160	987760	I mean, but I'm not gonna lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming
987760	988760	to get done?
988760	989760	Probably not.
989760	995600	You build an emulator and it runs ROMs, and that's it, you're done.
995600	998760	Question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom, I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they
998760	1001480	are gonna do on the 3DS browser.
1001480	1003580	You think any at all?
1003580	1005760	Probably not, if anything it'll be- Maybe something in Flash?
1005760	1006760	I don't know.
1006760	1007760	Um...
1007760	1011980	Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit,
1011980	1015440	they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.
1015440	1020640	They supported Flash- No, they didn't support Flash- I can't remember what they supported.
1020640	1022480	They supported something with it.
1022480	1023480	It was very basic.
1023480	1027760	It was just like the PSP was, where it supported- It used basic.
1027760	1033560	It supports Flash, but very little Flash, because of the kits that they had.
1033560	1039340	But I think, if anything, what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that
1039340	1040800	those 3D pictures are in.
1040800	1045760	So, like, say if I post that on my, you know, wall or something like that, you know, somewhere
1045760	1048240	in a webpage, it would be in 3D on yours.
1048240	1052120	Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing
1052120	1058080	Nintendo games in Flash, on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games
1058080	1060280	on my 3D- It would be very meta.
1060280	1061900	No, you couldn't.
1061900	1065800	And the reason why you couldn't is because, just, it doesn't have the processing power
1065800	1069000	to handle that, something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like
1069000	1070000	that either.
1070000	1074800	So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP, you'd never be able to build something like
1074800	1075800	that.
1075800	1077800	I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwell from the chatroom.
1077800	1081200	The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.
1081200	1082200	I did hear about that.
1082200	1083720	Yeah, that looks- That's interesting.
1083720	1087800	It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know-
1087800	1089360	It's more of a show-off thing, right?
1089360	1092280	It's like, it's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D, ooh!
1092280	1096240	Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.
1096240	1097900	Okay.
1097900	1098900	Go ahead.
1098900	1103080	For the record, OK Go is a good band.
1103080	1106040	No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.
1106040	1109200	Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in
1109200	1110200	Rock Band.
1110200	1112160	All their videos since then have been amazing.
1112160	1117480	Oh yeah, and that one, there was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing
1117480	1118480	video.
1118480	1120480	Well, there's the one with the dogs, one with them in the park, with the stop motion.
1120480	1123400	The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there, yeah.
1123400	1124400	Okay.
1124400	1127560	So, it's like, they're on the cutting edge of music videos.
1127560	1129520	It's like them and Lady Gaga, right there.
1129520	1130520	Yeah.
1130520	1131520	Alright.
1131520	1132520	They should collaborate.
1132520	1134640	I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.
1134640	1135640	Really?
1135640	1136640	Good show.
1136640	1137640	Oh, good times.
1137640	1138640	Another good band.
1138640	1140960	Alright, so is that it for your gaming week, Loki?
1140960	1143160	Some 3DS rants and so forth?
1143160	1149480	Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday,
1149480	1155080	which, I don't know why all the hate, really, everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever,
1155080	1157360	this is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.
1157360	1158360	It was entertaining.
1158360	1162400	Oh, damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertaining movies?
1162400	1163400	I don't understand.
1163400	1168440	See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really, it's what
1168440	1169440	you want to see.
1169440	1170440	It's alright.
1170440	1171440	Let me put it this way.
1171440	1175040	It's kind of funny because it's, a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of
1175040	1176040	different games.
1176040	1180680	Like, they have this one scene that you probably see in there where they're in a mech and stuff
1180680	1186200	and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from
1186200	1187200	Killzone.
1187200	1189720	It's, it's pretty much that.
1189720	1191200	It looks so much like it.
1191200	1192200	It's ridiculous.
1192200	1193200	Are there lots of boobs?
1193200	1194200	Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.
1194200	1195200	It's PG-13.
1195200	1197200	Oh, come on!
1197200	1203360	No, but it's got, it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train,
1203360	1207760	and it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy 13 where they're, like, fighting soldiers
1207760	1212040	and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.
1212040	1216040	It's badass, but, uh, and it's, like, seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?
1216040	1218400	This would be really awesome as a game.
1218400	1221560	Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.
1221560	1224480	I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.
1224480	1228960	I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.
1228960	1232080	He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.
1232080	1235280	The 300, problematic, but awesome.
1235280	1239600	Then Watchmen, I love the novel, but eh, now, now this, so.
1239600	1243280	So Superman's gonna be great.
1243280	1247080	It was cool, but, like, I see people's complaints, they're like, well, the first part of the
1247080	1249240	movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.
1249240	1250420	So what?
1250420	1251920	So it didn't have dialogue in it.
1251920	1255440	Neither did Wall-E, so that argument's null and void, because Wall-E's one of the greatest
1255440	1256440	movies of the past ten years.
1256440	1261680	So did the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001, so.
1261680	1267600	But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution
1267600	1272080	as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.
1272080	1273400	And whatever, who cares?
1273400	1278440	It doesn't matter, because if it was just, like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution
1278440	1280720	and stuff.
1280720	1286640	It's basically her coping with whatever is going on, because apparently, you know, there's
1286640	1292080	stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as, like, a, you know, a burlesque type
1292080	1293080	place.
1293080	1298660	Um, the way she copes with it is kind of goes into this imaginary world thing, where she's
1298660	1300760	solving how she's gonna escape.
1300760	1303720	And you see how she's gonna figure that out right in the very beginning.
1303720	1308920	She figured it all out, but this is just all, like, very quick, like, uh, kind of like Inception
1308920	1312400	where, you know, there's a lot stuff taking place in a very short period of time.
1312400	1315960	Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.
1315960	1317040	Boobies in 3D.
1317040	1318560	Is there any porn in 3D?
1318560	1321880	Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and
1321880	1323160	you can download it to your flashcard.
1323160	1326560	It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.
1326560	1327880	It would not be difficult to do that.
1327880	1332200	I would say otherwise, your biggest hope would be, uh, Netflix when it comes out, if they
1332200	1337040	start doing the 3D movies, uh, and then, like, Piranha 3D is gonna be, like, your boobies
1337040	1339120	in 3D or whatever else.
1339120	1344560	Well, once they have it where you can, say, take video with your 3DS and stuff, they'll
1344560	1351160	find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and, ta-da, you know, they'll be done.
1351160	1353880	But then again, I don't know, it'd be hard to do 3D.
1353880	1359840	There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet,
1359840	1362220	so, I don't know, it might be a while.
1362220	1363220	But boobies in 3D.
1363220	1365320	I mean, that's a great use of 3D.
1365320	1368440	But once again, though, that's just to get people in the seats for, like, Piranha 3D.
1368440	1372880	I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's... it is interesting.
1372880	1377160	Like, you know, I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and
1377160	1378440	it's got a lot of gore in it.
1378440	1380120	I mean, that sounds awesome.
1380120	1381120	Alright, whatever.
1381120	1382680	But it's a terrible movie.
1382680	1384640	You're part of the problem!
1384640	1389360	No, no, okay, there is something, I can't remember, I'm trying to think if we're actually
1389360	1395200	going to get into it tonight, um, God, I had a Nintendo thing.
1395200	1399600	I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something.
1399600	1402000	Alright, you will come back to that after the gaming week.
1402000	1403800	I have to refresh my memory why I was pissed off.
1403800	1405840	Let me go over to Salacious Pop and check in with him.
1405840	1407280	How was your gaming week, Salacious Pop?
1407280	1408920	It was pretty good.
1408920	1414960	I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2, because I have to revisit
1414960	1416960	that game every couple months.
1416960	1420960	My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is, you know, the very beginning when
1420960	1426640	you're on the train, play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm,
1426640	1431680	which is the very scary, gory, Resident Evil inspired, and I think the developers of Valve
1431680	1434400	said that this very Resident Evil influenced that zone.
1434400	1438000	I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.
1438000	1439000	That's where I'm at right now.
1439000	1443600	I played some Warcraft 3, the RTS from 2003.
1443600	1449440	I'm starting to use cheat codes now, just so I can see the story.
1449440	1454800	And uh, wow, World of Warcraft.
1454800	1455800	That's about it.
1455800	1456800	Alright.
1456800	1459800	When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?
1459800	1464840	Yet, Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some
1464840	1468880	sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.
1468880	1472880	If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.
1472880	1477080	You might want to get a diaper, just in case.
1477080	1478080	Alright.
1478080	1481000	I know Loki's dying to get to his ramp, but I'm going to make him wait through my gaming
1481000	1482000	week.
1482000	1483000	That's fine.
1483000	1484000	It's not a bad big deal.
1484000	1485000	Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.
1485000	1487920	Um, I played a lot of repeats.
1487920	1490160	I played You Don't Know Jack, which was fun.
1490160	1492600	Speaking of diapers, we got the best dissertat ever.
1492600	1493640	It was, what was it?
1493640	1495800	It was, uh, boy band or adult diaper?
1495800	1496800	Something like that?
1496800	1498120	I don't remember what it was.
1498120	1499960	No, it was inspirational poster.
1499960	1500960	Yeah.
1500960	1502920	It was inspirational poster or adult diaper brand.
1502920	1503920	I don't know.
1503920	1505520	I want to ruin the game for you guys.
1505520	1506520	It was great.
1506520	1507520	Laughed.
1507520	1508840	It's a good, it's just a fun party game.
1508840	1511720	Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played, uh, You Don't Know Jack.
1511720	1512960	It called me an idiot to my face.
1512960	1513960	Yeah, that's right.
1513960	1514960	The game called you an idiot.
1514960	1515960	I forgot about that.
1515960	1516960	It was, uh, what was the question?
1516960	1521920	Something about what one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Barney
1521920	1522960	Stone.
1522960	1526400	And it was like, uh, the correct answer was the kiss from Spiderman because you're supposed
1526400	1528440	to kiss the Barney Stone upside down.
1528440	1533920	But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer
1533920	1540400	goes, yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Barney Stone, idiot.
1540400	1544080	He ended up winning the round anyway, but I took it home at the end.
1544080	1547640	We couldn't hear any follow up because, uh, Grandpa Warcraft we were playing with and
1547640	1549080	I were laughing so loud.
1549080	1552040	We couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an
1552040	1553040	idiot.
1553040	1554040	Great.
1554040	1557080	Um, otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade.
1557080	1560400	And every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that, he's like, why aren't you playing this
1560400	1561400	on PC?
1561400	1562400	But I don't know.
1562400	1563400	I, I want the achievements.
1563400	1564400	Don't judge me.
1564400	1570600	Um, and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade.
1570600	1574880	I once knew, you know, we've had a bunch of sad news about, you know, we had the Chinatown
1574880	1579140	arcade in New York City closed, arcade infinity closed as far as I'm concerned, Roseville
1579140	1580140	Golf Land closed too.
1580140	1581440	That place is dead to me.
1581440	1585240	I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy
1585240	1589240	that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.
1589240	1591040	He's going to hear me fuss.
1591040	1593200	There's, there's no Beatmania anymore.
1593200	1594720	There's no DJ Max Technica.
1594720	1597880	They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.
1597880	1604680	All they have is DDR Disney, yeah, Disney and Max 2 and then the drum freaks are, I'm
1604680	1605680	not even into that.
1605680	1609320	They have guitar freaks and drum freaks that like beat the hell up, but they're there at
1609320	1610320	least.
1610320	1614840	But I'm just, you know, I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of, I mean, I would
1614840	1620320	be cool if there were some fun fighting games, no Capcom SNK to be found, no Soul Calibur,
1620320	1621320	nothing.
1621320	1624720	It's, they have an original Soul Calibur 2.
1624720	1625720	Where the hell was that?
1625720	1626720	It was hidden somewhere.
1626720	1631520	And they also have an SNK, it's like, um, three different King of Fighters and then
1631520	1634200	a Metal Slug, one of those four in one boxes.
1634200	1637880	When I played that a couple of months ago and I was laughing last there, I was on the
1637880	1642200	right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.
1642200	1643880	Yeah, it's just sad.
1643880	1648120	The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because
1648120	1650160	like, that is one racing game I do really like.
1650160	1651160	I'll play that.
1651160	1654800	They had Initial D5, which, you know, there's a lot of people really into that series, I'm
1654800	1655800	sure we're playing that.
1655800	1658760	There's only one game there that I think is still in E real good and that's that Tank,
1658760	1659760	Tank, Tank.
1659760	1661920	They do have Tank, Tank, Tank still, but I'm just, I'm over it.
1661920	1665640	Like, it's so far out there for me to drive to and now with no beat mania, I'm just kind
1665640	1667240	of like, you're dead to me, bye.
1667240	1671000	They have a big, um, aside from all the racers, they have the big shooter games with like
1671000	1677040	the giant plastic gun that, you know, like the, the Sega Rambo, Rambo game.
1677040	1678960	So this game is kind of fun.
1678960	1681240	So dad swiped his card for his little girl.
1681240	1685360	She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun
1685360	1687240	as big as she is playing Rambo.
1687240	1688240	She wasn't doing that.
1688240	1689840	Well, I was like, that is awesome.
1689840	1692080	You kill all those mercenaries.
1692080	1694200	You just, yeah, you go ahead girl.
1694200	1695200	Go ahead.
1695200	1699400	I'm going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge radio.com GOVDA has a warning about
1699400	1700520	the Blarney stone.
1700520	1701640	Don't kiss the stone.
1701640	1705520	All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.
1705520	1707200	That's probably some good advice.
1707200	1708200	You know what?
1708200	1714320	I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle and I've
1714320	1716280	got video of my uncle doing it.
1716280	1717280	Oh really?
1717280	1718280	Yeah.
1718280	1719360	No, not pee.
1719360	1721920	Your uncle kiss pee.
1721920	1723440	He went for his honeymoon.
1723440	1724440	Okay.
1724440	1728680	But like lady in the tramp, I don't think, I don't really don't think that there's any
1728680	1733880	way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.
1733880	1734880	You know what?
1734880	1736220	That's what boys like to do is pee on things.
1736220	1738360	So where there's a will, there's a pee.
1738360	1741120	Uh, anyway, uh, what else did I play this week?
1741120	1742120	Otherwise?
1742120	1744560	Um, that was pretty, I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.
1744560	1747840	Oh, final fantasy three on the iPhone came out this week.
1747840	1752040	Um, it's a remake of the DS version of final fantasy three port.
1752040	1753040	Yeah.
1753040	1754040	Or a port, whatever.
1754040	1757360	Uh, well they, I don't know if you'd say, cause they really did soup it up.
1757360	1760520	It's for retina display and the graphics are like noticeably like, wow.
1760520	1764080	I mean, I, that was one of the first things I noticed is it looks great on the iPhone.
1764080	1765800	I mean, granted it's kind of small.
1765800	1769740	I'm usually not a big fan of games on the iPhone, but you know, because they tailor
1769740	1773380	made this for the iPhone, the analog stick kind of works.
1773380	1775260	The faux analog stick they do.
1775260	1780440	One thing I love about it that I wish more iPhone developers would do, it's not a always
1780440	1786280	in the same place analog stick, wherever you touch on the screen becomes an analog stick.
1786280	1789800	So like, you know, in some games you want to be able to see the bottom left corner or
1789800	1791320	the analog stick sometimes is.
1791320	1794560	So if that ends up being the case of fantasy three, you can just move your thumb to the
1794560	1796360	upper right and have your analog stick be there.
1796360	1799320	And it's, it's very small little improvement that I really like.
1799320	1803040	Um, the only tricky touchy prices is the price.
1803040	1807640	Uh, 1599 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.
1807640	1810360	So it's a little high, but then you gotta, you know.
1810360	1815560	What a game is worth is really up in the air right now, and this is where a lot of controversy
1815560	1819720	comes in, which you've heard about, you know, at Game Developers Conference where Nintendo
1819720	1824760	was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and this whole 99 cents for a game and you know,
1824760	1825760	all this.
1825760	1831240	So I mean 1599, yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game, but at the same time the quality
1831240	1835600	is pretty great and you're getting a port or a remake, whatever you want to call it,
1835600	1838880	of a $35 DS game.
1838880	1842200	I mean I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.
1842200	1846880	I mean it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this
1846880	1848400	if you're a Final Fantasy fan.
1848400	1850360	I mean you already know if this game is for you or not.
1850360	1853760	Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.
1853760	1857400	But it looks beautiful and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't
1857400	1859000	really like see for yourself.
1859000	1863240	But um, I, the very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out
1863240	1869240	the 4 remake as well, but at the same time with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't
1869240	1873280	justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with
1873280	1874660	the after years.
1874660	1879600	So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.
1879600	1884080	On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.
1884080	1887820	And I'm, even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like 5 years
1887820	1894100	ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4, so I'm probably not going to get that
1894100	1895480	on the iPhone.
1895480	1900060	Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.
1900060	1903800	If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like 10 bucks whenever
1903800	1907160	the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.
1907160	1911360	So anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.
1911360	1914360	So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.
1914360	1917880	Actually, it was just what you were talking about, how Nintendo was poo-pooing on the
1917880	1922000	developers and stuff like that, the indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.
1922000	1930040	They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system, is their
1930040	1931040	quote.
1931040	1935480	You know, people that, they want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers,
1935480	1938760	just people that make games, I guess.
1938760	1942120	Because they don't want crappy games coming out in their system.
1942120	1946480	Excuse me!
1946480	1948560	Crappy games coming out in your system.
1948560	1951640	The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.
1951640	1958640	There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers
1958640	1961560	and legitimate publishers.
1961560	1966020	I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there, somebody
1966020	1970680	that I don't know might add some innovation to something instead of say, licensing Jelly
1970680	1973800	Belly or licensing Smiley Face.
1973800	1979120	The icon of the 60s, 70s, whoo, that's current.
1979120	1984080	You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.
1984080	1989760	I don't think, see once again, this kind of goes back to, they don't understand the whole
1989760	1990760	online business.
1990760	1995400	They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to
1995400	1997240	the online thing, they're just lost.
1997240	2002080	It's like they just don't know what they're doing.
2002080	2006720	It's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a
2006720	2011040	lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?
2011040	2017280	You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.
2017280	2024040	I mean, had they not put virtual console stuff out there for four, five, six, seven dollars
2024040	2028360	and put it all out for 99 cents, I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just
2028360	2030160	crazy amounts of games.
2030160	2037400	Well, the other thing too is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort
2037400	2039920	of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?
2039920	2042080	They have to buy the SDK, right?
2042080	2043080	I think so.
2043080	2046000	Well, actually, no, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit,
2046000	2048520	because I think you can just download that stuff.
2048520	2049520	Yes.
2049520	2050520	There is a license.
2050520	2051520	There is.
2051520	2056360	So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless if the developers
2056360	2059840	are making the money or not, the only thing they have to worry about is if anything is
2059840	2065080	going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.
2065080	2068840	I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have
2068840	2070380	set up.
2070380	2077220	So really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry
2077220	2078220	about.
2078220	2081360	Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.
2081360	2085080	Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is this something
2085080	2086480	they're going to do to make money?
2086480	2093560	It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with, because Nintendo doesn't
2093560	2095480	have to deal with the same clientele.
2095480	2100120	Here's the problem with Nintendo and what they're worried about is the fact that they're
2100120	2102480	a first-party developer as well.
2102480	2104200	I mean, they put out their own games.
2104200	2105760	Apple doesn't put out their own games.
2105760	2107240	They don't care.
2107240	2111560	Also, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.
2111560	2115920	They could put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really
2115920	2120840	saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.
2120840	2122600	There's so much garbage on there.
2122600	2123720	Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.
2123720	2126960	There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see
2126960	2131960	what's garbage and what's not garbage.
2131960	2136000	They've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because
2136000	2142720	if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.
2142720	2144280	They're not willing to embrace that.
2144280	2147320	It's tricky to say too where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super
2147320	2151040	Meat Boy, and that was kind of a... I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer,
2151040	2152280	but it was definitely in that middle ground.
2152280	2156940	It was basically two guys that made that whole game, despite maybe they had somebody else
2156940	2157940	do the music and so forth.
2157940	2161080	But the core of the game was two guys, and it's probably one of the best arcade games
2161080	2162600	to have come out in the past year.
2162600	2168040	Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?
2168040	2172120	Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.
2172120	2173680	And I don't have a problem with that.
2173680	2175520	What if people want to buy fart apps?
2175520	2176520	That's fine.
2176520	2177520	You know what?
2177520	2179520	No one's going to say, oh, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.
2179520	2180520	No, you don't buy it.
2180520	2181520	Okay?
2181520	2182520	That's not a big deal.
2182520	2186000	Well, and the whole point too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only
2186000	2189760	really work on something like a phone, something you're going to care about.
2189760	2193120	Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.
2193120	2196720	Does that have, would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the
2196720	2197720	Wii?
2197720	2198720	No?
2198720	2201920	Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring
2201920	2202920	out your phone into it.
2202920	2206120	Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and
2206120	2208680	then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.
2208680	2209680	Yeah.
2209680	2215360	But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer
2215360	2218080	is do people like their games?
2218080	2219720	Because that's really the only difference for them.
2219720	2220720	Oh!
2220720	2224800	Two people developing out of a garage made a popular game, oh well they're an indie developer.
2224800	2229280	You know, large company makes fart app, oh well they're a garage developer.
2229280	2233440	That's really, I think, the only, that's their only excuse.
2233440	2238720	Really, it just comes down to that they're, they're just not embracing what they need
2238720	2241040	to be embracing, the business model that's going to make them money.
2241040	2245400	Some interesting comments, sorry, some interesting comments from chatroom, BlackWolf says XNA
2245400	2248720	indie games sold so well too, or wait.
2248720	2254040	I would say though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft
2254040	2255800	really advertised it at first.
2255800	2259840	Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the
2259840	2260840	real arcade.
2260840	2261840	Like, wasn't that...
2261840	2262840	They do that.
2262840	2263840	Like, do they?
2263840	2265960	They do that, but they have, that, it's, it's so rare though.
2265960	2266960	It's basically...
2266960	2270000	Because I know that dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing, but...
2270000	2275500	It's a competition that they hold each year, and the, like, top few games actually do get
2275500	2280180	published as Xbox Live Arcade games, but that's once a year, and we're talking, like, two
2280180	2283720	to four games, maybe, that get published.
2283720	2288500	And yeah, there is a lot of junk out there, but once again, there's a problem because
2288500	2292800	it wasn't until well after that came out that they actually got a peer rating system for
2292800	2297260	that, and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.
2297260	2301720	People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store, where you
2301720	2306040	can say, okay, well the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just
2306040	2307800	crap, you know, I rated it one star.
2307800	2312120	It's, okay, this game is glitchy, and it doesn't load, or this game is broken, or whatever.
2312120	2314540	The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.
2314540	2318700	It's a clunky way to find good games, and it really screws over those developers who
2318700	2320200	don't land in the top spots.
2320200	2323480	Like, it's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.
2323480	2326760	Like, that's, that's my only thing with XNA is, is like, there's so many games on there,
2326760	2331200	I don't know where to begin, and a lot of the top stuff is poop, and if I go, and a
2331200	2335600	lot of people probably look at that and go, really, if this is the top stuff on XNA?
2335600	2336600	Not all of it.
2336600	2340440	There's some good stuff that gets in there, but, I don't know, I just, I feel like there's,
2340440	2344600	I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong,
2344600	2346360	and it's just the presentation of it all.
2346360	2348000	And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.
2348000	2352080	I get why they put it where they do, but there's ways they could feature it better than they
2352080	2353080	do.
2353080	2354080	You know what I mean?
2354080	2357160	But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony
2357160	2362160	is going to try with PlayStation Suite, and that is something that's on the horizon.
2362160	2365480	PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.
2365480	2366480	For PC, though.
2366480	2371560	I mean, it's, I don't know if that's really going to make a big difference, and it's going
2371560	2376200	to be a little late, because, I mean, we're talking like five years into the console cycle,
2376200	2380760	and they still haven't had something like that.
2380760	2384120	I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leased to
2384120	2389320	Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make
2389320	2390320	games.
2390320	2393720	And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something
2393720	2398680	niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny, I'm going to download that.
2398680	2399880	But that's fine.
2399880	2401740	You don't have to download that.
2401740	2402740	And that's the thing.
2402740	2404920	Nintendo has to understand.
2404920	2408920	Even the stuff that they have people paying, I mean, like, oh, seriously, they have the
2408920	2410960	Major League Eating game.
2410960	2411960	I mean, come on.
2411960	2413000	I mean, come on.
2413000	2415680	Is that really Nintendo quality?
2415680	2420520	I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League
2420520	2422080	Eating on our system.
2422080	2424940	Or like the beer pong game or something like that.
2424940	2426200	There's a lot of crap on there.
2426200	2429880	And the fact that they're just like coming out saying, oh, well, you know, we don't want
2429880	2431920	these garage developers ruining our system.
2431920	2436300	I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system
2436300	2440240	are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.
2440240	2442040	All right.
2442040	2445360	Well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news.
2445360	2446360	But that's okay.
2446360	2447360	We're talking about games.
2447360	2448360	That's how we roll.
2448360	2449360	No, we haven't got the video.
2449360	2450360	Or the news.
2450360	2451840	We want to get to more of the news.
2451840	2452840	But that's okay.
2452840	2454760	Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.
2454760	2456360	Of course, you can always add us on Facebook.
2456360	2457360	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
2457360	2461800	And of course, follow us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R. That's how you can keep tabs
2461800	2462800	with us online.
2462800	2466120	Or visit our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2466120	2470540	Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.
2470540	2473400	Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.
2473400	2476240	Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.
2476240	2478680	Let's get into some video game news for the week.
2478680	2479680	Loki, start us off.
2479680	2481680	Yummy, yummy, yummy news.
2481680	2485000	Now, this is kind of funny.
2485000	2486760	I kind of laughed a little bit.
2486760	2488000	But it's not that big a deal.
2488000	2492280	And I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.
2492280	2495160	Duke Nukem Forever delayed.
2495160	2497360	It's only delayed a month.
2497360	2499600	And that's not a big deal.
2499600	2502620	And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.
2502620	2505200	It was coming out in May.
2505200	2508040	Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.
2508040	2512540	Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A. Noire.
2512540	2513800	Then there's Brink.
2513800	2516000	And then Fear 3.
2516000	2518460	And Hunted, The Demon's Forge.
2518460	2520000	Dungeon Siege 3.
2520000	2522020	MX vs ATV Alive.
2522020	2525440	I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.
2525440	2532000	Lego, I mean, it's not really direct competition, but Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.
2532000	2533480	So I mean.
2533480	2534580	School's letting out, right?
2534580	2536800	So it's like, school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.
2536800	2539080	But it's not typical that May's a busy month.
2539080	2541720	Usually June is a little bit busier.
2541720	2543200	May's kind of eh.
2543200	2545140	And then April's is dead.
2545140	2546320	Which April is still dead.
2546320	2549280	But like last year, they had a lot of good games coming out in May and it kind of worked
2549280	2550280	out for them.
2550280	2553300	So they're kind of doing that again.
2553300	2557840	But it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June, for them at least, because June right
2557840	2559360	now doesn't have much coming out.
2559360	2561280	It has a few AAA games and that's it.
2561280	2566080	I mean, there's stuff that's not announced yet, but very few games compared to May coming
2566080	2567080	out.
2567080	2569080	So, whatever.
2569080	2570080	It's a month.
2570080	2571780	It's not like ten years.
2571780	2576960	Now if it's late again and again and again and again, then, well, you know, there's not
2576960	2579400	really anything we can say about that.
2579400	2580400	Did you watch the little video?
2580400	2581400	I just watched the video.
2581400	2582400	The video was funny.
2582400	2589240	Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know, here, you know, it was, it was pretty, pretty
2589240	2590240	fun.
2590240	2592520	Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.
2592520	2597040	But you know, see, here's the thing, I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some
2597040	2601120	people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in
2601120	2604920	development only as long as Gearbox has had it.
2604920	2609880	Because I don't fault them for the time that 3D Realms had the game, because, in my opinion,
2609880	2615440	they started over, maybe with the assets and so forth, but you know Gearbox basically started
2615440	2616800	from quote-unquote scratch.
2616800	2619660	I mean, maybe there were some scraps here and there that they recycled, but Gearbox
2619660	2621400	probably had to build this game from the ground up.
2621400	2624840	So I don't fault them for the ten year delay this game took.
2624840	2626460	I don't think it was really their fault.
2626460	2627460	So one month, whatever.
2627460	2630240	And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.
2630240	2633760	I mean, they could have, it could have just like, no one could have bought it.
2633760	2637960	They just said, ah, forget it, you know, Duke Nukem's ten years ago, who cares?
2637960	2638960	Right.
2638960	2641680	Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something.
2641680	2642680	Oh, hell no.
2642680	2643680	That wouldn't work.
2643680	2644680	Yeah, I know.
2644680	2645680	It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point you just have to put it
2645680	2646680	out.
2646680	2647680	Yes, I have an idea.
2647680	2651800	Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.
2651800	2655400	Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever if it wasn't delayed
2655400	2656560	at least one more time.
2656560	2660480	And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.
2660480	2666800	And of course, you know, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced, Duke Match,
2666800	2667980	Team Duke Match.
2667980	2674920	But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.
2674920	2678320	And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.
2678320	2684680	But the babe will sporadically freak out, and you have to, I guess, slap her to get
2684680	2685680	her back in line.
2685680	2686680	Oh, great.
2686680	2687680	On the rump.
2687680	2692080	A little playful spank to keep her in line, because that's a good message.
2692080	2695200	They said it in the face, but, well, something.
2695200	2696200	No.
2696200	2697200	Slap.
2697200	2698200	Slap his ass.
2698200	2701440	Is that how I can keep Dark Sakura in line when she yells at me on the show?
2701440	2705840	Bitch, please.
2705840	2712920	I don't want to be a widower at 33.
2712920	2715520	But yeah, I mean, it's Duke Nukem.
2715520	2716520	Come on.
2716520	2718080	I heard Fox News did a thing on it.
2718080	2719080	Come on.
2719080	2720080	Fox News.
2720080	2721080	Fox News is stupid.
2721080	2725480	The media is going to just take this opportunity to say, look at the games you're buying your
2725480	2726480	kids.
2726480	2727480	Look at the games.
2727480	2728480	Look like this.
2728480	2730320	Every single video game is slapping women on the ass.
2730320	2732040	And they will turn you gay.
2732040	2734740	All of them will turn you gay.
2734740	2736400	That's Fox News for you.
2736400	2739440	Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?
2739440	2744160	Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.
2744160	2746160	I don't know.
2746160	2747160	Perhaps.
2747160	2749600	No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.
2749600	2751920	Come on, people.
2751920	2752920	I don't know.
2752920	2754140	Duke Nukem made me very happy.
2754140	2755840	I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.
2755840	2759960	I'm looking forward to this new one, even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.
2759960	2764600	I'm going to be so, so very disappointed that I sort of don't care.
2764600	2769720	It's like, I don't know, it would be like Death Race 3000.
2769720	2774040	I mean, you know, they're never going to live up to the awesomeness that was Death Race
2774040	2775040	2000.
2775040	2779960	Hell, the remake didn't live up to the awesome Roger Corman classic, but you still kind of
2779960	2784760	want to watch it anyways because it's got more killing in it and it's got cheesy stuff.
2784760	2787200	We'll have Jason Statham.
2787200	2788200	And no hand grenade.
2788200	2789200	I mean, come on.
2789200	2790200	That was awesome.
2790200	2791200	Aw.
2791200	2792200	All right.
2792200	2795640	Well, moving on to something a little more artful, maybe you're familiar with a company
2795640	2797800	called The Weinstein Company.
2797800	2801680	This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting
2801680	2805240	into films when they left Miramax, they went their separate ways, right?
2805240	2810160	And they actually put out, or they distributed, they don't, you know, make the movies, but
2810160	2811160	they're a distributor.
2811160	2813640	They distributed The King's Speech, which of course won the Oscar this year.
2813640	2817280	Well, The Weinstein Company is getting into games.
2817280	2823160	They formed this week a strategic consultancy, whatever that means, with Beefy Media.
2823160	2824720	I love that.
2824720	2829240	The Weinstein Company, arthouse maker, films up with, teams up with Beefy Media.
2829240	2833960	Anyhow, they're supposedly going to be capitalizing on Weinstein properties.
2833960	2839680	Now, The Weinstein Company also owns Dimension Films, which is responsible for a lot of the
2839680	2842000	horror movies you see out there right now.
2842000	2845600	So this would include things like Scream, which, you know, is getting a new movie after,
2845600	2852200	what, 10 years, very soon, Halloween, Hellraiser, Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids.
2852200	2854880	All of these would now fall under this possible TWC games table.
2854880	2856880	Because Spy Kids is frightening.
2856880	2860320	Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.
2860320	2864240	I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand
2864240	2865240	they're what?
2865240	2866240	James Bond for kids, right?
2866240	2867240	Pretty much?
2867240	2869280	It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.
2869280	2873600	There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became Lava
2873600	2874600	Girl and Sharkboy.
2874600	2877400	And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.
2877400	2878400	He was Sharkboy.
2878400	2880520	Oh, really?
2880520	2882200	You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.
2882200	2883520	That kind of frightens me.
2883520	2885520	And that's, it was the origin of Machete.
2885520	2886520	Oh, okay.
2886520	2888080	Well, that's okay.
2888080	2892000	So does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under your box?
2892000	2894240	They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.
2894240	2895720	Pulp Fiction was Miramax.
2895720	2898000	I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.
2898000	2900300	So where's my Kill Bill video game?
2900300	2901440	Maybe that could be a part of this.
2901440	2902440	I don't know.
2902440	2903640	It very well could be.
2903640	2904640	Very well could be.
2904640	2907840	Especially if they do a sequel, which they weren't talking about doing.
2907840	2908840	So that's it.
2908840	2912980	You know, obviously no game announcements right now, but they are exploring these brands
2912980	2914480	in the video game universe.
2914480	2917200	I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening.
2917200	2919240	Like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense.
2919240	2923280	And yes, I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago.
2923280	2928880	And you may remember, I mean it's not unlike, you know, movie studios to get into the game
2928880	2929880	business.
2929880	2932160	Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.
2932160	2938480	I mean, Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot, they don't do anything console-wise
2938480	2939480	right now.
2939480	2943520	They like some online downloadable games.
2943520	2946120	But Warner Games is a big one, for sure.
2946120	2947120	And Disney.
2947120	2948120	Disney Interactive.
2948120	2949120	All right.
2949120	2954720	Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future, but right now, nothing but an announcement.
2954720	2958520	And who knows, maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5.
2958520	2959520	Or 6.
2959520	2960520	Or 21.
2960520	2961520	Whatever.
2961520	2965840	Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.
2965840	2969640	Which is, I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies
2969640	2975520	like Saw and all that stuff, but to me, Scream is like, I don't know, like, Scream is okay.
2975520	2977960	I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not like Saw sick.
2977960	2979960	I didn't mind the Scream movie, actually.
2979960	2980960	Yeah, Scream's cute.
2980960	2982360	I was just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?
2982360	2983360	Showgirls.
2983360	2987160	Yeah, Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.
2987160	2988160	I'll see those.
2988160	2989160	Yeah.
2989160	2993680	I just hope that Hayden Panterre is the before-the-credits killing.
2993680	2994720	No spoilers in chat.
2994720	2995720	I will destroy you.
2995720	2996720	All right.
2996720	2997720	Dark Saga.
2997720	2998720	Well.
2998720	3003000	Well, speaking of kids' movies and scary, Pokemons!
3003000	3004000	Yay!
3004000	3010520	Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold two million units in the first
3010520	3017120	two weeks in the U.S., and five million plus copies in Japan, so, uh, yeah, they've made
3017120	3019520	their money.
3019520	3021920	Seven million people playing the game.
3021920	3024520	Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.
3024520	3030280	Well, we were at, um, at Dimple, which is a local resell place, and they're saying that
3030280	3034160	basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.
3034160	3035160	Oh, I'm sure.
3035160	3036160	Yeah, so.
3036160	3037160	I can-
3037160	3038160	Kids eat this shit up.
3038160	3041440	Hell, adults eat this stuff up, too, like, you know, Miek LaTov, who's been on this show
3041440	3042440	in the past.
3042440	3044560	And he was playing Black and White, but he imported them.
3044560	3046700	He imported it and he got the regular ones.
3046700	3047700	But you know what?
3047700	3053400	Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?
3053400	3055800	Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.
3055800	3057960	Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.
3057960	3063080	The character I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old
3063080	3064880	school Black and White Game Boy.
3064880	3065880	You know what I mean?
3065880	3070480	Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.
3070480	3072840	Maybe Black and White does something different that I haven't seen yet.
3072840	3074840	I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.
3074840	3075840	I do kind of want to play it.
3075840	3077840	Oh, Black and White, you can collect poop.
3077840	3078840	Oh, yay.
3078840	3081080	And their poop does special things.
3081080	3083360	Oh, hooray.
3083360	3085360	So yeah.
3085360	3090880	Anyhow, so yeah, I'll probably check that out eventually, but you know there's going
3090880	3092420	to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.
3092420	3093420	You know what?
3093420	3094420	Pokemon...
3094420	3095420	You know what?
3095420	3096760	I'm done with Pokemon.
3096760	3098920	I'm really done.
3098920	3102680	I would never say never, because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?
3102680	3106400	Okay, that's different, but I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.
3106400	3108840	Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.
3108840	3111520	I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.
3111520	3114640	There is sort of one that someone made called PokeFarm, like a website.
3114640	3120360	I mean, official Reggie Fils-Aime coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have
3120360	3122360	been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.
3122360	3123360	You know Nintendo wouldn't do an MMO.
3123360	3126200	I have it tied to my harem of women down here.
3126200	3128360	You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.
3128360	3129680	Too much that they couldn't.
3129680	3133180	If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would
3133180	3137040	want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.
3137040	3139300	It'd be something like Animal Crossing.
3139300	3143080	I think too, a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs, because
3143080	3148360	Pokemon is so much for kids, like, you know, it would be an MMO with pre-determined phrases
3148360	3152740	that you can say, and you know, it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO, but that would
3152740	3159280	be better than nothing, but that's just me, so.
3159280	3165760	The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.
3165760	3172280	I read a list a couple days ago, it was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries
3172280	3175280	that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game, and it's like, this
3175280	3179040	Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.
3179040	3180040	Cubone!
3180040	3181040	Yeah.
3181040	3182040	It was Cubone.
3182040	3183040	Yeah.
3183040	3184040	What?
3184040	3185040	Really?
3185040	3187400	This one is the soul of the dead child who comes back and eats other souls.
3187400	3191520	I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and
3191520	3195600	there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed, and it's supposed
3195600	3198280	to be like an alien thing, but it's still like, dude!
3198280	3199560	Not cool!
3199560	3202400	You know?
3202400	3206800	This might be, why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that.
3206800	3209680	Maybe that hits a little close to home, especially for kids.
3209680	3212440	Anyhow, let's move on.
3212440	3214120	More gaming news, Loki.
3214120	3220040	Yeah, so there's some rumored features that are going to be coming to Forza 4.
3220040	3222760	This is coming from a special survey that they had.
3222760	3228680	Of course, a survey that was not supposed to be leaked out, but I don't know what was.
3228680	3233000	So, some of the information that people have gathered are speculating coming from there.
3233000	3238920	Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able
3238920	3242000	to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.
3242000	3246600	So they're going to have some controller-free racing.
3246600	3249480	I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.
3249480	3250480	Like the U-Force?
3250480	3256120	Like the U-Force or like Joyride.
3256120	3262160	They're saying it's going to support over 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.
3262160	3269880	They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode, a new career mode involving an
3269880	3272280	automotive world tour.
3272280	3277320	They're going to increase the variety in challenges and events that you participate in.
3277320	3283880	The game's going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and
3283880	3286400	shading models.
3286400	3290600	Also I guess they're saying that...
3290600	3292040	This is kind of cool.
3292040	3293360	They're going to be doing...
3293360	3298120	And once again, this is all you need to do in your damn games.
3298120	3303800	Just make it better with Kinect by introducing head tracking.
3303800	3305640	Awesome.
3305640	3311740	And I guess they're going to also have voice control for menus and air faces.
3311740	3312740	That is awesome.
3312740	3314640	But hey, head tracking.
3314640	3315640	It's not that difficult.
3315640	3318800	Add it to every single goddamn first person shooter that you have.
3318800	3319800	Done.
3319800	3320800	I mean you don't need to have...
3320800	3322360	You're still using a controller.
3322360	3324600	It's just tracking your head to make it slightly more realistic.
3324600	3326200	I have to admit that would be kind of cool.
3326200	3327440	Why is that so difficult?
3327440	3329440	I mean it...
3329440	3330440	Nintendo could be...
3330440	3333920	As much as I am not a fan of the 3D metroids, it's the first thing that comes to mind with
3333920	3337840	like a Nintendo backed first person shooter that would be really cool with the head tracking.
3337840	3340800	Could you imagine a time crisis with head tracking?
3340800	3344280	Where you peek over or around a corner?
3344280	3345280	That would be cool.
3345280	3347760	Police 9-1-1?
3347760	3350200	Which was also one of the few machines they had at Roseville Golf Land.
3350200	3351200	So police 9-1-1-2.
3351200	3353760	One of the few machines they had that was working.
3353760	3354760	I know, right?
3354760	3357280	They should have, what was it, rescue 9-1-1.
3357280	3358600	Sir William Shatner.
3358600	3359600	No.
3359600	3360600	Well.
3360600	3362400	Quick comment from our chat room at chat.orchestlandtrader.com.
3362400	3365400	They're behind a little bit because of the delay, so it goes back to the Pokemon story.
3365400	3367500	Act F wanted to correct something saying it's not...
3367500	3370120	It's actually not called ground zero though.
3370120	3371280	It's called Relic Castle.
3371280	3373400	Maybe it was something to do with the translations.
3373400	3375000	One of my friends is saying something.
3375000	3377240	But of course, you know how rumors go.
3377240	3378240	So alright, fine.
3378240	3379240	There you go.
3379240	3381480	A little correction issue there.
3381480	3385640	Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza.
3385640	3388240	Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.
3388240	3390520	I don't know.
3390520	3391520	Head tracking.
3391520	3395840	I'm very interested to see that implemented in more games.
3395840	3397920	I really think it's a good idea and it's simple.
3397920	3401440	If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to
3401440	3402440	be like, oh casual.
3402440	3403440	Head tracking.
3403440	3404440	That's all you got to do.
3404440	3405440	And you can even say, hey look.
3405440	3406440	It puts you in the game.
3406440	3407440	And guess what?
3407440	3409600	You don't have to use the stupid, you know, Kinect stuff if you don't want to.
3409600	3410600	That's awesome.
3410600	3414100	Well, now, I don't know if you guys remember when Nintendo did this.
3414100	3416300	This was way before the 3DS.
3416300	3417840	Way before the Game Boy.
3417840	3418840	Even the NES.
3418840	3421800	They used to do these little LCD Game and Watch games.
3421800	3423200	That's where Mr. Game and Watch comes from.
3423200	3424200	I've got a couple.
3424200	3425200	Yeah, I know.
3425200	3426200	The old school stuff.
3426200	3428080	The old Mario Brothers one and some other ones.
3428080	3429560	I had the Cenet Mixer one.
3429560	3430560	Oh, good times.
3430560	3431560	Yeah.
3431560	3433920	So yeah, these Game and Watch games are really old school.
3433920	3436320	They even have like a Donkey Kong Jr. one and so forth.
3436320	3440640	Well, there's this new website that came out this week and, or at least caught wind on
3440640	3444640	the game blogs this week called Pikapeak.com.
3444640	3446200	No that's not a Pikachu thing.
3446200	3447400	It's maybe Pikapik.
3447400	3448400	I don't know.
3448400	3452160	P-I-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to check this out.
3452160	3457360	You can actually play a variety of the Game and Watch LCD games, at least until this website
3457360	3458360	gets shut down.
3458360	3463160	But really, Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game and Watch
3463160	3464160	games.
3464160	3465160	I don't know.
3465160	3466160	So yeah, I'm on it right now.
3466160	3468780	I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here.
3468780	3469780	Let's see.
3469780	3472320	What did I find here?
3472320	3473320	Otto Slalom.
3473320	3475320	That doesn't look like fun.
3475320	3478240	I want to play Mario Brothers or something.
3478240	3479240	Mary Cook.
3479240	3481440	Oh, I remember this one.
3481440	3482440	Good times.
3482440	3483440	Oh, you can even move back and forth.
3483440	3484440	That's done very well.
3484440	3488320	Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S
3488320	3490920	and K. So let's see if we can start.
3490920	3492440	Here we go.
3492440	3495320	Good times.
3495320	3497280	Listen to the sounds of LCD games.
3497280	3498280	That's right.
3498280	3500120	This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.
3500120	3502120	Ooh, it looks like it's Russian.
3502120	3506440	Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.
3506440	3509320	Anyhow, good times.
3509320	3510320	So check that out.
3510320	3515280	T-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain
3515280	3517960	you for like five minutes.
3517960	3523640	Well let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.
3523640	3530860	There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness
3530860	3535920	of the romance in Dragon Age 2.
3535920	3540960	And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer.
3540960	3545880	And that he didn't like that...
3545880	3548200	Basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.
3548200	3550880	He's like, we are your demographic.
3550880	3553160	You need to cater to us.
3553160	3556120	Basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.
3556120	3557120	We play the Sims.
3557120	3558120	Yeah.
3558120	3562240	And he's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us
3562240	3563760	male gamers were happy.
3563760	3568040	And he said, now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you
3568040	3569040	don't speak for me.
3569040	3570040	I love Dragon Age 2.
3570040	3575160	But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.
3575160	3580160	He also uses commas very poorly.
3580160	3587560	So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of Bioware.
3587560	3593840	Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer,
3593840	3595840	we know you don't.
3595840	3600080	I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight
3600080	3603160	male gamers out there.
3603160	3606920	And basically saying, you know, I'll read a few lines here and there.
3606920	3609720	It says, the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer.
3609720	3610900	They're for everyone.
3610900	3614480	We have a lot of fans, many of whom are neither straight nor male, and they deserve no less
3614480	3615560	attention.
3615560	3619040	We have good numbers, after all, on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of
3619040	3624440	content in DAO, and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea
3624440	3627240	that the numbers are not insignificant.
3627240	3634800	And basically going on, you know, it's basically saying, yeah, we don't care, you need to get
3634800	3638000	your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world.
3638000	3642800	And there's one paragraph, if you don't mind me reading it, that is like the most awesome
3642800	3643800	thing.
3643800	3648800	It's about lies to the world in general, and I think everyone needs to take this to heart.
3648800	3652600	And if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility, it has to do
3652600	3653760	with privilege.
3653760	3657540	You can write it off as political correctness if you wish, but the truth is that privilege
3657540	3659640	always lies with the majority.
3659640	3664040	They're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance.
3664040	3667440	They don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them.
3667440	3669760	What's everyone's fuss all about?
3669760	3671080	That's the way it should be.
3671080	3675560	Anybody else should get used to not getting what they want.
3675560	3681600	It's basically saying, well, yeah, everyone else might have catered to you, but hi, this
3681600	3684760	is the real world and the universe doesn't revolve around you.
3684760	3689120	And the part of the argument I don't get is that the game doesn't force you to do any
3689120	3690640	particular path.
3690640	3697000	Like, it's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.
3697000	3701320	And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.
3701320	3703440	This is an insanely popular series with women.
3703440	3704440	Tiara is a big fan.
3704440	3705440	Oh, yeah.
3705440	3709000	I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.
3709000	3714160	And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.
3714160	3715960	I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.
3715960	3716960	They were so cute.
3716960	3717960	They were so adorable.
3717960	3720640	How could anybody be upset about that?
3720640	3726300	And on top of that, it gave you options that you could not go through with the romance.
3726300	3730800	You could say the quote, wrong thing to make the romance not happen.
3730800	3735120	It was totally like, it was, it was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.
3735120	3738120	And what I also don't understand where this dude is coming from is it's like, well, have
3738120	3740800	you ever watched an episode of Will and Grace?
3740800	3745560	Like did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out or something?
3745560	3746640	You know what I mean?
3746640	3751060	It's kind of like, what's the big, even if, even if there really wasn't an option, a good
3751060	3752360	game is still a good game.
3752360	3753840	A good story is a good story.
3753840	3756200	It's kind of like, what's your big...
3756200	3760360	And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a
3760360	3771680	bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I would say, homocentric is there's gotta
3771680	3777400	be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well this makes me uncomfortable
3777400	3782440	and it's gotta be personal insecurity, I think.
3782440	3786360	My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play
3786360	3790920	him as, with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the
3790920	3796280	male NPCs that you could do a same sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit
3796280	3801880	so that it's, you know, the way that the game is set up is to where you can tell, okay,
3801880	3806660	well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.
3806660	3813480	I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility even if it's
3813480	3816460	not something that they would RP into the game themselves.
3816460	3820800	Like they basically, if there is a same sex option, they want it buried so deep that you
3820800	3822940	have to go to Game Facts and look up how to do it.
3822940	3828820	They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game because they don't
3828820	3829820	like it.
3829820	3833860	And you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.
3833860	3835500	It doesn't matter.
3835500	3840880	You're going to have to get used to, you know, things are going to happen in life that you're
3840880	3842920	not comfortable with.
3842920	3847060	Things are going to happen that are not fitting in with your worldview.
3847060	3848060	Get used to it.
3848060	3849060	It's called reality.
3849060	3850500	Let me also kind of phrase it this way.
3850500	3853780	I'm sure this guy doesn't listen to the show, but let me like just kind of give you a dose
3853780	3855700	of reality.
3855700	3857580	Flip the tables, dude.
3857580	3863840	I am a homosexual gamer and have been forever and I have to play through all these games
3863840	3865940	that have straight storylines.
3865940	3870620	Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these
3870620	3871620	games?
3871620	3873160	No, because they're stories.
3873160	3879060	And like for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays
3879060	3882260	a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.
3882260	3886280	Like I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the
3886280	3889940	time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time
3889940	3893000	was so, you know, emotionally moving.
3893000	3897620	Did I, was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?
3897620	3902260	No, that's like, it does, a good story is a good story.
3902260	3903260	You know what I mean?
3903260	3908740	Well, I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.
3908740	3914140	You think about this, when you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.
3914140	3919700	And if it's in your character's nature to, you know, flirt with a girl, then you stay
3919700	3921040	within your character's nature.
3921040	3925080	If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.
3925080	3931740	If they are completely, you know, say you're playing like the most uptight paladin, they're
3931740	3934380	supposed to get uncomfortable whenever and anyone flirts with them.
3934380	3935740	You know, that's the type of thing.
3935740	3938940	You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing it if it's immersive enough
3938940	3940480	of a game.
3940480	3944620	And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.
3944620	3945620	I don't know.
3945620	3951940	I mean, but the whole point of you, the whole thing is that you are in game as your character.
3951940	3957300	Unless it's saying you are you in the game, but no, you're playing this person that's
3957300	3959740	living in this life at this time.
3959740	3964540	And yeah, I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable, you know, show a little bit
3964540	3965540	of interest?
3965540	3966540	Hmm?
3966540	3967540	It's just ridiculous.
3967540	3970300	Bro dude needs to get over it.
3970300	3972780	And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.
3972780	3976520	B if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're
3976520	3978380	forced to watch anal sex.
3978380	3979380	Okay.
3979380	3980380	I mean, let's be real.
3980380	3981380	It's a fade.
3981380	3984300	It's artful and you know, whatever.
3984300	3989600	It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters
3989600	3993320	you're not comfortable with, but let's face it, there's no game that's tacky like that
3993320	3994320	at all.
3994320	3996860	Except maybe the guy game.
3996860	3999000	How many years ago was that?
3999000	4000000	It's just the point.
4000000	4007020	I mean, and if you're that insecure, then you know what, go find yourself a good therapist
4007020	4011060	and deal with your insecurities instead of taking them out on developer of the game who
4011060	4013220	is catering to their audience.
4013220	4017540	Essex in our chat room says, I'm a big old queen, but I love Lulu in Final Fantasy X
4017540	4018540	just for that outfit.
4018540	4019540	Right?
4019540	4020540	I know.
4020540	4021540	She was beautiful and vicious.
4021540	4023980	I was pissed that she wasn't really a central character in 10 too.
4023980	4027120	I was a little upset though that she didn't look pregnant.
4027120	4028120	That's true.
4028120	4031260	Canyon in our chat room says my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.
4031260	4033780	There you go.
4033780	4039780	In a Final Fantasy X too, they made Lulu a stay at home mom.
4039780	4040780	Totally destroyed her form.
4040780	4041780	10 too.
4041780	4042780	Oh, 10 too.
4042780	4043780	That's right.
4043780	4044780	All right.
4044780	4046540	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates, some games coming
4046540	4052340	out soon to a Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.
4052340	4053340	Yes.
4053340	4055540	Um, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
4055540	4059580	Um, you know, not to mention, I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming
4059580	4062540	out today because, well, it's today and not next week.
4062540	4065660	Um, some other cool stuff though that will be coming our way.
4065660	4071780	WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii and the PSP.
4071780	4077220	Um, if you're looking for like an arcade style WWE game, kind of, uh, reminds me of like
4077220	4082060	stuff that they had way back on, like the Super Nintendo NES, that kind of stuff.
4082060	4088660	Um, Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360, of course a tie-in with the new movie, Hop on
4088660	4097460	Nintendo DS, um, let's see, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation
4097460	4110780	3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii, um, Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition
4110780	4118780	that's, uh, coming out on PSP as well, um, Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3 and
4118780	4129180	Xbox 360, uh, NASCAR 11 on, uh, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Country Dance, um, taking
4129180	4133820	the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it, of course it's not actually
4133820	4138840	by Ubisoft, it's kind of a knock-off, but, you know, same type of thing.
4138840	4143820	And that'll be on the Wii, uh, Pinkalicious, based off of like some children's book, that's
4143820	4149720	on Nintendo DS, Zuzu Puppies, yes, it's not hamsters anymore, it's just, you know, animals,
4149720	4157420	so now that's coming out on Nintendo DS, and, um, and that would be it.
4157420	4161620	Again, the chat's delayed a little bit, but I have to read this comment from chat, because
4161620	4165500	I love it so much, before I get to the Japanese release dates, Bochikawa in our chatroom
4165500	4169980	says, if it's a choice, it's a choice in a game, you've got another choice, don't play
4169980	4171980	the game.
4171980	4172980	Well said, my friend.
4172980	4176660	Alright, on to Japanese release dates, what's coming out in Japan very soon.
4176660	4181020	On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360, as well as a game
4181020	4186660	called Nailed, no, that is not a sexual connotation, it actually looks like an ATV racing game,
4186660	4194580	I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah, Top Spin 4, the, uh, did you see
4194580	4198020	that very controversial Serena Williams commercial, I don't think it made our show world tonight,
4198020	4200500	did you see that, uh, Top Spin 4 commercial?
4200500	4201500	It was dumb.
4201500	4212500	It was not even that, that controversial at all, so, alright, um, also moving on to, uh,
4212500	4217680	releases on the Playstation 3, Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Top Spin
4217680	4224460	4 there as well, um, moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing, cause things have dried up there
4224460	4225460	a little bit.
4225460	4231580	Um, on the 3DS, March 31st, uh, you have to look forward to Blaze Blue Continuum Shift
4231580	4238500	2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imakai Sakyo Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then,
4238500	4242220	uh, a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4 themed stuff.
4242220	4243980	You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?
4243980	4244980	You got it.
4244980	4245980	So forth.
4245980	4248980	Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here, cause sadly there's, like, nothing really
4248980	4254060	coming out on the 360 or the PS3, but granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now,
4254060	4257340	I'm sure some things kind of got moved around, so, you know.
4257340	4262100	Uh, lastly on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift
4262100	4269220	2 is out there as well, and, and, and, Oni Chambara Special, yeah, March 31st.
4269220	4270860	Let's move on to Europe!
4270860	4277340	Well, not a whole bunch, it's a short list, um, on the 30th we have Islands of Wakku,
4277340	4287100	and Strania the Stella Machina, I guess, Machina, um, that makes me think of your cat.
4287100	4288100	The Stella Machina?
4288100	4289100	The Stella Machina.
4289100	4291100	She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.
4291100	4292100	No.
4292100	4294500	She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.
4294500	4296140	So I've seen.
4296140	4302260	And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse, which, as Loki
4302260	4304220	would have us believe, is awesome.
4304220	4307540	It is very awesome.
4307540	4309660	Is it like, ah, awesome?
4309660	4310660	Yes it is.
4310660	4311660	It's O-Face, apparently.
4311660	4312660	It is that awesome.
4312660	4317160	Alright, let's move on with some more news, we're just a little ways away from the classic
4317160	4320900	game of the week, real good one this week too, one that I think a lot of you have played,
4320900	4323540	but we'll get there after a couple more news stories.
4323540	4333740	Ah, yes, um, so, this is always fun, um, Sony, and I don't really know if this is a big deal,
4333740	4340620	but I guess they're transferring the online service operations, um, to a new division
4340620	4343820	of their company, I guess.
4343820	4348980	The Sony Network Entertainment Inc. instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America
4348980	4351460	and that kind of stuff.
4351460	4352460	I don't know.
4352460	4356820	Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.
4356820	4362180	It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like, I don't know, the people
4362180	4367060	that run Ragnarok online or something like that, although that would be quite funny.
4367060	4368660	I love Ragnarok.
4368660	4373140	But um, yeah, okay, so, I don't know, a lot of people are covering this and yeah, it's
4373140	4379140	coming, the change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into
4379140	4384820	a new terms of service, blah blah blah, I mean, so what?
4384820	4390100	So they're changing the name of that division.
4390100	4392260	It's more of like a consolidation thing.
4392260	4393420	It really doesn't seem like a big deal.
4393420	4397420	I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot
4397420	4401540	of our listeners do, I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always
4401540	4404060	gives us the PSN updates and all that.
4404060	4408980	It's consolidating with the one on the Playstation 3 and it sounds like a good thing.
4408980	4414060	It's probably all moving towards something more unified for the NGP or whatever they
4414060	4415780	ultimately call that thing.
4415780	4420500	And honestly, if Microsoft does it, with the Zune points or whatever, I guess the Zune
4420500	4424340	isn't around anymore, but you know what I mean, like the points for Microsoft on the
4424340	4430100	360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune or on your PC through Windows
4430100	4433440	Media, it's just competitive or whatever.
4433440	4437160	It's no big deal, really.
4437160	4442780	But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.
4442780	4445460	I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.
4445460	4446460	No, it's not.
4446460	4447460	It's just, whatever.
4447460	4448460	They're changing something.
4448460	4451860	They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.
4451860	4457140	They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account
4457140	4458140	or...
4458140	4459140	I don't know.
4459140	4463260	I'd be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.
4463260	4465180	That's all that matters.
4465180	4470180	Alright, a couple updates for you on what's going on in the gaming community for Japan
4470180	4472640	Relief and the tragedy that's happened over there.
4472640	4474260	Some really cool stuff happening at Sega.
4474260	4478020	Sega is auctioning off some very rare collectibles.
4478020	4481780	There is a Valkyria Chronicles poster that's going to be auctioned off.
4481780	4485660	A Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off.
4485660	4487140	Lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega.
4487140	4491660	If you want to see more information on that, go to their blogs, blogs.sega.com.
4491660	4494220	A Yakuza track jacket.
4494220	4495220	There's a lot of...
4495220	4496220	A Dreamcast bag.
4496220	4501100	There's like, I'm sure, tons of stuff in here where DarkSocko would be like, what?
4501100	4503020	She's like, I have four of those already.
4503020	4507860	Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3, I know she doesn't
4507860	4508860	have that.
4508860	4512260	Or Virtua Tennis Sweatbands, I don't think I've seen those before.
4512260	4517020	But how about an Outrun art signed by Yu Suzuki, I bet Dan would be all over that.
4517020	4520340	I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.
4520340	4521660	Alright.
4521660	4525020	But still, it's for Japan Relief, so it is a good cause.
4525020	4526020	It's a good cause.
4526020	4527020	It's a great cause.
4527020	4531720	Alright, also going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.
4531720	4536620	It's something that's on Facebook right now, and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.
4536620	4537620	What is it?
4537620	4541780	It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.
4541780	4545380	It's gonna be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed
4545380	4547060	to be on TV.
4547060	4551900	But it's gonna feature folks throughout the gaming industry, Tim Schafer, Peter Molyneux,
4551900	4556780	all these folks talking about how the Japanese have impacted the gaming industry for us and
4556780	4559460	how the Japanese will continue to shape it in the future.
4559460	4564220	And you know, folks from G4 and Destructoid are gonna take part in this as well.
4564220	4569260	So you can check out more information on that, gamersheartjapan.com.
4569260	4572340	And that's a whole special thing they're gonna put together that's just, you know, I think
4572340	4574540	it's kind of similar to what the music industry did.
4574540	4577220	You saw a lot of like music industry, Heart Japan.
4577220	4580900	I wouldn't even say I saw somewhere on the internet like voice actors for anime, Heart
4580900	4581900	Japan.
4581900	4584660	I don't remember what they called it, but there's a lot of this like Heart Japan stuff
4584660	4588060	going on right now, and you know, all for a great cause.
4588060	4593700	So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty
4593700	4594700	good.
4594700	4599060	Like even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually
4599060	4601100	sounds like an interesting special.
4601100	4605680	And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.
4605680	4606740	So very cool.
4606740	4611500	I kind of, it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming
4611500	4614900	industry to like a telethon type thing.
4614900	4620260	Like you remember when another big tragedy happened, Katrina and George Clooney put together
4620260	4624020	all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief.
4624020	4629540	This kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a, you know, different type of
4629540	4630540	tragedy.
4630540	4632540	So kind of neat.
4632540	4634180	Definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds.
4634180	4635180	I think it's a good idea.
4635180	4636220	I think it's a great idea.
4636220	4638740	So I'll be checking that out myself.
4638740	4643020	All right, for now though, let's move on into the classic game of the week.
4643020	4646620	You know, every week here on the show, we like to take a trip down memory lane and look
4646620	4651580	at a game that helped us become who we are today.
4651580	4655460	And this is a game that is near and dear to all of our hearts here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4655460	4656460	It's not a music game.
4656460	4657460	It's something else that's pretty awesome.
4657460	4659500	It is dark soccer's classic game of the week.
4659500	4662940	She's going to jump in the vault right now and pull that game for us.
4662940	4663940	Dark soccer.
4663940	4664940	What is the classic game of the week?
4664940	4671220	Classic game of the week is dark stalkers, which in Japan was known as vampire and in
4671220	4674780	Europe as vampire hunter.
4674780	4683860	There was a trilogy of these fantastic, super fun and one of my favorite games ever.
4683860	4688020	I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before where we had the World
4688020	4689780	Cup soccer and Killer Instinct.
4689780	4695340	Well, this was another game that we had and there's this one guy who was super epically
4695340	4699220	awesome at this game and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did and I felt so accomplished.
4699220	4703260	But yeah, there were three different games in the series.
4703260	4707060	There was a vampire slash dark soccer's.
4707060	4712100	There was vampire hunter slash night warriors, which is the second one and vampire savior.
4712100	4715980	And then there was a vampire hunter two and a vampire savior two.
4715980	4720180	There were sort of upgraded versions and then the rereleases which came out later.
4720180	4727860	So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this
4727860	4732500	particular universe and hunters, but you've got, you know, your vampires.
4732500	4737440	You have your ghost, your demon possessions, your zombies.
4737440	4738440	The characters of the game.
4738440	4743580	There was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbien, who was the werewolf, Victor
4743580	4750100	von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein's monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was
4750100	4757140	the succubus, Anna Kars, who's a mummy, Felicia, the cat woman, Bishamon, who was this possessed
4757140	4759980	samurai armor.
4759980	4767500	You had Riku, who was the fish man and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch, what a shock.
4767500	4774260	And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot,
4774260	4779260	like an ancient Aztec robot and Pyron, who is this flame guy.
4779260	4783220	And it was a pretty cool game, lots of fun, very street fightery.
4783220	4787860	You could air block and crouch walk and had chain combos and different things.
4787860	4792260	You had a super combo, so you could do a special attack.
4792260	4797580	And it actually would, though, drain as you played if you didn't keep doing stuff to refill
4797580	4798580	it.
4798580	4803460	It came out on PlayStation in 96 and had a new opening theme, which was really cool.
4803460	4808100	But it was the theme for the American Dogstalkers animated series, which was kind of crap.
4808100	4811860	And then we had Vampire Hunter, or Night Warriors, as it came out over here.
4811860	4815260	So we got Donovan and Sienko in there.
4815260	4820940	And you could also play as Huitzil and Pyron, still the bosses.
4820940	4826540	And you had a normal mode, and then you had an easy mode that was an auto block mode and
4826540	4827540	different chain combos.
4827540	4830340	And it came out on the Saturn, which I've got this version.
4830340	4832720	Super, super awesome game.
4832720	4836860	It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the US.
4836860	4840260	And of course, the Japanese version was the same, because the Saturn had more memory for
4840260	4841260	it.
4841260	4847580	So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jetta, who was totally
4847580	4855980	my character for a while, and Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.
4855980	4860380	And QB, who was always fun, and baby Bonnie Hood, which she actually had a better name
4860380	4861380	in Japan.
4861380	4863740	It was Bulleta.
4863740	4865580	She was super fun to use.
4865580	4869820	And I love her ending, because it's like this monster family watching TV.
4869820	4873500	There's been this massacre, and everyone will watch out for a human person.
4873500	4875940	They're like, oh, these humans are so scary.
4875940	4876940	Keep us safe, daddy.
4876940	4878500	I'll protect you, son.
4878500	4883180	And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and
4883180	4884180	everything.
4884180	4885180	But anyway.
4885180	4887980	Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.
4887980	4894420	And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4-meg RAM cartridge.
4894420	4896020	Got this one, too.
4896020	4899340	And so it was fully arcade perfect.
4899340	4902140	It was fantastic.
4902140	4906580	And you could play as...
4906580	4908980	It was all kinds of different bonus characters in it.
4908980	4916140	You had Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.
4916140	4919060	Shadow basically was...
4919060	4925380	You could assume the identity of the defeated character in there, and then...
4925380	4929460	So if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan, that type of game.
4929460	4931660	It was really cool.
4931660	4935100	And of course, like I said, there was also the upgraded ones.
4935100	4942420	There's Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2 that were the upgraded versions.
4942420	4944540	Different tweaks.
4944540	4948260	You also had slightly different...
4948260	4954140	I think that they redid some of the sprites for it, too, if I'm correct.
4954140	4959260	And you also had Bishamon and Shadow as the secret characters, and you had Marionette
4959260	4962140	that were basically mirror matches.
4962140	4964980	And then there were the re-releases.
4964980	4969940	There's Vampire Chronicle, which was the one that came out on Dreamcast.
4969940	4972660	It was a Dreamcast direct mail order.
4972660	4975100	And I believe I have that one, too.
4975100	4976340	Pretty sure I do.
4976340	4979380	And it came out over here as Dark Sulkish Chronicle, the Chaos Tower.
4979380	4983000	There's a PSP version.
4983000	4988900	There's also Dark Sulkers Collection that came out on PS2 in 2005.
4988900	4992460	And then there was an animated series that was kind of crap.
4992460	4996340	And then the OAV series, which is actually kind of cool, called Vampire Hunter the Animation
4996340	4998360	Series put out by Viz.
4998360	5002900	There were manga, different comics that came out.
5002900	5010500	And then there was Dark Sulkers graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards
5010500	5011500	and concept art.
5011500	5012500	But that was put out by Udon.
5012500	5016540	Udon is fantastic in their Capcom related art.
5016540	5019060	I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.
5019060	5021300	They are amazing artists.
5021300	5025460	Their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.
5025460	5036780	And then in Love Hina, actually, there were the main female characters were the costumes
5036780	5043380	of Boletta, Sienko, Felicia for Halloween in chapter 86 of the manga.
5043380	5047540	And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia and Sienko.
5047540	5054660	So this is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.
5054660	5063740	UGO ranked it as number 19 and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Dark
5063740	5064740	Sulkers coming out.
5064740	5065740	That'll be awesome.
5065740	5069380	I don't know how founded that is, but.
5069380	5073380	Well here's a comment from Mr. J100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.
5073380	5077940	I remember the MVC 3 panel at New York Comic Con someone asked the devs if they would consider
5077940	5080540	making a Dark Sulkers sequel or remake.
5080540	5085460	Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting
5085460	5086460	it.
5086460	5087460	Get on it.
5087460	5093380	Well, you know what, imagine, okay look how well Street Fighter 4 did.
5093380	5095820	Look how Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.
5095820	5100660	It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Dark Sulkers game.
5100660	5105460	Bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then throw in some new ones.
5105460	5108500	You've got all kinds of supernatural mythos out there.
5108500	5112340	There's that Street Fighter cross Tekken game though still on the way that I think has gone
5112340	5114300	to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.
5114300	5118900	Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.
5118900	5120740	That's the classic game.
5120740	5125660	Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic, Dark Sulkers, what's that?
5125660	5128460	Another hidden character, Dee.
5128460	5134860	Which was the fully, you know Donovan was half Dark Sulkers, well there was the version
5134860	5137820	of him that was all evil and vampirey.
5137820	5142100	And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following
5142100	5145460	around with him, only she's older, but it fades out and that's his ending.
5145460	5146460	Alright.
5146460	5150980	Well there it is, your classic game of the week, Dark Sulkers from the arcade by Capcom
5150980	5154740	and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Dark Sulkers
5154740	5155740	is definitely not forgotten.
5155740	5158760	Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back
5158760	5162660	with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com
5162660	5163780	slash o-l-r.
5163780	5168020	Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news, then we'll
5168020	5171740	get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of The
5171740	5176100	Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.
5176100	5179780	We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after
5179780	5186980	this.
5186980	5189340	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5189340	5195580	We are live on this Sunday evening, March the 27th of 2011 with our 407th episode of
5195580	5197020	Orange Lounge Radio.
5197020	5201260	Welcome back, we had a fun first half talking a little bit about the 3DS launch and talking
5201260	5204060	about BioWare and Forza and some other stuff too.
5204060	5208420	We're going to get into plenty more gaming news and your twitter topics in just a minute
5208420	5213380	here, but first we want to do some rapid fire news right after we do some plugs for our
5213380	5217100	spinoff shows, or side projects if you will.
5217100	5220420	Dark Soccer, I believe your side project had a pretty big show this week, right?
5220420	5224340	Yes, we had a fantastic show.
5224340	5231880	The show that I do is called Comic Insanity, and it's basically comics, I do this with
5231880	5236500	Tiara, who you've heard on the show, she's hosted before, Mar and Marvel, and also with
5236500	5242820	Dan Shadow, and we basically discussed comics, but we had a special guest for our recording
5242820	5249940	today, which you can hear on Tuesday, downloaded from Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.
5249940	5258580	We had Todd Stashwick on the show, and he is doing, actually writing an online comic.
5258580	5266380	It's called Devil Inside, it's on his website, ToddStashwick.com, but he's also known in the
5266380	5274300	TV sci-fi fan community as kind of a monster and bad guy, you know, he's taken those kinds
5274300	5275300	of roles.
5275300	5279300	He's been on Buffy, he's been on Angel, he's on Supernatural, one of my favorite episodes
5279300	5280300	too.
5280300	5283260	He played Dracula, that was cool.
5283260	5284660	Like a black and white Dracula was really cool.
5284660	5288340	He could have been a character in Dark Stalkers.
5288340	5294980	But he's such a great guy, really fun to talk to, and geeked it up with us this morning,
5294980	5295980	so it was really cool.
5295980	5296980	Awesome.
5296980	5300820	But read Devil Inside, seriously, it's good.
5300820	5303580	Like anyone could get into this, it's so good.
5303580	5307860	Well, the side project I had, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week,
5307860	5309200	we did have a pretty exciting guest.
5309200	5313100	If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, we're the best little Horde House
5313100	5314100	in Azeroth.
5314100	5317520	Now with a website, HordeHouse.com, finally, we have an official website for the show.
5317520	5320140	So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and Extfer talking about it.
5320140	5323420	And this week, we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle
5323420	5328060	Madison from Video Game Outsiders, and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network,
5328060	5329060	joined us.
5329060	5331540	And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.
5331540	5335400	Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Extfer and I, and I was really worried
5335400	5338740	that Extfer was gonna make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time, she really
5338740	5340040	played along with it.
5340040	5343340	And Michelle had a book come out, and congrats to her.
5343340	5346940	You may not know this, but she does the whole, her and her sister are behind the Damn You
5346940	5347980	autocorrect.
5347980	5348980	That is them.
5348980	5351600	And they've had a lot of success with that and just had a book come out.
5351600	5353980	So please support Michelle and buy that book.
5353980	5354980	I think that's great.
5354980	5356980	And other great podcasts on the All Games Network.
5356980	5362180	Again, HordeHouse.com, even if you don't like WoW, apparently, I had my buddy Brad from
5362180	5366300	Pod Culture said, I don't even really, you know, I haven't gotten into WoW, but your
5366300	5369300	show was, you know, still pretty good.
5369300	5371580	And it got me to get a trial account.
5371580	5372580	Sucker.
5372580	5373580	Addict.
5373580	5374580	No.
5374580	5378020	All right, anyhow, let's move on with some rapid fire news.
5378020	5380220	Loki, what else is going on in the news this week?
5380220	5390060	You know, actually, I was reading GameStop was, I think, handing out free trial discs
5390060	5391060	for a while.
5391060	5392660	That's kind of neat.
5392660	5396180	Anyways, so actual rapid fire news, though.
5396180	5397940	Some pretty cool stuff.
5397940	5401940	Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstar Apocalypse.
5401940	5407020	Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end, and that would be in the UK, where
5407020	5411460	it's gotten a release date, March 31st, so you won't have to wait very long, actually,
5411460	5415020	to play the game.
5415020	5419420	And you know, if you really die in the play of the game, and you're not in the UK, it
5419420	5423540	is region free, so import away.
5423540	5425820	But let me really just give it a couple more weeks, it'll be out.
5425820	5431140	But it is really awesome, so you should really pick it up.
5431140	5435780	Some annoying game is expanding, and that annoying game would be Farmville.
5435780	5439940	They're having an English countryside expansion.
5439940	5446700	I guess it's for players level 20 and above, I guess if you log into the game, you will
5446700	5454780	be greeted, I guess, by a crash landing zeppelin, and it'll begin the game's, they're calling
5454780	5462660	it the British Invasion, and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship, and
5462660	5469260	he invites the players back to his homeland, where you can, you know, create farms there.
5469260	5470900	Wait, wait, do you hear that?
5470900	5471900	Wait, do you hear it?
5471900	5477180	Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.
5477180	5480660	Farmville news, Loki, what did you expect me to say?
5480660	5483060	My mother cares.
5483060	5491660	And finally, after a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.
5491660	5498740	Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed, so it is still in beta.
5498740	5503220	It might as well, you might as well have left it offline, because it would have been doing
5503220	5507060	people more of a favor than actually them playing the game.
5507060	5509820	You're terrible, but accurate.
5509820	5516220	So apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were, you know, taking them offline
5516220	5519020	to conserve power in Japan.
5519020	5529380	They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also
5529380	5539500	by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.
5539500	5544380	Square Enix is cooking in the dark for the benefit of you all to bring the servers back
5544380	5545380	online.
5545380	5546820	Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.
5546820	5547820	No, I know.
5547820	5551700	But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.
5551700	5553460	It might be a little warm.
5553460	5554460	Crack a window.
5554460	5558180	All right, moving on to other MMOs.
5558180	5560180	This is a free one online that's pretty popular.
5560180	5564740	Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later
5564740	5565740	this year.
5565740	5571060	I've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO, and
5571060	5575780	it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, looks like an old school SNES type of little
5575780	5576780	game.
5576780	5577780	So obviously, it's graphic style.
5577780	5583580	I've really drawn in a lot of users, 2.2 million concurrent users, meaning at the same time.
5583580	5584580	So that's pretty awesome.
5584580	5586620	It is coming out for Xbox Live later in the year.
5586620	5589460	It will be published by Microsoft Game Studios.
5589460	5592140	Now, it's a free-to-play MMO online.
5592140	5595980	They sell items and other little enhancements for premium fees.
5595980	5596980	Here's the deal.
5596980	5600460	The Xbox Live Arcade one, it won't be free-to-play.
5600460	5602420	It's actually going to cost money.
5602420	5605220	And this is the other weird thing.
5605220	5609180	It might not really be an MMO either, because they came out and said, and this is from a
5609180	5614940	Microsoft representative, it's not a freemium MMORPG.
5614940	5618620	It's with online multiplayer features.
5618620	5620020	So I don't know.
5620020	5622980	Set the expectation bar a little low, but I don't know.
5622980	5625420	It could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade.
5625420	5626420	We'll see.
5626420	5629980	If you've been following the Back to the Future games from Telltale, you'll probably be looking
5629980	5632980	forward to the third episode of the series.
5632980	5636140	And you can look forward to one of the voice actresses they've confirmed for it.
5636140	5640680	Claudia Wells will be reprising her role as Jennifer.
5640680	5642140	So pretty cool.
5642140	5647100	Now, she was the original actress, I believe, in the sequels Elizabeth Shue took over the
5647100	5648100	role.
5648100	5653500	And the original Jennifer is back for the Back to the Future games.
5653500	5654500	That's pretty cool.
5654500	5656540	They've gotten a lot of the original voice actors.
5656540	5658100	And one more story for you guys.
5658100	5660180	The NPD put out a press release this week.
5660180	5664460	Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?
5664460	5665460	Imagine Babies.
5665460	5669180	No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or
5669180	5670720	maybe it was Call of Duty.
5670720	5672460	Those games sell like crazy.
5672460	5676620	Actually, apparently the best gross revenue game.
5676620	5681660	We're not talking games that like sold the most number of units, but we're talking about
5681660	5684800	what actually made the most money.
5684800	5691260	Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock was the most money making game of the past generation.
5691260	5693260	And they're canceling the series?
5693260	5696800	Kind of ironic in that regard, but let's face it, three was the peak.
5696800	5699060	It went really downhill fast from there.
5699060	5703780	So you know, that was three came out concurrently with Rock Band, which by the way, was number
5703780	5705300	five on the list.
5705300	5711300	Isn't three the Guitar Hero that had like a million different skews of different combinations
5711300	5713860	of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.
5713860	5718380	Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.
5718380	5719380	That's when it got really bad.
5719380	5720380	No, that one.
5720380	5721380	The band hero.
5721380	5723280	The three was just guitar, not guitar.
5723280	5728900	It wasn't, it was just as like any of the other Guitar Hero games, well, prior to that,
5728900	5731220	any of the other Guitar Hero games.
5731220	5735700	That's when they got to, you know, well, actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because
5735700	5737860	it was just, you know, like Rock Band.
5737860	5742580	It was game, guitar game, band.
5742580	5745100	Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of too.
5745100	5747220	I noticed that when I was playing the machine.
5747220	5750820	I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week, so.
5750820	5751820	Probably not worth it.
5751820	5754620	No, it really wasn't because I failed the song, which pissed me off because the guitar
5754620	5757300	was broken and one of the buttons didn't work right.
5757300	5759100	Uh, that's, that's terrible.
5759100	5760100	What a surprise!
5760100	5762860	Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Land if it's not broken.
5762860	5763860	Alright.
5763860	5766340	Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.
5766340	5767740	Dark Sakura.
5767740	5773340	Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.
5773340	5777780	Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.
5777780	5782340	That will have a 900 point price tag.
5782340	5784260	It's one of my favorite RPGs.
5784260	5787500	I've actually gotten original of this too.
5787500	5792580	Something about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it
5792580	5795220	is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.
5795220	5798300	And hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.
5798300	5799420	Precisely.
5799420	5803260	And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.
5803260	5807700	There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.
5807700	5811300	It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs.
5811300	5813300	Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.
5813300	5816500	Don't you want somebody to love?
5816500	5819820	And Santana's Black Magic Woman.
5819820	5823780	Imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.
5823780	5824780	Imagine that in pro.
5824780	5827140	Wouldn't that be crazy?
5827140	5834100	And then Dragon Force through the Fire and the Flames, and Operation Ground and Pound.
5834100	5837020	So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.
5837020	5840420	Kind of ironic, we just had a story about Guitar Hero, because that was one of the most
5840420	5841820	memorable songs from that series.
5841820	5842820	But Rock Band is awesome.
5842820	5843820	And from 3, I think.
5843820	5844820	Wasn't it?
5844820	5847540	I think so.
5847540	5856700	At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii points for the standard Rock packs, 160 points.
5856700	5863260	And the Days of Peace pack will actually be 550 Wii points, or 440 Microsoft points.
5863260	5867660	And then through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have pro guitar
5867660	5869680	and pro bass mode.
5869680	5874060	And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii points, or 80 Microsoft points.
5874060	5883700	And last but never least, we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.
5883700	5886740	And he's on fire.
5886740	5891740	He's burning up, and he's got some bad red eye problems, so he's going to need some Visine.
5891740	5893980	He's burning for you.
5893980	5899980	And the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website.
5899980	5909300	So definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're
5909300	5910540	officially there.
5910540	5912220	And the profile is there.
5912220	5913220	And I will post that into the chatroom.
5913220	5915700	So what exactly is Evil Ryu do that...
5915700	5916700	Well, technically...
5916700	5917700	Evil things?
5917700	5918700	Technically...
5918700	5920700	He kicks puppies.
5920700	5923740	He's Satsui no Hadou Ryu.
5923740	5927300	Because I guess Akuma is always like, give in to your fighting spirit.
5927300	5928300	Okay.
5928300	5929300	Join the dark side.
5929300	5930300	That's what Evil Ryu is.
5930300	5934460	If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Goku.
5934460	5940740	I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back, and it's all torn, and
5940740	5943100	he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.
5943100	5944100	Who's Oni?
5944100	5945620	Is that like Evil Evil Goku?
5945620	5948380	I think that would be, yeah, like Uber Goku.
5948380	5949380	It's Eviler!
5949380	5953660	Give in to your Evil Evil.
5953660	5955540	There's voice samples on there too.
5955540	5959020	Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.
5959020	5960020	Alright.
5960020	5961940	I'm gonna post this in the chatroom.
5961940	5963660	Fun little soundboard to play with there.
5963660	5965260	Let's go to the Twitter!
5965260	5969820	Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, and every week we like to read your tweets.
5969820	5970820	Tweet tweet.
5970820	5973580	Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, let's look at some tweets.
5973580	5979380	Some interesting tweets from 13X Forever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently
5979380	5984460	are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.
5984460	5988020	Now before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently
5988020	5991620	what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment, it was a point
5991620	5996800	and click adventure computer game, it was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.
5996800	6001980	It was supposed to be I think after Warcraft 2, it was gonna be fourth quarter 97, so that
6001980	6006900	would have been a little bit before Starcraft, kind of in that era, so this was like an old
6006900	6007900	game.
6007900	6011340	But randomly these YouTubes went up that we got linked to, so I'm just kind of taking
6011340	6013020	a quick peek at how this played out.
6013020	6015700	So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and
6015700	6016700	those types of games.
6016700	6018820	Oh the art in this looks pretty cool.
6018820	6023500	Looks more SCUMM engine, but yeah it's within the SCUMM engine, LucasArts, King's Quest
6023500	6025780	vein, that style of gameplay.
6025780	6030340	Actually the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me, kind of that really like,
6030340	6035700	really like very jerky motion cell animation stuff.
6035700	6039220	It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking
6039220	6040620	cancelled, you know what I mean?
6040620	6045820	Oh there's a trailer here for this game actually, let me click on this and take a look at this
6045820	6048040	real quick if it'll load.
6048040	6053100	This is an old school trailer from like 97, let me just take a peek at this, what could
6053100	6055220	have been, but is not.
6055220	6058260	Let's see, pass the logo, come on people.
6058260	6063860	Three great wars between the human alliance and the orcish invaders have laid waste to
6063860	6067260	the once proud realms of Azeroth.
6067260	6092860	See this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from Azeroth, this has been a whole
6092860	6107660	new era.
6107660	6114260	I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off
6114260	6118460	into the novels, so if you're a lore nerd like I am, read the books and you'll get all
6118460	6121060	the story from that game.
6121060	6126100	Alright, Dark Tetsuya sends us a link, greetings true believers, I got your first Wondercon
6126100	6128740	scoop right here about a new Spiderman game in the works.
6128740	6132500	Dark Tetsuya very excited because he's going to Wondercon and promises to bring back lots
6132500	6136400	of stories for OLR, but I guess there is a new Spiderman game that's supposed to be shown
6136400	6142620	at Wondercon, yeah that's what they're saying, Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision
6142620	6146340	Spiderman panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spiderman
6146340	6148580	game is, check that out.
6148580	6153100	Henderson Man tweets us at twitter.com slash OLR, how do you think the iPhone has hurt
6153100	6154460	sales of 3DS?
6154460	6158940	I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.
6158940	6163660	The guy told me I was the only one who even asked, should Nintendo be worried?
6163660	6169900	I would say no, mostly because it's still early and there hasn't been a lot of like,
6169900	6175300	there haven't been commercials, they went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.
6175300	6180180	There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing though, unless you're really gung
6180180	6186380	ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind
6186380	6189780	of like, ooh I gotta have that.
6189780	6194160	There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good and there's a lot of blogs covering all
6194160	6199760	that stuff and saying hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs but don't.
6199760	6205740	It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top and yes,
6205740	6212740	as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.
6212740	6218020	And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305 says this tweet
6218020	6221740	about Mortal Kombat download characters, I guess those were announced just recently.
6221740	6225700	I'm actually very excited, one of my favorite characters from the series who came out later
6225700	6231900	in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content, Kenshi, that was the blindfolded,
6231900	6235380	he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters, and a character
6235380	6237380	called Scarlet.
6237380	6243740	Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist, she's kind of in that Ermac
6243740	6249940	thing where there really wasn't a character named Scarlet, but I guess what happened is
6249940	6255140	that sometimes the game would glitch out and create a red version of Katana or Mileena
6255140	6260540	and she was referred to as Scarlet by the arcade going folk and so now they have actually
6260540	6266300	made Scarlet a character and she's going to be a downloadable character, so kind of funny
6266300	6267300	that they're doing that.
6267300	6271300	I mean that's kind of where Jade comes from too, I mean Jade was a legitimate hidden character
6271300	6275300	but she was just a palette swap for green and had both Katana and Mileena's moves and
6275300	6280220	now she's a whole, they gave her a big bar thing that she used as a weapon, kind of made
6280220	6284500	her flesh her out as an actual character, so good stuff coming to the Mortal Kombat
6284500	6286820	game that is out next month.
6286820	6292460	I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs Sanrio, that's the license that
6292460	6293460	I'll play.
6293460	6294460	Kitty-ality.
6294460	6295460	Yeah.
6295460	6296460	Bad Batsumaru.
6296460	6297460	I would think Cutality.
6297460	6298460	Huh?
6298460	6299460	Cutality.
6299460	6300460	Friendship?
6300460	6301460	Friendship?
6301460	6305740	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, sorry to make you put down the 3DS lowkey
6305740	6306740	but.
6306740	6307740	It's alright.
6307740	6317220	So this is kind of neat, Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of, well both Resident
6317220	6323260	Evil 4 and Code Veronica, and they're coming over here as some download content, well not
6323260	6329220	really, download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.
6329220	6333220	No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the, you know, souped
6333220	6339840	up visuals, but people love their Resident Evil 4, and I know even the Wii version with
6339840	6347380	just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular, so I
6347380	6349580	could see this doing pretty well.
6349580	6355720	And you know, it's kind of the whole HD remake thing is really even popular lately, so not
6355720	6360180	surprised to see it happen.
6360180	6361180	Alright.
6361180	6362860	Wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?
6362860	6368220	Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being, you know, talked about as well, they revealed
6368220	6376780	it in the official Xbox Magazine, it's not really, they haven't really said where it's,
6376780	6380540	what's going to take place, they are saying that you can change the history of Resident
6380540	6390500	Evil, and I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.
6390500	6398820	So it's interesting, I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.
6398820	6399820	Hmm.
6399820	6410780	I don't know, it sounds interesting, not really a series I follow too well, I don't know.
6410780	6414260	I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.
6414260	6417500	I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.
6417500	6423020	Alright, well let's talk about what will not happen, and apparently if rumors are to be
6423020	6428900	believed, Bonk and Bomberman, those ports on the 3DS, not happening, and a lot of that
6428900	6432020	has to do with what's been going down at Hudson Entertainment, of course they closed a big
6432020	6435180	office of theirs not that long ago after the whole Konami takeover.
6435180	6438500	Remember this way, I've played the Bonk game, it was terrible.
6438500	6439500	On the 3DS?
6439500	6442260	No, on the 3DS, on the Xbox Live Arcade.
6442260	6445460	Oh yeah, well there was supposed to be one on the 3DS, and Bomberman, which would have
6445460	6449540	been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff, but apparently it is not going
6449540	6450540	to happen.
6450540	6454740	Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no no no,
6454740	6458980	that's not true, but those are the rumors going around right now.
6458980	6463540	Apparently Konami went out and told Wired that the announcement didn't come from us,
6463540	6464540	so it's not true.
6464540	6468460	We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.
6468460	6472540	Now the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all
6472540	6475820	this stuff, I mean they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little
6475820	6477260	bit of controversy going on.
6477260	6482380	I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved, new development house,
6482380	6484940	either way, you're not seeing them anytime soon.
6484940	6489060	I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman
6489060	6493780	wouldn't happen, Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's got to happen at some point,
6493780	6496060	it's probably just not going to happen as soon as you'd like.
6496060	6497060	We'll see though.
6497060	6505180	Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over,
6505180	6511860	Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be more than one game announced at E3.
6511860	6517660	So the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5, maybe another Zone of the Enders, could
6517660	6518660	be anything.
6518660	6522460	Would it be cool if there was another Snatcher?
6522460	6523460	No.
6523460	6525740	Hey, you never know.
6525740	6526740	Never know.
6526740	6530340	So, anything could happen.
6530340	6531740	What would you like to see?
6531740	6534420	Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.
6534420	6535420	What would I like to see?
6535420	6536980	I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.
6536980	6539060	From Kojima anyways?
6539060	6540060	Probably that.
6540060	6543860	The Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.
6543860	6547000	I would be down with maybe like a Metal, I don't know, I want to see something new come
6547000	6551360	out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid.
6551360	6552360	Or Acid.
6552360	6553620	It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.
6553620	6557660	I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.
6557660	6561300	And I think, didn't we already know there's a Metal Gear game coming on 3DS?
6561300	6562380	I think that's inevitable.
6562380	6564760	You're going to see that at E3 this year, it's whatever.
6564760	6569920	And that'll probably be the big push from Konami at their booth this year is probably
6569920	6572140	whatever Metal Gear game is in development.
6572140	6575740	We're almost starting to see, and you know there's a new Silent Hill game, you're kind
6575740	6578060	of starting to get a sense of what games you're seeing at E3 this year.
6578060	6580060	But there'll be some surprises.
6580060	6583700	I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.
6583700	6584700	Alright.
6584700	6587660	Could you imagine that?
6587660	6592420	I thought he was supposedly like ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening
6592420	6593420	there with that.
6593420	6594420	I don't remember.
6594420	6595420	Alright.
6595420	6599500	Let's move on with some more news, Loki.
6599500	6601720	Ah yes.
6601720	6604760	This is kind of neat.
6604760	6608700	I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff really.
6608700	6618620	It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or really offensive stuff.
6618620	6625580	Well they've, ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half Life 2
6625580	6626580	and whatnot.
6626580	6630460	They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.
6630460	6634420	It's basically, yeah School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.
6634420	6635420	Oh my god.
6635420	6636740	Now who would find that offensive?
6636740	6640380	I don't understand, that doesn't make any sense to me.
6640380	6645120	But apparently I guess the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first
6645120	6651980	person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.
6651980	6652980	Yeah.
6652980	6657900	I can't imagine why they would remove something so harmless.
6657900	6659500	I know, right?
6659500	6661140	Why would someone even make that?
6661140	6664620	Just knowing what, I mean, well I know why someone would make that.
6664620	6668660	Someone made that to basically troll, because they could, right?
6668660	6670620	I mean that's why you make this.
6670620	6674260	To say like, heh heh heh, look what I made, it's really controversial and I shouldn't
6674260	6676500	be making a game like this but I did.
6676500	6682660	Yes, apparently I guess they're saying, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why
6682660	6685140	they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right
6685140	6692180	to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer-run site, the
6692180	6695640	confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.
6695640	6704580	And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well and it says, I guess
6704580	6713380	they have the boring effect that someone took from that bullet storm duty calls viral game
6713380	6715900	thing that they put in there.
6715900	6719140	I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.
6719140	6720740	Really?
6720740	6724060	That's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.
6724060	6725060	Only a matter of time.
6725060	6730660	Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they're playing school shooter, oh my god.
6730660	6734620	How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game
6734620	6736900	school shooter by Valve.
6736900	6740840	Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban but they also get Half Life 2 banned and that's
6740840	6744140	when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off and.
6744140	6745740	And the game turned you gay.
6745740	6752380	It turned you gay, so very gay.
6752380	6759260	Alright enough about that, silly mods, although I have to admit I probably would play it once
6759260	6764500	just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment, alright.
6764500	6769380	It's probably dumb, I mean, it's probably a terrible, terrible game.
6769380	6773700	There was a very interesting competition that took place recently, it was the Kong Off is
6773700	6778260	what this was called, some photos have gone up from the event which was just held recently,
6778260	6781580	it was held in New Jersey at Richie Knuckles Arcade Games.
6781580	6783140	What was so special about the Kong Off?
6783140	6787820	Well, god, it's the story that won't go away about the high score for Donkey Kong.
6787820	6790740	And you now have three people battling for it.
6790740	6795500	There's Steve Weeby and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie, The King of Kong.
6795500	6799420	And then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who, as we reported last week, is going to have
6799420	6801460	his own movie now coming out.
6801460	6802460	All this stuff.
6802460	6806620	All of them were in the same building at this Kong Off, so that's pretty cool.
6806620	6808300	So who ended up winning?
6808300	6811220	Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong Off.
6811220	6813940	And second place, Steve Weeby.
6813940	6818700	Seventh place, Billy Mitchell, out of ten.
6818700	6821500	I would have loved to see the look on his face.
6821500	6826600	But you are talking about ten like godly Donkey Kong players and it's so funny how this game
6826600	6829820	is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.
6829820	6833980	I wonder if the guy, I think he like, beat the top scorer of Missile Command and he plays
6833980	6834980	with his feet.
6834980	6835980	Mhm.
6835980	6836980	Seriously.
6836980	6838780	Is that Captain Awesome?
6838780	6842420	They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his
6842420	6843420	feet.
6843420	6844420	That's awesome.
6844420	6850020	SX in our chatroom says Kong Off sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.
6850020	6852400	No, no, it's nothing like that.
6852400	6857900	But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing
6857900	6859180	their Donkey Kong.
6859180	6861340	I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.
6861340	6864260	Stop it, Loki.
6864260	6865260	Stop it.
6865260	6869020	Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.
6869020	6872900	I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.
6872900	6875820	They've made these like special flyers that say the Kong Off.
6875820	6879860	I mean, these dudes like love Donkey Kong.
6879860	6884180	I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.
6884180	6885960	I have to give kudos for that.
6885960	6891420	I mean, if you're going to go in, go all in, right, on this classic stuff.
6891420	6893780	So there's, there's big love for Kong.
6893780	6894780	All right.
6894780	6900500	There's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called List List.
6900500	6906860	Now, we haven't done a list list in a little while, it's been a few months, so let me recap
6906860	6908740	how list list works.
6908740	6914040	We are about to make the definitive list about a certain topic and it's a scientific process
6914040	6916180	and once we've made up the list, it's done.
6916180	6917180	There's no arguing.
6917180	6918200	It is, it is done.
6918200	6920720	This is the list, okay?
6920720	6924740	And the way it works is that we're going to go around the room and Dark Sakura, myself,
6924740	6928380	Loki and tonight's guest Salacious Pop, we're all going to pick three things that we think
6928380	6930780	should go on the list around the topic.
6930780	6934860	Then we go to the elimination round and each take one item off the list.
6934860	6939340	So that will leave us with a list of eight items that the chat room will then vote on.
6939340	6941280	Their number two and their number one picks.
6941280	6946920	So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
6946920	6950380	So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do
6950380	6953220	with the 3DS launch, so here it is.
6953220	6959360	The list list tonight, fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant
6959360	6960360	buy.
6960360	6964860	I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because,
6964860	6968140	you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is
6968140	6971260	it's kind of lackluster launch title.
6971260	6972340	Launch titles.
6972340	6975260	So folks are saying maybe there's some games you should wait for.
6975260	6979260	Well tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch
6979260	6982940	titles would have made the system an instant buy.
6982940	6984980	All right, here we go to list list.
6984980	6988340	And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for
6988340	6992700	the list because if one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually
6992700	6996660	turn to chat to help us kind of round up, round out the list.
6996660	6997660	So who wants to start tonight?
6997660	6999660	I guess we'll go with Dark Sakura.
6999660	7001340	Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?
7001340	7004180	What is the number three item on your list?
7004180	7005180	It's not a game.
7005180	7006180	It's an item.
7006180	7007180	That's fine.
7007180	7008180	It's a launch title.
7008180	7009180	Doesn't mean launch game.
7009180	7014460	A lenticular photo printer.
7014460	7017600	And what would be, what would the lenticular photo printer do?
7017600	7020420	It would print up your images in 3D.
7020420	7023460	Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.
7023460	7026780	So like, kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D?
7026780	7027780	Yeah.
7027780	7028780	Okay.
7028780	7031820	So it would print one layer, print a second layer.
7031820	7035940	It'd be huge probably, but I'd still think it would be neat to have something like that.
7035940	7043060	I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my Wang that I would take.
7043060	7046940	Slaces Pop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.
7046940	7050020	The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.
7050020	7053420	Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.
7053420	7057540	I'd buy that.
7057540	7062340	And how exactly would Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster work?
7062340	7069300	Jubble physics in 3D and you shoot aliens and you get, you get, you get grease from
7069300	7072740	your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.
7072740	7076340	You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.
7076340	7078580	Brings a whole new meaning to screw attack.
7078580	7080440	All right.
7080440	7081580	I guess I'll go next.
7081580	7086300	The number three thing that launch title that would have made me get a 3DS right today,
7086300	7089580	first thing, um, how about F-Zero 3DS?
7089580	7092060	I'm going to go a little serious here.
7092060	7094180	Where's my fucking new F-Zero game?
7094180	7095180	F-Zero 3DS.
7095180	7096820	Loki, what's your number three answer?
7096820	7099020	Well, this is a more of a serious route.
7099020	7104300	I swear that this is in development because I, I thought I saw some sort of screenshots
7104300	7111660	or something like this, but, uh, Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.
7111660	7116660	Excite Truck is awesome, not that this is Excite Bots bullshit though, Excite Truck.
7116660	7117660	Excite Truck.
7117660	7122580	Hell, you don't even have to do anything different, put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks,
7122580	7123580	everything.
7123580	7129260	Although I would like it if you did something, but you know, if you don't have to, then fine.
7129260	7135220	So far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and
7135220	7136580	Excite Truck 3DS.
7136580	7138900	Dark Sakura, what's your number two?
7138900	7141100	Planet Harrier.
7141100	7145380	I love this game, I have only gotten to play it a few times, there's been no home version
7145380	7146380	released.
7146380	7150180	Don't you think it would be about time for it to, you know, something like that to come
7150180	7151180	on 3DS?
7151180	7156780	You know, it's, it's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.
7156780	7160420	I can see a lot of those, like, old school, like, Sega shooters and I think of 3D World
7160420	7162100	Runner, like, for the NES.
7162100	7167060	But those, this sort of first person, not kind of first person, but those, those perspective
7167060	7170540	games would be perfect for that type of screen.
7170540	7171540	So, I'm with you.
7171540	7173100	My vote is Planet Harriers.
7173100	7174100	All right.
7174100	7178260	Slasius Pop, your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today.
7178260	7183100	Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, Migraine and Vertigo Edition.
7183100	7187780	What exactly is Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo
7187780	7188780	Edition?
7188780	7193860	Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames
7193860	7198220	to make the 3D, they make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have
7198220	7199220	to lay down.
7199220	7203660	Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image
7203660	7204660	or something.
7204660	7205660	They have that already.
7205660	7208340	It's called, um, Ridge Racer.
7208340	7209740	All right.
7209740	7215380	Uh, game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.
7215380	7220620	I'm going to say, Breasts 3D.
7220620	7226060	All it would be, would be pictures of breasts in 3D.
7226060	7230420	And I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that, cause who doesn't love boobs,
7230420	7231980	gay or straight or whatever you are.
7231980	7235460	Does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it, it has a little bead
7235460	7238140	that it can tell, so you can shake, you can shake it.
7238140	7242220	It would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again is
7242220	7246300	that you could just, you could, you know, you could motorboat the boobs if you want,
7246300	7248900	but it's not, it's not just restricted to Samus Aran.
7248900	7252860	Like I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster, but I want to see just,
7252860	7254420	just boobs.
7254420	7261540	Little boobs, big boobs, lopsided boobs, boobs, fake boobs, real boobs, more boobs.
7261540	7264340	You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up
7264340	7266340	to a person.
7266340	7267340	Yeah.
7267340	7271340	That would be a perfect mode.
7271340	7275620	It would actually use the whole like, uh, what is that, the, the, the camera on the
7275620	7278620	backside for those like, uh, virtual reality type simulations.
7278620	7283540	And like, if I, if I point the camera at Jamie just suddenly like random boobs will show
7283540	7285500	up.
7285500	7286500	She's frowning.
7286500	7287500	She's making a frowny face.
7287500	7291460	Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing, thank you.
7291460	7293620	My boobs are epic.
7293620	7296860	All right, Loki, your number two pick launch title for the 3DS that would have made you
7296860	7297860	buy one today.
7297860	7300700	Uh, just what you said made me forget.
7300700	7303780	Um, it is, oh yes, of course.
7303780	7307620	Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.
7307620	7309900	That would be so amazing.
7309900	7314460	I can take Earth Defense Force with me since the PSP version is not yet announced.
7314460	7315460	Come over here.
7315460	7316460	All right.
7316460	7320740	Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS going into the number ones.
7320740	7325980	We have lenticular photo printer, Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster, F zero 3DS excite
7325980	7332260	truck 3DS planet Harrier, Zelda eight bit 3DS migraine and vertigo edition breasts 3D
7332260	7335940	and Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS.
7335940	7337700	Let's get into the number one.
7337700	7340820	This is, you just fucking need it.
7340820	7345700	Dark Sakura, the new guardian legend, duh.
7345700	7347540	It's my list.
7347540	7353960	The new guardian legend in 3D in 3D because we're going to be at guardic and he had guardia.
7353960	7358560	So I guess the Japanese name of this would be shin guardia.
7358560	7359980	I don't care what the fuck they call it.
7359980	7360980	Just put it out already.
7360980	7361980	I know, right?
7361980	7362980	Damn it.
7362980	7363980	Nintendo or compile.
7363980	7369220	I realize compile needs to reform somehow, but just, just do it reform and put out.
7369220	7370220	All right.
7370220	7371220	Thank you.
7371220	7374260	Please put out XOXO slashes, pop number one.
7374260	7375260	You need it.
7375260	7376260	You need it now.
7376260	7377260	I'm 3DS.
7377260	7384520	Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer.
7384520	7388500	And how exactly would Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer work?
7388500	7393380	Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
7393380	7397060	And it has a built-in calendar days of the week.
7397060	7400820	Did I break Rob?
7400820	7401820	Is he upset?
7401820	7403500	No, I'm just regretting some things.
7403500	7404500	All right.
7404500	7405500	I'm kidding.
7405500	7406500	All right.
7406500	7407500	Let's move on.
7407500	7412220	Number one answer from me, the 3DS game we most need to see.
7412220	7413220	What did they call that?
7413220	7414220	The, the virtual reality.
7414220	7415220	I'm calling it wrong.
7415220	7419140	What's it, what's it really supposed to be called the like the face blaster.
7419140	7420140	What is that?
7420140	7421140	The augmented reality.
7421140	7422140	Thank you.
7422140	7423140	Augmented reality.
7423140	7424460	It's an augmented reality game for you.
7424460	7427220	And I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.
7427220	7437700	Augmented reality, Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.
7437700	7438700	That's right.
7438700	7442060	You can go to Golf Land and just, you know, then suddenly the little kids there celebrating
7442060	7448100	their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts.
7448100	7451380	You know, it's Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.
7451380	7459580	All right, Loki, number one game you most need to see on the 3DS, uh, an actual innovative
7459580	7468580	game from Nintendo, you know, something that perhaps is not, you know, funny, I don't think
7468580	7472820	this is actually a launch title, but just, just, just a description, an actual innovative
7472820	7478500	game from Nintendo, you know, like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that
7478500	7479500	they put out.
7479500	7485020	You know, like for example, Animal Crossing, it's been the same for a while now and, you
7485020	7491940	know, uh, even some of the other, like, you know, they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games.
7491940	7493420	They're just, Oh, now they're in 3D.
7493420	7496780	I mean, come on innovation here.
7496780	7501680	This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?
7501680	7504260	Like new, just because it's all the mascots that we...
7504260	7505260	Wii Music.
7505260	7506260	No, Wii Fit.
7506260	7507740	I would say Wii Fit.
7507740	7508740	But that's not...
7508740	7512140	We have anything iconic though, like a Mario or a Kirby.
7512140	7513140	Wii Sports.
7513140	7517100	What about WooHoo Island?
7517100	7520580	So basically we're getting Kirby's Crochet Carnival is what you're saying.
7520580	7526660	Actually, no, I do have a name for my innovative game, WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7526660	7529940	You want to change your answer to WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch?
7529940	7530940	Yes.
7530940	7531940	All right.
7531940	7536060	So an actual innovative game from Nintendo is now WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7536060	7537060	Yes.
7537060	7540940	Wouldn't that just be Dead Island?
7540940	7544380	It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that
7544380	7545380	void.
7545380	7546380	All right.
7546380	7547380	WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7547380	7548380	All right, here we go.
7548380	7549740	Here's the list as it stands right now.
7549740	7555660	Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Trek
7555660	7562580	3DS, Planet Harrier, Zelda 8-Bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition, Brest 3D, Earth Defense
7562580	7569020	Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, Rebecca Black's Preteen Convertible Off-Road Racer,
7569020	7574620	Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper 3DS, and WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7574620	7578220	Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.
7578220	7581940	We're going to start with Dark Sakura, but for now let me read some of the suggestions
7581940	7583860	you guys had in the chat room.
7583860	7591020	Akdev suggested Furi vs. Cosplayers 3DS, SHA100Matt suggested IHOP Restaurant Fighter 3DS, Tiger
7591020	7596980	Claw said DDR 3DS, IHOP Restaurant Fighter, now would that be the actual restaurants fighting
7596980	7598340	because that could be very cool.
7598340	7604220	No, actually in my mind it's Denny's, like go on YouTube and Google Denny's Fight Oakland,
7604220	7606420	it's great.
7606420	7610700	The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes, amazing.
7610700	7618820	SHA100Matt says Killer Instincts 3DS, Ray Deer in chat says Rob's Ass 3DS, hey, let's
7618820	7625980	see, AkumaJP says 3D Cat Ball, you know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer,
7625980	7633420	SJ100Matt says Match Game 3DS, DJBlazekin says Space Channel 5 3D, SJ100Matt says Betty
7633420	7639460	White Simulator 3DS, what, you'd just be badass the whole time, is that what that is?
7639460	7646460	Akdev says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR Technology, I am surprised, that sounds like an announcement
7646460	7647460	to you Furi right there.
7647460	7651980	And Dark Tetsuya said Gals Panic 3D, alright, those were the runners up but let's get back
7651980	7655660	to the list, unfortunately it's just the way the game works, these are all amazing answers
7655660	7661220	but unfortunately the way the game works, things have to go, it's part of the process.
7661220	7665140	So Dark Sakura we'll start with you, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7665140	7674580	First of all you need an apostrophe in blacks, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrated Vertigo
7674580	7679700	Edition because I have a Virtual Boy, and the game's pretty much already out as Ridge
7679700	7680700	Racer.
7680700	7684020	Alright, sorry Alan it has been stricken from the list.
7684020	7687060	Salacious Pop your chance for revenge or you could go for something else, which of these
7687060	7691980	items is not worthy of the list?
7691980	7693460	The Golf Land birthday party.
7693460	7699280	Oh you're killing me, why are you taking that off the list?
7699280	7702820	Well there's serious answers and there's my smart ass answers and I can't take down one
7702820	7705580	of mine so.
7705580	7710580	Alright there you go, it is removed from the list much to the sadness of the chat room.
7710580	7715020	My turn to strike one from the list, I'm sorry to do this but Loki, WooHoo Island Zombie
7715020	7721500	Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it, alright, alright so Loki, which
7721500	7723340	of these is not worthy of the list?
7723340	7728260	Lenticular Photo Printer, I mean having taken some of the photos are not that impressive
7728260	7730300	and would not want to print them out.
7730300	7733620	Alright so maybe, it's just too soon for the Lenticular Photo Printer.
7733620	7734620	We have a balanced list.
7734620	7739860	Yeah I was going to say everybody took some, everybody lost one so it's very rare that
7739860	7742540	that happens, usually someone gets picked on.
7742540	7745960	So here you go, here is what you guys in the chat can vote on, I'm going to read this list
7745960	7747100	one more time.
7747100	7752020	You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers, you gotta
7752020	7753700	message me those.
7753700	7757300	You need to mark them as number one or number two or I will assume that the one you name
7757300	7760620	first is your number one and the one you name second is your number two.
7760620	7763740	By the way you're getting boos in the chat room for taking off Golf Land first season.
7763740	7765620	What's your handle in chat this week?
7765620	7766620	It's Skye.
7766620	7767620	Okay got it back.
7767620	7768620	Alright yes I got it back.
7768620	7770960	So send a private message to Skye with your number one and number two votes.
7770960	7773540	Here is the list that you can vote on right now.
7773540	7781300	Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,
7781300	7789220	Brest 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's pre-teen
7789220	7790660	convertible off-road racer.
7790660	7792660	I can't believe that made it through.
7792660	7795580	Alright I would play that.
7795580	7797060	I would play as the girl in the braces.
7797060	7801180	It probably would be, yeah I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.
7801180	7804540	Alright so yeah that's going to do it.
7804540	7808100	Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.
7808100	7813220	Place your votes and we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.
7813220	7817440	For now though we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.
7817440	7819500	Every week you guys send us emails.
7819500	7821260	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7821260	7824820	Again that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7824820	7827820	It was looking really thin this morning so I put a call out on Twitter.
7827820	7828820	Did it work?
7828820	7829820	Did we get some emails?
7829820	7830820	We have two.
7830820	7831820	That's better than zero.
7831820	7832820	Alright.
7832820	7833820	But not better than F-Zero.
7833820	7834820	F-Zero is awesome.
7834820	7840900	This first one comes from RaBaba.
7840900	7846220	I'm surprised the Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on
7846220	7847220	American TV.
7847220	7851400	If you've ever seen them it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager
7851400	7854140	talking about the things they use their PCs for.
7854140	7856440	Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.
7856440	7862900	Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.
7862900	7867180	It implies that if you play MMOs you're automatically a threat to PC security.
7867180	7871080	I find this offensive not to the point of emotionally offended but the overly negative
7871080	7874340	stereotype that is also completely wrong.
7874340	7875980	New Zealand gets Jackie Chan ads.
7875980	7878380	No fair RaBaba.
7878380	7880380	Agreed.
7880380	7882380	And last email.
7882380	7886540	Oh no punctuation.
7886540	7890580	Yay your favorite.
7890580	7895940	And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.
7895940	7898140	That sounds like what auto correct would do.
7898140	7899140	I know.
7899140	7904940	Yesterday was great especially the second round of laser tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.
7904940	7908700	It was the last 10 to 30 seconds I was on the high rise and these three little kids
7908700	7914220	just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off a one by one in 1.5 seconds
7914220	7917300	enacting a triple kill.
7917300	7921700	It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp most of them being from
7921700	7927540	preschool to fourth grade fun times punctuate the sad parts of my experience was when I
7927540	7932100	went down there was no BeatMania 2DX.
7932100	7938220	I know what 2DX is person and Para Para second mix game would be and there was it was nowhere
7938220	7939220	to be found.
7939220	7943380	I saw that they sold it in their place was a theta screen Daytona USA in a four player
7943380	7948980	Mario Kart I shouted in my head WTF first keyboard mania then pop music now Para Para
7948980	7952060	then guitar freaks now BeatMania fuck you.
7952060	7955220	That's my translation of the all caps.
7955220	7960460	This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate
7960460	7966140	wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play
7966140	7973260	except drum mania V3 DDR Max 2 6th mix oh 6th mix and dance dance revolution 5th mix
7973260	7974980	and in the group too.
7974980	7980320	If only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones
7980320	7989180	like DJ Max Technica and G beat and dare I say it gulp pump it up pro maybe then maybe
7989180	7995980	they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.
7995980	8000720	Peace out DJ Blaze kid PS if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced
8000720	8004820	to buy an import just to play all the good music games.
8004820	8007820	There isn't an arcade like AI anymore I hate to say it.
8007820	8016100	It was AI an AI RIP yeah all right if you want to send us an email mailbag at orange
8016100	8022260	lounge radio dot com I put the last call out for listless votes so hopefully we're gonna
8022260	8042660	tally those up but not before we do some angst grr argh angst time.
8042660	8054220	FUs of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum
8054220	8062340	so I'm gonna say I feed a gluten and meat neither of them agree with me no matter how
8062340	8071920	tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is so I'm telling them goodbye for a while goodbye
8071920	8078640	I will sort of miss you but my stomach won't done Loki F you the people have turned too
8078640	8082980	damn slow in their cars there's some people that for some reason they need to slow down
8082980	8088160	the one mile per hour to make a turn into a driveway of a plaza it doesn't even have
8088160	8093540	a curb or anything it's just I don't understand it I mean I can make turns a lot faster than
8093540	8101020	that and it just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow or when they're merging lanes
8101020	8104980	I love these people they're just like oh I'm gonna cut in and out lanes I have my turn
8104980	8109700	right turn signal on but I'm just gonna assume that one turn signal on means I can go any
8109700	8118780	way I want so fuck you the bad drivers um my fu the whoop not ready for that song yet
8118780	8123440	uh my fu of the week actually I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately I can't
8123440	8128300	complain too much but I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday oh my
8128300	8134380	god that was so terrible um yeah that was bad and my tooth still kind of hurts a little
8134380	8139420	bit so fu to pain even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting
8139420	8147180	it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of so I'm pretty great so fu to pain
8147180	8155540	place to pop it's not really that angsty I guess but just fu to having only two weeks
8155540	8159340	to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do but it's still a good
8159340	8166940	thing so nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated all right
8166940	8170380	all right that does it for the fus of the week let's do a couple more news stories and
8170380	8175260	then we will reveal tonight's list list definitive list and we will get to the skype line in
8175260	8180860	just a little bit but for now a couple quick stories loki yeah um as we've kind of mentioned
8180860	8186580	before that the hd remix are kind of a uh a remix of different games are kind of popular
8186580	8192740	nowadays and ubisoft is jumping on board that trend um they actually have a few games coming
8192740	8197900	out uh the first course the splinter cell uh classic trilogy that's coming out june
8197900	8205940	21st now and uh will feature three games in that series also the prince of persia hd trilogy
8205940	8211100	so push back a little bit to april 19th and that would feature the uh my birthday the three
8211100	8219500	games in the um sands of time series so um it's neat i guess um i think the i want to
8219500	8223180	say that the uh games at least the prince of persia ones are already on the playstation
8223180	8229380	network they're 15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving five bucks um apparently
8229380	8233460	also the uh splinter cell games are going to be available on the playstation network
8233460	8238420	as well i'm assuming for probably around the same price 15 bucks each 40 for the compilation
8238420	8244980	of you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so yeah
8244980	8251540	save five bucks all right well would you like to be able to play more games on the mac well
8251540	8256980	maybe you can get a thing called boxer uh this isn't like boxers versus briefs or anything
8256980	8262900	this is actually a boxer it's a dos box for the mac that's right i did a little joke there
8262900	8268260	this will allow you to play old pc games on the mac but you know what all joking aside
8268260	8273300	this is pretty cool uh dos box of course was a old emulator that will make uh playing games
8273300	8278780	from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines boxer is kind of this redone
8278780	8284220	for apple computers uh the mac series of course and uh what i like about it is they've kind
8284220	8288300	of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit like you can see xcom in there although
8288300	8292660	it's just the demo but doom 2 is playable in this which is pretty cool so if you own
8292660	8297660	a mac um i would be checking this out boxerapp.com is where you can go to check out the boxer
8297660	8302060	emulator for your old school dos fix and this doesn't come with any games right you have
8302060	8306920	to install your own yeah i'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in like i
8306920	8312420	see uh doom 2 it's probably the freeware one and then underworld the demo ultimate underworld
8312420	8317600	probably just box with some of those you can though for the record play pc games on a mac
8317600	8325100	you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels i think it's called but i think
8325100	8329820	what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important
8329820	8334340	because some of the old dos games you try to play them on a pc now i'm just like crazy
8334340	8340300	you can't do it because you know the first computer i ever had pc was a 16 megahertz
8340300	8344740	computer and it was blazing fast and you know i used to play games like x-men on it and
8344740	8348620	like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what did computers
8348620	8355300	go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're
8355300	8360940	gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the
8360940	8367620	winner so here it is tonight's definitive list no arguing folks it's a done deal this
8367620	8374620	is a very scientific process the launch title that would have made you get a 3ds number
8374620	8382340	three breasts 3d that's right the game with boobs boobs and more boobs i already have
8382340	8387740	that game almost as good as the real thing i already have that game all right uh your
8387740	8391220	number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3ds would have made you get
8391220	8397740	one today samus arand's motorboat and bikini blaster woohoo i see a pattern it could be
8397740	8404220	in another nintendo tecmo collaboration there you go absolutely but the number one thing
8404220	8410980	that would have made you buy a 3ds today f-zero 3ds going for a serious answer there it is
8410980	8416500	f-zero 3ds is the winner i thought for sure that it would be the offered racing game uh
8416500	8421720	rebecca black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being and it was
8421720	8426700	just it was fourth place just shy of the list i'm kind of glad though it won't be etched
8426700	8430620	permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old
8430620	8436260	next week all right uh we totally missed out on all the charlie sheen references we could
8436260	8442340	use i know you could winning 3ds but no one cares anymore i'm kind of over it i didn't
8442340	8448700	care to be yeah yay we're watching a man self-destruct live on tv it's great but it's different now
8448700	8455340	because it's a man doing it it's been a while yeah maybe he'll show his kush on tv and people
8455340	8463580	will care as he's getting out of a limo sure cobwebby all right skype line is open now

8499780	8504560	whatever you know uh yeah he went to south america but not for fleeing well of course
8504560	8515740	you know if he doesn't come back then he is fleeing so data as well um yeah man there's

8542100	8546220	golden rule of radio go ahead and turn down the radio in the background because the echo
8546220	8550420	is going to mess with you like you wouldn't believe listen to me on your phone what's
8550420	8558180	up what'd you call us for tonight well i want to discuss i have some games to discuss with
8558180	8565340	you guys all right what games uh let's see the resident evil series uh-huh just the whole
8565340	8573740	damn series all of them uh well like uh number five resident evil five is uh i've never played
8573740	8579340	it but it looks pretty cool i think i might like it why do you think you'd like resident
8579340	8586540	evil five well i've seen uh videos of it and just the uh i did the graphics look amazing
8586540	8592580	and the gameplay looks cool now and you're a partner is a girl so you can't beat that
8592580	8597620	now resident evil 5 has been out for some time so what's uh what's stopping you from
8597620	8604180	just getting the damn game already well i don't have the system oh wow wow wow that
8604180	8611420	happens so you you are not an owner of any uh 360 ps3 type consoles no we've got a nintendo
8611420	8617100	gamecube and uh nintendo 64 that's all right that shit's expensive the new stuff so you
8617100	8622380	you you are kicking it old school yes i am so what games what old school games do you
8622380	8635540	enjoy playing uh let's see i've got um the uh old uh rampage games and uh have uh perfect
8635540	8643220	dark the one for the 64 classic i also have um fighting for 64
8643220	8653500	uh golden i double o seven well these are all classic games so so is it just like you
8653500	8658040	know i'm kind of surprised if you own a gamecube and a 64 you haven't yet taken the plunge
8658040	8664060	and gotten a wee is it just is it just a money thing well i'm still living at home and i
8664060	8668500	haven't moved out and i don't uh think i want to spend my money on that even though i like
8668500	8672740	playing on wheeze i don't think i want to own one yeah you know it's like you know the
8672740	8679340	rent or a wee the ramps probably a good idea i mean seriously i know i'm gonna so i'm with
8679340	8685100	the uh gamecube uh i've got uh diehard vendetta i don't think i'm not sure if you've heard
8685100	8689780	of that uh no probably not i wasn't really into the diehard movies although well i don't
8689780	8694940	know yippee-ki-yay motherfucker maybe i don't know just do we do we get that in the game
8694940	8698780	do we get a yippee-ki-yay motherfucker in the game i uh haven't played in such a long
8698780	8703940	time i've forgotten okay that's all right i probably not because it's a nintendo based
8703940	8709580	product so well it's an unrated game so you never know that's true okay here here's my
8709580	8712740	thing though uh resident evil you brought up resident evil five now one of the greatest
8712740	8717380	gamecube games they ever made was resident evil four so have you checked that out on
8717380	8723960	gamecube i think i do want to buy that and they i think they made that game for the we
8723960	8728600	as well but it's the same the graphics are still the same yeah pretty much i mean the
8728600	8733420	we's just two game cubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway so that's
8733420	8738260	a pretty good description uh how's your pc because some folks in chat are kind of commenting
8738260	8741960	wow this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago maybe he should
8741960	8748000	game on the pc have you have you tried gaming on pc i don't have a pc i'm actually using
8748000	8752940	a mac laptop right now well that well we just talked about dos box on the mac you might
8752940	8759140	that might be an option for you i don't know yeah i've actually had the original uh one
8759140	8765600	version of the original doom for the 64. i see so well uh you might have to check out
8765600	8769380	steam for the mac or something i don't know uh it's an option for you all right we gotta
8769380	8774660	take some more calls any other uh last minute thoughts before we uh let you go uh no just
8774660	8778580	that you guys do a really good job and uh keep doing what you're doing we will thank
8778580	8784660	you very much thank you thanks so much take care everybody bye you know not everybody
8784660	8788540	can not everybody can take the plunge you're talking about 200 for a nintendo we because
8788540	8791780	the folks in the chat room are like is that call from like three years ago what's going
8791780	8795300	on but it's like you know that's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody
8795300	8799060	gets to just take the plunge i should have asked how old he was because he did say he
8799060	8801780	lived at home and you know granted a lot of adults live at home but he might have also
8801780	8806700	been 16 which could have answered a lot of that i don't know all right one eight seven
8806700	8810740	seven game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio let's uh move on to some more
8810740	8814980	calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys this is kai judo
8814980	8820260	kai judo what's on your mind buddy but i just wanted to call real quick about uh pokemon
8820260	8826660	uh black and white pokemon before i say that yeah yeah i have it i have both actually but
8826660	8831860	um before i go on tonight i just want to say uh that previous caller uh die hard vandetta
8831860	8836540	he called it uh it does have a lot of cursing in it awesome it's actually uh a big deal
8836540	8840340	they were trying to go after nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many f
8840340	8846420	bombs in that game nice you wouldn't believe it i'm glad but um anyway so yeah the pokemans
8846420	8852100	show us your pokemans yeah i definitely recommend it i mean i think um if you haven't played
8852100	8856020	pokemon in a while i think you should definitely pick this one up i mean they always add something
8856020	8861220	new to the pokemon games and uh what they added new to this one is uh there's a lot of um
8862420	8867940	uh uh wi-fi connectability to the game like um they have the whole uh you know the big thing
8867940	8873300	that's like street pass they have that where if you have your uh your ds on and you walk by
8873300	8878340	someone and they have a pokemon you exchange information they have the uh you can battle
8878340	8886740	people online um what else do they have they have mudkip 2.0 huh mudkip 2.0
8887940	8890420	i don't even know what that is i'm just trolling don't listen to me
8891700	8897220	but anyway yeah they have this thing called uh g gear where it's like um you have three different
8897220	8901940	types of ways that you can connect with people uh there's the uh infrared where it's like it's
8901940	8906660	like a face-to-face type of connection that you do then there's the uh like i've mentioned before
8906660	8911460	you know like the street pass type thing and then there's the uh internet wi-fi and i mean there's
8911460	8918020	just a lot to it i mean it's a really big game i mean i can go i i can go on forever about um how
8918020	8922180	much they added to the game it's really a great game so my ignorance earlier in the show should
8922180	8926660	not have said that the pokemon games haven't really changed in a while well i mean it's your
8926660	8931620	opinion but actually they have changed the one that you mentioned uh the ruby what was it ruby
8931620	8938740	silver yeah now ruby what they yeah i mean i'm not i'm not the biggest uh pokemon historian but um
8938740	8942980	what i think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases which they didn't have
8942980	8948260	in the uh the original which was i think well was it red and blue or some shit okay but to be fair
8948260	8953140	i mean how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game i mean maybe a little bit
8953140	8957380	because i mean certain certain pokemon you couldn't catch you know you have to catch them at certain
8957380	8962100	days of the week you have to catch them at certain uh you know either day or night i mean you know
8962100	8966420	i mean they they really do innovative stuff with it i mean you know it may not be something that's
8966420	8971540	gonna like uh change how you think about pokemon but i mean they always uh consider the fans and
8971540	8976500	they you know they kind of like cater to what uh the fans want like whatever the fans are asking
8976500	8981620	for it you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next pokemon game let me ask one of the fanboy
8981620	8985540	questions of the year and i don't know how many times we brought this up on the show but why do
8985540	8990020	you think nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a pokemon mmo everybody i would even fucking
8990020	8995380	play a pokemon mmo well you you mentioned earlier um like i said i'm not the biggest uh pokemon
8995380	9002420	historian but they do have this uh website thing that's coming out on uh march 30th which is kind
9002420	9006580	of gonna is i guess you could say it's kind of like a minimum uh mmo you're gonna have like some
9006580	9012580	kind of pokey farm and you can you can raise your pokemon slaves there and you know make them fight
9012580	9016100	you know you know all that type of stuff so i mean they do have some type of uh
9016660	9021220	nmo thing going on i don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them
9021220	9025940	like in a while but um you'll be able to link up with maybe i don't know maybe 10 people in a room
9026580	9032260	and you can all like uh chat and this you can tie razorblades to their feet and all that shit
9032260	9036180	this sounds like you're turning cock fighting into a video game but you've just replaced
9036180	9040420	that with pikachu that's pretty much what pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it
9040420	9044580	you're basically catching you'd be a very dirty yes yeah it's cock fighting pretty much but i
9044580	9050500	mean it's great you know i mean i i don't mind it get your pikachu out of my cock fighting game
9051780	9055620	sorry we're having too much fun yes better than getting the real roosters and having them beat the
9055620	9059540	crap out of each other you could do it virtually all right and that and that's pretty much what
9059540	9064260	the main story is about in this game there's actually uh a guy who wants uh to free all the
9064260	9067620	pokemon because he's like oh you know we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy
9067620	9077380	shit so he's basically pita yeah yeah all right would that be people for the ethical treatment
9077380	9084500	of pokemon pp all right anyhow all right we gotta let you go guys judo but thank you for our pokey
9084500	9091380	phil any any quick last shout outs before we let you go uh shout out to uh everyone listening all

9174100	9181780	stats like special attack and defense you also have to raise some certain pokemon to to obtain

9292100	9299700	convince my husband to get me my 3ds uh look what you started act f we're all fighting it's all in
9299700	9303300	the fighting tonight i know olr is going to break up tonight and it's all because of your call i
9303300	9307620	just want you to know that i'm kidding i'm sorry about that sorry i'm kidding all right well
9307620	9315700	basically nintendo said uh the most principle thing they that uh what's the word they don't
9315700	9323220	want to do it because it's a big infrastructure and it's uh like i said a very big project for
9323220	9328580	for them to handle and they don't want to do it i see they're the number one selling console in
9328580	9333620	the motherfucking world yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a pokemon mmo
9333620	9339860	little old microsoft i have no idea how they're doing it and sony she's boy they're sure suckers
9339860	9346180	well to uh to uh you know their defense that microsoft doesn't have an mmo
9348900	9353940	but they have an online infrastructure which is more than nintendo has debatable to i mean
9353940	9357700	they did have final fantasy 11 you know i'm always going to whip out that card and fantasy star
9357700	9361860	universe that's true has all right fine then they already have more than intended us it's a
9362660	9367540	microsoft just is opposed to mmos for some reason there's some weird thing going on like i don't
9367540	9372580	know if they were just burned by final fantasy 11 or what but i don't know or maybe it has something
9372580	9377620	to do with their next system maybe the next system is all going to be about mmos who knows i'm making
9378180	9384100	shit up now all right act f before i let you go since we've completely um you know derailed your
9384100	9389300	phone calls many times uh anything else you want to share with our folks tonight well just one
9389300	9399060	question one last question of course would you pay around 525 for a 3ds hell no i wouldn't not
9399060	9402340	right now not until more games come out let me guess that's how much you're having to pay in
9402340	9411220	mexico huh yep don't you live not far from the border luckily but for those who doesn't or who
9411220	9416340	don't you need to just drive to san diego or find a friend here who can help you out for a lot
9416340	9422340	cheaper that's crazy talk 500 bucks i can find a friend i have i live pretty much across the border
9422340	9430660	so i can find a friend and k can bring me one but those who live on the south those are pretty much
9430660	9437860	screwed they're paying six hundred six thousand pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3ds
9437860	9444500	unbelievable all right well act after we hope uh it gets to a more reasonable level in mexico soon
9444500	9450020	but it is launch day i mean give it a few weeks to stabilize you know if the sales are not so hot
9450020	9453540	or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought maybe the price will drop pretty quickly
9453540	9460100	we'll see no doubt it but well let's see we'll see all right take care buddy take care you too
9460740	9464180	boy sometimes we forget how spoiled we are in america that at least these game companies put
9464180	9470100	out the consoles here you know what i mean it's weird that nintendo doesn't do more with mexico
9470100	9475060	because you know they have the the manuals all in spanish and french so that they can launch
9475060	9480900	in multiple regions simultaneously i don't know let's go to one or two more calls hi you're on
9480900	9485220	orange launch radio who's this hey it's ron how's everyone doing tonight hey good rama i just want
9485220	9490020	to say real quick to this our phones are like packed tonight it's weird like it's just constantly
9490020	9494260	lit up the whole screen so if you don't get through tonight don't get sand in your vagina
9494260	9497780	just send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com because millions of people will call
9497780	9501220	but yet no one will email us i don't understand all right barama you got through what's on your
9501220	9507780	mind tonight a few things um number one i know the music is out on the podcast but when you were
9507780	9515060	playing music from um space channel five i had mentioned that about years ago i was in a skit
9515060	9519540	where it was dance dance revolution versus space channel five i had to have been at least 10 years
9519540	9527140	ago when ddr was popular i'm just kidding i bet it was close to seven what was uh what was what
9527140	9533780	was this ddr versus space channel five sketch it was pretty much a dance off between which was
9533780	9539140	better on the characters from space channel five or ddr but what had happened was way to see it
9539140	9544340	let's go after the dance off uh the main villain from space channel five part two comes out tries
9544340	9550580	to take over the convention both sides join forces and do another dance off to destroy him but we
9550580	9555380	cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together now which character did you play and
9555380	9563540	please don't say space michael rage rage nice you wear pants no i did not have the hair i didn't
9563540	9570420	have time to throw that together you didn't go as pantsless rage no it's an old school a large
9570420	9578580	old school old school good you wore pants yes indeed so who ultimately ended up being victorious
9578580	9586180	the ddr people or the space channel five people i really don't know because it just ended up like
9586180	9590180	a tie per se but we still ended up winning an award which was pretty cool it was open to
9590180	9596340	interpretation that's what it was yes whatever you wanted to happen you as the viewer so what
9596340	9602340	cons are coming up rama any cons you're going to soon you're the con king uh anime boston but you
9602340	9606180	know that's them but i do have a couple more things i want to cover that i'm gonna be on my
9606180	9613860	merry little way all right number one loki you mentioned about what's the point of having
9613860	9618740	projectors with video games and stuff like that something tells me you've never seen gaming
9618740	9624660	tournaments i missed like half of what you just said there yeah you you bought uh you botched up
9624660	9628580	a little bit i don't know the connection but let me just repeat a little bit um rama is basically
9628580	9631380	a couple weeks ago on the show i don't even remember when you said it but you talked about
9631380	9635940	projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles but rama is saying well what about
9635940	9640500	gaming tournaments or anime cons or you know he does conventions and probably sees like ddr on
9640500	9646500	projectors all the time at the atari party they had um games on projector yeah that's cool that
9646500	9650660	you can do that but you can do that with pretty much any console i don't think it needs to be
9650660	9659300	necessarily built into a console and that being its you know its uh primary source of you know
9659300	9666020	putting out the images it's just it's impractical for a lot of people i mean for maybe a convention
9666020	9671540	or something like that where you don't want to bring a tv um that may work but the majority of
9671540	9677140	people out there don't use projectors a projector is basically a tv you know and so you use it for
9677140	9684180	certain scenarios so i guess that's where loki's coming from eh i'm just saying you know if you if
9684180	9688340	it's like if they come out with like some sort of 3d holographic system or something like that that
9688340	9695300	requires some special display that's not out there holodeck in a box you know then you know you want
9695300	9700900	one but like if it's just like oh look it's this console with a projector like a pico projector
9700900	9711540	built in it's kind of i don't know it's neat i guess but it's impractical unless of course it
9711540	9715140	runs on batteries and that might be pretty cool because then you can at least take it places and
9715140	9722660	play stuff but um you know i don't know all right rama anything else i had something else but i'll
9722660	9727140	save that for another time all right fair enough or you can email hint hint we need more emails all
9727140	9735140	right we'll do rama take care buddy no problem bye have fun at anime boston be good times all
9735140	9740820	right uh let's go ahead and get to some more calls 1877 game olr username on skype is orange
9740820	9744740	lunch radio we can do at least one more call right one more one more call yeah all right
9744740	9751940	one more call salacious pop says yes you want to take a call it'll be fun no all right all right
9751940	9755220	see what's lighting up now it's not well it takes about a minute in about a minute it's going to
9755220	9759300	light up completely all right loki uh is there any last minute stories i know you're just getting
9759300	9764340	into that okay go video but uh is there any last minute stories yeah actually there's um you know
9764340	9771220	it's a series that's on the uh ios system real racing um they've got real racing 2 hd that's
9771220	9776340	going to be getting a ipad 2 update that's actually going to turn the ipad 2 into almost
9776340	9782740	like a console it's uh 1080p visuals which make it look almost like a gran turismo type quality
9782740	9788740	game and use the actual um ipad as the steering wheel with the gas and brake on there and it has
9788740	9794580	a like a map display on the actual ipad but the actual games on the tv let me go to the phones
9794580	9799620	because we like clockwork like almost exactly a certain number of seconds after i said we're done
9799620	9803940	the buffer caught up we got another lit up board this is going to be the last call though guys um
9803940	9807940	so if you didn't get through again please email sorry all right uh hi caller you're on the air
9807940	9813380	who's this hey this is excellent hey what's on your mind buddy hey never much um first off i'm
9813380	9818500	very proud of my stepdaughter she's loving and she already been in less than about a month and
9818500	9822820	a half been through the first two games of the professor latent series and only needed help like
9822820	9827060	once or twice with one or two of the puzzles that is really amazing that's really good that's a very
9827060	9832340	cerebral game so awesome for her yeah she's very smart and she loves this type of puzzle game so
9832340	9836500	i'm looking forward to getting her the third one you got a kid genius on your hand mensa test
9836500	9841940	yeah really no joke um i bought pokemon black the day it came out and i really loved it and
9841940	9847300	i haven't played pokemon for quite a while i really pissed off the original and the only
9847300	9852580	reason why i got it was because a lot of my friends i knew had was getting either getting
9852580	9858340	the black or getting white so i decided well why not so you know and um try it out i'm really
9858340	9863300	enjoying it i'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated some of the move sets have changed around
9863300	9869540	and the different ways they're doing the wi-fi connection now so i can trade with friends even
9869540	9874900	from across states if i wanted to which was really cool which i tried that out so it was though the
9874900	9880020	microphone when it came on kind of threw for a loop but um it was very it's very cool though i
9880020	9884340	mean the the features and the functionality to put into it unfortunately it's kind of sad that
9884340	9889860	the global link where you could put your pokemon and do dream and put them in like a dream world
9889860	9895300	was kind of like a um web browser game type thing unfortunately won't be coming anytime soon because
9895300	9899860	of the fact that over japan with the earthquake they had to shut down the servers for it and they
9899860	9905620	came out with a release saying though it was supposed to come on on the 30th um for uh north
9905620	9913060	america and europe there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up so that was the
9913060	9916420	one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there
9916420	9922100	has been a delay and they have really statements about that so let me ask you the same fanboy
9922100	9926100	question i haven't asked everybody else about the whole pokemon mmo would you would you leave
9926100	9933540	warcraft for a pokemon mmo no no why is that i think that would be more towards your like
9933540	9939300	smaller kids and stuff kind of like the free realm is for like sony um i really don't see it
9939300	9946500	mean more towards adults i wouldn't mind playing it just for you know lols or if it's you know for
9946500	9951220	a good price but i just don't really see me playing a pokemon mmo when i just can go online
9951220	9955300	and just do the same things to the regular pokemon and just challenge somebody over wi-fi
9956260	9959940	gotcha unless they're gonna offer like a bunch more stuff to it so
9961780	9966340	i don't know i'm just i'm just type you know i just thought i couldn't really see myself doing
9966340	9970900	that but if they didn't want to do it it'll be a good cash cow go for it it'll probably give
9970900	9975140	wild probably run for our money if they if they can pull if they can play it off and do it right
9975140	9981780	that is and um also coming into the straight mail too for the bio well the bioware sorry really
9981780	9988340	quickly i don't get offended when i would play games say like dragon age uh dragon age 2 mass
9988340	9994340	effect and had a chill quote gay uh sex scene would happen i'm not gonna be like oh my god i
9994340	9998260	can't believe i'm seeing this i mean i couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and
9998260	10002900	said for all the street mail sorry not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that so
10003540	10010340	and if i don't like something i just don't play it that's as simple as that so right so uh yeah um
10011380	10016740	it was a weird story and it's it's kind of cool though the bioware like came out and just totally
10016740	10021300	like defended it and i'm glad that like if they're gonna go all in like that they really go like all
10021300	10026740	in and stand by it and you know the artistic stuff behind it precisely and i don't see any reason as
10026740	10032260	to why it didn't cause an outcry people knew about this way before i mean as soon as the game hits
10032260	10036500	people knew about this they warned people and they were like oh we're putting all this stuff in we're
10036500	10040900	showing you some of the scenes and they're letting people know and it's like it was your choice
10040900	10046500	either you do you can either a buy it knowing what was in it or b don't buy it don't worry about it
10046500	10051780	at all and just don't get all up you know don't make those decisions like like like it was said
10051780	10057540	before you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen and you would know
10057540	10063060	because of by the reaction of the people and what they say i mean it's kind of obvious all right
10063940	10068580	well we'll leave it on that for now excellent thanks so much for the call anytime enjoy your
10068580	10074020	pokemans oh i will all right see you see ya kind of surprised you didn't say anything about the

10185860	10190180	if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for nintendo dogs they are really like
10191780	10196180	really just missing the boat here because it's with friends which because all the games are
10196180	10202020	nintendo dogs and cats you know with friends um and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video and
10202020	10211780	it's in 3d come on nintendo it's like here you go great ad campaign don't have to do anything you
10211780	10218180	you just go go with it okay go no seriously though i'm surprised they should have if they wanted to
10218180	10221620	be kind of hip and cool about it they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with
10221620	10225540	little big planet where it was with live actors and stuff like that that i'm pretty awesome
10226500	10230500	but then again the game is just a rehash of the last game or they just need to get oprah to
