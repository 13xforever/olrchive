15780	23001	2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have some 3DS titles already been cancelled?
31451	36013	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36053	38274	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
38654	42256	It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.
43117	43917	My name is Rob Roberts.
43937	46358	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
46578	49400	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49860	50320	Woo!
50520	51601	How are you doing, Jamie Summers?
51781	52201	Woo!
52621	55142	Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?
55963	56063	Ugh!
56243	56523	Yeah.
56943	61126	I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smushage.
63668	65109	It looks like boob smash.
66465	67726	Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.
91549	97858	Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute, but of course we can't do a show without Techmaster Loki!
98679	101623	See, the reason they canceled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.
102684	103605	Did she?
105128	106089	She very well could have.
106678	109921	No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.
110141	110521	I don't know.
111081	111722	I can't explain it.
112543	113303	So how are you doing, Loki?
113403	113864	What's new with you?
113984	115044	Oh, no, you're right, you're right.
115125	116866	I'm confusing her with Chyna.
117306	117847	My mistake.
118667	119248	I should never do that.
119528	121169	That's because Chyna did enough steroids.
121229	122450	Not the country, but the wrestler.
122610	123591	No, the wrestler, yes.
124051	125092	Yes, I should never.
125593	127734	I apologize, Lucy Lawless.
128635	130296	Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.
130416	131977	Lucy Lawless could play Chyna.
132098	132878	No, she's awesome.
132898	133919	In like a Lifetime movie.
133939	135440	Chyna is a man beast, okay?
136941	139684	No, it's because of steroids.
140445	143488	I understand it's because of steroids, but yes.
143749	144129	Oh, man.
145410	146211	Do I feel bad?
146992	151036	Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange Lounge Radio.
151056	152338	Say hello to Salacious Pop.
152578	152938	What up?
153219	153699	How you doing?
153879	154260	Doing good.
154460	154660	Yeah?
154840	156322	You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?
158794	159955	Do you watch any TV at all?
160275	160535	No.
160875	164515	I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.
164836	167516	There's no like, you know, Hulu that you watch?
167556	169416	Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.
169476	170237	You watch Archer.
170357	171357	You got me hooked on that show.
171397	172017	That show's funny.
172317	173537	I like that show on FX.
174297	174598	Really?
174898	175798	You think it's funny?
176058	176558	Yeah.
176758	182959	I tried watching a few episodes of that to see because, you know, it looked really funny and it was terrible.
183159	183299	Really?
183319	184500	It was just terrible.
184660	185760	No, I love Archer.
185800	186200	It's funny.
187065	191467	Maybe I gotta go back and watch it, but the first few episodes just annoyed me because it wasn't funny enough.
191967	193728	Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes, I don't know.
193988	195028	Maybe, I don't know.
195549	198070	But every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.
198090	208074	It's very dark, the secretary that wants to bang everybody, because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.
208414	210155	Just really, like, wow.
210255	210455	Yeah.
211195	212056	A lot of awesome stuff.
230745	232886	where you can join us in the live chat room.
232946	234407	We do interact with the audience.
235108	242012	For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, Why is the State Theater near my house doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week?
242312	242712	WTF.
243756	248481	People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff and I'm so over it.
248921	250583	Just like Rebecca Black.
250623	254847	Rebecca Black was cool a week ago and now I think I'm finally getting over it.
255648	257510	Now it's become a parody of itself in a way.
257550	261153	And Charlie Sheen, is your buddy doing a live tour or something?
261654	262094	No thanks.
262414	264837	I'll go watch Hot Shots again.
265577	267639	I never actually watched the interview.
268807	269528	or heard anything.
270228	272050	I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.
272230	274312	Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?
274612	277054	Either of them.
277094	279617	I watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.
280978	284441	What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?
285121	287582	That was... Alan, what was that you posted on the walls?
287702	291103	There's a group called... I don't want to get their name wrong.
291143	291884	Bad Lip Sync?
292404	293104	Bad Lip Reading?
293364	293965	Yeah, that was it.
294385	311371	So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth and then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how... And then if you look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what it looks like she's saying.
311992	312812	And it's pretty awesome.
316198	317058	As you're queuing up the video.
317138	322121	I would try to play some of it here, but YouTube's acting ignorant right now.
322161	322661	It's terrible.
323761	324982	It's very ignorant right now.
325102	325962	I can't believe this.
326362	326943	Such ignorance.
328163	328563	There it goes.
329744	333706	Let's see if I can play some of this here.
333726	336547	I'm gonna see it get nasty.
351295	352236	Awesome.
352256	356398	That should be the theme song to River City Ransom Part 2, which we were talking about last week.
358660	359801	About fighting and chickens.
359941	360501	Barney.
360521	362022	We got party hats.
362062	362722	Barney, Barney.
363303	365444	I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.
365905	368026	It's actually much... I could listen to that.
368166	369207	I would buy that on iTunes.
369587	374010	It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, earworm than the original is.
374290	375351	Because I'll be in the shower.
375371	377312	It's like, stop it.
377372	379794	I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.
381315	383397	Alright, let's talk about actual video games.
383437	387781	I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen and Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes of our show.
387801	388402	That's way too much.
388762	391244	Let's talk about actual video games and how was your gaming week?
391565	393426	Ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
394467	396910	My gaming week was epic.
398231	404757	Well, in the terms of RPGs, because Dan and I are playing, well more like Dan's playing through it and I'm watching him while I crochet.
405499	434046	we're playing through Final Fantasy and we're halfway through the first game and when we're done with that we're going to go to 2 and then since we don't have a home version of 3 that we can play on the TV we're going to skip on to 4 and then we're going to do 5 which we've got a couple versions of now 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10-2 11 was crap and not really a game I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while
434226	436488	I played it for three years and never got to level cap.
436508	436889	What about 12-2?
456643	458524	12.2 was on the DS.
459284	462445	And it wasn't really 12.2, it was a side story.
462525	464246	There's a 12.2 that we saw.
465806	464246	13.2.
465866	468207	So there's two damn many games now.
468227	475690	Now, are you going to be playing the Final Fantasy 4, was it the After Years or whatever?
475710	477751	It may be out by the time we get to it.
477851	479511	We just might hook up the SNES.
479791	480171	I don't know.
480431	482732	Well, you can put it on the Wii.
483553	484293	We loaned out our Wii.
486102	486943	Our Wii's on loan.
487003	491108	If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.
491308	491708	I don't know.
492409	494411	We've got anthology versions.
494531	496934	I think I have one if you need to borrow one.
496994	498295	We've got anthology versions.
498355	500357	We've got the Super Nintendo versions.
501098	504281	Really, we've got, I think, three different versions of that game that we could play.
504722	505523	Let me back up a little bit.
505563	506284	Why are you doing this?
506764	509886	because this is romantic.
510786	519931	Well, back in the day, I say that like it was so long ago, but Dan would play it through Resident Evil 2 and I would be his navigator.
520431	529316	It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because it's been a long time since I've played the first one and when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.
530416	532238	I'm a Wonderswan But with the souped up music
547495	550217	The Warrior, The Monk, The Thief, and Red Mage
564446	565426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
581092	584194	Hi, I'm versatile and can cast Fire 3.
585936	591660	Then our friend Becky, he's named our monk because Becky kicks ass.
592581	596424	And then Mystique is the thief because it's Mystique.
596804	598825	And the thief is always asleep or dead.
600747	604870	Which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what Mystique's like whenever we have work to do.
606871	607732	And she's been on the show.
607892	608433	People have heard her.
609253	632087	um so it's pretty fun and like I was yelling at the husband the other day I'm playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 3 mostly at school like before class when I get a chance to and uh playing wow and um I made a new character Rebecca Black just because I thought it would be funny and I like now you're stuck with it
632877	636721	Well, I like running through Stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?
637242	638783	And I'm like, yeah.
640825	641686	Just because it's fun.
641846	643127	It's my own version of trolling.
643187	645289	No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.
649130	650431	I brought this chicken for us to eat.
651352	652753	Anything else for your gaming week?
656495	656876	Pinball.
657316	658497	I actually played some pinball.
659017	659518	Good times.
660018	667283	I played some World Cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.
668304	670726	And then I, like, drained them on my last two balls.
670766	673428	It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck.
673528	674569	Whee!
674669	674829	Whee!
675438	676660	Goal!
676800	677161	Suck.
677641	678743	That was what my game was like.
679464	680346	And Dan's my witness.
680406	681147	He can vouch for me.
682249	683551	That's my gaming week.
683951	684252	Awesome.
684552	685133	And I crocheted.
685574	686996	Loki, how about you and your gaming week?
689552	691253	Um, what did I play this week?
691353	692354	Uh, Motorstorm Apocalypse.
692394	696736	I finished the rookie, uh, story mode thing.
697356	700278	Um, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.
700478	701819	It's really hard as it is.
701959	709403	So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually kind of an archer type intro for.
710243	712765	Um, so I'm interested to see where that goes.
713325	716367	And then, um, what else did I play?
717227	718068	I played...
718948	720689	More Ridge Racer, because it's fun.
721470	725513	I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.
725633	734699	I got my US 3DS now, and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it should be sold this week.
735860	739723	And got some Pilotwings and Super Street Fighter 4.
740263	743706	So, those are kind of the games to get, I guess.
744967	745107	Um...
746476	748097	And that's really what I'm getting for a while.
777600	788729	I still kinda sorta want one.
789809	792211	There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.
792351	797335	A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.
798616	800678	Beyond that, might as well wait.
801018	801919	I mean, seriously, it's
803729	805230	It's not a Wii situation right now.
805730	809412	And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.
809612	813515	And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.
814375	820499	You know, I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo really seemed hellbent on getting this thing out in March.
820539	826622	And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we really start ramping up for the holiday season?
826682	831805	Like, part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had the Kid Icarus and some of these other games...
832225	834646	Maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many third parties on board.
834706	840667	Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is the movies, the entertainment package and everything.
841647	849669	If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the summer, kids' graduation presents and things like that.
849829	853250	Let's say they sell a million of these, if not more, by summertime.
853530	857691	Then there's already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey...
858251	862979	How about putting out that Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?
865240	867521	I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.
867541	870962	I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.
871502	880566	And by putting it out just before the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're going to sell all their first batch of systems probably within the first week.
881267	885668	And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their investors.
886089	888430	That's all I really think the reason why they did it.
888470	891551	Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here.
892031	893572	Actually, it's out in all regions now.
894938	895919	Thanks for watching!
923667	928951	That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.
929192	931894	Yeah, you still bought one, like a lamb to the slaughter.
932274	933235	You were in line.
934216	936017	I don't care about their crappy web browser.
936577	939460	Or their store, because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.
939940	950469	Although, I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had, and they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music, but
951149	951929	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
974656	976838	which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.
977198	982002	All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer and then the background was on the back layer.
982142	988287	I mean, but I'm not going to lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming to get done?
988367	989028	Probably not.
989128	992851	No, they just built an emulator and it runs ROMs and that's it.
993311	993651	You're done.
995272	996914	A question from Tigerclaw in our chat room.
996954	1000416	I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they are going to do on the 3DS browser.
1001437	1002238	Do you think any at all?
1002978	1004738	Probably not, if anything.
1004758	1005619	Maybe something in Flash?
1005839	1006199	I don't know.
1007139	1014860	Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit, they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.
1015421	1018901	They supported Flash, or no, they didn't support Flash.
1018921	1020562	I can't remember what they supported.
1020582	1022522	They supported something with it.
1022562	1023542	It was very basic.
1023582	1026803	It was just like the PSP was, where it supported... It used Basic.
1026823	1027123	Basic.
1027763	1048182	it supports flash but very little flash because of the kits that they had but I think if anything what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that those 3D pictures are in so like say if I post that on my wall or something like that somewhere in a webpage it would be in 3D on yours
1048302	1059131	Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing Nintendo games in Flash on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games on my 3D.
1059151	1059911	It would be very meta.
1060932	1061573	No, you couldn't.
1061873	1069499	And the reason why you couldn't is because it doesn't have the processing power to handle something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like that either.
1070420	1073442	So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP.
1073462	1075084	You'd never be able to build something like that.
1075703	1077706	I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room.
1077766	1081170	The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.
1081210	1081911	I did hear about that.
1081951	1083533	Yeah, that's interesting.
1083653	1086376	It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know.
1087758	1089220	It's more of a show-off thing, right?
1089981	1092303	It's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D.
1092504	1095187	Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.
1096619	1098360	Okay, go ahead.
1099021	1101082	Okay, go ahead.
1101222	1102823	For the record, Okay Go is a good band.
1103224	1105966	No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.
1106006	1109808	Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in Rock Band.
1109928	1112210	All their videos since then have been amazing.
1112410	1117494	Oh, yeah, and that one that was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing video.
1117514	1120436	Well, there's the one with the dogs, the one with them in the park, with the stop motion.
1120456	1121897	The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there.
1121917	1122137	Okay.
1122217	1122417	Okay.
1124150	1127651	So it's like they're on the cutting edge of music videos.
1127671	1129272	It's like them and Lady Gaga right there.
1130733	1131433	They should collaborate.
1131513	1134494	I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.
1134614	1134874	Really?
1134954	1135374	Good show.
1136055	1136475	Good times.
1136695	1137555	Another good band.
1138595	1140236	Alright, so is that it for your Gaming Week, Loki?
1140896	1142437	Some 3DS rants and so forth?
1143037	1152621	Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday, which, I don't know why all the hate, really.
1152862	1154782	Everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever.
1154802	1156783	This is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.
1157344	1158184	It was entertaining.
1158784	1162366	Oh damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertainment movies?
1162386	1163326	I don't understand.
1163446	1168429	See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really?
1168449	1168989	It's alright.
1169009	1169549	It's what you want to see?
1170250	1170810	Let me put it this way.
1170910	1175692	It's kind of funny because a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of different games.
1175752	1186697	Like, they have this one scene that you've probably seen there where they're in a mech and stuff, and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from Killzone.
1186717	1187098	I mean, it's...
1188298	1189359	It's pretty much that.
1189679	1191080	It looks so much like it.
1191140	1191680	It's ridiculous.
1191921	1192761	Are there lots of boobs?
1192941	1194102	Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.
1194182	1194462	It's PG-13.
1194822	1195783	Oh, come on!
1198285	1202467	No, but it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train.
1203228	1210373	And it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy XIII where they're fighting soldiers and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.
1211952	1215934	It's badass, but seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?
1215974	1217594	This would be really awesome as a game.
1218254	1221476	Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.
1221596	1223576	I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.
1224557	1228158	I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.
1228878	1232040	He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.
1232060	1232140	The 300...
1234244	1235204	Problematic but awesome.
1235224	1235964	Then Watchmen.
1236285	1238285	I love the novel, but now this.
1238605	1241326	So Superman's going to be great.
1243266	1245887	It was cool, but I see people's complaints.
1245907	1248708	They're like, well, the first part of the movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.
1249168	1249828	So what?
1250368	1251829	So it didn't have dialogue in it.
1251889	1252869	Neither did WALL-E.
1253249	1256270	So that argument is null and void because WALL-E is one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years.
1256290	1258850	Sort of the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001.
1258970	1259130	Yeah.
1261511	1271320	But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.
1272000	1273221	And, whatever, who cares?
1273401	1280448	It doesn't matter because if it was just like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution and stuff.
1280688	1286093	It's basically her coping with whatever is going on because apparently, you know, there's...
1286813	1292136	Stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as a burlesque type place.
1294037	1300540	The way she copes with it goes into this imaginary world thing where she's solving how she's going to escape.
1300960	1303661	You see how she's going to figure that out right in the very beginning.
1303701	1307923	She figured it all out, but this is just all very quick.
1308103	1311665	Kind of like Inception where there's a lot of stuff taking place in a very short period of time.
1312265	1315810	and Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.
1315970	1316992	Boobies in 3D.
1317052	1318354	Is there any porn in 3D?
1318794	1323241	Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and you can download it to your flashcard.
1323781	1326405	It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.
1326465	1327867	And it would not be difficult to do that.
1328207	1339077	I would say otherwise your biggest hope would be Netflix when it comes out if they start doing the 3D movies and then like Piranha 3D is going to be like your boobies in 3D or whatever else.
1339157	1348204	Well once they have it where you can say take video with your 3DS and stuff they'll find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and
1349125	1349646	Ta-da!
1349666	1350226	You know what I mean?
1350286	1350646	It'll be done.
1351067	1352187	But then again, I don't know.
1352207	1353768	It'd be hard to do 3D.
1353788	1361414	There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays, and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet, so I don't know.
1361474	1362134	It might be a while.
1362174	1363395	But boobies in 3D.
1363515	1364856	I mean, that's a great use of 3D.
1365216	1368619	But once again, though, that's just to get people in seats for, like, Piranha 3D.
1368679	1370420	I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's...
1372151	1372991	It is interesting.
1374192	1378433	I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and it's got a lot of gore in it.
1378713	1379974	That sounds awesome.
1381414	1382514	Alright, whatever.
1382755	1384895	You're part of the problem!
1385115	1385615	No, no, okay.
1385796	1387896	There is something I can't remember.
1388256	1390517	I'm trying to think if we're actually going to get into it tonight.
1391737	1393378	God, I had a Nintendo thing.
1395299	1399320	I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something
1399941	1407106	I have to refresh my memory while I was pissed off.
1407226	1407727	It's pretty good.
1409628	1416113	I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2 because I have to revisit that game every couple months.
1417013	1421757	My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is the very beginning when you're on the train.
1422435	1425618	play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm.
1426658	1429701	Which is the very scary, gory Resident Evil inspired.
1429721	1434204	I think the developers of Valve said that Resident Evil influenced that zone.
1434625	1437347	I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.
1437907	1438708	That's where I'm at right now.
1439268	1440189	I played some Warcraft 3.
1440269	1443011	The RTS from 2003.
1443872	1445433	I'm starting to use cheat codes now.
1446394	1447755	Just so I can see the story.
1449377	1449817	And uh
1452256	1453397	Wow, World of Warcraft.
1454678	1455139	That's about it.
1456660	1459883	When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?
1460524	1468031	Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.
1468912	1472476	If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.
1474850	1475611	Boy band or adult diaper?
1475631	1476211	Something like that?
1497409	1502211	I don't know.
1502611	1505032	I want to ruin the game for you guys.
1505592	1506192	It was great.
1506392	1507013	Laughed.
1507333	1508433	It's just a fun party game.
1508813	1511554	Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played You Don't Know Jack.
1511734	1513115	It called me an idiot to my face.
1513255	1513595	Yeah, that's right.
1513615	1514755	The game called you an idiot.
1514815	1515555	I forgot about that.
1515856	1516416	What was the question?
1516436	1516856	Something about...
1517176	1522520	Which one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Blarney Stone?
1522940	1527983	And it was like, the correct answer was the kiss from Spider-Man, because you're supposed to kiss the Blarney Stone upside down.
1528423	1538590	But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp, and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer goes, Yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Blarney Stone, idiot.
1540411	1541933	He ended up winning the round anyway.
1542153	1543995	Yeah, I took it home at the end.
1544116	1552505	We couldn't hear any follow-up because Grandpa Warcraft, who we were playing with, and I were laughing so loud we couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an idiot.
1552965	1553286	Great.
1554561	1580991	um otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade and every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that he's like why aren't you playing this on PC but I don't know I want the achievements don't judge me um and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade I once knew you know we've had a bunch of sad news about you know we had the Chinatown Arcade in New York City closed Arcade Infinity closed as far as I'm concerned Roseville Golf Land closed too that place is dead to me
1581591	1588896	I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.
1589397	1590617	He's gonna hear me fuss.
1590958	1593099	There's no Beatmania anymore.
1593139	1594780	There's no DJ Max Technica.
1595041	1597442	They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.
1597882	1599844	All they have is... DDR Disney.
1600004	1605708	Yeah, Disney and Max 2, and then the Drum Freaks guitar hero, which I'm not even into that anymore.
1605728	1609150	They have Guitar Freaks and Drum Freaks that beat the hell up, but they're there at least.
1609170	1609711	Yeah, they're beat.
1610351	1637086	but I'm just you know I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of I mean I would be cool if there were some fun fighting games no Capcom SNK to be found no Soul Calibur nothing it's they have an original Soul Calibur 2 where the hell was that it was hidden somewhere and they also have an SNK it's like um three different King of Fighters and then a Metal Slug one of those four-in-one boxes when I played that a couple months ago and I was last there I was
1637606	1641928	on the right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.
1642408	1643549	Yeah, this is sad.
1643869	1649991	The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because that is one racing game I do really like.
1650192	1650692	I'll play that.
1650732	1654694	They had Initial D5, which there's a lot of people really into that series.
1654774	1655634	I'm sure we're playing that.
1655919	1656479	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1673007	1676191	You know, like the Sega Rambo game.
1677312	1678614	That game is kind of fun.
1678714	1681197	Some dad swiped his card for his little girl.
1681217	1687484	She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun as big as she is playing Rambo.
1687564	1688465	She wasn't doing that well.
1688745	1689787	I was like, that is awesome.
1689827	1691188	You kill all those mercenaries.
1692029	1692929	You just, yeah.
1693069	1694010	You go ahead, girl.
1694170	1694630	Go ahead.
1694770	1694990	Yeah.
1695790	1698071	Go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1698111	1700211	Giovedea has a warning about the Blarney Stone.
1700311	1701431	Don't kiss the stone.
1701591	1704052	All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.
1704072	1706713	That's probably some good advice.
1707173	1707693	You know what?
1708013	1712934	I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle.
1714034	1716015	I've got video of my uncle doing it.
1716455	1716835	Oh, really?
1717055	1718075	Yeah.
1718395	1719276	No, not peeing on it.
1719296	1720296	Your uncle kissed pee.
1722089	1723330	He went for his honeymoon.
1723790	1724070	Oh, okay.
1724290	1724790	And kissed pee.
1725671	1725851	No.
1725951	1726771	Like Lady and the Tramp?
1726811	1732994	I don't think... I really don't think there's any way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.
1733835	1734315	You know what?
1734395	1736156	That's what boys like to do is pee on things.
1736196	1737717	So where there's a will, there's a pee.
1738917	1741219	Anyway, what else did I play this week otherwise?
1741759	1744440	That was... I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.
1744620	1744740	Oh!
1744880	1747141	Final Fantasy III on the iPhone came out this week.
1748622	1749422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1771369	1772790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1791244	1796309	So if that ends up being the case of Final Fantasy 3, you can just move your thumb to the upper right and have your analog stick be there.
1796409	1798831	It's a very small little improvement that I really like.
1800012	1802334	The only tricky, touchy price is the price.
1804316	1807018	$15.99 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.
1807579	1811542	So it's a little high, but then you gotta... What a game is worth...
1812663	1830129	is really up in the air right now and this is where a lot of controversy comes in which you've heard about you know a game developers conference where Nintendo was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and sold 99 cents for a game and you know all this so I mean $15.99 yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game but at the same time
1830729	1838375	The quality is pretty great and you're getting a port or remake, whatever you want to call it, of a $35 DS game.
1839055	1842278	I mean, I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.
1842318	1848462	I mean, it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this if you're a Final Fantasy fan.
1848482	1850384	I mean, you already know if this game is for you or not.
1850444	1852625	Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.
1853766	1858867	But it looks beautiful, and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't really see for yourself.
1860807	1874170	The very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out the 4 remake as well, but at the same time, with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with the After Years.
1874650	1876530	So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.
1876550	1879371	What if they put it out with the remake and the After Years?
1879691	1883494	On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.
1883974	1892221	And even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like five years ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4.
1893081	1894843	So I'm probably not going to get that on the iPhone.
1895363	1899626	Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.
1900106	1906591	If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like $10 whenever the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.
1907152	1907272	So...
1908857	1910962	Anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.
1911383	1914209	So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.
1915013	1916274	Actually, it's just what you were talking about.
1916574	1919015	How Nintendo was poo-pooing on the developers and stuff like that.
1919135	1921537	The indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.
1922017	1928280	They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system.
1928741	1930502	Is their quote.
1930922	1935645	You know, people that... They want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers.
1935705	1937325	Just people that make games, I guess.
1938546	1941828	Because they don't want crappy games coming out on their system.
1942408	1943009	Yeah.
1943949	1944470	Excuse me!
1946253	1947614	Crappy games coming out of your system.
1948516	1951360	The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.
1951480	1960452	There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers and legitimate publishers.
1961678	1965400	I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there.
1965720	1973224	Somebody that, I don't know, might add some innovation to something instead of, say, licensing Jelly Belly or licensing Smiley Face.
1973744	1976545	The icon of the 60s, 70s?
1977546	1979427	Woo, that's current.
1980807	1983889	You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.
1984369	1988071	I don't think... See, once again, this kind of goes back to they don't understand...
1989483	1990644	The whole online business.
1990664	1996987	They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to the online thing, they're just lost.
1997147	1999768	It's like they just don't know what they're doing.
2000749	2010954	And it's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?
2011014	2015456	You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.
2017358	2024931	I mean, how do you not put virtual console stuff out there for $4, $5, $6, $7 and put it all out for $9?
2025372	2030281	I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just crazy amounts of games.
2030834	2039962	Well, the other thing, too, is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?
2040202	2041563	They have to buy the SDK, right?
2042184	2042824	I think so.
2042964	2047969	Well, actually, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit, because I think you can just download that.
2048029	2048469	Yes.
2049230	2050271	There is a license.
2050291	2051492	There is.
2051712	2057317	So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless of if the developers are making the money or not.
2057617	2064440	The only thing they have to worry about is if anything is going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.
2065181	2069343	I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have set up.
2070343	2077627	So, really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry about.
2078507	2081329	Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.
2081389	2086051	Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is it something they're going to do to make money?
2086391	2094945	It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with because Nintendo doesn't have to deal with the same clientele.
2095373	2102395	Here's the problem with Nintendo, and what they're worried about is the fact that they're a first-party developer as well.
2102575	2104156	I mean, they put out their own games.
2104296	2105616	Apple doesn't put out their own games.
2105736	2106516	They don't care.
2107156	2111478	And also, I mean, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.
2111738	2120700	They can put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.
2120720	2122261	There's so much garbage on there.
2122921	2123804	Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.
2123824	2128958	There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see what's garbage and what's not garbage.
2130453	2141621	So, they've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.
2141901	2144103	It's just they're not willing to embrace that.
2144183	2152308	It's tricky to say, too, where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super Meat Boy, and that was kind of a, I mean, I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer, but it was definitely in that middle ground.
2152328	2154470	I mean, it was basically two guys that made that whole game.
2155591	2157852	Despite maybe they had somebody else do the music and so forth.
2157892	2158953	But the core of the game was two guys.
2159273	2163076	And it's probably one of the best arcade games to have come out in the past year.
2163096	2167940	Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?
2168240	2171542	Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.
2172063	2173083	And I don't have a problem with that.
2173123	2175365	What if people want to buy fart apps?
2175385	2175966	That's fine.
2175986	2176406	You know what?
2176466	2179448	No one's going to say, oh, well, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.
2179568	2180789	Then you don't buy it, okay?
2181009	2181790	That's not a big deal.
2182130	2188052	Well, and the whole point, too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only really work on something like a phone.
2188252	2193573	Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.
2193954	2196934	Would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the Wii?
2197895	2198175	No?
2199035	2202836	Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring out your phone and do it.
2202976	2208098	Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.
2208720	2208960	Yeah.
2209321	2217507	But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer is do people like their games?
2217947	2219409	Because that's really the only difference to them.
2219829	2222851	Oh, two people developing out of a garage made a popular game.
2223072	2224112	Oh, well, they're an indie developer.
2224753	2227435	You know, large company makes fart app.
2227555	2228796	Oh, well, they're a garage developer.
2229196	2232879	That's really, I think, the only... That's their only excuse.
2232899	2233660	Yeah.
2233800	2239286	Really, it just comes down to that they're just not embracing what they need to be embracing.
2239326	2240827	The business model that's going to make them money.
2240948	2243951	Some interesting comments from chat room.
2243991	2247234	Blackwolf says, XNA indie games sold so well too.
2247514	2247875	Or wait.
2248855	2255736	I would say, though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft really advertised it at first.
2255816	2260777	Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the real arcade?
2260857	2261997	They do that.
2262137	2262757	Do they?
2263197	2265898	They do that, but it's so rare, though.
2266278	2269198	Because I know that Dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing.
2269939	2277840	It's a competition that they hold each year, and the top few games actually do get published as Xbox Live Arcade games.
2278120	2278801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2293197	2297079	and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.
2297119	2307706	People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store where you can say, okay, well, the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just crap, you know, I rated it one star.
2307786	2312569	It's, okay, this game is glitchy and it doesn't load or this game is broken or whatever.
2312589	2314490	The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.
2314530	2320514	It's a clunky way to find good games and it really screws over those developers who don't land in the top spots.
2320994	2323775	It's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.
2323895	2325455	That's my only thing with XNA.
2325756	2327716	There's so many games on there, I don't know where to begin.
2327896	2329637	And a lot of the top stuff is poop.
2330197	2332798	And a lot of people probably look at that and go, really?
2332918	2335119	If this is the top stuff on XNA?
2335479	2336139	Not all of it.
2336159	2338280	There's some good stuff that gets in there, but I don't know.
2339660	2344341	I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong.
2344521	2346042	And it's just the presentation of it all.
2346302	2347962	And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.
2348062	2349543	I get why they put it where they do.
2350003	2352343	But there's ways they could feature it better than they do.
2352644	2353104	You know what I mean?
2353704	2359045	But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony is going to try with PlayStation Suite.
2359565	2361806	And that is something that's on the horizon.
2362066	2365167	PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.
2365447	2365787	DarkSakura,
2380844	2389413	I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leads to Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make games.
2389593	2397281	And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny.
2397321	2398222	I'm going to download that.
2399043	2399564	But that's fine.
2399824	2401225	You don't have to download that.
2401646	2403728	And that's the thing Nintendo has to understand.
2404791	2406357	Even the stuff that they have people paying.
2406939	2410493	Seriously, they have the Major League Eating game.
2411069	2412169	I mean, come on.
2412309	2412910	I mean, come on.
2412990	2415890	Is that really Nintendo quality?
2416070	2421612	I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League Eating on our system.
2422052	2424153	Or like the Beer Pong game or something like that.
2424773	2426133	There's a lot of crap on there.
2426153	2431915	And the fact that they're just coming out saying, oh, well, we don't want these garage developers ruining our system.
2431995	2439297	I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.
2441810	2445894	Alright, well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news, but that's okay.
2446014	2446835	We're talking about games.
2446855	2447616	That's how we roll.
2447676	2449758	No, we haven't got the video, or the news.
2449918	2451019	We want to get to more of the news.
2451800	2452281	But that's okay.
2452961	2454663	Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.
2454783	2460609	Of course, you can always add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2460969	2465554	That's how you can keep tabs with us online, or visit our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
2466034	2470316	Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.
2470356	2472817	Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.
2473337	2475718	Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.
2476099	2478300	Let's get into some video game news for the week.
2478420	2479280	Loki, start us off.
2480510	2482352	Yummy, yummy, yummy news.
2482992	2483853	Now, this is kind of funny.
2485295	2491140	I kind of laughed a little bit, but it's not that big a deal, and I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.
2492201	2493903	Duke Nukem Forever, delayed.
2495064	2498147	It's only delayed a month, and that's not a big deal.
2499508	2502109	And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.
2502650	2503891	It was coming out in May.
2505151	2507313	Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.
2507773	2511235	Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A.
2511576	2521823	Noire, then there's Brink, and then Fear 3, and Hunted the Demon's Forge, Dungeon Siege 3, MX vs. ATV Alive.
2522103	2525245	I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.
2525325	2528247	Oh, LEGO, I mean, it's not really direct competition,
2529247	2530528	Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.
2531988	2534369	So, I mean... School's letting out, right?
2534549	2536850	So it's like school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.
2536870	2538831	But it's not typical that May's a busy month.
2538911	2551296	Usually June is a little bit busier, May's kind of eh, and then April's is dead, which April is still dead, but like last year they had a lot of good games come out in May and it kind of worked out for them, so they're kind of doing that again.
2553257	2580366	but it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June for them at least because June right now doesn't have much coming out it has a few AAA games and that's it I mean there's stuff that's not announced yet but very few games compared to May coming out so whatever it's a month it's not like 10 years now if it's delayed again and again and again and again then well you know there's not really anything we can say about that but did you watch the little video
2581144	2582125	I just watched the video, it was funny.
2582145	2582985	The video was funny.
2583425	2586787	Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know here.
2587407	2588908	You know, it was pretty funny.
2589548	2592510	Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.
2592530	2594090	But, you know, see, here's the thing.
2594751	2604275	I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in development only as long as Gearbox has had it.
2604695	2605416	Because I don't...
2605816	2606156	and DarkSakura.
2627915	2630497	And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.
2630577	2633660	I mean, they could have... It could have just, like, no one could have bought it.
2633740	2635081	They just said, eh, forget it, you know.
2635501	2637463	Duke Nukem's 10 years ago, who cares?
2638123	2638323	Right.
2639024	2642767	Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something, but... Oh, hell no, that wouldn't work.
2642827	2643367	Yeah, I know.
2643407	2645789	It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point, you just have to put it out.
2645829	2646390	Yes, I have an idea.
2646430	2651734	Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.
2651774	2656498	Bochikawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem forever if it wasn't delayed at least one more time.
2656758	2660081	And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.
2660401	2665566	And of course, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced.
2665726	2667508	Duke Match, Team Duke Match.
2667928	2674154	But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.
2674834	2677277	And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.
2678197	2682181	But the babe will sporadically freak out and you have to...
2683442	2683763	Bitch, please.
2705945	2707026	I don't want to be a widower at 33
2736485	2739146	Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?
2739306	2744088	Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.
2744188	2744668	I don't know.
2745988	2746469	Perhaps.
2747449	2749430	No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.
2749510	2750390	Come on, people.
2752031	2752351	I don't know.
2752391	2753491	Duke Nukem made me very happy.
2754251	2755832	I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.
2755892	2759973	I'm looking forward to this new one even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.
2760033	2762994	I'm going to be so, so very disappointed but I swear I don't care.
2764535	2764795	It's like
2765772	2766433	Death Race 3000 Death Race 2000
2791553	2793975	All right, well, moving on to something a little more artful.
2794515	2797237	Maybe you're familiar with a company called the Weinstein Company.
2797697	2803081	This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting into films when they left Miramax.
2803101	2804321	They went their separate ways, right?
2805122	2807964	And they actually put out or they distributed.
2808004	2808304	They don't.
2808584	2809324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2823912	2825153	Halloween, Hellraiser,
2849068	2855153	Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids, all of these would now fall under this possible TWC games label.
2855173	2856073	Because Spy Kids is frightening.
2857595	2859996	Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.
2860457	2866001	I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand they're what, James Bond for kids, right?
2866081	2866441	Pretty much?
2866461	2869644	It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.
2869664	2874688	There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became what, Lava Girl and Shark Boy?
2874888	2876929	And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.
2877430	2878110	He was Shark Boy.
2878411	2878811	Oh, really?
2880512	2882113	You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.
2882133	2883114	That kind of frightens me.
2883434	2885475	And it was the origin of Machete.
2886376	2886696	Oh, okay.
2886716	2888277	Well, that's okay.
2888977	2891799	Does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under Miramax?
2891999	2894101	They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.
2894241	2895722	Pulp Fiction was Miramax.
2895802	2897603	I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.
2898003	2900164	So where's my Kill Bill video game?
2900184	2901425	Maybe that could be a part of this.
2901565	2902366	I don't know.
2902546	2903386	It very well could be.
2903547	2904207	Very well could be.
2904307	2907089	Especially if they do a sequel, which they were talking about doing.
2907189	2907309	Yeah.
2907849	2925485	so that's it you know obviously no game announcements right now but they are exploring these brands in the video game universe I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense and yes I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago and you may remember I mean it's not unlike you know
2926446	2929229	Movie Studios to get into the game business.
2929469	2932532	Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.
2934194	2936777	Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot.
2936797	2938959	They don't do anything console-wise right now.
2939019	2945605	They like some online downloadable games, but Warner Games is a big one for sure.
2946086	2946526	And Disney.
2947467	2948068	Disney Interactive.
2949933	2950213	All right.
2950494	2952576	Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future.
2952636	2954437	But right now, nothing but an announcement.
2954618	2955318	And who knows?
2955378	2959923	Maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5 or 6 or 21.
2960363	2960763	Whatever.
2961184	2965568	Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.
2965788	2970993	Which I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies like Saw and all that stuff.
2971073	2973255	But to me, Scream is like...
2974136	2975397	I don't know, like, Scream is okay.
2975597	2978019	I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not, like, soft-sick.
2978059	2980220	I didn't mind the Scream movies, actually.
2980240	2980661	Yeah, Scream's cute.
2980681	2982302	I just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?
2982562	2983123	Showgirls.
2984644	2987165	Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.
2987225	2987846	I'll see those.
2988346	2991248	I just hope that Hayden Pantera is the before-the-credits killing.
2993670	2995451	No spoilers in chat, I will destroy you.
2995811	2997232	Alright, DarkSakura.
2998013	3002875	Well, speaking of kids, movies, and scary, Pokemons!
3003156	3003976	Yay!
3004416	3011640	Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold 2 million units in the first two weeks in the US.
3012621	3015082	And 5 million plus copies in Japan.
3015783	3017544	So, yeah, they've made their money.
3019568	3020829	7 million people playing the game.
3021950	3023731	Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.
3025472	3033916	Well, we were at Dimple, which is a local resale place, and they're saying that basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.
3033936	3034877	Oh, I'm sure.
3035057	3037818	Yeah, so... Kids eat this shit up.
3037838	3039699	How adults eat this stuff up, too.
3039780	3041981	Like, you know, Miklatov, who's been on this show in the past.
3042001	3044422	He was playing Black and White.
3044562	3046543	He imported it, and he got the regular ones.
3046643	3047184	But you know what?
3047964	3052446	Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?
3053107	3055248	Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.
3055648	3057649	Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.
3057669	3064572	Whatever I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old school black and white Game Boy.
3064833	3065353	You know what I mean?
3065713	3070275	Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.
3070335	3072616	Maybe black and white does something different that I haven't seen yet.
3073017	3074798	I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.
3074998	3076939	Oh, black and white, you can collect poop.
3077960	3078622	Oh, yay.
3078742	3080086	And their poop does special things.
3080607	3081349	Oh, hooray.
3083286	3084547	So, yeah.
3085648	3085968	Anyhow.
3086869	3088150	So, yeah.
3088550	3090252	I'll probably check that out eventually.
3090352	3092393	But you know there's going to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.
3092413	3092834	You know it.
3093534	3094175	Pokemon.
3094395	3094835	You know what?
3095376	3096456	I'm done with Pokemon.
3096897	3097457	I'm really done.
3099118	3102521	I would never say never because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?
3103102	3104002	Okay, that's different.
3104022	3106064	But I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.
3106564	3108666	Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.
3109086	3111288	I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.
3111488	3114671	There is sort of one that someone made called Pokefarm, like a website.
3114691	3122518	No, I mean official Reggie Fils-Aimé coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.
3122538	3123839	You know Nintendo wouldn't really do an MMO.
3123859	3125300	I have it tied to my harem of women down here.
3126121	3127963	You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.
3129424	3136030	If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.
3137011	3157397	it'd be something like Animal Crossing I think too a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs because Pokemon is so much for kids like you know it would be an MMO with predetermined phrases that you can say and you know it's it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO but that would be better than nothing but that's just me so
3159286	3163848	The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.
3165870	3167590	I read a list a couple days ago.
3167671	3174874	It was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game.
3174894	3178997	And it's like, this Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.
3179037	3179657	Cubone!
3180257	3181338	It was Cubone.
3181958	3182198	What?
3182578	3182879	Really?
3183079	3187061	This one is a soul of a dead child who comes back and eats other souls.
3187761	3213534	I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed and it's supposed to be like an alien thing but it's still like dude not cool you know this might be why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that maybe that hits a little close to home especially for kids anyhow let's move on more gaming news Loki
3214964	3216225	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3234605	3241533	Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.
3241993	3245638	So they're going to have some controller-free racing.
3246739	3249342	I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.
3249863	3250563	Like the U-Force?
3251384	3254027	I'd like to use Force or like Joyride.
3256088	3260993	They're saying it's going to support up to 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.
3262114	3265657	They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode.
3267599	3271083	A new career mode involving an automotive world tour.
3272224	3275708	They're going to increase the variety of challenges and events that you participate in.
3277350	3284958	The game is going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and shading models.
3286239	3288061	Also, I guess they're saying that...
3290566	3290986	Head Tracking
3314537	3315237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3336169	3336209	9-1-1
3347737	3359864	Actdeft wanted to correct something saying it's not it's actually not called Ground Zero though it's called Relic Castle maybe it was something to do with the translation one of my friends was saying something but of course you know how rumors go
3377188	3378750	So, alright, fine, there you go.
3378790	3380431	A little correction issued there.
3382513	3388118	Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza... Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.
3388479	3390220	I don't know.
3390460	3390981	Head tracking.
3391101	3392322	I'm very interested to see...
3394865	3395806	That implemented more games.
3395906	3397828	I really think it's a good idea, and it's simple.
3397908	3402051	If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to be like, oh, casual.
3402331	3406294	Head tracking is all you've got to do, and you can even say, hey, look, it puts you in the game, and guess what?
3406334	3409317	You don't have to use the stupid Kinect stuff if you don't want to.
3409437	3410077	That's awesome.
3411218	3412499	I had the cement mixer one.
3429693	3429993	Peek-a-Peek.com
3448129	3470958	PICA-PIC.com if you want to check this out you can actually play a variety of the Game & Watch LCD games at least until this website gets shut down but really Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game & Watch games I don't know so yeah I'm on it right now I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here let's see what did I find here
3472501	3474723	Otto's Slalom.
3475303	3476084	That doesn't look like fun.
3476104	3477285	I want to play Mario Brothers or something.
3478245	3478926	Mary Cook.
3479026	3479927	Oh, I remember this one.
3481368	3482108	Good Times.
3482228	3483049	Oh, you can even move back and forth.
3483069	3483870	That's done very well.
3484030	3490755	Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S and K. So let me see if I can start.
3490895	3491275	Here we go.
3492396	3493076	Good Times.
3495138	3497120	Listen to the sounds of LCD games.
3497160	3497560	That's right.
3497600	3499982	This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.
3500662	3501603	Oh, it looks like it's Russian.
3502748	3505492	Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.
3506594	3507836	Anyhow, good times.
3509318	3516089	So check that out, pica-pic.com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain you for like five minutes.
3517813	3523098	Well, let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.
3523519	3534050	There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness of the romance in Dragon Age 2.
3535731	3541277	And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer and that
3542705	3548547	He didn't like that, you know, basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.
3548607	3550788	He's like, we are your demographic.
3550828	3552009	You need to cater to us.
3552669	3555830	You know, basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.
3556111	3557131	We play The Sims.
3557831	3558231	Yeah.
3558472	3563614	And it's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us male gamers were happy.
3565019	3569581	Now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you don't speak for me, I love Dragon Age 2.
3570181	3575083	But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.
3575143	3578645	He also uses commas very poorly.
3580085	3586448	So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of BioWare.
3587150	3594493	Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer, we know you don't.
3595934	3601256	I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight male gamers out there.
3602999	3626141	and basically saying you know I'll read a few lines here and there it says the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer they're for everyone we have a lot of fans many of whom are neither straight nor male and they deserve no less attention we have good numbers after all on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of content in DAO and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea that the numbers are not insignificant
3627081	3648182	and basically going on you know it's basically saying yeah we don't care you're you need to get your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world and there's one paragraph if you don't mind me reading it go ahead that is like the most awesome thing and I think it applies to the world in general and I think everyone needs to take this to heart and
3648742	3673335	and if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility it has to do with privilege you can write it off as political correctness if you wish but the truth is that privilege always lies with the majority they're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance they don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them what's everyone's fuss all about that's the way it should be anybody else should get used to not getting what they want
3675427	3676648	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3691663	3696346	It's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.
3696926	3700368	And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.
3700488	3703429	I mean, this is an insanely popular series with women.
3703469	3704290	Tiara is a big fan.
3704390	3704830	Oh yeah.
3704990	3708872	I mean, I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.
3708972	3713835	And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.
3714255	3715896	I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.
3716556	3717477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3730825	3735087	It was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.
3735567	3737988	I also don't understand where this dude is coming from.
3738008	3740929	Have you ever watched an episode of Will & Grace?
3741430	3745031	Did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out?
3745371	3746132	You know what I mean?
3747112	3752354	Even if there really wasn't an option, a good game is still a good game.
3752394	3753675	A good story is a good story.
3753795	3755736	It's kind of like, what's your big...
3756136	3777533	And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I'd say homocentric, is there's got to be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well, this makes me uncomfortable.
3777674	3780636	And it's got to be personal insecurity, I think.
3781797	3781877	Yeah.
3782412	3796289	My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play him with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the male NPCs that you could do a same-sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit.
3796749	3800153	The way that the game is set up is to where...
3800974	3805978	You can tell, okay, well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.
3806718	3816185	I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility, even if it's not something that they would RP into the game themselves.
3816366	3823591	Like, they basically, if there is a same-sex option, they want it buried so deep that you have to go to GameFAQs and look up how to do it.
3823711	3829075	They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game, because they don't like it.
3829335	3832758	and you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.
3833819	3834379	It doesn't matter.
3835360	3841765	They're gonna have to get used to, you know, things are gonna happen in life that you're not comfortable with.
3842677	3843137	DarkSakura.com
3861947	3865269	and I have to play through all these games that have straight storylines.
3865830	3870653	Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these games?
3871013	3872514	No, because they're stories.
3873055	3881881	And like, for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.
3882121	3889706	Like, I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time.
3890066	3893290	was so emotionally moving.
3894031	3897214	Was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?
3897915	3898156	No.
3898376	3901700	A good story is a good story.
3902180	3902641	You know what I mean?
3903190	3907991	I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.
3908691	3909472	You think about this.
3910052	3913533	When you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.
3914053	3920834	And if it's in your character's nature to flirt with a girl, then you stay within your character's nature.
3920994	3924895	If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.
3925035	3926836	If they are completely...
3928716	3934257	Say you're playing the most uptight paladin, they're supposed to get uncomfortable whenever anyone flirts with them.
3934537	3935198	That's the type of thing.
3935638	3939478	You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing if it's immersive enough of a game.
3940399	3944500	And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.
3944640	3945080	I don't know.
3946560	3951801	But the whole point of view, the whole thing is that you are in-game as your character.
3952161	3954682	Unless it's saying you are you in the game,
3955905	3959209	But no, you're playing this person that's living in this life at this time.
3959990	3965055	I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable show a little bit of interest?
3967350	3968231	It's just ridiculous.
3969091	3970052	Bro Dude needs to get over it.
3970272	3972594	And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.
3972754	3978758	B, if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're forced to watch anal sex, okay?
3978918	3980039	I mean, let's be real.
3980119	3980859	It's a fade.
3981160	3984162	It's artful and, you know, whatever.
3984242	3992988	It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters you're not comfortable with, but there's no game that's tacky like that.
3993448	3993749	at all.
3994409	3995411	Is that maybe the guy game?
3996852	3997894	How many years ago was that?
3998434	4000376	I was a little upset, though, that she didn't look pregnant.
4026997	4027337	That's true.
4027897	4030918	D'Artagnan in our chatroom says, my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.
4032159	4032619	There you go.
4033759	4038181	In Final Fantasy X2, they made Lulu a stay-at-home mom.
4039542	4040542	Totally destroyed her form.
4040682	4042183	Oh, X2, that's right.
4043303	4045904	All right, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates.
4045924	4051546	Some games coming out soon to Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.
4052130	4055351	Yes, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.
4057572	4061913	I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming out today, because, well, that's today and not next week.
4063074	4071877	Some other cool stuff, though, that will be coming our way, WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the PSP.
4072717	4078699	If you're looking for an arcade-style WWE game, kind of reminds me of stuff that they had way back on, like,
4079399	4098619	Super Nintendo NES Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360 Of course, to tie in with the new movie, Hop on Nintendo DS Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii
4106599	4113463	Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition that's coming out on PSP as well.
4115804	4120147	Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
4121187	4125069	NASCAR 11 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4126770	4128211	Country Dance.
4128871	4132913	Taking the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it.
4132934	4134714	Of course, it's not actually by Ubisoft.
4134775	4137736	It's kind of a knockoff, but same type of thing.
4138797	4139697	And that will be on the Wii.
4140338	4143679	Pinkalicious, based off of some children's book.
4143699	4144740	That's on Nintendo DS.
4145200	4146181	Zuzu Puppies.
4146261	4147782	Yes, it's not hamsters anymore.
4147862	4149583	It's just animals.
4149703	4151744	So now that's coming out on Nintendo DS.
4152744	4152904	And...
4155862	4170565	and that would be it again the chat's delayed a little bit but I have to read this comment from chat because I love it so much before I get to the Japanese release dates Bochikawa in our chatroom says if it's a choice it's a choice in a game you've got another choice don't play the game
4171845	4172706	Well said, my friend.
4173106	4176228	Alright, on to Japanese release dates and what's coming out in Japan very soon.
4176629	4181892	On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 as well as a game called Nailed.
4182353	4184494	No, that is not a sexual connotation.
4184554	4186616	It actually looks like an ATV racing game.
4186676	4189238	I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah.
4189678	4190759	They nailed it.
4191539	4192180	Top Spin 4.
4192260	4192520	The, uh...
4194241	4195183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4203362	4206605	That controversial at all.
4208426	4214311	Also, moving on to releases on the PlayStation 3.
4215211	4218634	Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Topspin 4 there as well.
4219555	4221416	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii.
4222097	4224959	Nothing, because things have dried up there a little bit.
4225779	4241728	On the 3DS, March 31st, you have to look forward to BlazBlue Continuum Shift 2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imekai Sakyou Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4-themed stuff.
4242168	4243849	You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?
4243909	4244429	You got it.
4244889	4245310	So forth.
4245750	4251152	Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here because sadly there's like nothing really coming out on the 360 or the PS3.
4251613	4256195	But granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now, I'm sure some things kind of got moved around.
4256275	4256815	So, you know.
4257996	4263058	Lastly, on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift 2 is out there as well.
4263299	4266000	And, and, and, Oni Chambara Special.
4266320	4266860	Yeah.
4267180	4268001	March 31st.
4269141	4270062	Let's move on to Europe.
4271601	4272461	Well, not a whole bunch.
4272501	4273242	It's a short list.
4274122	4279004	On the 30th, we have Islands of Wakfu and Strania the Stella Machine.
4279644	4281064	I guess Machina.
4284685	4285926	That makes me think of your cat.
4287096	4288136	The Stellamachina.
4288476	4289097	The Stellamachina.
4289117	4290757	She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.
4291037	4291197	No.
4291477	4293358	She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.
4294478	4295158	So I've seen.
4296019	4300260	And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow, Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse.
4301260	4303441	Which, as Loki would have us believe, is awesome.
4304241	4305081	It is very awesome.
4307582	4309422	Is it like, awesome?
4309582	4310043	Yes, it is.
4310323	4310843	It's awesome, apparently.
4310863	4311603	It is that awesome.
4313815	4315276	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
4315417	4317859	We're just a little ways away from the classic game of the week.
4318099	4319200	Real good one this week, too.
4319340	4320681	One that I think a lot of you have played.
4320882	4322903	But we'll get there after a couple more news stories.
4323924	4324285	Ah, yes.
4325826	4328328	So, this is always fun.
4330803	4343448	Sony, and I don't even really know if this is a big deal, but I guess they're transferring the online service operations to a new division of their company, I guess.
4343828	4346389	The Sony Network Entertainment Inc.
4346610	4349851	instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and that kind of stuff.
4351672	4352052	I don't know.
4352212	4356654	Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.
4356794	4359735	It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like
4361525	4365546	I don't know, the people that run Ragnarok online or something like that.
4365606	4366826	Although that would be quite funny.
4367626	4371047	I love Ragnarok.
4371067	4372647	A lot of people are covering this.
4372667	4380469	The change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into a new terms of service.
4381909	4382889	Blah, blah, blah.
4384069	4384690	So what?
4384810	4387010	So they're changing the name of
4388795	4389516	That division.
4390537	4392258	It's more of like a consolidation thing.
4392298	4393459	It really doesn't seem like a big deal.
4393519	4398403	I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot of our listeners do.
4398463	4403228	I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always gives us the PSN updates and all that.
4404068	4406711	It's consolidating with the one on the PlayStation 3.
4406911	4408292	And that sounds like a good thing.
4408993	4411555	It's probably all moving towards something more unified for PC.
4412575	4434940	The NGP or whatever they ultimately call that thing And honestly if Microsoft does it with the Zune points I guess the Zune isn't around anymore But you know what I mean The points for Microsoft on the 360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune Or on your PC through Windows Media It's just competitive or whatever It's no big deal really
4435740	4436060	I don't know.
4437021	4442324	But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.
4442864	4445485	I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.
4445545	4446226	No, it's not.
4446306	4447847	It's just whatever.
4448047	4449388	They're changing something.
4449768	4451769	They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.
4451809	4457292	They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account or
4459465	4462827	Hey, be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.
4482178	4499385	a Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega if you want to see more information on that go to their blogs blogs.sega.com a Yakuza track jacket there's a lot of a Dreamcast bag there's like I'm sure tons of stuff in here where DarkSakura would be like what?
4500965	4502286	or she's like I have four of those already
4503646	4506827	Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3.
4506847	4507708	I know she doesn't have that.
4508848	4510449	Or Virtua Tennis sweatbands.
4510489	4511649	I don't think I've seen those before.
4512209	4515190	But how about an OutRun art signed by Yu Suzuki?
4515250	4516631	I bet Dan would be all over that.
4517431	4519472	I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.
4519872	4520252	All right.
4521592	4523113	But still, it's for Japan relief.
4523373	4523633	I know.
4523653	4524873	So, you know, it is a good cause.
4524934	4525514	It's a good cause.
4525594	4526194	It's a great cause.
4527175	4531158	Also, going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.
4531638	4536121	It's something that's on Facebook right now and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.
4536501	4536922	What is it?
4537182	4541325	It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.
4541725	4546329	It's going to be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed to be on TV.
4546889	4547389	DarkSakura.com
4569199	4570340	and that's a whole special thing.
4586656	4587777	All for a great cause.
4587977	4594101	So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty good.
4594621	4600485	Even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually sounds like an interesting special.
4600985	4605488	And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.
4605608	4606589	So very cool.
4606849	4607149	I kind of...
4607709	4635031	it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming industry to like a telethon type thing like you remember when another big tragedy happened Katrina and George Clooney put together all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief this kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a you know different type of tragedy so kind of neat definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds I think it's a good idea
4635251	4636952	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4664634	4672576	Classic game of the week is Darkstalkers which in Japan was known as Vampire and in Europe as Vampire Hunter
4673630	4676652	Ooh, there was a trilogy of these.
4677772	4682634	Fantastic, super fun, and one of my favorite games ever.
4683995	4689618	I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before, where we had the World Cup Soccer and Killer Instinct.
4690058	4691719	Well, this was another game that we had.
4692479	4699142	And there was this one guy who was super epically awesome at this game, and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did, and I felt so accomplished.
4699542	4701343	Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors, Vampire Savior
4711992	4715654	And then there was a Vampire Hunter 2 and a Vampire Savior 2.
4715714	4717315	They were sort of upgraded versions.
4717895	4719916	And then the re-releases which came out later.
4720116	4729341	So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this particular universe and hunters.
4729401	4736745	But you've got your vampires, you have your ghosts, your demon possessions, your zombies.
4737405	4757939	The characters in the game, there was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbane, who was the werewolf, Victor von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was the succubus, Anakaris, who was a mummy, Felicia, the catwoman, Bishamon, who was this possessed samurai armor.
4759961	4764444	You had Rikuo, who was the fishman, and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch!
4765665	4766125	What a shock!
4767441	4778948	And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot, like an ancient Aztec robot, and Pyron, who was this flame guy.
4780015	4781376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4809354	4810896	Vampire Hunter, Night Warriors
4830573	4832074	Super, super awesome game.
4832675	4836278	It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the U.S.
4836698	4840261	And of course the Japanese version was the same because, I mean, the Saturn had more memory for it.
4840281	4840821	It was really cool.
4841582	4848868	So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jedha, who was totally my character for a while.
4849829	4854472	And Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.
4855954	4857635	And QB, who was always fun.
4857875	4858856	And Baby Bonnie Hood.
4859229	4861490	Which, she actually had a better name in Japan, it was Boletta.
4863730	4865291	She was super fun to use.
4865591	4869812	And I love her ending, because it's like, this monster family watching TV.
4870113	4871313	There's been this massacre!
4871773	4873494	Never will watch out for a human person!
4873514	4875754	They're like, oh, these humans are so scary!
4875874	4876875	Keep us safe, daddy!
4877115	4878095	I'll protect you, son!
4878495	4883517	And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and everything.
4884057	4884278	Anyway.
4885219	4887001	Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.
4887842	4893869	And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4Meg RAM cartridge.
4894370	4894970	Got this one too.
4895911	4899275	And so it was fully arcade perfect.
4899416	4900437	It was fantastic.
4902079	4902780	And you could...
4904838	4908921	Play as, uh, there was all kinds of different, you know, bonus characters in it.
4908981	4914465	You had, uh, Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.
4915385	4923531	Um, Shadow basically was, you could assume the identity of the defeated character in there.
4924071	4928234	And then, um, so like, if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan.
4928354	4928895	That type of thing.
4929675	4933337	Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2
4948605	4975795	I think that they redid some of the sprites for it too if I'm correct and you also had Bishamon and Shadows of Secret Characters and you had Marionette that were basically mirror matches and then there were the re-releases there was Vampire Chronicle which was the one that came out on Dreamcast it was a Dreamcast direct mail order and I believe I have that one too pretty sure I do
4976375	4978016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4998306	5001909	There were manga, different comics that came out.
5002849	5011095	And then there was DarkSakura's graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards and concept art.
5011115	5012115	But that was put out by Udon.
5012175	5016518	And Udon is fantastic in their Capcom-related art.
5016839	5019000	I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.
5019080	5021001	They are amazing artists.
5021041	5024704	Just their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.
5025424	5025785	And then...
5028141	5042717	In Love Hina, actually, the main female characters were wearing the costumes of Beletta, Sienko, and Felicia for Halloween in Chapter 86 of the manga.
5043317	5047041	And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia, and Sienko.
5048242	5053927	This is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.
5055248	5064915	UGO ranked it as number 19, and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Darkstalkers coming out.
5064955	5065795	That would be awesome.
5066896	5073101	I don't know how founded that is, but... Well, here's a comment from SSJ100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.
5073562	5076324	I remember the MVC3 panel at New York Comic Con.
5076364	5080127	Someone asked the devs if they would consider making a Darkstalker sequel or remake.
5080527	5085571	Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting it.
5086051	5086512	Get on it!
5088092	5092875	Well, you know what, imagine, okay, look how well Street Fighter 4 did.
5093335	5095136	Look how well Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.
5095837	5099879	It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Darkstalkers game.
5100319	5105422	You know, bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then, you know, throw in some new ones.
5105442	5108404	You've got all kinds of, you know, supernatural mythos out there.
5108444	5114568	There's that Street Fighter cross-teching game, though, still on the way that I think has gone to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.
5114588	5116769	Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.
5117330	5117710	True, true.
5118420	5119701	That's the classic game.
5120781	5123683	Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic.
5123703	5124183	Oh, I forgot another.
5124203	5125324	Darkstalkers, what's that?
5125464	5126504	Another hidden character.
5127065	5131907	D. Which was the fully, you know, Donovan was half Darkstalker.
5132628	5136990	Well, there was the version of him that was all evil and vampire-y.
5137770	5143333	And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following around with him, only she's older.
5143753	5144954	But it fades out and that's his ending.
5145589	5155699	Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, Darkstalkers from the arcade by Capcom, and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Darkstalkers is definitely not forgotten.
5155719	5163446	Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com slash olr
5163866	5167511	Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news.
5167571	5175742	Then we'll get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of the Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.
5176043	5179848	We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5186906	5187667	3DS Launch, BioWare, Forza, etc.
5204326	5205247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5227900	5248776	and uh it's basically comics I do this with Tiara who's you've heard on the show she's hosted before Mar and Marvel and also with um Dan Shadow and we basically discuss comics but we had a special guest to um for our recording today which you can hear on Tuesday downloaded from uh infamous.net n-f-a-m-o-u-s.net
5250532	5251213	Todd Stashwick
5280052	5280753	He played Dracula.
5281473	5282113	That was cool.
5283194	5284155	Like a black and white Dracula.
5284175	5284575	It was really cool.
5284615	5285996	He could have been a character in Darkstalkers.
5288157	5291319	But he's such a great guy.
5291800	5294882	Really fun to talk to and geeked it up with us this morning.
5294942	5295542	So it was really cool.
5296103	5296463	Awesome.
5297243	5298644	But read Devil Inside.
5299004	5300345	Seriously, it's good.
5300766	5302046	Like anyone could get into this.
5302106	5302687	It's so good.
5304068	5309151	Well, the side project I have, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week, but we did have a pretty exciting guest.
5309191	5313534	If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, or the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
5313634	5315495	Now with a website, HordeHouse.com.
5315575	5317116	Finally, we have an official website for the show.
5317456	5319658	So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and X for talking about it.
5320058	5328509	And this week we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle Madison from Video Game Outsiders and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network, joined us.
5328549	5331472	And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.
5331512	5338501	Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Xtfer and I. And I was really worried that Xtfer was going to make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time.
5338521	5339482	She really played along with it.
5339902	5363026	and Michelle had a book come out and congrats to her she is you may not know this but she does the whole her and her sister are behind the damn you autocorrect that is them and they've had a lot of success of that and just had a book come out so please support Michelle and buy that book I think that's great and other great podcasts on the all games network again hoardhouse.com even if you don't like wow apparently I had my buddy Brad from pod culture said I
5363226	5364546	GameStop was handing out free trial discs.
5390003	5390463	For a while.
5391344	5391864	It's kind of neat.
5392344	5394785	Anyways, so actual rapid fire news though.
5396086	5396966	Some pretty cool stuff.
5397686	5402188	Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstorm Apocalypse.
5402228	5404529	Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end.
5404969	5409331	And that would be in the UK, where it's gotten a release date, March 31st.
5409431	5412172	So you won't have to wait very long actually to play the game.
5413113	5413193	Um...
5414907	5428905	and you know if you really die in the play of the game and you're not in the UK it is region free so import away but let me really just give it a couple more weeks but it is really awesome so you should really pick it up um
5430905	5431665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5450956	5469170	and it'll begin the game's, they're calling it the British Invasion and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship and he invites the players back to his homeland where you can create farms there.
5469450	5470190	Wait, wait, do you hear that?
5470470	5471151	Wait, do you hear it?
5471811	5473973	Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.
5477026	5479408	Farmville News, Loki, what did you expect me to say?
5480689	5481529	My mother cares.
5483090	5484711	Don't tell her.
5484891	5491296	After a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.
5491716	5494858	Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed.
5496019	5499541	It is still in beta.
5500242	5505685	You might as well have left it offline because it would have been doing people more of a favor than actually letting them play the game.
5506986	5508767	You're terrible, but accurate.
5511128	5518171	Apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were taking them offline to conserve power in Japan.
5519031	5536558	They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.
5539528	5544674	Square Enix is cooking in the dark for benefit of you all to bring the servers back online.
5544694	5546736	Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.
5546876	5548598	No, I know.
5548918	5551661	But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.
5551721	5553063	It might be a little warm.
5553483	5554064	Crack a window.
5556106	5558067	Alright, moving on to other MMOs.
5558087	5560068	This is a free one online that's pretty popular.
5560168	5565211	Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later this year.
5565551	5570915	If you've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO.
5570995	5575798	And it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, it looks like an old school SNES type of little game.
5576158	5576618	XBOX LIVE ARCADE 1
5598670	5625692	it won't be free to play it's actually going to cost money and this is the other weird thing it might not really be an MMO either because they came out and said and this is from a Microsoft representative it's not a freemium MMORPG it's with online multiplayer features so I don't know set the expectation bar a little low but I don't know it could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade we'll see
5626753	5627253	Back to the Future Games
5656466	5657807	And one more story for you guys.
5658107	5660188	The NPD put out a press release this week.
5660228	5664030	Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?
5664190	5664931	Imagine Babies.
5665171	5670614	No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or maybe it was Call of Duty.
5670654	5671774	Those games sell like crazy.
5672375	5672835	Actually...
5673335	5674937	And they're canceling the series?
5694456	5696756	3 was the peak.
5696836	5700218	It went really downhill fast from there.
5700238	5704719	3 came out concurrently with Rock Band, which, by the way, was number 5 on the list.
5705099	5709161	Wasn't 3 the guitar hero that had a million different skews?
5710361	5713805	The different combinations of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.
5714085	5718028	Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.
5718149	5719390	That's when it got really bad.
5719410	5720371	The band hero.
5720551	5723153	The three was just guitar, not guitar.
5723313	5727477	It wasn't necessarily... It was just like any of the other Guitar Hero games.
5727557	5730079	Well, prior to that, any of the other Guitar Hero games.
5731161	5737857	It's when they got to, well actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because it was just like rock band.
5737917	5740402	It was game, guitar game, band.
5742389	5745110	Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of, too.
5745170	5747211	I noticed that when I was playing the machine.
5747291	5749832	I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week.
5750553	5751373	Probably not worth it.
5751673	5756896	No, it really wasn't, because I failed the song, which pissed me off, because the guitar was broken, and one of the buttons didn't work right.
5759036	5759937	What a surprise!
5760177	5762638	Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Line if it's not broken.
5763158	5763458	All right.
5763879	5766220	Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.
5766260	5766760	Dark Sakura.
5767998	5772381	Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.
5773301	5776784	Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.
5777644	5781467	That will have a 900 point price tag.
5782247	5784248	It's one of my favorite RPGs.
5784329	5785990	I've actually got an original of this too.
5787270	5795015	Nothing about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.
5795376	5797317	Hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.
5797990	5798631	Precisely.
5799331	5802253	And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.
5803154	5807196	There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.
5807677	5813381	It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.
5813401	5816043	Don't you want somebody to love?
5816083	5816263	Yeah.
5817163	5823228	And Santana's Black Magic Woman, which imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.
5823588	5824489	Imagine that in pro.
5825409	5826050	Wouldn't that be crazy?
5827074	5833618	and then Dragon Force, Through the Fire and the Flames and Operation Ground and Pound.
5834079	5836660	So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.
5836680	5841724	Kind of ironic we just had a story about Guitar Hero because that was one of the most memorable songs from that series.
5841764	5842644	But Rock Band is awesome.
5842844	5844065	And from 3, I think.
5845106	5845466	Wasn't it?
5846167	5846487	I think so.
5847483	5862193	At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii Points for the standard Rock Packs, 160 points, and the Days of Peace Pack will actually be 550 Wii Points or 440 Microsoft Points.
5863133	5868837	And then Through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have Pro Guitar and Pro Bass Mode.
5869558	5872860	And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii Points or 80 Microsoft Points.
5873880	5900077	and last but never least we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition and he's on fire he's burning up and he's got some bad red eye problems so he's gonna need some Visine he's burning for you and the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website so
5901398	5910062	Definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're officially there.
5910362	5912183	And the profile is there.
5912203	5913324	And I will post that into the chat room.
5913344	5914884	So what exactly does Evil Ryu do?
5915545	5917386	Well, technically he... Evil things.
5918126	5919447	Technically... He kicks puppies.
5920487	5922528	He's Satsui no Hado Ryu.
5923589	5927471	Because I guess Akuma is always given to your fighting spirit.
5927651	5928132	Okay.
5928172	5928992	Join the dark side.
5929512	5934315	If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Gouki.
5935076	5942900	I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back and it's all torn and he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.
5943020	5944021	Whose oni is that?
5944241	5945702	Evil, evil Gouki?
5945722	5946502	I think that would be...
5947683	5949163	It's evil-er!
5950464	5953085	Give it to your evil evil.
5953545	5954885	There's voice samples on there too.
5957106	5958326	Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.
5959546	5960967	I'm going to post this in the chat room.
5961867	5963147	Fun little soundboard to play with there.
5963587	5964488	Let's go to the Twitter!
5965108	5968949	Twitter.com slash OLR and every week we like to read your tweets.
5969944	5972426	Twitter.com slash OLR.
5972486	5973227	Let's look at some tweets.
5973527	5984035	Some interesting tweets from 13xForever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.
5984436	5990961	Now, before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment.
5990981	5993783	It was a point-and-click adventure computer game.
5993803	5995624	It was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.
5996825	5998826	It was supposed to be, I think, after Warcraft 2.
5998907	6000868	It was going to be fourth quarter 97.
6001408	6005831	So that would have been a little bit before StarCraft, kind of in that era.
6005871	6006951	So this was like an old game.
6007432	6010513	But randomly, these YouTubes went up that we got linked to.
6010613	6012615	So I'll just kind of take a quick peek at how this played out.
6012975	6016497	So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and those types of games.
6017057	6018418	Oh, the art in this looks pretty cool.
6018658	6025142	Looks more Scum Engine, but yeah, it's within the Scum Engine, LucasArts, King's Quest vein, that style of gameplay.
6025562	6029284	Actually, the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me.
6029324	6034807	Kind of that really, like, very jerky motion cell animation stuff.
6035628	6040470	It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking cancelled, you know what I mean?
6040810	6042391	Oh, there's a trailer here for this game, actually.
6042411	6043232	Let me click on this.
6044933	6046914	And take a look at this real quick.
6047954	6049915	This is an old school trailer from, like, 97.
6049955	6052717	Let me just take a peek at this.
6052777	6054578	What could have been, but is not.
6056329	6057490	Let's see, pass the logo.
6057610	6058030	Come on, people.
6058070	6069599	Three great wars between the Human Alliance and the Orcish invaders have laid waste to the once proud realms of Azeroth.
6069619	6073582	22 years have passed since Blackmoor found the young Orcling.
6074358	6084422	Secretly raising the Orkling within the confines of his prison fortress, Durnold, Blackmoor planned to mold the Orkling into the perfect warrior.
6085002	6086963	A warrior conditioned to human thinking.
6087023	6091925	See, this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from what it's supposed to be.
6092325	6104329	I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off into the novels so if you're a lore nerd like I am read the books and you'll get all the story from that game
6121971	6147552	DarkTetsuya sends us a link greetings true believers I got your first WonderCon scoop right here about a new Spider-Man game in the works DarkTetsuya very excited because he's going to WonderCon and promises to bring back lots of stories for OLR but I guess there is a new Spider-Man game that's supposed to be shown at WonderCon yeah that's as they're saying Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision Spider-Man panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spider-Man game is check that out
6148493	6151136	Henderson Mann tweets us at Twitter.com slash OLR.
6151676	6154319	How do you think the iPhone has hurt sales of 3DS?
6154579	6158603	I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.
6158904	6161566	The guy told me I was the only one who even asked.
6161747	6162988	Should Nintendo be worried?
6164129	6168333	I would say no, mostly because it's still early.
6168473	6171256	And there hasn't been a lot of, like, there haven't been commercials.
6172037	6175021	They went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.
6175201	6177725	There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing, though.
6178446	6188178	I mean, unless you're really gung-ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind of like, ooh, I gotta have that.
6189660	6192443	There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good.
6192563	6199269	And there's a lot of blogs covering all that stuff and saying, hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs, but don't.
6199689	6203933	It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top.
6205054	6210058	And yes, as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.
6212649	6216772	And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on Twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305.
6216792	6219994	This is a tweet about Mortal Kombat download characters.
6220034	6221575	I guess those were announced just recently.
6221895	6222756	I'm actually very excited.
6222796	6229040	One of my favorite characters from the series who came out later in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content.
6229400	6234884	Kenshi, that was the blindfolded, he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters.
6234984	6236305	And a character called Scarlet.
6236905	6240748	Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist.
6241048	6242169	She's kind of in that Ermac.
6242849	6243911	Noob Saboit and Rain
6266195	6267596	I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs. Sanrio.
6291467	6292868	That's the license that I'll play.
6293028	6293768	Kidiality.
6296249	6297049	Bad Bats and Roaches.
6297069	6297909	I would think Cutality.
6298369	6298590	Huh?
6298710	6299310	Cutality.
6299450	6299990	Friendship?
6300430	6300930	Friendship?
6302471	6304271	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
6304311	6305952	Sorry to make you put down the 3DS, Loki, but...
6306897	6307157	All right.
6308077	6310438	So this is kind of neat.
6311358	6318699	Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of both Resident Evil 4 and Code Veronica.
6319200	6327101	And they're coming over here as some download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.
6329222	6334343	No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the souped-up visuals, but...
6335843	6362534	people love their Resident Evil 4 and I know even the Wii version with just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular so I could see this doing pretty well and you know it's kind of the whole HD remake thing has really been popular lately so not surprised to see it happen alright wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?
6363106	6367728	Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being talked about as well.
6367768	6370989	They revealed it in the official Xbox magazine.
6371709	6377411	They haven't really said what's going to take place.
6377571	6380932	They are saying that you can change the history of Resident Evil.
6384434	6387835	I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.
6390467	6392168	So it's interesting.
6393469	6398553	I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.
6400554	6400774	Hmm.
6401115	6401415	I don't know.
6401775	6403917	It sounds interesting.
6405918	6407759	Not really a series I follow too well.
6409521	6409861	I don't know.
6410922	6413764	I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.
6413864	6416085	Yeah, I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.
6417546	6417827	All right.
6419099	6419599	Xbox Live Arcade
6442569	6444512	Oh yeah, well, there was supposed to be one on the 3DS.
6444572	6447395	And Bomberman, which would have been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff.
6447735	6450058	But yeah, apparently it is not going to happen.
6450479	6455444	Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no, no, no, that's not true.
6455505	6457687	But those are the rumors going around right now.
6458508	6461452	Apparently, Konami went out and told Wired that...
6461912	6464414	The announcement didn't come from us, so it's not true.
6464514	6467977	We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.
6468458	6472942	Now, the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all this stuff.
6472982	6476925	I mean, they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little bit of controversy going on.
6477426	6480789	I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved.
6481149	6482030	New development house.
6482530	6483031	Either way...
6483311	6484692	You're not seeing them anytime soon.
6485373	6489897	I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman wouldn't happen.
6490017	6493780	Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's gotta happen at some point.
6493820	6495482	It's probably just not gonna happen as soon as you'd like.
6496042	6496623	We'll see, though.
6497884	6507112	Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over, Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be
6509090	6521238	more than one game announced at E3 so the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5 maybe another Zone of the Enders could be anything wouldn't it be cool if there was another Snatcher?
6522519	6531004	no hey, you never know you never know so anything could happen what would you like to see?
6531488	6533810	Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.
6534350	6535051	What would I like to see?
6535111	6536852	I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.
6536892	6539374	From Kojima, anyways, probably that.
6540796	6541876	Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.
6544218	6545960	I would be down with maybe like a metal... I don't know.
6546000	6551864	I want to see something new come out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid or Acid.
6551885	6553626	It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.
6553666	6556288	I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.
6557589	6559230	I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.
6584100	6584421	Alright.
6585061	6585782	Could you imagine that?
6587904	6593050	I thought he was supposedly ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening there with that.
6593270	6593851	I don't remember.
6594932	6595192	Alright.
6595553	6596534	Let's move on with some more news.
6596594	6596834	Loki.
6599831	6600191	Ah, yes.
6601672	6603333	This is kind of neat.
6604914	6606956	I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff, really.
6608677	6614981	It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or...
6617133	6619756	Really offensive stuff.
6620156	6626061	ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half-Life 2 and whatnot.
6626521	6630085	They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.
6630465	6633487	It's basically, yeah, School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.
6634608	6637311	Now who would find that offensive?
6637451	6637651	I know.
6637671	6638411	I don't understand.
6638451	6639692	That doesn't make any sense to me.
6640332	6651615	But apparently, I guess, the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.
6653116	6653256	Yeah.
6654463	6657906	I can't imagine why they would remove something just so harmless.
6658106	6658926	I know, right?
6659226	6659467	Really?
6659507	6660967	Why would someone even make that?
6661008	6664350	Just knowing what... I mean, well, I know why someone would make that.
6664410	6668572	Someone made that to basically troll because they could, right?
6668792	6670153	I mean, that's why you make this.
6670654	6672455	To say like, look what I made.
6672495	6676077	It's really controversial and I shouldn't be making a game like this, but I did.
6676400	6694714	Yes, apparently, I guess, they're saying, you know, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer run site, the confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.
6695515	6700759	And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well.
6701379	6701799	And it says...
6703658	6715286	I guess they have the boring effect that someone took from that Bulletstorm Duty Calls viral game thing that they put in there.
6716066	6718228	I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.
6719589	6723832	Really, that's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.
6723912	6724732	Only a matter of time.
6724752	6728835	Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they were playing school shooter.
6729475	6730136	Oh my god.
6730596	6736523	How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game School Shooter by Valve?
6737344	6743251	Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban, but they also get Half-Life 2 ban, and that's when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off.
6744092	6745454	And the game turns you gay.
6745714	6746975	It turns you gay.
6747176	6748878	So very gay.
6752025	6768966	ah all right enough about that silly mods although I have to admit I probably would play it once just just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment all right it's probably dumb I mean well probably a terrible terrible game
6769326	6770187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6788121	6807706	and you now have three people battling for it there's Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie The King of Kong and then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who as we reported last week is going to have his own movie now coming out all this stuff well the three of them were in the same building at this Kong-Off so that's pretty cool so who ended up winning?
6808226	6815388	Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong-Off and second place Steve Wiebe seventh place Billy Mitchell
6817155	6821296	Oh, I would have loved to see the look on his face.
6821416	6824957	But you are talking about 10 like godly Donkey Kong players.
6825037	6829618	And it's so funny how this game is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.
6829898	6834539	I wonder if the guy I think he like beat the top score of Missile Command and he plays with his feet.
6836279	6836840	Seriously.
6837320	6838720	Is that Captain Awesome?
6838760	6842721	They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his feet.
6843442	6843942	That's awesome.
6845443	6847044	SX in our chatroom says, Kong off?
6847104	6849666	Sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.
6850486	6852027	No, no, it's nothing like that.
6852327	6859152	But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing their Donkey Kong.
6859172	6860993	I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.
6862334	6863434	Stop it, Loki.
6863914	6864455	Stop it.
6865561	6869005	Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.
6869085	6872389	I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.
6872749	6875812	They've made these, like, special flyers that say the Kong off.
6875872	6879757	I mean, these dudes, like, love Donkey Kong.
6879957	6883120	I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.
6883381	6885583	I have to give kudos for that.
6886083	6886364	I mean...
6887990	6889732	If you're gonna go in, go all in, right?
6890172	6893515	On this classic stuff, so there's big love for Kong.
6894235	6900721	Alright, there's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called Listless!
6904124	6904424	DarkSakura.com
6919861	6922303	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6941235	6951661	So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do with the 3DS launch.
6952062	6952682	So here it is.
6953182	6954183	The list list tonight.
6954783	6959866	Fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant buy.
6960407	6970693	I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because, you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is it's kind of a lackluster launch title.
6971153	6971653	Launch titles.
6972334	6974974	So folks are saying, maybe there's some games you should wait for.
6975195	6983197	Well, tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch titles would have made the system an instant buy.
6983738	6984878	Alright, here we go to list list.
6984958	6989300	And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for the list because...
6990220	6996264	If one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually turn to chat to help us round out the list.
6996664	6997605	So who wants to start tonight?
6997645	6998606	I guess we'll go with DarkSakura.
6999626	7001267	DarkSakura, you want to start us off tonight.
7001327	7003729	What is the number three item on your list?
7003909	7004810	Well, it's not a game.
7004850	7005370	It's an item.
7005810	7006211	That's fine.
7006391	7007431	It's a launch title.
7007732	7008712	It doesn't mean launch game.
7009153	7010273	A lenticular photo printer.
7014496	7016978	And what would the lenticular photo printer do?
7017640	7020101	It would print up your images in 3D.
7020921	7022862	Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.
7023482	7026603	So kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D.
7027003	7027223	Yeah.
7027403	7027683	Okay.
7027943	7028523	I can roll with that.
7028543	7031684	So it would print one layer, print a second layer.
7031784	7035946	It'd be huge probably, but I still think it would be neat to have something like that.
7036086	7039527	I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my wang that I would take.
7043120	7046484	SalaciousPop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.
7046944	7049307	The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.
7049908	7052170	Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.
7053456	7053956	I'd buy that.
7057538	7061039	And how exactly would Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster work?
7062360	7063681	Double physics in 3D.
7064081	7064901	And you shoot aliens.
7066562	7072605	And you get grease from your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.
7073025	7076146	You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.
7076266	7077967	Brings a whole new meaning to Screw Attack.
7079288	7079588	Alright.
7080448	7080689	F-Zero 3DS
7095507	7096668	Loki, what's your number three answer?
7097088	7099129	Well, this is more of a serious route.
7099169	7105133	I swear that this is in development, because I thought I saw some sort of screenshots or something like this.
7105653	7110576	But Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.
7111477	7112678	Excite Truck is awesome.
7112738	7114979	None of this Excite Bots bullshit, though.
7115119	7115920	Excite Truck.
7116400	7117160	and Sight Truck.
7117381	7119161	Hell, you don't even have to do anything different.
7119282	7123123	Put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks, everything.
7123304	7127866	Although, I would like it if you did something, but if you don't have to, then fuck it.
7128206	7136090	Alright, so far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and Excite Truck 3DS.
7136450	7137771	DarkSakura, what's your number two?
7138666	7139406	Planet Harrier.
7141307	7142247	I love this game.
7142587	7144127	I have only gotten to play it a few times.
7144167	7146408	There's been no home version released.
7147048	7150969	Don't you think it would be about time for something like that to come on 3DS?
7152450	7156531	It's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.
7156871	7161672	I can see a lot of those old school Sega shooters and I think of 3D World Runner from the NES.
7162032	7181417	but those the sort of first person not kind of first person but those those perspective games would be perfect for that type of screen okay so I'm with you my vote is Planet Harriers all right Salacious Pop your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today Zelda 8-bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition
7183098	7185180	What exactly is Zelda 8-bit 3DS?
7185701	7188283	I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo Edition?
7188603	7194769	Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames to make the 3D.
7195150	7198873	They make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have to lay down.
7199234	7204299	Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image or something.
7204659	7205520	They have that already.
7205580	7207281	It's called Ridge Racer.
7210644	7215368	Game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.
7215528	7218710	I'm going to say Breasts 3D.
7220592	7223934	All it would be would be pictures of breasts in 3D.
7226059	7253586	and I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that because who doesn't love boobs gay or straight or whatever you are does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it it has the little bead that it can tell so you can shake it it would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again you could motorboat the boobs if you want but it's not just restricted to Samus Aran I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster but I want to see just boobs
7254307	7257583	Little Boobs, Big Boobs, Lopsided Boobs
7258598	7260098	Boobs, fake boobs, real boobs.
7261559	7265080	You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up to a person.
7269841	7271161	That would be a perfect mode.
7271381	7279263	It would actually use the whole camera on the back side for those virtual reality type simulations.
7279864	7283845	If I point the camera at Jamie, just suddenly random boobs will show up.
7285512	7286113	She's frowning.
7286133	7286815	She's making frowny faces.
7286855	7289480	Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing.
7289540	7289941	Thank you.
7291504	7292226	My boobs are epic.
7293635	7295276	All right, Loki, your number two pick.
7295336	7297556	Launch title for the 3DS that would have made you buy one today.
7299337	7300497	Just what you said made me forget.
7301517	7303278	It is... Oh, yes, of course.
7303918	7307719	Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.
7308260	7310220	That would be so amazing.
7311361	7312621	I can take Earth Defense Force with me.
7312661	7314842	Since the PSP version is not yet announced, come over here.
7315982	7317883	DarkSakura, The New Guardian Legend
7345259	7346542	Duh, it's my list.
7347544	7348545	The new Guardia legend.
7349127	7349507	In 3D.
7350229	7350609	In 3D.
7350629	7353114	Because remember you had Guardic and you had Guardia.
7353976	7356942	So I guess the Japanese name of this would be Shingardia.
7358726	7360848	I don't care what the fuck they call it, just put it out already.
7360969	7361709	I know, right?
7362770	7364172	Damn it, Nintendo, or Compile.
7364192	7364532	Put out!
7364552	7367836	I realize Compile needs to reform somehow, but just do it.
7367916	7369117	Reform and put out.
7369257	7369538	Alright.
7369878	7370259	Thank you.
7370639	7371240	Please put out.
7371900	7372461	XOXO.
7372881	7374823	Salacious Pop number one, you need it.
7374984	7376465	You need it now on the 3DS.
7376745	7379689	Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer.
7384540	7388142	And how exactly would Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer work?
7388322	7391803	Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
7393384	7394524	And it has a built-in calendar.
7394884	7395384	Days of the week.
7400066	7400847	Did I break Rob?
7400887	7401447	Is he upset?
7401892	7403333	No, I'm just regretting some things.
7403433	7403713	All right.
7404613	7405094	I'm kidding.
7405434	7406514	All right, let's move on.
7407075	7408756	Number one answer from me.
7409476	7411737	The 3DS game we most need to see.
7412217	7413998	What do they call that, the virtual reality?
7414018	7414999	I'm calling it wrong.
7415039	7416400	What's it really supposed to be called?
7418120	7419121	Like the face blaster?
7419141	7419541	What is that?
7420362	7421142	Augmentative reality.
7421162	7422323	Thank you, augmentative reality.
7422443	7426725	I have the augmentative reality game for you, and I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.
7427425	7428466	Augmentative reality...
7428946	7456258	Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS that's right you can go to Golfland and just you know suddenly the little kids there celebrating their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts you know it's Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS alright Loki number one game you most need to see on the 3DS
7458796	7460706	An actual innovative game from Nintendo.
7465851	7494113	you know something that perhaps is not you know funny I don't think this is actually a launch title but just a description an actual innovative game from Nintendo you know like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that they put out like you know like for example Animal Crossing it's been the same for a while now and you know even some of the other like you know they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games they're just oh now they're in 3D I mean come on
7495795	7501339	This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?
7501359	7501800	Wii Music.
7501860	7502260	No, Wii Fit.
7502320	7502901	I would say Wii Fit.
7502921	7503521	What about WooHoo Island?
7517074	7517815	Dead Island, Dead Island
7540917	7544641	It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that void.
7544801	7546422	Alright, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7546442	7547063	Alright, here we go.
7547363	7549265	Here's the list as it stands right now.
7549705	7557212	Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,
7557592	7574113	Zelda 8-bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition, Breasts 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, Rebecca Black's Preteen Convertible Off-Road Racer, Golfland Birthday Party Sniper 3DS, and Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.
7574614	7578335	Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.
7578355	7583256	We're going to start with DarkSakura, but for now, let me read some of the suggestions you guys had in the chatroom.
7583856	7586757	Actdeft suggested Furry vs. Cosplayers 3DS.
7587317	7590378	SSJ100Matt suggested IHOP Restaurant Fighter 3DS.
7590838	7592138	Tigerclaw said DDR 3DS.
7592178	7592998	Whoa, hold on.
7593018	7593478	Stop, stop.
7593779	7593939	What?
7594079	7595179	IHOP Restaurant Fighter?
7595259	7597099	Now, would that be the actual restaurants fighting?
7597119	7598280	Because that could be very cool.
7598360	7600800	No, actually, in my mind, it's Denny's.
7600940	7603641	Like, go on YouTube and Google, like, Denny's Fight Oakland.
7604201	7604741	That's great.
7606443	7608264	The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes.
7608644	7609064	Amazing.
7610785	7613007	Sjo900Matt says, Killer Instincts 3DS.
7614288	7616949	Raydeer in chat says, Rob's Ass 3DS.
7617049	7618691	Hey!
7618751	7619251	Let's see.
7620272	7622293	AkumaJP says, 3D Cat Ball.
7622553	7625155	You know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer.
7626115	7636718	SG-100 Matt says Match Game 3DS DJ Blaziken says Space Channel 5 3D SG-100 Matt says Betty White Simulator 3DS What, you'd just be badass the whole time?
7636838	7637418	Is that what that is?
7638999	7647301	Actdeft says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR technology I am surprised That sounds like an announcement to E3 right there
7647461	7649502	and DarkTetsuya said Gals Panic 3D.
7649782	7652523	Alright, those were the runners-up, but let's get back to the list.
7652623	7654624	Unfortunately, it's just the way the game works.
7654644	7658646	These are all amazing answers, but unfortunately, the way the game works, things have to go.
7659106	7660386	It's part of the process.
7661207	7663027	So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
7663127	7665268	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
7665408	7667069	First of all, you need an apostrophe and blacks.
7668850	7676292	Um, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrate and Vertigo Edition because I have a Virtual Boy.
7677253	7680074	And the game's pretty much already out as Ridge Racer.
7680914	7681334	Alright.
7681354	7681834	Touche.
7682014	7683815	Sorry, Alan, it has been stricken from the list.
7684115	7686736	Salacious Pop, your chance for revenge, or you could go for something else.
7686776	7688496	Which of these items is not worthy of the list?
7691937	7693218	The Golf Land Birthday Party.
7693698	7695118	Oh, you're killing me!
7695679	7696919	Why are you taking that off the list?
7699241	7706827	Well, there's serious answers and there's my smart-ass answers and I can't take down one of mine, so... Alright, there you go.
7707227	7709889	It is removed from the list, much to the sadness of the chatroom.
7710610	7712131	My turn to strike one from the list.
7712411	7718376	I'm sorry to do this, but Loki, Woohoo Island Zombie Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it.
7719997	7723000	Alright, so Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7723260	7724581	Lenticular Photo Printer.
7724981	7726443	Thanks for watching!
7742503	7743224	So here you go.
7743344	7745205	Here is what you guys in the chat can vote on.
7745225	7746646	I'm going to read this list one more time.
7746986	7751810	You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers.
7751830	7753471	You got to message me those.
7753651	7760576	You need to mark them as number one or number two, or I will assume that the one you named first is your number one and the one you named second is your number two.
7760636	7763598	By the way, you're getting booze in the chat room for taking off the offline party.
7763638	7765199	What's your handle in chat this week?
7765279	7765480	Is it?
7765580	7766140	It's Sky.
7766300	7766941	Okay, got it back.
7767181	7767361	All right.
7767481	7768302	Alright, yes, I got it back.
7768582	7770824	So send a private message to Sky with your number one and number two votes.
7770884	7773026	Here is the list that you can vote on right now.
7773486	7790702	Samus Aran's Motor Boat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier, Breasts 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's Pre-Teen Convertible Off-Road Racer.
7790742	7792023	I can't believe that made it through.
7792663	7792964	Alright.
7793764	7794364	I would play that.
7795664	7796985	I would play as the girl in the braces.
7797445	7801245	Yeah, I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.
7802286	7804366	So yeah, that's going to do it.
7804426	7807867	Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.
7808047	7808587	Place your votes.
7809087	7812608	And we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.
7813228	7817309	For now though, we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.
7817369	7818669	Every week you guys send us emails.
7819429	7827798	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Again, that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com It was looking really thin this morning, so I put a call out on Twitter.
7827818	7828238	Did it work?
7828258	7828939	Did we get some emails?
7828979	7829620	We have two.
7830400	7831201	That's better than zero.
7831381	7831642	Alright.
7832952	7834633	But not better than F-Zero.
7836094	7837836	F-Zero is awesome.
7838876	7840057	This first one comes from Robaba.
7840978	7847123	I'm surprised that Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on American TV.
7847603	7853547	If you've ever seen them, it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager talking about the things they use their PCs for.
7854068	7856229	Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.
7856329	7861833	Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.
7862834	7863334	Yeah, your favorite.
7863354	7863454	Yeah.
7890536	7895100	And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.
7895841	7897903	That sounds like what autocorrect would do.
7898203	7898503	I know.
7899364	7904308	Yesterday was great, especially the second round of Laser Tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.
7904929	7906510	It was the last 10 to 30 seconds.
7906570	7915558	I was on the high rise and these three little kids just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off one by one in 1.5 seconds, enacting a triple kill.
7915899	7916239	Nice.
7917290	7923832	It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp, most of them being from preschool to fourth grade fun times.
7923933	7924633	Punctuate!
7925693	7929675	The sad parts of my experience was when I went down, there was no Beatmania 2DX.
7932159	7933559	I know what 2DX is, person.
7933980	7938781	And Parapara's second mix game would be, and it was nowhere to be found.
7939321	7944243	So that they sold it in their place was a faded screen Daytona USA and a four-player Mario Kart.
7945043	7950405	I shouted in my head, WTF, first Keyboard Mania, then Pop Music, now Parapara, then Guitar Freaks, now Beatmania, fuck you!
7951916	7954158	That's my translation of the all caps.
7955119	7973957	This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play except Drum Mania V3, DDR Max 2, 6th Mix and Dance Dance Revolution 5th Mix and In The Group 2.
7974938	7995546	if only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones like DJ Max Technica and Jubit and dare I say it, Gulp Pump It Up Pro maybe then maybe they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.
7995947	7997147	Peace out DJ Blaziken.
7997567	7997887	P.S.
7998027	8001429	if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced to buy an import.
8001729	8002169	P.S.
8002189	8004510	too just to play all the good music games
8004738	8006439	There isn't an arcade like AI anymore.
8006459	8007039	I hate to say it.
8007799	8008720	It was AI.
8008840	8011260	An AI RIP.
8011541	8011721	Yeah.
8013361	8013661	All right.
8013982	8017503	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8017543	8023105	I put the last call out for listless votes, so hopefully we're going to tally those up.
8023125	8025506	But not before we do some angst.
8026106	8026666	Grr.
8027086	8027347	Arg.
8027587	8028227	Angst time.
8042817	8057888	FU's of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum so I'm gonna say FU to gluten and meat
8060442	8065727	Neither of them agree with me, no matter how tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is.
8066647	8068969	So I'm telling them goodbye for a while.
8069750	8070311	Goodbye.
8072032	8074214	I will sort of miss you, but my stomach won't.
8075600	8075840	Done.
8076400	8076681	Loki!
8096980	8099162	It just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow.
8099382	8100944	Or when they're merging lanes.
8101164	8104227	I love these people that are just like, oh, I'm going to cut in and out lanes.
8104387	8110312	I have my right turn signal on, but I'm just going to assume that one turn signal on means I can go any way I want.
8110573	8112875	So, fuck you, the bad drivers.
8116447	8120168	My FU of the week.
8120308	8122989	Actually, I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately.
8123209	8124269	I can't complain too much.
8125009	8127849	But I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday.
8128149	8130590	Oh my god, that was so terrible.
8130810	8132530	Yeah, that was bad.
8132650	8134411	And my tooth still kind of hurts a little bit.
8134511	8136171	So FU to pain.
8136291	8141592	Even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of.
8141852	8142793	So I'm pretty great.
8143373	8147675	So F you to paint.
8150637	8157721	It's not really that angsty, I guess, but just F you to having only two weeks to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do.
8158661	8159942	But it's still a good thing, so.
8160863	8164084	Nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated.
8164284	8165125	All right.
8166673	8168294	Alright, that does it for the FUs of the week.
8168755	8176480	Let's do a couple more news stories and then we will reveal tonight's list list, definitive list, and we will get to the Skype line in just a little bit.
8176560	8178061	But for now, a couple quick stories.
8178101	8178281	Loki.
8178755	8180497	The Splinter Cell Classic Trilogy
8197219	8197740	Thanks for watching!
8216073	8245142	it's neat I guess I think the I want to say that the games at least the Prince of Persia ones are already on the Playstation Network they're $15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving $5 apparently also the Splinter Cell games are going to be available on the Playstation Network as well I'm assuming for probably around the same price $15 each $40 for the compilation if you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so save $5
8247299	8247639	All right.
8247659	8250380	Well, would you like to be able to play more games on the Mac?
8251361	8253662	Well, maybe you can get a thing called Boxer.
8254482	8257043	This isn't like Boxers versus Briefs or anything.
8257083	8258324	This is actually Boxer.
8258464	8260865	It's a DOS box for the Mac.
8261325	8261705	That's right.
8261745	8262685	I did a little joke there.
8263005	8266487	This will allow you to play old PC games on the Mac.
8266867	8267447	But you know what?
8267527	8269148	All joking aside, this is pretty cool.
8269808	8276392	DOSBox, of course, was an old emulator that will make playing games from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines.
8276912	8280114	Boxer is kind of this redone for Apple computers.
8280815	8281955	The Mac series, of course.
8282415	8286518	And what I like about it is they've kind of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit.
8286638	8289139	Like you can see XCOM in there, although it's just the demo.
8289440	8291981	But Doom 2 is playable in this, which is pretty cool.
8292361	8294522	So if you own a Mac, I would be checking this out.
8294582	8295463	BoxerApp.com
8295623	8300165	DarkSakura.com is where you can go to check out the Boxer emulator for your old school DOS fix.
8300245	8301866	And this doesn't come with any games, right?
8301886	8303707	You have to install your own.
8304047	8306708	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in.
8306748	8309609	Like I see Doom 2, it's probably the freeware one.
8309649	8313811	And then Underworld, the demo, Ultima Underworld, probably just boxed with some of those.
8314452	8334899	you can though for the record play PC games on a Mac you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels I think it's called but I think what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important because some of the old DOS games you try to play them on a PC now it's like crazy you can't do it
8335379	8361351	because you know the first computer I ever had PC was a 16 megahertz computer and it was blazing fast and you know I used to play games like X-Men on it and like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what do computers go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the winner
8363228	8365249	So here it is, tonight's definitive list.
8365349	8366370	No arguing, folks.
8366610	8367410	It's a done deal.
8367550	8369111	This is a very scientific process.
8369492	8373174	The launch title that would have made you get a 3DS.
8374494	8377596	Number three, Breasts 3D.
8378096	8380758	That's right, the game with boobs, boobs, and more boobs.
8381960	8382740	I already have that game.
8382980	8384421	Almost as good as the real thing.
8384441	8385621	I already have that game.
8385961	8387522	Alright.
8387642	8394984	Your number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3DS that would have made you get one today, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.
8395284	8395804	Woohoo!
8396004	8396824	I see a pattern.
8397064	8399865	It could be another Nintendo Tecmo collaboration.
8400005	8401486	There you go.
8401706	8402206	Absolutely.
8402606	8405507	But the number one thing that would have made you buy a 3DS today...
8407194	8431176	F03DS going for a serious answer there it is F03DS is the winner I thought for sure that it would be the off-road racing game Rebecca Black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being it it was just it was fourth place just shy of the list I'm kind of glad though it won't be etched permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old next week
8432648	8432889	All right.
8433329	8437632	We totally missed out on all the Charlie Sheen references we could have used.
8437692	8437832	I know.
8437912	8440094	Winning 3DS, but not.
8440134	8441155	No one cares anymore.
8441195	8441975	I'm kind of over it.
8442055	8443756	I didn't care to begin with.
8444617	8447239	Yay, we're watching a man self-destruct live on TV.
8447319	8447839	It's great.
8448039	8450241	But it's different now because it's a man doing it.
8450501	8451262	It's been a while.
8452923	8456025	Maybe he'll show his kush on TV and people will care.
8456045	8457206	Yeah.
8458351	8460491	As he's getting out of a limo, sure.
8460751	8461131	All right.
8461732	8463732	Skype line is open now.
8463752	8467253	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8467273	8473994	If you want to give us a call and talk about the 3DS or you want to talk about something we talked about in the news or maybe have a game review, I don't know.
8474434	8476794	Skype line's open and call.
8477574	8480135	I'm hoping we'll get at least one caller tonight we've never had before.
8480695	8483355	I want to hear from someone shy who never calls us.
8483875	8486856	Loki, meanwhile, do you have any last minute news for us tonight?
8487945	8489847	Um, there's some stuff we didn't talk about.
8490007	8495933	Like, uh, there was a whole thing that they thought that Geohot had fled to South America.
8496233	8497014	Yes, he went to South America.
8497034	8498295	I'm just sick of that fucking story.
8498315	8498896	Yeah, I know.
8499096	8500257	It's, whatever.
8500678	8503600	You know, uh, yeah, he went to South America, but not for fleeing.
8504161	8507544	Of course, you know, if he doesn't come back, then he is fleeing, so.
8508725	8509246	Take it as you will.
8510968	8511088	Um...
8515327	8516547	Yeah, man, there's not a lot of stuff.
8517007	8518888	All right, let's go to the phones.
8518908	8519888	When we have phones, take a call.
8520608	8521648	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8521668	8522049	Who's this?
8522969	8523829	This is C.D.
8523889	8524269	Fender.
8525049	8525509	Say that again?
8525569	8525889	C.D.
8525949	8526329	Fidner?
8527170	8527550	Fender.
8527770	8528170	Fender.
8528230	8528550	C.D.
8528610	8528990	Fender.
8529170	8531431	I don't think we've had you on the show before.
8531491	8532171	I got my wish.
8532251	8532951	What's on your mind, buddy?
8534131	8535111	It's actually Fender.
8535552	8536232	Oh, Fender.
8536612	8537212	What's up, Fender?
8542096	8543256	Golden rule of radio.
8543296	8548299	Go ahead and turn down the radio in the background because the echo is going to mess with you like you wouldn't believe.
8548839	8549959	Listen to me on your phone.
8550340	8550680	What's up?
8550700	8552741	What did you call us for tonight?
8554642	8558684	Well, I have some games to discuss with you guys.
8558844	8559104	All right.
8559144	8559544	What games?
8561465	8561985	Let's see.
8562466	8564267	The Resident Evil series.
8564967	8566168	Just the whole damn series?
8566408	8566748	All of them?
8569479	8575562	Well, like Resident Evil 5, I've never played it, but it looks pretty cool.
8575962	8576923	I think I might like it.
8578144	8579664	Why do you think you'd like Resident Evil 5?
8580865	8588248	Well, I've seen videos of it, and just the graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks cool.
8588869	8591730	And your partner is a girl, so it can't be that.
8592717	8598942	Now, Resident Evil 5 has been out for some time, so what's stopping you from just getting the damn game already?
8600804	8601945	Well, I don't have the system.
8602785	8604567	Oh, well, that happens.
8604847	8609211	So you are not an owner of any 360 PS3-type consoles?
8610472	8614355	No, I've got a Nintendo GameCube and a Nintendo 64.
8614615	8615116	That's all right.
8615136	8616677	That shit's expensive, the new stuff.
8616697	8618719	So you are kicking it old school.
8619793	8620253	Yes, I am.
8620373	8623075	So what old school games do you enjoy playing?
8624676	8625497	Let's see.
8625757	8630120	I've got the old Rampage games.
8632782	8636744	And I have Perfect Dark, the one for the 64.
8638165	8638626	Classic.
8640027	8642668	I also have Fighting for 64.
8642709	8642829	Goal 9-007.
8650678	8655202	Well, I'm still living at home and I haven't moved out and I don't think I want to spend my money on that.
8655322	8658045	Even though I like playing on Wii's, I don't think I want to own one.
8671024	8674287	Yeah, you know, it's like The Rent or a Wii.
8674307	8675929	It's probably a good idea.
8675949	8676610	I mean, seriously.
8676710	8677110	I know.
8679172	8684177	And with the GameCube, I've got Die Hard Vendetta.
8684398	8685519	I'm not sure if you've heard of that.
8686320	8687181	No, probably not.
8687221	8688942	I wasn't really into the Die Hard movies.
8689062	8690003	Although, well, I don't know.
8690043	8691445	Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker, maybe?
8691545	8691865	I don't know.
8691945	8693247	Do we get that in the game?
8694949	8696710	Do we get a Yippee-Ki-Yay motherfucker in the game?
8697090	8699831	I haven't played it in such a long time, I've forgotten.
8700512	8701172	Okay, that's alright.
8701772	8704494	Probably not, because it's a Nintendo-based product.
8705134	8707995	Well, it's an M-rated game, so you never know.
8708255	8708736	That's true.
8708936	8710136	Okay, here's my thing, though.
8710556	8712097	Resident Evil you brought up, Resident Evil 5.
8712157	8715519	Now, one of the greatest GameCube games they ever made was Resident Evil 4.
8716239	8717940	So, have you checked that out on GameCube?
8719903	8721224	I think I do want to buy that.
8722565	8725586	I think they made that game for the Wii as well, but it's the same.
8726127	8727547	The graphics are still the same.
8727708	8728388	Yeah, pretty much.
8728448	8731950	I mean, the Wii's just two GameCubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway.
8733411	8734491	That's a pretty good description.
8735712	8736552	How's your PC?
8736572	8741615	Because some folks in chat are kind of commenting, wow, this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago.
8741655	8742836	Maybe he should game on the PC.
8743296	8744837	Have you tried gaming on PC?
8744857	8744897	No.
8745816	8746516	I don't have a PC.
8746577	8749799	I'm actually using a Mac laptop right now.
8750479	8753081	Well, we just talked about DOSBox on the Mac.
8753141	8754221	That might be an option for you.
8754281	8754602	I don't know.
8755903	8761306	Yeah, I actually have the original one version of the original Doom for the 64.
8762387	8762647	I see.
8764388	8767230	Well, you might have to check out Steam for the Mac or something.
8767370	8767790	I don't know.
8768371	8769051	It's an option for you.
8769091	8770152	Alright, we've got to take some more calls.
8770212	8772093	Any other last minute thoughts before we let you go?
8774003	8777685	No, just that you guys do a really good job and keep doing what you're doing.
8777885	8778305	We will.
8778505	8779106	Thank you very much.
8779146	8779466	Thank you.
8779726	8780306	Thanks so much.
8780586	8780967	Take care, buddy.
8781007	8781147	Bye.
8781427	8781667	Bye.
8783048	8786569	You know, not everybody can take the plunge.
8786589	8788310	You're talking about $200 for a Nintendo Wii.
8788470	8791432	Because some folks in the chat room are like, is that call from like three years ago?
8791492	8792052	What's going on?
8792072	8796674	But it's like, you know, it's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody gets to just take the plunge.
8796814	8797955	I should have asked how old he was.
8798575	8798975	Hey, what's up, guys?
8798995	8799335	This is Kaijudo.
8799355	8801316	But I just wanted to call real quick about Pokemon, black and white.
8801336	8803597	But before I say that, yeah, I have it.
8803617	8804857	I have both, actually.
8826636	8856316	but before I go on to that I just want to say that previous caller Die Hard Vendetta he called it it does have a lot of cursing in it it was actually a big deal they were trying to go after Nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many F-bombs in that game you wouldn't believe it but anyway so Pokemans show us your Pokemans yeah I definitely recommend it I mean I think if you haven't played Pokemon in a while I think you should definitely pick this one up I mean they always add something new
8857151	8857451	Mudkip 2.0?
8857491	8857731	Mudkip 2.0?
8889163	8890464	I'm just trolling, don't listen to me.
8917225	8919025	about how much they added to the game.
8919085	8920266	It's really a great game.
8920426	8924986	So my ignorant ass earlier in the show should not have said that the Pokemon games haven't really changed in a while.
8925827	8928607	Well, I mean, it's your opinion, but actually they have changed.
8928627	8931248	The one that you mentioned, the Ruby, what was it?
8931408	8932068	Ruby Silver?
8932168	8932448	Yeah.
8932788	8934648	No, Ruby Emerald.
8935088	8945210	Yeah, I mean, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but what I think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases, which they didn't have in the original, which was, I think,
8945680	8946921	What was it, Red and Blue or some shit?
8947001	8952083	Okay, but to be fair, I mean, how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game?
8952163	8953243	I mean, maybe a little bit.
8953263	8961747	Well, it does, because, I mean, certain Pokemon you couldn't catch, you know, you have to catch them at certain days of the week, you have to catch them at certain, you know, either day or night.
8961787	8964728	I mean, you know, I mean, they really do innovative stuff with it.
8964748	8971831	I mean, you know, it may not be something that's going to, like, change how you think about Pokemon, but, I mean, they always consider the fans and they...
8973077	8975518	They kind of cater to what the fans want.
8975538	8979999	Whatever the fans are asking for, you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next Pokemon game.
8980199	8988542	Let me ask one of the fanboy questions of the year, and I don't know how many times we brought this up on the show, but why do you think Nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a Pokemon MMO?
8989402	8991143	I would even fucking play a Pokemon MMO.
8992163	9001266	Well, you mentioned earlier, like I said, I'm not the biggest Pokemon historian, but they do have this website thing that's coming out on March 30th.
9002452	9005753	I guess you could say it's kind of like an MMO.
9005773	9013575	You're going to have some kind of Pokefarm and you can raise your Pokemon slaves there and make them fight.
9013675	9014795	All that type of stuff.
9014815	9017796	They do have some type of MMO thing going on.
9017816	9025038	I don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them in a while, but you'll be able to link up with maybe 10 people in a room.
9026798	9050817	and you can all like chat and you know exchange you can tie razor blades to their feet and all that shit this sounds like you're turning cockfighting into a video game but you've just replaced the cocks with Pikachu that's pretty much what Pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it you're basically catching these things and making them like yeah it's cockfighting pretty much but I mean it's great you know I mean I don't mind it get your Pikachu out of my cockfighting game it's better than getting real cock
9051929	9053310	Sorry, we're having too much fun.
9053330	9056371	Yeah, it's better than getting real roosters and having them beat the crap out of each other.
9056391	9057132	You could do it virtually.
9057472	9057792	All right.
9058132	9061253	And that's pretty much what the main story is about in this game.
9061293	9067977	There's actually a guy who wants to free all the Pokemon because he's like, oh, you know, we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy shit.
9068077	9069197	So he's basically PETA.
9070458	9071698	Yeah, yeah.
9073799	9074059	All right.
9074079	9075640	Wouldn't that be pee-pee?
9075660	9078281	People for the ethical treatment of Pokemon?
9078802	9079222	Pee-pee?
9081436	9087382	Any quick last shoutouts before we let you go?
9089143	9103455	Shoutout to everyone listening Shoutout to Raichu, I love you man I'm not gonna Raichu a love song Oh god Have you seen that t-shirt?
9103936	9107579	No I'm not gonna and then the picture of Raichu and then love song
9115820	9118681	SX in our chatroom says, no one show this game to Michael Vick.
9118801	9119641	Ooh, ouch.
9120841	9121362	I don't know about that.
9121382	9125703	All right, 1877GAMEOLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9128764	9130304	Oh, I can't deal with it tonight.
9130364	9131324	Let's get to some more calls.
9131664	9132665	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9132685	9133045	Who's this?
9135746	9137166	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9138393	9139354	Hi, this is Actdeft.
9139454	9141014	Hey, Actdeft running to the mic.
9141034	9141555	Shit, shit, shit.
9141815	9142895	Hi, what's up, Actdeft?
9144576	9147518	I just want to pull up the last call about Pokemon.
9147698	9148158	Yeah, what's up?
9149559	9156083	Well, I pretty much, well, it has changed a lot since the Game Boy Advance games.
9156763	9157023	Okay.
9157123	9157584	A lot.
9159425	9161025	So what's all changed?
9161946	9165628	What am I missing by not experiencing Pokemon Black and White?
9167253	9170096	Well, you have more stuff to do with Pokemon.
9170676	9176902	You have to watch out for stats like special attack and defense.
9177683	9182127	You also have to raise some certain Pokemon to obtain them.
9184810	9186331	You have to work that Pokemon.
9186351	9187212	You have to train them.
9187913	9190395	Can you whip your Pokemon like the Derby Owners Club?
9193341	9196563	If you're a competitive player, pretty much you have to do that.
9199745	9204449	And also about Nintendo not doing the Pokemon MMO.
9205990	9210893	Pretty much Nintendo, I think, has said that they don't want to do it because it's...
9212134	9217839	It's a very big project, and I think they said that it couldn't work.
9218059	9218780	Well, fuck them!
9219400	9220241	Give me what I want!
9221222	9222002	Is that too much to ask?
9222042	9223363	Yeah, I know.
9223543	9225125	Everyone would play it, I know.
9225185	9230289	I don't play MMOs, I don't like them, but I know I would play a Pokemon MMO.
9231029	9234110	I dare somebody to call in and say they wouldn't play the Pokemon MMO.
9234171	9234931	Anyone in this room?
9234971	9237372	Would anyone in this room not play the Pokemon MMO?
9237872	9238712	Or at least give it a try?
9239052	9239373	I'd try.
9239393	9240893	I would not play the Pokemon MMO.
9240973	9242074	Okay, hater, why?
9242334	9243734	Because I don't like Pokemon.
9243754	9245215	Because you can't shoot Pokemon.
9245515	9246756	No, because I don't like it.
9246796	9251818	I think it's a stupid series that certain people over age... Hold on, hold on.
9251918	9253078	I just, I have to know.
9253538	9256199	Haven't you bought every single Animal Crossing game they've ever made?
9256600	9256820	Yes.
9257320	9257400	Yes.
9258020	9259541	I don't understand you at all.
9259641	9260642	And I don't like them.
9261502	9262583	But you buy them.
9262923	9265645	You hate, you hate, you hate, you hate, and yet you buy.
9265665	9266986	My wife wanted to play them.
9267006	9268006	Yeah, likely story.
9268427	9269307	It is likely.
9269927	9272769	Well, maybe Josh wants to play Pokemon MMO.
9273129	9275731	I bought Nintendogs, and I hate it, and I'm getting rid of it.
9275851	9276531	So you know what?
9277872	9278794	It doesn't matter.
9278874	9281096	I want to play Nintendogs.
9281176	9281677	Buy it.
9281957	9283299	Oh, you want to play the new Nintendogs?
9283739	9285261	Boot up the old Nintendogs.
9286202	9287323	And get drunk.
9287403	9287904	It'll be in 3D.
9287964	9290627	I don't know.
9290707	9293870	I just want someone to convince my husband to get me my 3DS.
9297010	9298211	Look what you started, Actdeft.
9298391	9299131	We're all fighting.
9299292	9300372	It's all in fighting tonight.
9300432	9303194	I know OLR is going to break up tonight, and it's all because of your call.
9303314	9304234	I just want you to know that.
9304354	9304735	I'm kidding.
9304855	9305835	I'm sorry about that.
9306015	9306415	I'm kidding.
9306916	9307736	No, no, no.
9307756	9325486	Basically, Nintendo said the most principal thing, they don't want to do it because it's a big infrastructure, and it's, like I said, a very big project for them to handle, and they don't want to do it.
9325840	9326261	I see.
9326341	9333368	They're the number one selling console in the motherfucking world, yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a Pokemon MMO.
9333769	9339735	Little old Microsoft, I have no idea how they're doing it, and Sony, jeez, boy, they're sure suckers.
9339975	9346242	Well, to their defense, Microsoft doesn't have an MMO.
9349045	9352607	But they have an online infrastructure, which is more than Nintendo has.
9352647	9353228	Debatable.
9353848	9355469	I mean, they did have Final Fantasy XI.
9355489	9356870	You know I'm always going to whip out that card.
9357111	9358191	And Phantasy Star Universe.
9358251	9358912	That's true.
9359072	9360253	Alright, fine.
9360273	9361874	Then they already have more than Nintendo does.
9362815	9365877	Microsoft just is opposed to MMOs for some reason.
9365897	9367358	There's some weird thing going on.
9367418	9371081	I don't know if they were just burned by Final Fantasy XI or what, but I don't know.
9371841	9373924	or maybe it has something to do with their next system.
9374064	9376247	Maybe their next system is all going to be about MMOs.
9376507	9376888	Who knows?
9377369	9378911	I'm making shit up now.
9380473	9380753	All right.
9381173	9387622	Actdeft, before I let you go, since we've completely derailed your phone calls many times, anything else you want to share with our folks tonight?
9388444	9390726	Well, just one last question.
9391707	9396711	Would you pay around $525 for a 3DS?
9397451	9398953	Hell no, I wouldn't.
9398993	9399653	Not right now.
9399713	9400954	Not until more games come out.
9401014	9403056	Let me guess, that's how much you're having to pay in Mexico, huh?
9403496	9403756	Yep.
9405683	9405963	DarkSakura.com
9429606	9431169	Those are pretty much screwed.
9431349	9434555	They're paying 6,000 pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3DS.
9434575	9435356	Unbelievable.
9440598	9444621	Alright, well, Actdeft, we hope it gets to a more reasonable level in Mexico soon.
9444661	9445842	But it is launch day.
9445882	9447584	I mean, give it a few weeks to stabilize.
9447764	9453448	You know, if the sales are not so hot, or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought, maybe the price will drop pretty quickly.
9453728	9454069	We'll see.
9454769	9456591	I doubt it, but, well, let's see.
9456831	9457131	We'll see.
9457531	9458232	Alright, take care, buddy.
9459433	9459753	Take care.
9459953	9460194	You too.
9460916	9461416	Thanks for watching!
9478906	9480687	Let's go to one or two more calls.
9480727	9481548	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9481568	9481908	Who's this?
9482508	9483269	Hey, it's Ranma.
9483289	9484289	How's everyone doing tonight?
9484309	9485010	Hey, good, Ranma.
9485050	9486371	I just want to say real quick to this.
9486731	9488032	Our phones are like packed tonight.
9488092	9488572	It's weird.
9488632	9491254	Like it's just constantly lit up the whole screen.
9491314	9494415	So if you don't get through tonight, don't get sand in your vagina.
9494455	9495176	Just send us an email.
9495196	9498938	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com because millions of people will call, but yet no one will email us.
9499038	9499599	I don't understand.
9499979	9501039	All right, but Ranma, you got through.
9501079	9501720	What's on your mind tonight?
9502532	9503152	A few things.
9503533	9517821	Number one, I know the music is out on the podcast, but when you were playing music from Space Channel 5, I had mentioned that about two years ago, I was in a skit where it was Dance Dance Revolution versus Space Channel 5.
9517961	9521523	It had to have been at least ten years ago when DDR was popular.
9523364	9524245	I'm just kidding.
9524505	9526626	It was close to seven.
9526686	9529408	What was this DDR versus Space Channel 5 skit?
9530655	9537121	It was pretty much a dance-off between which was better, the characters from Space Channel 5 or DDR.
9537461	9549792	But what had happened was, after the dance-off, the main villain from Space Channel 5 Part 2 comes out, tries to take over the convention, both sides join forces, and do another dance-off to destroy him.
9549972	9552754	But we cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together.
9553715	9555376	Now, which character did you play?
9555416	9556757	And please don't say Space Michael.
9557618	9557998	Rage.
9558478	9559158	Rage.
9559419	9559639	Nice.
9559659	9560699	Did you wear pants?
9562160	9562761	No, I didn't.
9562781	9563401	I had the hair.
9563441	9565002	I didn't have time to throw that together.
9566943	9568324	You didn't go as pantsless, Rage?
9569165	9569665	No.
9569765	9570726	It's an old school LR joke.
9570806	9571226	Old school.
9571586	9572026	Old school.
9573027	9573327	Good.
9573367	9574148	You wore pants.
9575268	9576069	Yes, indeed.
9576769	9578731	So who ultimately ended up being victorious?
9578791	9580872	The DDR people or the Space Channel 5 people?
9583180	9589521	I really don't know because it just ended up like a tie per se, but we still ended up winning an award, which was pretty cool.
9589581	9591122	It was open to interpretation.
9591922	9592482	That's what it was.
9592782	9592982	Yes.
9593282	9595362	Whatever you wanted to happen, you as the viewer.
9596183	9597603	So what cons are coming up, Rama?
9597623	9598743	Any cons you're going to do soon?
9598863	9599823	You're the con king.
9601003	9603704	Anime Boston, but you know, that's them.
9603904	9606985	But I do have a couple more things I want to cover that I'm going to be on my merry little way.
9607165	9607405	All right.
9608065	9608525	Number one.
9609185	9616277	Loki, you mentioned what's the point of having projectors with video games and stuff like that.
9616597	9619362	Something tells me you've never seen gaming tournaments.
9620529	9622250	I missed like half of what you just said there.
9622270	9625112	Yeah, you botched up a little bit.
9625132	9627233	I don't know the connection, but let me just repeat a little bit.
9628053	9634276	Ranma's basically saying a couple weeks ago on the show, I don't even remember when you said it, but you talked about projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles.
9634617	9638599	But Ranma's saying, well, what about gaming tournaments or anime cons?
9638619	9641380	He does conventions and probably sees DDR on projectors all the time.
9641500	9644362	At the Atari party, they had games on projector.
9645768	9646669	Projector is basically a TV.
9675268	9676289	Yeah, maybe pretty much.
9676349	9678990	You use it for certain scenarios.
9679850	9681251	I guess that's where Loki's coming from, eh?
9681531	9693357	I'm just saying, you know, if they come out with some sort of 3D holographic system or something like that that requires some special display that's not out there... Holodeck in a box.
9693577	9695639	You know you want one.
9696119	9702702	But if it's just like, oh look, it's this console with a Pico projector built in, it's kind of...
9704543	9704923	I don't know.
9705644	9709406	It's neat, I guess, but it's impractical.
9711187	9718531	Unless, of course, it runs on batteries, and that might be pretty cool, because then you can at least take it places and play stuff, but I don't know.
9719512	9720452	Alright, Ranma, anything else?
9720472	9723754	I had something else, but I'll save that for another time.
9724159	9724459	Alright.
9724900	9725220	Fair enough.
9725260	9725860	Or you can email.
9726040	9726360	Hint, hint.
9726380	9726921	We need more emails.
9727141	9727401	Alright.
9727981	9728322	We'll do.
9728642	9729382	Ranma, take care, buddy.
9729803	9730183	No problem.
9730283	9730523	Later.
9730683	9730903	Bye.
9731624	9732824	Have fun at Anime Boston.
9733805	9734325	Be good times.
9735126	9735406	Alright.
9736567	9738728	Let's go ahead and get to some more calls.
9738748	9741330	1-877-GAME-OLR Use name on Skype as Orange Lunch Radio.
9741350	9742671	We can do at least one more call, right?
9742771	9743051	One more?
9743635	9744176	One more call?
9744316	9744496	Yeah.
9744716	9745357	All right, one more call.
9745877	9746738	Salacious Pop says yes.
9746758	9747439	You want to take a call?
9747459	9747920	It'll be fun.
9748340	9748480	No.
9748881	9749061	All right.
9751584	9752004	All right.
9752124	9752825	See, it was lighting up.
9752905	9753205	Now it's not.
9753225	9754126	Well, it takes about a minute.
9754347	9756048	In about a minute, it's going to light up completely.
9756489	9758671	All right, Loki, is there any last-minute stories?
9758691	9762195	I know you're just getting into that OK Go video, but is there any last-minute stories?
9762375	9768117	Yeah, actually, it's a series that's on the iOS system, Real Racing.
9769217	9777140	They've got Real Racing 2 HD that's going to be getting an iPad 2 update that's actually going to turn the iPad 2 into almost like a console.
9777620	9778281	Thanks for watching!
9793513	9802198	Let me go to the phones because we, like clockwork, like almost exactly a certain number of seconds after I said we're done, the buffer caught up and we got another lit up board.
9802218	9803859	This is going to be the last call though, guys.
9804199	9805960	So if you didn't get through again, please email.
9806020	9806441	Sorry.
9806801	9807041	All right.
9807281	9807661	Hi, caller.
9807681	9808062	You're on the air.
9808082	9808362	Who's this?
9809002	9809742	Hey, this is X-Link.
9809762	9811003	Hey, what's on your mind, buddy?
9811423	9812083	Hey, nothing much.
9812923	9814843	First off, I'm very proud of my stepdaughter.
9815024	9824886	She's 11, and she's already been in less than about a month and a half been through the first two games of the Professor Layton series and only needed help like once or twice with one or two of the puzzles.
9825026	9826846	That is really amazing for me to see her do that.
9826866	9828907	That's a very cerebral game, so awesome for her.
9829147	9833888	Yeah, she's very smart, and she loves this type of puzzle game, so I'm looking forward to getting her the third one.
9833908	9835709	You got a kid genius on your hand.
9835889	9836569	Mensa test.
9837526	9838607	Yeah, really, no joke.
9839447	9842850	I bought Pokemon Black the day it came out, and I really loved it.
9842890	9844711	And I haven't played Pokemon for quite a while.
9844891	9847253	I really pissed off the Pokemon fans tonight, didn't I?
9847993	9854678	And the only reason why I got it was because a lot of my friends that I knew was getting either getting the black or getting white.
9854758	9856039	So I decided, well, why not?
9856179	9858460	So, you know, and try it out.
9858901	9859741	I'm really enjoying it.
9859781	9861823	I'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated.
9862083	9866726	Some of the movesets have changed around, and the different ways they're doing the Wi-Fi connection.
9867469	9868210	Thanks for watching!
9886775	9893859	Where you could put your Pokemon and put them in a dream world, which is kind of like a web browser game type thing.
9893939	9900542	Unfortunately, it won't be coming anytime soon because of the fact that over in Japan with the earthquake, they had to shut down the servers for it.
9900642	9910688	And they came out with a release saying, though it was supposed to come on on the 30th for North America and Europe, there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up.
9911068	9911228	Hmm.
9912916	9920502	so that was the one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there has been a delay and they have released statements about that so
9921516	9925959	Let me ask you the same fanboy question I've been asking everybody else about the whole Pokemon MMO.
9926459	9928441	Would you leave Warcraft for a Pokemon MMO?
9929301	9929501	No.
9930362	9930582	No?
9931002	9931522	Why is that?
9932343	9938247	I think that would be more towards smaller kids and stuff, kind of like the free realm is for Sony.
9939047	9942850	I really don't see it being more towards adults.
9943130	9947693	I wouldn't mind playing it just for LOLs or if it's for a good price, but
9948413	9955996	I just don't really see me playing a Pokemon MMO when I just can go online and just do the same things as a regular Pokemon and just challenge somebody over Wi-Fi.
9957117	9960358	Unless they're going to offer a bunch more stuff to it.
9960618	9964700	I don't know.
9965240	9967221	I couldn't really see myself doing that.
9967361	9969762	But if Nintendo wants to do it, it would be a good cash cow.
9970002	9970503	Go for it.
9970523	9972824	It would probably give WoW a run for their money.
9973544	9976105	If they can play it off and do it right, that is.
9977029	9982830	and also coming into the straight mail too for the Bioware, sorry, really quickly.
9983370	9993772	I don't get offended when I would play games, say like Dragon Age, Dragon Age 2, Mass Effect and had a quote-unquote gay sex scene would happen.
9993832	9995973	I'm not going to be like, oh my god, I can't believe I'm seeing this.
9996093	10003554	I mean, I couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and said for all the straight mail, sorry, not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that, so...
10004292	10005913	And if I don't like something, I just don't play it.
10006013	10007233	It's as simple as that.
10007754	10009995	Right.
10012135	10013436	It was a weird story.
10014116	10018238	It's kind of cool, though, that Bioware came out and just totally defended it.
10018318	10024681	And I'm glad that if they're going to go all-in like that, they really go all-in and stand by it and the artistic stuff behind it.
10025301	10025841	Precisely.
10026102	10027502	And I don't see any reason as to why.
10027562	10028663	It didn't cause an outcry.
10028703	10030664	People knew about this way before.
10030684	10033665	I mean, as soon as the game hits, people knew about this.
10034065	10036746	They warned people and they were like, oh, we're putting all this stuff in.
10036766	10038067	We're showing you some of the scenes.
10038667	10039648	And they're letting people know.
10039768	10041268	And it's like, it was your choice.
10041769	10046051	You can either A, buy it knowing what was in it, or B, don't buy it.
10046111	10047231	Don't worry about it at all.
10047311	10048332	And just don't get all up.
10049132	10050253	Don't make those decisions.
10050293	10056876	Like it was said before, you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen.
10057036	10060838	And you would know because of by the reaction of the people and what they say.
10061058	10062178	I mean, it's kind of obvious.
10063159	10063519	All right.
10064451	10065660	Well, we'll leave it on that for now.
10066164	10066466	Excellent.
10066486	10067292	Thanks so much for the call.
10068632	10069533	Enjoy your Pokemans.
10070173	10070613	Oh, I will.
10071713	10072474	See ya.
10072974	10075915	Kinda surprised he didn't say anything about the stepdaughter playing Pokemon.
10076275	10082558	Alright, so clearly I angered the Pokemon fans across America tonight, so I would like to apologize.
10082678	10086059	I'm deeply sorry to those Pokemon fans I may have offended.
10086319	10087960	Let me play you a little something in tribute.
10089420	10092761	Goddammit, I hate it when people mislabel YouTube things.
10093002	10094822	It's supposed to be something else.
10095302	10095623	Fail.
10095943	10096523	Maybe this one?
10099332	10100573	I know something that you can pull up.
10100633	10102334	I was trying to play the Jigglypuff song.
10102614	10103134	Let me try this.
10112439	10116742	Search for, it's a bumper from WB's Cartoon Afternoon.
10117222	10119563	Batman sings Jigglypuff.
10120284	10123165	It's awesome.
10124386	10125987	Jiggly Batman, is that it?
10126307	10126547	Here we go.
10130129	10131250	Time for bed.
10131851	10133552	Alright, but a deal's a deal.
10134153	10134593	No way.
10134933	10135914	You promised.
10137896	10145742	Jigglypuff, Jigglypuff.
10147764	10149646	Alright, can I... The whole thing.
10153553	10156655	Pokemon Next on Kids WB Very nice.
10156895	10157236	Very good.
10157556	10158076	I like that one.
10159117	10159337	Nice.
10160658	10162859	Alright, as we put the listeners to sleep even more.
10162940	10165641	Alright, wake up because we're about to wrap up the show here.
10166162	10167963	Thanks to you guys who called in tonight.
10168003	10170265	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but remember we do have an email.
10170325	10173907	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Alright.
10174948	10176569	Any other last minute stories we didn't get to, Loki?
10177426	10202944	No, um, but I did want to mention one thing, though, and just after watching the updated, you know, system update thing for, uh, the OK Go video, if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for Nintendogs, they are really, like, really just missing the boat here, because it's with friends, which, because all the games are Nintendogs and cats, you know, with friends, um, and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video, and it's in 3D.
10203484	10204245	Come on!
10204885	10205366	Nintendo!
10207210	10210232	It's like, here you go, great ad campaign.
10210613	10211393	Don't have to do anything.
10211453	10213335	You just go.
10213675	10214156	Go with it.
10214576	10214976	Okay?
10215197	10215497	Go.
10216097	10217238	No, but seriously, though, I'm surprised.
10217258	10224404	They should have, if they wanted to be kind of hip and cool about it, they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with LittleBigPlanet where it was with live actors and stuff like that.
10224424	10225665	That would have been pretty awesome.
10226646	10229408	But then again, the game is just a rehash of the last game.
10229508	10232230	Or they just need to get Oprah to give away 3DSs on her last show.
10232351	10233171	And you get a 3DS.
10233191	10233612	And you get a 3DS.
10236008	10237669	It's by Nintendo!
10239069	10241310	She already had her last Favorite Things episode, though.
10241550	10243951	And the audience completely just lost their minds.
10243971	10244672	Of course they did.
10244852	10245172	Awesome.
10245192	10246813	You would, too, if you'd been in that audience.
10248213	10248653	Hold me.
10248673	10250974	I would have been you if you got to go to the Britney concert today.
10250994	10254396	She totally trolled them, too, because she never says that it's a giveaway episode.
10254856	10257657	So it's like, oh, we're going to talk about to cancer patients.
10257697	10258177	And it's very sad.
10258197	10261619	Then all of a sudden all the big balloons fall out of the sky and everyone falls out.
10261739	10262879	Celebrate cancer!
10262979	10263839	Woo!
10264420	10264920	All right, anyhow.
10265549	10268071	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10268131	10270553	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking it out.
10271314	10275158	Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.
10275458	10277119	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
10277139	10279121	Word of mouth is what we need because you know what?
10279181	10280502	We don't have a big website.
10280522	10281583	We're not a magazine.
10281943	10283225	We're not corporate owned.
10283705	10286948	We're just frenzies doing this show because we enjoy it.
10287348	10289129	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10289389	10290990	We'll start off with Salacious Pop.
10291030	10292791	Thank you once again for sitting in on the show tonight.
10292952	10293292	Thank you.
10293372	10294332	Great list list tonight.
10294553	10296694	And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10296894	10297494	Tacos.
10298855	10299155	All right.
10299255	10300716	And we'll go to Loki.
10300756	10301737	Any final thoughts for you tonight?
10302179	10308462	My final thought is this, and I don't know if anyone's really noticed, there's an infrared camera on the 3DS.
10309042	10311743	Infrared camera plus motion controls, what does that equal?
10312344	10313844	Wii integration!
10314425	10315605	Yay!
10316606	10317226	Dance party.
10317946	10318807	Dance party.
10318907	10323229	All you need people is playing some Wii game and they just fling their 3DS out of their hand and it's just gone.
10323329	10324789	Next up is the 3DS condom.
10326130	10330252	Alright, my final thought for the night is care packages from Japan rock.
10331239	10335328	DarkSakura, you have a final thought tonight?
10335348	10338615	No.
10339537	10339658	No.
10341195	10341775	No means no.
10342056	10342196	No.
10342876	10343176	All right.
10343536	10346058	That's it, guys, for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10346078	10347939	We'll be back to do it all again next week, though.
