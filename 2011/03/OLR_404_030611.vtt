00:00.000 --> 00:19.740
Today, March 6th, 2011, the PlayStation 3 stops shipping in one country, GameStop becomes

00:19.740 --> 00:31.720
the target of the class-action lawsuit, and Microsoft clears up some old gamer tags.

00:31.720 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the interwebs and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.960
It is that show about video games.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.360
It's the show that brings every gamer a voice as we have over the past nine years.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.160
We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

00:48.160 --> 00:49.320
Black Wolf show.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.160
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.080
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
Shamae.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
How are you?

00:58.080 --> 00:59.080
Shamae.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.080
Shamazzle.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.360
Are we the Laverne and Shirley opening?

01:03.360 --> 01:06.640
This will be showing up on our photo feed shortly.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
Shortly.

01:07.640 --> 01:12.000
Because today's alcoholism is brought to you by Shamae, which is tasty.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.640
Uh oh, you're not drinking during the show again because last week, oh boy, that was

01:15.640 --> 01:16.640
a rough show.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.640
Alright.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
Watch me.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
You're not drinking.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.080
Say hello and welcome back.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.600
Loki is back with us tonight.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
Hello.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.600
How are you doing?

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
You feeling better?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.000
Um, yeah, I guess.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.480
We told all the listeners why you were gone.

01:28.480 --> 01:29.480
Sorry if you want to keep it a secret.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.480
No, I don't.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.480
We forget to tweet about it.

01:31.480 --> 01:32.480
I don't care.

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
Yeah, it's fine.

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
I told him that we played a song in tribute.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
That's right.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
We did play living in a hernia.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
Living with a hernia on our way out.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.040
Apparently it was something, I don't know, I guess it was something I had for a long

01:40.040 --> 01:45.820
time or something, but like on Tuesday last week, like all of a sudden my innie became

01:45.820 --> 01:50.920
an Audi and it's like, oh, this kind of hurts, you know, why is this hurting?

01:50.920 --> 01:55.800
So I went to the doctor, doctor said, um, you know, hey, you better go, you know, here,

01:55.800 --> 01:58.680
I'm going to make an appointment with the surgeon right now so you can go get checked

01:58.680 --> 01:59.680
out.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.560
And then the went to the surgeon's office and they're like, well, we can take care of

02:02.560 --> 02:03.560
this right now if you want.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.760
I'm like, all right.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
So they're wet.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
They did that.

02:07.760 --> 02:13.560
And it hurt like a bitch for, well, during the operation because, you know, operations

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
tend to hurt.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.560
Did they put you under?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.560
I don't know.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
It's local.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
And that felt weird.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
Yeah, I bet.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.560
Oh.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.040
Um, but then, uh, no, then it's just like really stiff and sore for a couple of days.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.920
I just want to point out, they don't knock you out for a vasectomy either.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.320
If you want to, I'm sure that I've heard, I haven't had, that probably wouldn't have

02:30.320 --> 02:33.560
heard as bad as, you know, it's not even really hurting.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
It's weird stuff.

02:34.560 --> 02:40.460
Like imagine someone putting like their finger into your belly button underneath and then

02:40.460 --> 02:44.640
pulling muscle, you know, down or something like that.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.520
That's kind of the feeling that stuff or nice sounds of barf or the, um, the feeling of

02:50.520 --> 02:55.580
someone electrocuting fat or something on you and popping and then smelling that fat

02:55.580 --> 02:56.580
burning.

02:56.580 --> 03:01.200
Once in a while we do talk about video games, I promise, but no, I'm feeling, I'm feeling

03:01.200 --> 03:02.200
better.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.200
Did they turn the fat into bacon?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
They did not.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.200
It does not smell like bacon.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.920
It's not even, it's not good.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.560
Smells like a chicken burning does not smell like chicken burning.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.840
It's not pleasant and it's not pleasant to feel it burning either.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.920
All right, well look, all this gross medical talk house aside, um, hopefully you had a

03:22.920 --> 03:25.440
chance to play a lot of games while you were recovering.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.440
Yeah.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.160
And it was, it was an umbilical hernia.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.320
It was something I think, cause like for the long, like as long as I can remember, it was

03:32.320 --> 03:34.360
like my belly button feels weird.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.080
Like it felt like there was like a tube on the other side or something like that.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.680
Well you never had a baby to lift before and it's probably what, I don't even know if it

03:40.680 --> 03:41.680
does that.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.520
It was just, if it was there, your intestines hooked up to the wrong spot.

03:44.520 --> 03:49.200
Basically what happened was is like it, what happens with hernia is sometimes fat can,

03:49.200 --> 03:52.600
fat or tissue can get trapped inside of it and then it gets, the circulation gets caught

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
off and it dies.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.500
Well, that's what started to happen with some of that.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.120
So that's why I started hurting.

03:57.120 --> 04:02.760
Um, so they had to, you know, get rid of that so that, you know, wouldn't turn, you know,

04:02.760 --> 04:05.520
into gangrene or something.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.680
I got to go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.480
Let me read you some of the comments from our chat room right now.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
We are live.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.480
Uh, at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.480
OMFG.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.480
Loki.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.480
Stop.

04:15.480 --> 04:16.480
Gah.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
Yeah.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.040
Can't Loki just talk about grand theft or earth defense force instead?

04:20.040 --> 04:21.360
Orange lounge trauma center.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.880
I can talk about both of those.

04:23.880 --> 04:29.240
I saw the, I saw the new little, uh, trailer or like behind the scenes or not really a

04:29.240 --> 04:30.240
trailer.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.720
It was like a behind the scenes thing on, um, or a preview of earth defense.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.000
It's awesome.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
So awesome.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
All right.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.320
Anyhow, wow.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.720
I don't know how to follow that up, but, uh, I guess we'll find now that technically I'm

04:45.720 --> 04:49.880
not supposed to be lifting anything or doing anything, but I feel fine.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.560
Um, and so I've been lifting my son's stuff.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.440
I'm just not like, you know, not because you're secretly a cyborg.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.000
I'm not going to go, you know, try to get more cat litter or something like that.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.480
It was like a 30 pound.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.200
It's basically if it hurts, stop doing it.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.720
Uh, well you were missed last week.

05:05.720 --> 05:06.720
Loki.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.720
But our aims improving now that you're with the targeting range.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.720
Was last week.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Seriously.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.720
We had a drunk Jamie.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
We had the Oscars.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
I was tipsy.

05:13.720 --> 05:18.080
We had a drunk Jamie and the mystique came in middle of the show and I don't even know

05:18.080 --> 05:19.080
what happened.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
Shut off our Batman shoes.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
I did pretty good on my Oscar picks.

05:21.080 --> 05:27.640
I think I haven't got a chance to be back to my work yet, but I hope I won something

05:27.640 --> 05:29.240
that'd be kind of cool.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.160
All right, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming weeks.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
Dark soccer.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
How was your gaming week?

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
I played well.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.800
Damn you addict dealer.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.280
I joined the Horde house guild and made a death night because it did not want to start

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
from one.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.920
That's the interesting thing about having a new guild.

05:45.920 --> 05:46.920
Yeah.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
My a spinoff show.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.120
Horde house with extra for has an official guild now and all the details are on the last

05:51.120 --> 05:52.840
show or the goober server Twitter.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
Yeah.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
Uh, on what?

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
Wow.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
Wiki calls a server full of bad players.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
So we had to roll there.

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
We had to roll there.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.840
Had to do it.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.840
So, but everything's starting from scratch has been very weird.

06:01.840 --> 06:06.160
I've run into nothing but assholes really except for us.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.160
Of course.

06:07.160 --> 06:11.120
Um, well, I know there was one nice person who wanted to group with me, but I'm like,

06:11.120 --> 06:12.640
I don't want to play with you.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.520
So it's just been MMOs for you?

06:14.520 --> 06:19.680
Well, today I went in either room cause I wanted to play Marvel versus Capcom three

06:19.680 --> 06:22.380
and I was in, and Dan was playing through Shinobi.

06:22.380 --> 06:28.360
So I sit down with my, uh, my sleepy, I sleep with a sleeping bag because it's really warm

06:28.360 --> 06:32.240
and cause I was super cold, so I sat with my sleeping bag and I fell asleep to Shinobi

06:32.240 --> 06:35.200
and woke up to Ikaruga.

06:35.200 --> 06:41.160
So I guess that counts that I can sleep to video games apparently at some point Dan beat

06:41.160 --> 06:46.080
it cause I opened my eyes and saw the ending and it was like, Oh, whatever.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.760
And uh, I think that's about it.

06:48.760 --> 06:54.920
You know, um, uh, off show stuff, we were, um, out to brunch earlier today cause I've

06:54.920 --> 06:58.520
been promising you brunch when Alan was in town for a long time.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.520
Best French toast ever.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
Well, I had the waffle.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.520
It was pretty good.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.080
But, um, we were kind of talking about old school video games and I had mentioned, uh,

07:05.080 --> 07:07.680
ever since then, cause we were talking about, um, a certain game that's going to come up

07:07.680 --> 07:08.760
later in the show.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.400
And then we were talking about Rygar, the, uh, the arcade game, like not the NES game

07:12.400 --> 07:13.400
that most everybody remembers.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.840
It was also an arcade game.

07:14.840 --> 07:19.520
And I was talking about the Taito arcade classics that is on Xbox, the old school one.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.000
It has Rygar, has tech mobile, a bunch of other stuff in it.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Uh, and like how I've been really wanting to play that.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.520
I didn't get to it today, but like ever since our little conversation this morning, I've

07:27.520 --> 07:28.800
been dying to go back and play some Rygar.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.520
It's been like an old school arcade day.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.640
It is, I think one of the backwards compatible.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.640
It is.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
It is.

07:34.640 --> 07:35.640
That's why I know I can play it.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.640
That came up in our discussion today.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
Yeah.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.680
So, cause I don't think Dan knew that it was backwards compatible and it is one of the

07:39.680 --> 07:40.680
few.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
I don't think he checked.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.880
Did Taito, I think Taito had like the Rainbow Islands and Bubble Bobble.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.080
I can't remember what was in that collection.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.560
It was years ago that I first got it, but now it's pretty awesome considering a lot

07:49.560 --> 07:52.560
of those arcade games kind of get recycled and they want to charge you five, 10 bucks

07:52.560 --> 07:53.560
a piece for them.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.560
I love Parasol Stars.

07:54.560 --> 08:00.160
I found a copy of Parasol Stars for a PC Engine and they wanted like a bunch of money for

08:00.160 --> 08:01.720
it, which was retarded.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
I'm sorry.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
Which was stupid.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.080
I'm sorry if I offended some retarded people out there.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.080
Whatever.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.520
I was trying to see if I could find the, uh.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.360
Oh, now I'm sorry if I offended stupid people.

08:11.360 --> 08:18.880
I was trying to see if I could find the Taito arcade classics page, but I can't find it.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.760
An older game, so it's probably harder to find.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
And I don't want to hear anything about Pokemans.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.760
Are you jealous?

08:24.760 --> 08:28.920
Cause I've already heard about Pokemans from when Shane was playing through Pokemans.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.480
It's all old news.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.480
Old news.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.160
I find it fascinating how many people are going to get Pokemon black and white on the

08:37.160 --> 08:43.600
3DS, even though you can play it on a DS Lite, but because the launch lineup for 3DS is not

08:43.600 --> 08:46.760
as strong as it could have been, uh, there's a lot of people that want to use Pokemon to

08:46.760 --> 08:47.920
kind of fill in the gap.

08:47.920 --> 08:48.920
So we're waiting.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.600
Pokemon fans are pretty rabid, so it's a big day for a lot of people.

08:52.600 --> 08:58.360
Dan has announced that we are waiting for Star Fox to get our 3DS.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.840
And I want Kid Icarus.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.720
Yeah, hopefully those will all be up on the holidays.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.640
All those other bitches can shut up.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.640
Alright.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.640
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

09:06.640 --> 09:07.640
Shime.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.640
Let's go to Loki.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.640
How was your gaming week, Loki?

09:09.640 --> 09:10.640
And I know you had time to play a lot.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.640
Yeah, but I didn't play a lot.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.680
But I did play a few things, and it's funny.

09:16.680 --> 09:21.320
So I finished Sword and Poker 2 finally, so I stopped playing that.

09:21.320 --> 09:27.160
And I'm playing a new iOS game, Game Dev Story.

09:27.160 --> 09:32.060
It's the one where it's a game developer sim, and so you can develop games and stuff like

09:32.060 --> 09:33.060
that.

09:33.060 --> 09:36.160
And, uh, you know, I'm just kicking ass at it.

09:36.160 --> 09:44.560
And it's kind of funny, though, because it's, uh, it takes place, like, during, you know,

09:44.560 --> 09:49.240
pre-Nintendo and stuff like that, but there's all these different systems with different

09:49.240 --> 09:55.840
names that are supposed to be the, you know, those consoles, like the Nintendo IES, or,

09:55.840 --> 10:00.720
you know, the Neon Gion, stuff like that.

10:00.720 --> 10:08.200
So I have my company, Orange Lounge, here, and let me go over some of the past products

10:08.200 --> 10:11.360
that we have put out, and that have sold well.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.600
And of course, everything is really inappropriate, so that's awesome.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.760
Very awesome.

10:17.760 --> 10:25.080
One of our first games, Two Girls, One Cup, sold 847,000 units, of course, that's early

10:25.080 --> 10:27.080
on.

10:27.080 --> 10:33.920
Pokemans, we put out a game called Pokemans, sold 2.7 million.

10:33.920 --> 10:42.040
Some of the other more popular games, um, Fucked Your Mom, 4 million units, Pokemans

10:42.040 --> 10:50.240
3, 11 million, You Is Stupid, which is our You Don't Know Jack game, and then of course

10:50.240 --> 10:54.480
I ripped off other things, obviously, since Nintendo doesn't exist, so we have Mario RPG

10:54.480 --> 10:55.480
as well.

10:55.480 --> 11:05.080
Pokeman Online, 54 million copies, that's pretty awesome, and then of course our last

11:05.080 --> 11:09.600
music game, TDR Ol' Army, 46 million.

11:09.600 --> 11:15.240
And that's on our console, the glory hole, because they happened to be watching the soup

11:15.240 --> 11:21.800
at the time, so, and our console is kicking the Playstation's ass.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.800
Wow.

11:22.800 --> 11:29.600
I gotta do a quick correction, so I apologize, I blended my companies together.

11:29.600 --> 11:35.160
The Rygar and Tecmo Bowl, of course, are in the Tecmo Classic Arcade Collection, not Taito,

11:35.160 --> 11:40.640
sorry, a very similar sounding in my arcade classic knowledge failed me for a moment,

11:40.640 --> 11:44.920
but there's Tecmo Classic Arcade, that is the one that is backwards compatible, Bombjack

11:44.920 --> 11:48.840
Rygar, Tecmo Bowl, Solomon's Key, lots of awesome ones.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.380
There is a separate game called Taito Legends, I can't remember if this one was backwards

11:52.380 --> 11:56.080
compatible, but this was the one that had like the Bubble Bobble, Space Invaders, Elevator

11:56.080 --> 12:01.740
Action, New Zealand Story, and some of those games, so, oops!

12:01.740 --> 12:02.740
I'm getting old, sorry.

12:02.740 --> 12:04.920
And these games are how many years old?

12:04.920 --> 12:08.960
And funny enough, Frisbee, Fucked Your Mom, The Sequel, Fucked Your Dad, that is actually

12:08.960 --> 12:13.240
the sequel, so, pretty funny.

12:13.240 --> 12:19.440
But the game, it's all done in pixel art, and it's pretty fun, and basically you hire

12:19.440 --> 12:26.400
people, fire people, you train them, you can eventually get like, you can go to E3, or

12:26.400 --> 12:35.240
I think they call it Game Decks, it's like Com Decks, SSJ100 Matt wants to know how what

12:35.240 --> 12:37.520
theyplay.com snap is selling.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.360
That's an old school, by the way.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
Don't have that game yet.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
You might have to put that in there.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.240
We may have to develop that game.

12:44.240 --> 12:48.080
But we just put out Call of Duty, and sold 7 million units in the first week.

12:48.080 --> 12:53.080
And don't forget my dream game for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade would be Granny's Got a

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
Gun.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.080
Granny's Got a Gun?

12:55.080 --> 13:00.080
That would be Granny's Got a Gun, and it's the Golden Girls with machine guns.

13:00.080 --> 13:05.900
Yes, and it's great though because you can see what your console, how it's doing and

13:05.900 --> 13:11.080
stuff in the marketplace, and they even have the Virtual Boy, and all the console stuff

13:11.080 --> 13:17.600
since we kinda know what's going on with the game industry and everything, it's like, okay,

13:17.600 --> 13:24.800
here comes the Virtual Kid, it's a 3D portable, I don't think I'll be developing on that because

13:24.800 --> 13:29.440
I think it's going away really fast, and sure enough it goes away really fast, just like

13:29.440 --> 13:36.460
the other ones, instead of the Saturn it's the Uranus.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.360
But yeah, it's pretty fun.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.760
Definitely worth picking up Game Dev Story, and they have the new one, they don't have

13:43.760 --> 13:49.720
it over here yet, but they have some spa sim, they have the spa sim over here, which is

13:49.720 --> 13:56.200
kinda dumb, but they have a game store, it's called the Game Dealer, and you play like

13:56.200 --> 13:59.600
a Game Stop type thing, it's a similar game, Dev Story.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.880
I've heard about that.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.960
But yeah, definitely, Game Dev Story, check it out, it's awesome.

14:04.960 --> 14:05.960
Alright.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.280
Oh, and then other things, I'm sorry, Grand Theft Auto.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.320
Of course, of course, wouldn't be a week on OLR without Grand Theft Auto.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.400
In fact, was that what you were playing a minute ago, it was in like debug mode or something

14:15.400 --> 14:16.800
where you had the flying ice cream truck?

14:16.800 --> 14:22.680
No, that was the PC version, I'm working on mod stuff for it, because I've edited the

14:22.680 --> 14:29.400
water and everything to create this kind of a hydro thunder type track thing in there,

14:29.400 --> 14:33.840
so I'm building, I've done the water part of it, called ice cream thunder.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.320
No, the ice cream truck has nothing to do with it.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.760
The whole reason there was an ice cream truck that was flying around like a helicopter is

14:40.760 --> 14:45.360
because the annihilator helicopter fires guns off of it, and I was trying to make a vehicle

14:45.360 --> 14:49.200
that drives around that fires guns out of the front of it, that happens to be an ice

14:49.200 --> 14:54.200
cream truck just like, you know, Sweet Tooth and Twisted Metal, so.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.000
Was unable to do that though, because the game just crashes for no apparent reason when

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
I try to make it drive.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
So I don't know.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.240
Does it play that horrible Jack in the Box style music while you're driving it?

15:05.240 --> 15:09.400
It does when it, because that, all I did was I replaced the image of it, so.

15:09.400 --> 15:15.320
But the actual ice cream truck does play all the like, you know, that type of music.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.760
Can you do not just an ice cream truck, but what do they call it, the Roach Coaches that,

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
you know, the trucks start to incorporate buildings?

15:19.760 --> 15:20.760
They don't have the Roach Coaches.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.640
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

15:22.640 --> 15:28.560
No but you can, like I've, some other map edit stuff I was working on, I was doing some

15:28.560 --> 15:34.800
tweaks to the physics of the bus and the ambulance, and so now I can clear Central Park with a

15:34.800 --> 15:37.120
ramp, which is awesome.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.480
That bus moves fast.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
I don't know.

15:41.480 --> 15:45.280
They need to bring back something like hard driving and modernize it with more stunts.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.720
I mean I guess you could say, well like Burnout or whatever, but like.

15:47.720 --> 15:52.560
Well that would technically be, well yeah, I mean like I understand, as far as like that

15:52.560 --> 15:56.080
game Stunts, I guess that would be Trackmania, it would be kind of similar to Stunts.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.080
Oh yeah, Trackmania.

15:57.080 --> 16:01.320
But um, you know, as far as like a simulation racing game like that, I don't think they

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
have that.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.080
Hey but hey, you know, EA, Need for Speed, you know, maybe some Need for Speed stunt

16:06.080 --> 16:07.400
game or something like that.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.040
That would be fun.

16:09.040 --> 16:13.680
Alright, uh, My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff, I haven't really invested a lot

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
in new games lately.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.680
I was tempted the other day though, man, the Dreamcast Collection with Space Channel 5

16:18.680 --> 16:23.480
Part 2, uh, Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure, which are already out on Xbox Live Arcade,

16:23.480 --> 16:28.240
but I didn't because I figured the game I really, really want, it'll come out on Xbox

16:28.240 --> 16:31.640
Live Arcade eventually, and if I really, really, really wanted to play it, I could probably

16:31.640 --> 16:36.000
just borrow, you know, Alan's copy or Jamie's copy or something, so I'll just wait a little

16:36.000 --> 16:39.720
longer for some choo choo in Space Channel 5 Part 2.

16:39.720 --> 16:44.640
As far as games I actually did play, went back, today I was feeling really old school

16:44.640 --> 16:49.120
for some reason, I went back and played Bionic Commando Rearmed, because I was going through

16:49.120 --> 16:52.240
like my Xbox games, because I bought a lot of arcade games back in the day, and I was

16:52.240 --> 16:54.920
like, which one of these did I not play enough of?

16:54.920 --> 16:58.280
I got down to B before I found the game, I was like, shit, I need to play more of this.

16:58.280 --> 17:02.980
So I spent some quality time with Bionic Commando Rearmed, and I don't know why I just stopped

17:02.980 --> 17:05.320
playing that the first time, I think it just came out during a period where there were

17:05.320 --> 17:09.320
a lot of games coming out, and yes, I realize there's a sequel out already, so I'm a little

17:09.320 --> 17:15.280
bit behind, but yeah, you can't forget, especially for you folks who are just now getting Xbox

17:15.280 --> 17:19.120
360s, I think sometimes you can get a little bit distracted by all the arcade games that

17:19.120 --> 17:23.640
are out there now, but seriously, there's a lot of like old school stuff that's really

17:23.640 --> 17:28.080
pretty good out on Xbox Live Marketplace, so do your research, because there's some

17:28.080 --> 17:32.160
games you might have missed that came out even like a year ago, two years, I mean, heck,

17:32.160 --> 17:36.000
how old's the Xbox 360 now, coming on five years old, and still some stuff that dates

17:36.000 --> 17:40.160
all the way back, that's quality stuff, like Geometry Wars, the original, is still worth

17:40.160 --> 17:44.360
your five bucks, and the sequel's probably worth another ten.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.480
Rest in peace, Bazaar.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.320
As far as other games I played this week, I did check out the demo for one new game,

17:51.320 --> 17:55.360
Beyond Good and Evil HD, which is of course the big Xbox Live title that came out this

17:55.360 --> 17:59.320
week, which made a lot of people really excited, because the original game has lots and lots

17:59.320 --> 18:03.960
of fans, and let me admit something to you guys, I never really played the original.

18:03.960 --> 18:09.560
I know, I know, it was like a huge game, had its fans on PC, PS2, again, I think the original

18:09.560 --> 18:14.680
kind of came out during a time where I wasn't, either I was way too hardcore into the music

18:14.680 --> 18:18.320
games where I was missing a lot of this stuff, or I don't know, I just, you know, there's

18:18.320 --> 18:22.360
not enough time in the day to play everything, so I missed this the first time around.

18:22.360 --> 18:26.760
But I checked it out this time, and I at least played through the demo, and I was left wanting

18:26.760 --> 18:30.520
to get the full version, it was pretty cool.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.160
Having not played the original, I can't sit here and profess to know a lot about what

18:33.160 --> 18:38.120
the upgraded, but I will tell you it was widescreen, it definitely seemed like there was a lot

18:38.120 --> 18:43.760
of water effects that seemed to be somewhat new, and everything seemed very, very smooth.

18:43.760 --> 18:48.160
It didn't look like, it did kind of look like an up-res'd PlayStation 2 game, but that's

18:48.160 --> 18:53.120
okay, I mean, I hear a lot of people are really drawn to this game because of the story, and

18:53.120 --> 18:57.560
I know this game really throws you in right away.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.880
There's really not a lot of background explanation given as to, you know, what's going on in

19:00.880 --> 19:05.560
the game, but it was cool, like I was interested in it right up until they pulled the plug

19:05.560 --> 19:08.080
on it, which was rather abruptly on the demo.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.920
What a great way to try and convince people to spend ten bucks, so yeah, I'm interested

19:11.920 --> 19:15.040
in going back and revisiting this game since, you know, so many people love it, and I know

19:15.040 --> 19:18.840
a lot of good things about it, and having got to play the first, I don't know, thirty

19:18.840 --> 19:24.500
minutes or so in the demo was nice, so I will check out more of that, if I don't get too

19:24.500 --> 19:28.880
distracted by Torchlight next week, because that is the Xbox Live game I am waiting for,

19:28.880 --> 19:33.400
I love the PC one, I'm so excited to see how it translates to console, I'm really worried

19:33.400 --> 19:37.240
I'm getting my expectations way too high, that I'm going to be just left disappointed

19:37.240 --> 19:40.280
next week, but hopefully I can fit in Beyond Good and Evil HD 2.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.000
According to Game Guru, Space Channel 5 is on Steam.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.240
Yes, it did, it came out, I believe, over the weekend on Steam, it just kind of suddenly

19:48.240 --> 19:54.760
showed up, so yeah, if you want to check that out on the PC, that would be cool, so, alright,

19:54.760 --> 19:58.400
so that was pretty much it for my gaming week, those two games, and you know, some of the

19:58.400 --> 20:03.520
usual stuff, wow, and some other PC games and so forth, Super Meat Boy, getting frustrated,

20:03.520 --> 20:06.480
tried some of those new levels that we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show,

20:06.480 --> 20:11.320
couldn't even beat one, couldn't even beat stage one on some of those really hard ones,

20:11.320 --> 20:12.320
disgusting.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.920
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we will get into the gaming news

20:16.920 --> 20:21.520
for tonight, not a lot to say for housekeeping except Dark Soccer, sadly, will not be joining

20:21.520 --> 20:27.640
us next week, but there will still be an OLR, Loki and I will be here, perhaps a guest host,

20:27.640 --> 20:28.640
I don't know, we'll see.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.880
I will be in a car.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.840
Yes, you're going far away, so.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.840
Far far away.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.840
I hope you have fun.

20:34.840 --> 20:39.360
Don't go too far that you can't come back, because we can go one week, but I don't know

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
about two weeks.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.360
Not be back.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.360
Alright.

20:42.360 --> 20:47.120
Join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, you can join us on Facebook, facebook.com

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
slash Orange Laundry.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.560
Speaking of Twitter, I'm peeking at it a little early tonight, and I thought this was a really

20:51.560 --> 20:56.180
funny tweet from Defective Candy sent us a tweet, I know, I'm getting to Twitter early,

20:56.180 --> 21:00.400
so shoot me, introducing OLR to seven of my friends tonight.

21:00.400 --> 21:05.160
We're partying it up with some old school Unreal LAN partying and tuning in.

21:05.160 --> 21:09.160
Well shout out to you guys at the LAN party, that sounds pretty awesome, kicking it old

21:09.160 --> 21:11.600
school with Unreal.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.480
Back in the day, this might be a little more even old school than Unreal, but back in the

21:14.480 --> 21:18.360
day, we used to get together and play Quake, that used to be kind of the big thing, this

21:18.360 --> 21:22.000
is like way before MMOs and all that, we would get together and play Quake like online, it

21:22.000 --> 21:23.240
was just a lot of fun.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.920
My first LAN was Duke Nukem 3D.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.920
Oh yeah?

21:25.920 --> 21:29.560
Yeah, I used to do that on the modem, the dial-up thing, it was a lot of fun.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.920
Duke Nukem and Command & Conquer Red Alert were fun over the modem.

21:32.920 --> 21:33.920
Nice.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.360
So, I hope you guys are having fun, and thanks for spreading the word of the show, appreciate

21:37.360 --> 21:38.360
it.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.720
Let's get to the news, and Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.720
Oh yeah.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.320
Much busier week than last week, that's for sure.

21:44.320 --> 21:50.840
Yeah, it helps to have stuff going on in conferences and whatnot.

21:50.840 --> 21:54.760
We may have talked about, well we did talk about this a little bit, that it was a possibility,

21:54.760 --> 22:02.560
especially with LG suing Sony over the Blu-ray technology, but now apparently they've won

22:02.560 --> 22:10.080
their preliminary injunction, and that means that they have blocked the sale of the Playstation

22:10.080 --> 22:11.560
3 in Europe.

22:11.560 --> 22:18.200
So basically, LG has an injunction for customs to seize and confiscate all PS3s coming into

22:18.200 --> 22:22.640
Europe and from manufacturing plants, etc., up to ten days.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.920
I don't really know what that's supposed to do for ten days.

22:25.920 --> 22:31.760
It says, apparently they're collecting consuls, the consuls collected are temporarily being

22:31.760 --> 22:40.720
held in Dutch warehouses until the case moves forward, but right now they're expected to,

22:40.720 --> 22:44.740
I guess retailers are expected to have enough PS3s the last two or three weeks, so you may

22:44.740 --> 22:49.360
not necessarily see any shortages or something like that.

22:49.360 --> 22:55.560
You may, if this case goes further, and they end up winning everything, because Sony's

22:55.560 --> 22:58.360
gonna have to pay them some money.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.440
Do you think maybe that's just what's gonna ultimately happen, is that this all gets settled

23:01.440 --> 23:03.240
out of court to stop this from happening?

23:03.240 --> 23:04.240
It all depends-

23:04.240 --> 23:08.560
It seems like 90% of the game lawsuit stories end up settled out of court.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.720
It all depends whether they feel they're in the right or not.

23:12.720 --> 23:20.040
If Sony knows that they have no chance at winning this, then they probably won't fight

23:20.040 --> 23:25.840
it, but if they think that they're in the right and they don't need to pay them any

23:25.840 --> 23:30.760
royalties or whatever, they're gonna fight it, because it saves them money if they don't

23:30.760 --> 23:34.120
want to pay these royalties on every single console shipped.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.040
How damaging is this to Sony, do you think?

23:36.040 --> 23:40.520
Because I look at this and go, well, if they can't ship it to stores, they're still okay

23:40.520 --> 23:42.880
for a little bit, because stores have what's on hand.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.200
Come on, it's just a shortage for ten days.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.880
It's no big deal.

23:47.880 --> 23:51.920
It's not like the PlayStation 3 has a must-have game coming out this week or something.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.560
People deal with shortages on stuff for a lot longer than ten days.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.140
I mean, look at the Wii, and it's just fine.

23:57.140 --> 24:00.340
I doubt this will make any sort of impact.

24:00.340 --> 24:05.760
Everybody likes reporting on this stuff because, haha, Sony's getting their taste of legal

24:05.760 --> 24:10.720
battles since they're suing GeoHot and stuff like that, whatever.

24:10.720 --> 24:16.000
It's just another lawsuit, but at least this time it's not just something stupid like some

24:16.000 --> 24:21.300
no-name company sitting on patents for a while and going, oh, hey, we invented, you know,

24:21.300 --> 24:23.240
we patented controller.

24:23.240 --> 24:26.240
That's true, you can't say this is so much a patent troll thing.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.240
No, this is not.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.240
Interesting.

24:28.240 --> 24:33.280
All right, well, we'll see what comes of this, the legal team at Sony working overtime these

24:33.280 --> 24:35.120
next couple weeks for sure.

24:35.120 --> 24:41.800
Big, big gaming news, and kind of always divisive when I talk about Apple.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.240
And Apple did announce the iPad 2 is coming out March 11th, and you bet this is gaming

24:46.240 --> 24:52.160
news because, you know, a lot of folks are gaming on the Apple these days with the iPhone

24:52.160 --> 24:54.720
and the iOS, you know, big, big system.

24:54.720 --> 24:59.400
Controversial too if you want to get into the whole fact that they charge very little

24:59.400 --> 25:03.960
for the games on the iPhone and some people have a problem with that as we learn GDC this

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
week.

25:04.960 --> 25:05.960
But I digress.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.280
iPad 2 was announced this week.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.760
It is coming out on March 11th.

25:09.760 --> 25:14.240
It will cost you anywhere between $629 and $829.

25:14.240 --> 25:20.000
If you want a unit with 3G, lowest you can go though is $499 if you want the Wi-Fi only

25:20.000 --> 25:22.600
up to $699.

25:22.600 --> 25:26.640
Just throwing it out there too, if you wanted to get the original iPad, those are now sliced

25:26.640 --> 25:28.560
in price by $100.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.300
So those are now out as well.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.920
Some of the big things that are supposed to be coming out with the iPad 2, it's not just

25:32.920 --> 25:38.120
the fancy colors, but of particular interest is this cable that will allow you to hook

25:38.120 --> 25:44.080
up the iPad to your television and get the output in 1080p display, which is making a

25:44.080 --> 25:45.640
lot of people very excited.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.600
You know, of course streaming movies that are on the device makes it very easy to kind

25:48.600 --> 25:52.960
of bypass the Mac Mini, or I'm sorry, not the Mac Mini, the Apple TV and so forth in

25:52.960 --> 25:54.200
order to do that.

25:54.200 --> 25:59.000
But a lot of people also wondering, could this have some feature for games going with

25:59.000 --> 26:04.200
it where you could use the cord to have the iPad as a control device for something on

26:04.200 --> 26:05.200
your TV?

26:05.200 --> 26:06.200
Angry Birds HD?

26:06.200 --> 26:11.560
No, I mean, because who wants to be tethered to a TV?

26:11.560 --> 26:14.680
You know, unless they have some sort of wireless thing, it's not.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.080
Which, quite frankly, I'm surprised they don't through the whole Apple TV thing that we've

26:19.080 --> 26:20.080
seen.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
They may later on.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.120
I mean, they can stream stuff through Apple TV, and it could be something that comes through

26:25.120 --> 26:26.760
iOS later on, but...

26:26.760 --> 26:31.980
I mean, we did have the story last week or two weeks ago about the whole people were

26:31.980 --> 26:37.640
playing PS3 games through the iOS, was a whole thing that had been set up.

26:37.640 --> 26:42.920
So I mean, the technology is getting there, and that has nothing to do with Apple themselves.

26:42.920 --> 26:45.960
That was kind of a filed-in-a-hack-and-crack bin.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.960
Yeah, but that's a little in the reverse.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.960
That's not necessarily...

26:49.960 --> 26:58.360
I mean, playing PlayStation 1 emulated games, that's through the actual system that's running

26:58.360 --> 26:59.360
that.

26:59.360 --> 27:04.320
But streaming stuff from the PlayStation 3, though, that's a little bit different.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.160
That's just streaming video.

27:06.160 --> 27:10.880
And I mean, I'm sure that obviously since the iPad 2 is a dual-core system, I'm sure

27:10.880 --> 27:13.720
it can handle streaming stuff.

27:13.720 --> 27:22.520
But as far as the Apple TV goes, I mean, I think it's just like an Intel Atom little

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
box.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.160
I mean, it's just...

27:25.160 --> 27:29.080
I don't think it has enough oomph to do 1080p.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.800
I think it's capped at 720 because I think that's what iTunes is.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.320
The ones that are out there now, yeah, 720.

27:36.320 --> 27:40.720
Let me throw this question out there to you guys here in studio and the chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com.

27:40.720 --> 27:46.280
There's been a lot of talk this week with this news and in the game blogs and so forth

27:46.280 --> 27:50.200
about the 3DS, which we'll get into some of that news in a little while, and the iPad

27:50.200 --> 27:51.760
2.

27:51.760 --> 27:55.760
Both had these major press conferences on the same day, literally within an hour of

27:55.760 --> 28:03.720
each other, and somewhat of a dig at Apple coming from Nintendo, and kind of a lot of

28:03.720 --> 28:07.880
both these devices coming out in March, and a lot of talk about kind of the future of

28:07.880 --> 28:09.880
handheld gaming.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.880
What do you guys kind of think?

28:10.880 --> 28:17.240
Does the 3DS really have to worry about iPad 2 or vice versa, or do these things kind of

28:17.240 --> 28:21.360
coexist and neither really has to really worry about the other, so why are they dogging on

28:21.360 --> 28:22.360
each other?

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
I think it's the latter, but you know how companies are.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.600
They like to look for drama where there isn't.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.160
And on top of that, the rivalry is only good for both of them.

28:31.160 --> 28:36.720
Establishing some type of farcical rivalry.

28:36.720 --> 28:42.240
Unfortunately, Nintendo will never be able to compete with Apple as far as their online

28:42.240 --> 28:45.360
marketplace goes, because their online marketplace is open.

28:45.360 --> 28:51.280
It's an open marketplace for all these developers to basically create these games, submit them,

28:51.280 --> 28:54.320
get approval, and then they are up on the marketplace really quickly.

28:54.320 --> 28:58.840
That's why you get hundreds of apps each day on that marketplace.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.360
Now granted, not all of them are great, but you know what?

29:01.360 --> 29:04.920
That should be up to the consumer to decide what's good, and they have a good review system

29:04.920 --> 29:11.120
I think in place on the app store that it's pretty easy to find what you're looking for

29:11.120 --> 29:13.960
and know if it's crap or not.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.480
But see, that's what Nintendo needs, because unfortunately you're never going to be able

29:17.480 --> 29:23.240
to compete at the level with these guys if you're just releasing three games a week on

29:23.240 --> 29:24.240
that.

29:24.240 --> 29:29.640
And I'm sorry, but the virtual console stuff, at this point you know what?

29:29.640 --> 29:34.520
You should just get the rights where you can, and it really shouldn't take much.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.960
You've got an emulator built, just dump the ROMs, go, go, go.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.880
To PlayDevil's advocate though, what if it were three quality games a week?

29:41.880 --> 29:48.040
I'm talking Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, the stuff that's really good on iOS, of which

29:48.040 --> 29:51.180
there isn't much, but there are some really, really good games on there.

29:51.180 --> 29:55.960
There are good games on the iOS platform, and it's just some of these games that people

29:55.960 --> 29:57.560
just decide that they like.

29:57.560 --> 30:01.120
Angry Birds I don't think is a great game.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.120
I'm sorry, it's a game that's popular.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.320
It's a trading game is what it is.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.600
But the public disagrees.

30:08.600 --> 30:09.600
Public's dumb.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.120
It's selling very well.

30:12.120 --> 30:16.360
I don't think it's all that either, I prefer Cut the Rope, but I can say okay, it's selling

30:16.360 --> 30:18.440
like shit tons of copies.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.440
And you know what though?

30:20.440 --> 30:25.560
I wouldn't be surprised, and there's no reason why they can't have Angry Birds on the Nintendo

30:25.560 --> 30:26.560
DS.

30:26.560 --> 30:31.120
Right now, on the DSi, why can't they have Angry Birds on there?

30:31.120 --> 30:39.480
I mean, PSP has it, it was a download game, it came out way later, but that's even the

30:39.480 --> 30:46.160
problem with the PSP, they're a little online stuff, it's so closed that they just can't

30:46.160 --> 30:47.880
get games fast enough.

30:47.880 --> 30:54.680
They need to really open it up, I think the closest thing to the app store is probably

30:54.680 --> 30:59.080
the Xbox Indie games, because your release is there, you're seeing a lot of games coming

30:59.080 --> 31:00.080
out.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.320
A lot of crap, but that's the same with the app store, a lot of it is crap.

31:04.320 --> 31:10.440
But if you open it up, a lot more stuff comes out, and yeah, you're gonna get a lot of crappy

31:10.440 --> 31:14.520
games, but you're also gonna get a lot of good games, and if you're smart, and know

31:14.520 --> 31:22.640
how to highlight those good games, and know how to push that platform forward, then that

31:22.640 --> 31:23.640
is good for you.

31:23.640 --> 31:27.560
The problem with Nintendo though is, is if they do that, and they start pushing that

31:27.560 --> 31:31.560
platform forward, who's gonna want to pay $50 for a game?

31:31.560 --> 31:37.360
Because then they can just get some really quality games for like 99 cents, or a few

31:37.360 --> 31:39.560
bucks instead of $50.

31:39.560 --> 31:44.080
Why should I pay $50 for a 3DS game like Zelda?

31:44.080 --> 31:47.320
Because it's 3D!

31:47.320 --> 31:49.400
So what if it's 3D?

31:49.400 --> 31:54.000
Doesn't mean that those digital download games aren't 3D, they could easily program for 3D,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.640
just like there's gonna be indie games that are gonna support the Kinect, eventually,

31:57.640 --> 32:02.000
once they open it up for everybody.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.520
Why should I have to pay that kind of money?

32:04.520 --> 32:05.600
And that's what they're complaining about.

32:05.600 --> 32:10.080
They're complaining about the fact that they think that these games are devaluing their

32:10.080 --> 32:11.080
games.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.080
Well, why do you think that?

32:13.080 --> 32:18.560
Because obviously if you think your games are so much better, then how would they devalue

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
your games?

32:19.560 --> 32:20.560
Oh!

32:20.560 --> 32:22.240
Because they're not...

32:22.240 --> 32:23.820
Your games aren't that much better.

32:23.820 --> 32:24.820
That's the problem.

32:24.820 --> 32:29.600
Is, you know, you've spent all this money on developing these games, they're just okay.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.600
I mean...

32:31.600 --> 32:32.800
Let's go to comments from our chat room.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.280
Chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments.

32:35.280 --> 32:38.580
Dark Tetsuya says, I think Nintendo's just jealous because they can't keep releasing

32:38.580 --> 32:41.920
all new hardware after a year the way Apple seems to.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
They don't need to!

32:42.920 --> 32:43.920
They do!

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
But they do!

32:44.920 --> 32:50.920
The DS Lite, the DS Lite in new colors, the DSi, the XL...

32:50.920 --> 32:54.080
As of lately, I would say they have been doing something new every year.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.080
Yeah, the XL...

32:55.080 --> 33:00.160
But, see, that's even retarded too, because what's the point of making the system larger?

33:00.160 --> 33:02.760
How is this supposed to, you know, drive sales for you guys?

33:02.760 --> 33:04.400
I never understood that.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.520
Let's make a portable system larger now.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.520
What?

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
Why?

33:08.520 --> 33:10.920
It's just like, oh, let's make the Game Boy micro.

33:10.920 --> 33:15.200
Game Guru says Nintendo pretty much dumped every game they do own on the Virtual Console.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.360
Or at least, well, every game they could dump.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.000
I guess maybe a dig at Earthbound because of the whole trouble there.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
They're not thinking...

33:23.000 --> 33:27.040
The problem is they're a step behind when it comes to, well, they're a few steps behind

33:27.040 --> 33:29.840
when it comes to embracing online.

33:29.840 --> 33:35.480
They're not where these first-party companies are.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.780
They're not supporting download content as well.

33:37.780 --> 33:40.880
Why aren't there downloadable tracks for Mario Kart?

33:40.880 --> 33:42.000
I mean, come on.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.480
And that's stupid simple.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.040
You could easily just put out all...

33:46.040 --> 33:47.200
Says that we can't handle it.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.520
No, I mean, I know it can.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.400
The Wii can handle it.

33:50.400 --> 33:56.480
The problem with the Wii, though, is because they, you know...

33:56.480 --> 34:00.560
The problem is they just don't want to do that because then they can't sell another

34:00.560 --> 34:04.840
Mario Kart game because they can put, you know, new tracks in there.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.520
But here's the thing that's even funny about the Wii.

34:06.520 --> 34:12.520
I mean, people can, like, they can modify the tracks that are in the game just by using

34:12.520 --> 34:15.280
an SD memory card and some software.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.880
So if it's that easy, open it up like ModNation Racers.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.520
Oh my god, you've got a community of people that are excited about a game.

34:20.520 --> 34:24.360
You can even start charging for some download content, different, you know, tools and stuff

34:24.360 --> 34:26.000
that you can put in there, like LittleBigPlanet.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.440
You can make, you know, money off this.

34:27.440 --> 34:31.240
The problem is they need to change their stupid business model in order for it to work.

34:31.240 --> 34:36.960
And I'm sorry, but I just don't see them ever embracing online like that.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.800
Let me ask you this and then kind of try to close with this thought, because I want to

34:39.800 --> 34:40.800
come...

34:40.800 --> 34:42.200
Believe it or not, I want to come back to the Wii thing later in the show because I

34:42.200 --> 34:43.760
have another question about it.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.040
But let me ask this.

34:45.040 --> 34:49.640
You say they need to change their business model, but at the same time, numbers say they

34:49.640 --> 34:52.600
have the number one console in America, period.

34:52.600 --> 34:56.000
I mean, so why do they need to change their business model?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
They're number one.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.620
I mean, I hate it.

34:58.620 --> 34:59.620
You hate it.

34:59.620 --> 35:00.620
We all hate it.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
But they are number one.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.620
For right now.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.520
I mean, that's the problem.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
That's a cocky attitude, though.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.320
If you say, oh, but we're number one, we can do whatever the hell we want.

35:09.320 --> 35:14.640
That's great until Apple decides to put out a console and then they have this app store

35:14.640 --> 35:17.220
and then you can download all these games for 99 cents.

35:17.220 --> 35:21.040
Or let's just say that they're iPad prices and it's like two bucks a game or something

35:21.040 --> 35:22.720
like that.

35:22.720 --> 35:27.480
I'm sorry, but a lot of people, you know, there are a lot of good games out there that

35:27.480 --> 35:32.880
are on these marketplaces, you know, even like the Android marketplace and stuff.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.960
Not everybody really wants you to spend the kind of development time that it costs for

35:37.960 --> 35:39.320
a $50 game.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.720
Like for example, a perfect example, Excite Truck.

35:43.720 --> 35:44.720
I love that game.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.920
That game is awesome.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.840
All they needed to do was release download content for it or a sequel that had basically

35:49.840 --> 35:51.880
the same style of gameplay, just more tracks.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.880
Not Excite Bots.

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
Not Excite Bots.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.060
Excite Bots was, I don't even know what the hell they were doing.

35:57.060 --> 36:00.120
But I know Nintendo had a problem, was behind that kind of crap.

36:00.120 --> 36:03.360
Hey, you know what would be better if we made some more mini games in there?

36:03.360 --> 36:07.960
It does not belong, mini games do not belong in a racing game.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.300
It's stupid.

36:09.300 --> 36:13.100
It's really, really stupid.

36:13.100 --> 36:18.560
But all they had to do was download content, and they could have still made some money

36:18.560 --> 36:21.200
on top of that, and you know what?

36:21.200 --> 36:25.080
Games like that, even if they have download content, do not devalue their sequels when

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
they come out.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.920
So what if there's good download content for that?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.100
You know what?

36:29.100 --> 36:31.520
People will be more willing to buy the next game because they know that they're going

36:31.520 --> 36:34.040
to be supporting download content on top of that.

36:34.040 --> 36:39.360
Or hell, you can put out the game for a cheaper cost and then have in-game downloads or something

36:39.360 --> 36:43.240
like that, you can add to it and increase value that way.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.300
There's just so many ways that they could do it, but they don't want to.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.700
Because you know what?

36:48.700 --> 36:50.120
People don't download games.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.120
That's what they think.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.120
People don't download games.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.200
Well, I think Apple would disagree with you on that.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.220
So let me ask this question.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.440
How do you kind of feel about Nintendo right now?

37:00.440 --> 37:05.760
Because I do notice you're looking at eBay on your computer looking for 3DSs right now.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.680
So there's a part of you that must... there's something Nintendo's doing right for you.

37:09.680 --> 37:10.680
Well I want to...

37:10.680 --> 37:13.080
I just get every console, okay?

37:13.080 --> 37:16.480
That doesn't even necessarily... and I was just looking to see if anybody's actually

37:16.480 --> 37:20.000
offering up a Japanese system for a decent price.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.560
I'm sorry but even though $350 is a good price for a Japanese console, and it is in California,

37:26.560 --> 37:31.200
although his reserve price is probably $500, so screw that.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.000
You know me, I like getting stuff early.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.960
Anyways, but no, I'm not actually gonna probably buy that.

37:35.960 --> 37:42.720
I will buy a 3DS when it comes out, because I think it's a cool technology, but I gotta

37:42.720 --> 37:46.040
be honest, the launch lineup is very disappointing.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.160
I'm like sitting there going, looking at the tiles coming out, I'm like, well I'll pick

37:50.160 --> 37:56.200
up pilot wings because that looks fun, but pfft, it's like... and Nintendo's like, but

37:56.200 --> 37:57.600
we have Steel Diver!

37:57.600 --> 37:59.720
It's a 2D submarine game!

37:59.720 --> 38:00.720
Oh, cool?

38:00.720 --> 38:05.520
I mean, you know, that's neat, I guess.

38:05.520 --> 38:14.000
Or like, you know, hey, we have Nintendogs, and Nintendogs and cats, or, hey, hey, hey,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.520
we've got Ocarina of Time.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.120
Like I was reading the news articles, they're like, oh my god, Master Quest is in Ocarina

38:21.120 --> 38:22.440
of Time!

38:22.440 --> 38:24.240
For the 3DS, that's so amazing!

38:24.240 --> 38:28.400
Alright, I promise I won't let Dark Soccer do her story here, but I gotta read this comment

38:28.400 --> 38:30.800
from chat, because it is kind of an interesting point.

38:30.800 --> 38:35.320
Game Guru says, your Mario Kart example doesn't work, Nintendo only makes one Mario Kart per

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
system.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.880
Well, I'm talking about other consoles though.

38:40.880 --> 38:47.560
I mean, I'm saying, you know, and this is even bad now, as far as the trend goes, remember

38:47.560 --> 38:53.960
before with like Mario Kart for the GameCube I think was the first one I did, it's like,

38:53.960 --> 38:56.960
oh look, we've got some of the older tracks in there, oh that's kind of cool, you know,

38:56.960 --> 39:01.280
a little bit of retro nostalgia there, and then they started, one of the Game Boy ones

39:01.280 --> 39:06.080
I think started that whole trend, you're right, the Game Boy Advance one did, because it was

39:06.080 --> 39:09.680
based off the, you know, it looked like the Super Nintendo game, and I was like, oh that's

39:09.680 --> 39:14.480
kind of cool because it's nostalgia, and now all of them do, like half the tracks are all

39:14.480 --> 39:16.200
old tracks.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.520
Come on, man, that is just, that's lazy right there.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.360
You have to admit, Rainbow Road's pretty sweet.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.100
They have Rainbow, but yeah, I understand it's really sweet, but there's a new Rainbow

39:25.100 --> 39:36.280
Road in every game, okay, and it's not necessary to put in one of the, you know, Mario Circuit

39:36.280 --> 39:42.280
tracks from the Game Boy Advance and my 3DS version or something like that, they just

39:42.280 --> 39:48.340
have such potential, like, you know, a track editor would be so awesome, but they'll never

39:48.340 --> 39:54.240
do it, because they're like afraid that people will, I don't know.

39:54.240 --> 40:01.720
I mean, come on, look at, here's a perfect example, a game that they did offer some sort

40:01.720 --> 40:07.640
of editor for, a level editor, and it was so insignificant, but it just blew up like

40:07.640 --> 40:08.640
crazy.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.240
Smash Brothers, for the Wii, they had a level editor in there, oh my god, everybody loved

40:13.240 --> 40:17.560
it, they had a website, they had websites sharing levels back and forth, IGN had this

40:17.560 --> 40:21.780
big ol' thing that you can share custom levels, there was hundreds of levels to download and

40:21.780 --> 40:29.000
play and stuff like that, it was such a minuscule thing, but it really got people excited about

40:29.000 --> 40:31.800
the game, so what can I create?

40:31.800 --> 40:36.760
Come on, people, Mario Kart's a cool game and stuff, and then, you know, even like your

40:36.760 --> 40:42.160
Mario games are fun, or Zelda, whatever, but if you throw in some sort of like community

40:42.160 --> 40:46.620
aspect to it, people get really excited about it, and I think that's gonna speak a lot louder

40:46.620 --> 40:50.800
than oh hey, we put out a Mario Kart game, yeah, I know you're gonna put out a Mario

40:50.800 --> 40:54.160
Kart game on 3S, you're also gonna put a Mario Kart game on the next console you put out,

40:54.160 --> 41:00.880
I mean, that's dumb, in a Zelda game, I mean, we know that's coming, it's, we'd be dumb

41:00.880 --> 41:08.700
to think otherwise, but they just, they have such potential, they just really are squandering

41:08.700 --> 41:09.700
it.

41:09.700 --> 41:13.920
Alright, let's move on, Dark Soccer's been waiting to talk about her next story.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.400
I've given up, I'm looking at Monday through Friday.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.800
More, more to come later though, we haven't finished the Nintendo news yet, and I've got

41:21.800 --> 41:25.600
another killer question for Loki in a little bit here on the show.

41:25.600 --> 41:31.120
GameStop has yet another class action lawsuit.

41:31.120 --> 41:36.720
We've gotten a lot of money from GameStop because of employee stuff, and apparently

41:36.720 --> 41:42.560
now people should be getting more, anyone who's bought anything ever from GameStop actually,

41:42.560 --> 41:48.760
they use their credit card to buy it, should be getting their $5, because apparently they

41:48.760 --> 41:55.240
acquire additional personal information, including the card holder's physical residential address,

41:55.240 --> 42:00.160
by pairing the personal identification information with the card holder's name obtained from

42:00.160 --> 42:01.280
the credit card.

42:01.280 --> 42:05.040
So basically, you swipe your card, they get all your info.

42:05.040 --> 42:09.800
It's not saying what they're doing with it, but they're supposedly doing it against your

42:09.800 --> 42:10.800
knowledge.

42:10.800 --> 42:16.280
But here's the thing, everywhere that you use your credit card does that without your

42:16.280 --> 42:17.280
knowledge.

42:17.280 --> 42:23.120
So this is me, we're gonna have class action lawsuits against the grocery store, and the

42:23.120 --> 42:24.680
porn shop, and eBay.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.200
I don't think it's necessarily that.

42:26.200 --> 42:32.640
I think it's more because you have to put in all your personal info for trades or whatever,

42:32.640 --> 42:37.680
that they're basically saying, okay, this is this person, here's this person, and this

42:37.680 --> 42:42.400
person paid, here's their name, okay, we're gonna link their card number to this address

42:42.400 --> 42:43.400
now.

42:43.400 --> 42:48.280
Which is not good, especially if that information just kind of gets leaked out, because I'm

42:48.280 --> 42:53.680
sure those GameStop employees are very trustworthy as far as, you know, minimum wage, that has

42:53.680 --> 42:55.800
a lot of trust built into it.

42:55.800 --> 42:59.160
They kind of should have some people's addresses on file, though, for the people that like

42:59.160 --> 43:00.760
to sell back stolen games.

43:00.760 --> 43:05.680
That's the point, too, is that I think that it's a good idea, I mean, I don't see any

43:05.680 --> 43:09.920
problem with it as long as they're not selling it, and if you're on the opt-out list, then

43:09.920 --> 43:13.920
they can't.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.840
And I mean, if you get their card, if you want the magazine, you've got to fill out

43:16.840 --> 43:19.000
all that stuff anyway, you know.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.280
I don't see what the big deal is, but people are all butthurt over their personal information.

43:23.280 --> 43:28.160
Well, privacy's a big thing, you know, especially in the past few years with Facebook and all

43:28.160 --> 43:30.000
that, it's really come into the spotlight.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
People are very sensitive, which, you know, I get it, identity theft sucks, and so forth.

43:35.000 --> 43:42.600
But this isn't something that, unless someone actually, you know, breaks into a database

43:42.600 --> 43:47.860
that all other stuff is uploaded to, and steals the information directly out of the database,

43:47.860 --> 43:51.520
I don't think that there's much of a problem.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.800
William Murderface in our chatroom says, so GameStop wants to troll me?

43:54.800 --> 43:55.800
I don't know how to react.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.240
Rama in our chatroom says, I hate when I swipe my card.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.680
Some terminals require your zip code, and you can't continue your transaction without

44:02.680 --> 44:03.680
it.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.680
Isn't that a credit card protection thing?

44:04.680 --> 44:08.680
It's like a gas station, I don't know if those are everywhere, but at Chevron, when I do

44:08.680 --> 44:13.520
the swipe, it always makes me put on my zip code, because that's how it knows that I'm

44:13.520 --> 44:16.360
who I, you know, somebody didn't steal my card.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.400
Apparently it's illegal, but I still don't see what the big deal is, because it's not

44:19.400 --> 44:26.120
like they can actually go out and sell your information without your permission, or they

44:26.120 --> 44:28.040
have to let you know that they're doing it.

44:28.040 --> 44:33.760
If this is just something that automatically pops up, you know, especially if they need

44:33.760 --> 44:37.560
to do consumer tracking, I don't see what the big problem is.

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
I really don't.

44:38.560 --> 44:44.560
Even, I mean, I really, I think that people are just being paranoid, really.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.880
So if you want to get your $5, go ahead, that's all you're gonna get, maybe $1.50.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.080
That's the other thing with these class action lawsuits, is that, well, you know, even though

44:52.080 --> 44:56.280
you might go, eh, GameStop's getting sued, likely they'll settle out of court, because

44:56.280 --> 45:01.100
that's the way these things tend to go, and, you know, it'll be like $2 to those that send

45:01.100 --> 45:05.800
in a form, that swear on an affidavit that their privacy was breached, or whatever, you

45:05.800 --> 45:06.800
know.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.320
It'll be interesting to see how that goes.

45:09.320 --> 45:14.680
So Marisa Congusto in our chat room says, gas stations are allowed to do this because

45:14.680 --> 45:16.480
they do not store it for marketing.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.760
We just discussed this in Business Law the other day.

45:18.760 --> 45:24.820
I don't think that they keep it for marketing either, really.

45:24.820 --> 45:28.040
We bought stuff at GameStop and never gotten, you know, offers and stuff.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.720
Yeah, I've never been, like, spammed by them, or what have you.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.680
No, you only ever got coupons and stuff when we had a subscription to Game Informer, and

45:33.680 --> 45:34.680
it came with our magazine.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.080
I am spammed by them.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.080
Are you?

45:37.080 --> 45:39.000
Did you sign up for their little card, though?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Maybe that's why.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.800
I signed up for their card, and then I get two emails from them every week, because I

45:44.800 --> 45:48.160
told them, like, I'm on your mailing list twice, you need to take me off there.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.920
Oh, okay.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
Never happened.

45:50.920 --> 45:56.400
And then I also get, oh hey, you know, you can get this special, you know, this is for

45:56.400 --> 45:59.140
GameStop, you know, people only.

45:59.140 --> 46:02.080
It's a special survey thing, you go fill out surveys and you need cash.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
It's like, stop.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.760
You're bothering me with that crap.

46:05.760 --> 46:10.240
Ramanarachatram says, when I swipe my CC to refill my Metro card, it asks for verification

46:10.240 --> 46:11.240
that I get.

46:11.240 --> 46:13.840
But not when I'm in Kmart, it asks every single time.

46:13.840 --> 46:16.000
That's not credit card protecting their polling for where people live.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.280
Yeah, Kohl's does that, too.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.800
They always ask your zip code.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.080
That is actually illegal to ask that.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.540
That's fine, it's for demographic information.

46:24.540 --> 46:25.720
That's still legal to ask that.

46:25.720 --> 46:26.720
There's actually a court case.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.200
I never said it wasn't.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.440
Can't you just say no?

46:29.440 --> 46:30.880
Yes, you can say no.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.200
And then they don't.

46:32.200 --> 46:36.320
You can tell them you don't want to give it and that can't stop them from...

46:36.320 --> 46:39.640
Most of those people that are working there anyway will just be like, all right, whatever.

46:39.640 --> 46:43.800
And they'll just, what they'll do, they'll just put in a different zip code.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.440
That's what I bet most of them do.

46:45.440 --> 46:46.440
Make up a zip code.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.880
You tell them no, they just make up a zip code.

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
Just make up a zip code.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.880
One, two, three, four, five.

46:49.880 --> 46:52.480
You know that's what's happening.

46:52.480 --> 46:56.800
Most of the people on the front lines like that don't care.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.560
I sometimes feel bad for them because then they're the ones that take the brunt of all

46:59.560 --> 47:02.960
this hatred towards the collecting and so forth.

47:02.960 --> 47:06.080
So all right, let's move on.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.360
More news.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.460
Release dates coming up at the Classic Game of the Week as well.

47:10.460 --> 47:12.180
Yeah.

47:12.180 --> 47:13.180
So this is interesting.

47:13.180 --> 47:18.320
BurgerTime HD, or as I like to call it, BurgerTime Galaxy, because that's certainly what it

47:18.320 --> 47:20.160
looks like.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.280
It's being developed, I guess, by Monkey Paw Games.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.460
It's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

47:26.460 --> 47:32.120
Wii and PC, I'm guessing, as part of their digital platforms, PlayStation Network, Xbox

47:32.120 --> 47:33.960
Live, WiiWare.

47:33.960 --> 47:43.200
And they're introducing new monsters, or I guess carrots, Apple Cores, hot peppers, oversized

47:43.200 --> 47:46.160
monsters and other fun stuff.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.400
They actually had some video online of it.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.400
Looks interesting though.

47:49.400 --> 47:53.160
You can actually play it multiplayer, split screen, which is kind of cool.

47:53.160 --> 47:56.960
But yeah, it definitely looks like BurgerTime Galaxy.

47:56.960 --> 48:00.520
Interesting.

48:00.520 --> 48:03.280
I do love me some BurgerTime, the old school 80s machine.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.920
Did you see the video of it?

48:04.920 --> 48:06.920
I haven't actually watched it yet.

48:06.920 --> 48:07.920
Is it on YouTube?

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
Uh, no.

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
Let's check this out.

48:09.920 --> 48:14.900
I'm going to pull it up here real quick for you.

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
We need to be more prepared.

48:15.900 --> 48:17.400
Let me see if I can find it here on YouTube.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.400
There it is!

48:18.400 --> 48:20.100
BurgerTime HD Level Complete Gameplay.

48:20.100 --> 48:21.400
Let's take a look at this here.

48:21.400 --> 48:29.600
Holy moly!

48:29.600 --> 48:33.200
It's like running around this 3D looking circle thing.

48:33.200 --> 48:39.600
All the levels have been changed into this giant cylinder.

48:39.600 --> 48:44.760
It's a very different look for the game, but it's kind of the same damn game.

48:44.760 --> 48:45.760
At least at first glance.

48:45.760 --> 48:51.760
Oh, well there's this co-op thing going on, it's not the same game in my life.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.760
Very interesting.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.200
BurgerTime Galaxy.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.960
I do see where you get in BurgerTime Galaxy, absolutely.

48:56.960 --> 49:04.840
That looks like it could be interesting.

49:04.840 --> 49:08.760
Sorry for the ambient noise, it's somebody filming a screen that's probably a game developer's

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
conference or something.

49:09.760 --> 49:10.760
I'm sure it is.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.760
But, um, interesting.

49:12.760 --> 49:13.760
Huh.

49:13.760 --> 49:17.240
I'll have to look at the demo for that when that comes out.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.760
That was an old school 80s game I really liked.

49:19.760 --> 49:21.520
I'm curious how the co-op works.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.920
That's something else.

49:22.920 --> 49:23.920
You guys want to see it?

49:23.920 --> 49:27.960
I just typed BurgerTime HD into YouTube and it came right up.

49:27.960 --> 49:32.200
Alright, speaking of guilty pleasure games, this is one of my biggest guilty pleasure

49:32.200 --> 49:35.480
games ever and it's been so long since I've played one of these games.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.680
Mortal Kombat.

49:36.680 --> 49:41.560
That's right, Mortal Kombat 9, or really it's the reboot, just Mortal Kombat, is coming

49:41.560 --> 49:42.560
out soon.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.600
My god, it's April 19th.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.640
I didn't realize it was that soon.

49:46.640 --> 49:47.640
That's my birthday.

49:47.640 --> 49:48.960
You know what to get me.

49:48.960 --> 49:50.040
It's pretty crazy how soon it's coming out.

49:50.040 --> 49:53.120
I just kind of forgot that was on its way out, but yeah, it's coming out.

49:53.120 --> 49:56.640
It's coming out on April 19th, but if you want to get your hands on it a little bit

49:56.640 --> 50:01.960
sooner you'll be able to play a demo next week, March 8th, by the time some of you guys

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
hear this.

50:02.960 --> 50:03.960
Here's the catch.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.320
You've got to be a PlayStation Plus member because they are the ones that are getting

50:06.320 --> 50:08.760
the demo first.

50:08.760 --> 50:13.680
You'll be able to play a Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, and Johnny Cage in the living forest

50:13.680 --> 50:15.360
or the fire pit.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.420
So that's not bad.

50:17.420 --> 50:21.240
Most fighting game demos only have two characters, so it's kind of neat that they have four.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.320
So there you go.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.640
One or two players.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.520
I'm imagining not online though.

50:25.520 --> 50:30.420
The other cool news is that not just the demo on March 8th for PlayStation Plus, but everybody

50:30.420 --> 50:32.540
will get it March 15th.

50:32.540 --> 50:36.080
So if you're like, I don't really want to sign up for PlayStation Plus, you can just

50:36.080 --> 50:38.840
wait one more week and you'll be able to get it there.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.520
Oh, I should say this though, that is only on PlayStation Network.

50:42.520 --> 50:47.320
They do not have a firm date for when Xbox Live is getting it, just later.

50:47.320 --> 50:53.280
Hmm, could be a lot closer to the game's release in that regard, so very curious about that.

50:53.280 --> 50:56.800
By the way, also a small follow-up on Mortal Kombat 9.

50:56.800 --> 51:02.180
I don't know if you guys heard, but it was banned in Australia because they refused to

51:02.180 --> 51:03.180
rate the game.

51:03.180 --> 51:07.200
When they refused to rate a game, that basically means that the game is banned.

51:07.200 --> 51:12.440
Well, the publishers behind Mortal Kombat, they are appealing this decision.

51:12.440 --> 51:17.040
We'll see just how far they get with it, so.

51:17.040 --> 51:19.120
We'll see before the game's release.

51:19.120 --> 51:22.520
Either way, it's probably going to end up getting delayed in Australia.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.440
Probably a lot of people are just going to import the damn thing from somewhere else.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.680
I'll probably be out there.

51:26.680 --> 51:30.000
Even though that's supposed to be illegal as well, I don't see them exactly banging

51:30.000 --> 51:33.280
down doors because people got bootleg copies of Mortal Kombat.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.280
So we'll see what happens.

51:34.280 --> 51:38.120
And then in fact if you bootleg, I'm sure that you can, you know, just import it.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.360
Most of those games are region-free.

51:39.360 --> 51:44.920
I don't mean like actual bootlegs, I mean like, you know, yeah, PlayStation 3 is region-free.

51:44.920 --> 51:48.200
So there'll probably be lots of people just hitting up Amazon or something, getting a

51:48.200 --> 51:50.880
friend in the US to buy it and then ship it to them.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.620
There you go.

51:53.620 --> 51:57.720
So also on Mortal Kombat, one other thing, I remember reading a story about this this

51:57.720 --> 52:01.480
week, I wanted to throw this out there, is that there's this whole challenge mode in

52:01.480 --> 52:02.480
it too.

52:02.480 --> 52:04.880
And I remember watching a video for it on YouTube and they were all talking, all excited

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
about this.

52:05.880 --> 52:09.880
Where I guess like 300 levels and they say you get something super special if you get

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
all the way to the end.

52:10.880 --> 52:13.600
I'm assuming you unlock a bonus character or something, that's just my assumption.

52:13.600 --> 52:17.460
But it's like all these cool modifiers, like there's some modifiers like Headless Combat

52:17.460 --> 52:23.240
where you fight with no head, kind of reminds me of some old tacky fighting games.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.760
Upside down mode, where the image is flipped upside down and that's how you have to play.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.240
I just thought it was kind of funny.

52:30.240 --> 52:33.880
So 300 levels though, that might be overkill, I don't know about that.

52:33.880 --> 52:38.240
That's going to take a serious investment to get through, but we'll see.

52:38.240 --> 52:41.280
Moving on, Dark Soccer's got a story for us, then we're going to get to release dates.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.400
I do, of course I do.

52:44.400 --> 52:52.400
Game, which is a UK retailer, well they're going to be doing pre-orders for used games.

52:52.400 --> 52:57.680
Yeah, they're going to be taking orders for games that people haven't bought yet.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.640
But for when they're used.

52:59.640 --> 53:00.640
Does that make sense?

53:00.640 --> 53:05.600
Because I think I might have drunk a little too much chamois and it's baffling me.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.240
It actually kind of does.

53:07.240 --> 53:12.300
There's a lot of people that wait to buy it used to just save the $5 because it's cheaper,

53:12.300 --> 53:13.520
you know.

53:13.520 --> 53:15.120
I could see this.

53:15.120 --> 53:19.520
There's some people that sell back their games fast too.

53:19.520 --> 53:23.360
Like you know I picked up Tron Evolution like maybe a week after it was out, now I realize

53:23.360 --> 53:27.360
why someone sold it back so quick, but you know, some games you can get pretty quick

53:27.360 --> 53:28.360
that way.

53:28.360 --> 53:29.360
Well once they already have on...

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
Game Crazy fucking did that for free.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.840
Wait, wait, wait, oh Dan, you got to say that on the air, hold on Dan.

53:33.840 --> 53:35.700
What's that Dan?

53:35.700 --> 53:37.600
Game Crazy fucking did that for free.

53:37.600 --> 53:38.600
How so?

53:38.600 --> 53:39.600
Like you just could put your name on a list?

53:39.600 --> 53:43.600
Like you could come in and say, hey, can you give me a call when this game comes in used?

53:43.600 --> 53:45.120
And they did it.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.120
But they went out of business.

53:46.120 --> 53:48.480
And why did they go out of business?

53:48.480 --> 53:52.680
Because Hollywood Entertainment sucked.

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
Sorry to hear it.

53:53.680 --> 53:58.600
At any rate, some of the games on the list already are Crisis 2, Homefront Dragon Age

53:58.600 --> 54:05.160
2, Shift 2 Unleashed, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12.

54:05.160 --> 54:09.160
So yeah, you can pay 5 pounds and save a game that's not out yet.

54:09.160 --> 54:14.400
Which we'll just go to show you, game stores will take your $5 for anything.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.960
Someone probably had that copy, or when it comes out, they probably got that copy, so

54:17.960 --> 54:19.440
this game sucks.

54:19.440 --> 54:23.960
And you know, spanked over it or something, and then took it back, and then you get the

54:23.960 --> 54:28.040
spank version.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.400
You get it christened with the love of another man.

54:30.400 --> 54:34.560
Be careful though, this could be one of those games that you can't sell back.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.400
Like DC Universe Online, one unique key.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.920
So be careful what you pre-order used.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.420
I think they've got a specific list for it.

54:43.420 --> 54:46.640
Game Guru in our chat room says, oh great, GameStop is going to push pre-orders of used

54:46.640 --> 54:47.640
games now?

54:47.640 --> 54:50.960
No, no, no, this is game in the UK.

54:50.960 --> 54:57.560
However, you know if it does well for them, it'll just get copied by everybody else.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.040
That's how these things go.

54:59.040 --> 55:02.960
Look at charging for bags on airlines.

55:02.960 --> 55:06.980
A couple of them did it first, and everybody does it, except those that want to use it

55:06.980 --> 55:10.640
as a marketing point that they don't charge for it, like the Jet Blues and Southwest of

55:10.640 --> 55:11.640
the world.

55:11.640 --> 55:15.680
Alright, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and games that

55:15.680 --> 55:17.720
are coming out real soon.

55:17.720 --> 55:22.640
Yes, actually today Pokemon Black and White came out, so that's pretty exciting if you're

55:22.640 --> 55:24.280
a fan of the Pokemans.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.600
Which there are some real rabid fans of Pokemon out there that are over the age of 30.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.300
As on the Nintendo DS.

55:31.300 --> 55:34.760
This week actually we have a new Kinect game, U-Star 2 in the movies.

55:34.760 --> 55:41.120
Remember U-Star was that camera green screen system that they were selling on TV that only

55:41.120 --> 55:43.040
worked with PC at one point.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.840
Wasn't there already a crappy game like that on 360 that had the vision camera, like you

55:46.840 --> 55:48.240
in the movies or something?

55:48.240 --> 55:50.760
Yeah, yeah, that was a little different though.

55:50.760 --> 55:55.320
That was more of like you're doing mini games and then it puts you into the game, or the

55:55.320 --> 55:57.360
movie, it makes a little short film.

55:57.360 --> 56:01.360
This is actually, it's like karaoke for movie lines.

56:01.360 --> 56:06.880
Basically you recite movie lines and you can play different people in there and it will

56:06.880 --> 56:12.960
actually kind of crop the actor or actress out of the scene and it'll put you in their

56:12.960 --> 56:19.320
place and so you can get scored for accuracy and stuff like that.

56:19.320 --> 56:23.720
It's neat I guess and there's certainly not a lot of Kinect games coming out.

56:23.720 --> 56:28.120
That's on Playstation 3 for the Kinect, or I'm sorry, the Playstation 3 with move support.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.600
You do need the Playstation Eye camera though if you want to play that and then of course

56:32.600 --> 56:36.600
on Xbox 360 for the Kinect.

56:36.600 --> 56:39.400
Let's see, some other stuff this week.

56:39.400 --> 56:44.560
Dragon Age 2 coming out this week, that's on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360, that's

56:44.560 --> 56:46.400
a pretty big game.

56:46.400 --> 56:52.920
On the Wii, the One Million Dollar Pyramid, yet another TV show game.

56:52.920 --> 56:59.560
A couple MLB games this week, MLB 2011 The Show, that's on Playstation 2, PS3, and the

56:59.560 --> 57:01.480
Playstation Portable.

57:01.480 --> 57:12.320
Also MLB 2K11 on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP I believe.

57:12.320 --> 57:20.120
Pets Bunnies Bunch on Nintendo DS, I guess gearing up for Easter.

57:20.120 --> 57:22.480
What the hell is this?

57:22.480 --> 57:28.200
Beastly Frantic Photo?

57:28.200 --> 57:33.720
I think this is some sort of stupid application that ties into that crappy movie Beastly.

57:33.720 --> 57:37.320
I was going to say, there was a movie with Vanessa Hudgens that came out called Beastly.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.120
Yeah, I think that's what this is.

57:39.120 --> 57:42.160
I have not heard of that, but that's kind of funny.

57:42.160 --> 57:47.600
Yep, I think it's some sort of photo game, and it looks like crap.

57:47.600 --> 57:50.320
So it's Vanessa Hudgens Snap?

57:50.320 --> 57:54.280
It might be, I'm actually, oh they have a trailer for the movie, I don't really care

57:54.280 --> 57:56.280
about that.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.800
Alright, moving on.

57:58.800 --> 58:01.000
Is Beastly like a knockoff of Twilight?

58:01.000 --> 58:05.600
No, it's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.

58:05.600 --> 58:08.240
Oh, okay.

58:08.240 --> 58:11.240
We're talking like a Beauty and the Beast that's going to be more like the old school

58:11.240 --> 58:13.240
TV show of Linda Hamilton, right?

58:13.240 --> 58:14.240
No.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.240
That show is the shit.

58:15.240 --> 58:19.360
A modern day retelling of the fairy tale, but not with the underground community.

58:19.360 --> 58:24.880
The guy is suddenly turned ugly by some witch girl, and he has to stay in his expensive

58:24.880 --> 58:26.020
penthouse.

58:26.020 --> 58:27.400
So no, be our guest.

58:27.400 --> 58:28.400
Be our guest.

58:28.400 --> 58:32.920
No, it's less song and dance, more emo.

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
He turns emo.

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
I see.

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
So it is a little bit Twilight-inspired.

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
Ah, yeah.

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
Aren't they all?

58:37.920 --> 58:40.920
Do they sparkle?

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
Yeah.

58:41.920 --> 58:44.840
Just like how, you know, Little Red Riding Hood, I don't remember werewolves being in

58:44.840 --> 58:45.840
Little Red Riding Hood.

58:45.840 --> 58:49.460
I could be, it's been a while since I heard Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't remember

58:49.460 --> 58:52.760
werewolves being in there, and I don't think emo people were in there as well.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.240
Now they're making emo Snow White, too.

58:54.240 --> 59:01.040
Come on, the original Little Red Riding Hood, she gets eaten by the wolf, and gets digested

59:01.040 --> 59:02.680
and dies.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.200
Awesome.

59:04.200 --> 59:07.080
As should those types of movies.

59:07.080 --> 59:10.680
Atari's Greatest Hits Volume 2 on the Nintendo DS coming out this week.

59:10.680 --> 59:15.880
Phantom Brave, Heroes of the Her-Muda Triangle for the PSP, another Atlus game.

59:15.880 --> 59:17.160
Not the Ber-Muda!

59:17.160 --> 59:18.160
The Her-Muda.

59:18.160 --> 59:19.160
Her-Muda.

59:19.160 --> 59:20.160
Like, hermaphrodite.

59:20.160 --> 59:28.080
Um, let's see here, also, um, what else we got here?

59:28.080 --> 59:34.680
Sims 3 Barnacle Bay on PC, in case you want to get your pirate on, um, for the Sims 3

59:34.680 --> 59:35.680
there.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.680
Yeah.

59:36.680 --> 59:41.720
And then some crappy Wii games, Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing, and Maximum Racing Dragon

59:41.720 --> 59:44.000
Sword, and just don't even bother, seriously.

59:44.000 --> 59:49.800
And then, because, and I gotta go in the rant mode about this, but, I'm sorry, but like,

59:49.800 --> 59:50.800
here we go.

59:50.800 --> 59:56.800
Just because Nintendo is so gracious for everybody, for a limited time, and this is the last time

59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.000
that they're reprinting this, game from the Super Nintendo, Super Mario All-Stars will

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.160
be coming out one week from today, the limited edition, oh my god limited, going on eBay

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.440
for $80 because, oh my god, I've never played a game that was on the Super Nintendo on the

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:16.000
Wii, um, that is coming out once again on the Wii, get it now, before it goes away forever.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.400
Um, seriously, if you buy this you're stupid.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.440
I'm sorry, you are stupid.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:27.720
That's right, stupid.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.080
Just spend the money on the virtual console, better yet, just buy the freakin' Super Nintendo

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080
on the original game.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.240
I mean, you don't need this limited soundtrack and a little art book, I mean, come on.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.440
I just think your rants are funnier with Mario Bros. music in the background.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
That's, that's fine.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:49.360
But yeah, so, um, that's what we have coming out this week, but seriously though!

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.120
They, they are taking you guys for fools, I mean, $30 for a Super Nintendo game.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.120
What's next, okay?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.880
We're gonna have, like, Game Boy Advance, you know, Mario Land or something, they're

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.840
gonna put no new color in it, they're not gonna do shit to it, in fact they're not even

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:10.240
gonna change, you know, um, aren't all those gonna be coming on the 3DS virtual, the virtual

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240
console, actually?

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.600
Yeah, they're not doing shit to them, nothing, nothing at all, and they're gonna charge tons

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600
of money for that.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.920
You know what you can buy a Game Boy for nowadays?

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.680
Probably 30 bucks, including that stupid, uh, probably even less than that, you probably

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.860
can find them dirt cheap, at a garage sale.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.120
People don't even know what they are, they're trying to get rid of them.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.520
I mean, just don't, don't, don't feed the beast.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520
Don't.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.020
It's a very beastly week in US releases, apparently.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.680
You're just encouraging them.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.040
All your, the message that you're sending loud and clear to Nintendo is, we like your

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.000
old shit, please bring it back and charge us a lot of money for it, that's all that

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
they're doing.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And you know what, people are dumb, because they're like, ooh, Mario must buy, Mario must

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
buy!

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:05.640
I mean, they can put out, like, Mario teaches, like, brain surgery or something like that.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:10.920
Mario's a wonderful douche, you know, and people would buy it, because it's got Mario

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.080
in it.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.320
Are you done?

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.600
I guess.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.680
Are you done with releases?

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.680
Oh, I'm done.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680
I'm done with Nintendo.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.680
Oh, okay, alright.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:31.440
Let's, let's move on to the Japanese release dates, and we'll start off with Xbox 360 releases.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.360
Um, I thought this was a game at first, but I did more research on it.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:38.640
This is interesting, it's a title called Cross Channel in Memory of All People comes out

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.640
this week on the Xbox 360.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.280
This has actually come out before, and it's a visual novel, so it's not really a game,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.800
it's this game novel thing that's been ported, it's been on the PS2, Windows, PSP, all this

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.880
stuff before.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.660
It is coming out on the Xbox 360 as well now, with some extra stuff.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:00.040
So it's, I guess, I don't even know if it's like an interactive anime or anything, but

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
who knows.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.400
So yeah, that is coming out this week.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.880
Probably nothing that'll ever see the light of day over here, I gotta be honest.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.500
But I have heard something about an English translation patch on some of the other versions,

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:13.080
for those that are into it.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:18.200
On the PlayStation 3 coming out this week, there's an all-new console coming out in Japan

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.200
this week.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.260
I think it is a satin silver model, I'm not sure what is coming out to kind of drive the

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:25.260
sales of that.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.680
I know that Heavy Rain is getting a price reduction over there, and there is Shin Sangoku

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.880
Musou 6 comes out this week as well.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.560
That's from Koei, is this Dynasty Warriors 6, is that what this is?

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.320
That would, I believe, be Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.920
Ah, it is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you're right, Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.000
Maybe that's what necessitates the new console.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I don't know.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.640
Remember, if you hear Sangoku, then it's Three Kingdoms.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.720
You think after nine years of this show, I would understand at least a couple words in

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.120
Japanese by now, but no.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.600
Actually, I don't, ichimi sanshi, I can count to four.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600
Awesome.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.080
Ah, nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, does that really surprise anybody?

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.680
But on the Nintendo 3DS this week, because that's already out there, on the 10th, Ash

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.200
Vault 3D Nitro Racing comes out this week from Konami.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.280
That is on the release date for the 3DS this week.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.040
And lastly, on the PSP this week, there's a few games, Deer Drops Distortion comes out

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:29.240
this week, Fairy Tail Portable Guild 2, and Rurouni Kenshin Meiji Kenkaku Ramatan Saisen

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.720
comes out from Namco Bandai this week.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.320
What the crap are they doing another Kenshin game for?

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.880
Because the public demands it?

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880
I don't know.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.480
But there you go, that does it for your Japanese releases.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.440
Well, for the UK, we have a few things.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:50.120
On the 9th is Torchlight, and then on the 11th we have Brunswick Pro Bowling, oooh,

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:57.000
Dragon Age 2, Home Front, and U-Star 2, and that's it.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.720
Alright.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.360
Let's move on with some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.320
Oh boy, can't wait for this next story.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.640
Loki, take it away.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.680
Now actually, just to go back real quick about my complaining about All-Stars, I mean seriously,

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.840
this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so let's just step backwards with this game.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.440
Look at Smash Bros., once again, Smash Bros. Brawl, perfect example, that's how you treat

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.080
a franchise as far as nostalgia purposes.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.920
They had demos for virtual console games on there for some of the old stuff.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:37.960
They had at the very least done that, you know, hey, guess what, you beat Mario, Super

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:44.360
Mario Bros., and the remade version, you unlock the NES version or something like that.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.560
I don't understand, well I understand why they do it now, because they want people to

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:54.680
buy it on the virtual console, but man, they were so much more giving on the GameCube than

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.480
they were on the Wii.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:01.000
I mean, remember all those, like, oh hey, you can unlock the Game Boy version of, or

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.720
you can unlock the Super Nintendo version of Metroid?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.320
Or freaking Animal Crossing, which was so badass, like that was the whole reason all

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:12.160
of us bought it, was because you could unlock all the old NES games in it, and then it was

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.720
like, hey, and the game itself is actually pretty sweet.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.000
Animal Crossing is seriously one of the best games that's come out in the past ten years.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.400
Honestly, it really is.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.120
And we're talking the original.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.120
Not any of the original.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120
Not any of the re-releases.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:28.840
But the original is one of my favorite games to have come out in the past ten years, easily.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.720
Another perfect example, I might add, of a game that Nintendo has done absolutely nothing

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.320
with, nothing, absolutely nothing with, from game to game.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.920
How much really have they changed from each sequel?

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920
Nothing.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.440
It's basically the same damn game presented in a slightly different way.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.720
And I mean very slight.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.360
And most of the times, it's not a good way.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.200
I mean, come on, we're seriously, we're just encouraging this crap.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.040
So you got some Nintendo news to report for us, Loki?

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.600
Yes, yes.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:00.600
Goodie.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.640
Anyways, so, we've got some interesting stuff, of course.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.840
This is all from Game Developers Conference, we're talking a little bit about the 3DS,

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:16.740
and some neat stuff, I guess, but I mean, once again, you can't read too much into this

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:23.920
because, I don't know, for example, the first part we have here, apparently the 3DS will

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.880
have access to 10,000 AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots by late May.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.680
Why not at launch?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.680
I don't know.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.680
But whatever.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680
Late May.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.520
So, that's neat that they're embracing- Is that like all the airports?

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520
I guess.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.760
It's gotta be like some restaurants have them.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.200
I don't know, where do you find AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots, I guess just miscellaneous restaurants

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.200
and so forth.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.640
So, I know that when they're selling you on their internet and stuff there, but you get

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.880
access to all these for free as well.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880
Big whoop.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.440
Is that how they're gonna deliver the patches without asking?

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:00.120
If you take your 3DS out in public, it finds an AT&T Wi-Fi hotspot, all of a sudden, whoop,

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.120
patch.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.120
They don't, no.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.640
They do, you have to agree to apply the patches, because I actually saw they had a patch for

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:15.280
the 3DS in Japan, and there's a notification you get, hey, there's a patch, download it.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.840
So that's neat and all that, they're gonna have access to these Wi-Fi hotspots, but once

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:27.160
again, unless they're doing a lot with it, I just don't see the point.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.460
It sounds good, but really, what's intended doing with their online stuff?

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.960
It's kind of yet to be seen.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.200
It's their way of saying, we don't have 3GS, but you'll be able to get online in public

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.560
at all these places.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.360
That's what it says to me.

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:49.040
And then, of course, the 3DS Virtual Consoles basically getting all the portable platforms

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.000
on top of, I believe, Game Boy and Game Boy Color, they're getting Game Gear, and Turbo

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.040
Graphics 16 games, because it's funny, because, well, Turbo Graphics 16 played the actual

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.680
console games on the handheld, so you're gonna be getting those games.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.240
Oh yeah, Jamie loves those games.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.240
Yeah, I've got one of those.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.240
Yeah.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.240
Turbo Express.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.240
Yeah.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.800
The whole NGP joke with the Neo Geo Pocket comes full, or no, I'm, nah, never mind, because

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.800
Turbo Graphics.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.800
Not a Neo Geo.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800
Fail.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800
But...

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.920
But maybe in the future.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:24.920
Who knows?

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.120
And I understand, it's coming late May.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.680
Why stop there?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680
Why stop there?

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.800
You have a Virtual Console, you have Virtual Console stuff already out there for, like,

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.240
Nintendo, Super Nintendo stuff.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:42.080
Don't tell me this system can't play Nintendo games, or Genesis games, or Sega Master System,

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.600
Sega Master System games.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.920
Once again, this could be an open marketplace, like the iOS platforms, or Steam, or something

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.320
like that, where you can have a bunch of games on there, ripe for the picking, so people

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.160
can go, oh my god, you know, I love playing the original Mario Brothers, or I love playing

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:07.320
Mario Kart 64, or something like that, on my Wii, I wanna take it with me, oh damn,

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.320
I have to buy it again.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.680
That's okay, because I love Nintendo, and I'll buy whatever they put out.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:13.680
Such a missed opportunity.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.960
They only have these portable games coming out for it.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.960
I mean, come on.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:25.360
It's so frustrating, that they could easily do this, but, nope, nope, sorry, we're not

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.900
gonna do that right now, whoa, but we may announce it later on, and people will be so

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:36.000
grateful that we've, you know, allowed them to repurchase our game again, ha ha ha.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.280
So yeah, that'll be coming out later on.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:47.300
I don't know, it's just, it's so frustrating, because they're just dumb.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:52.500
And yeah, late May, so if you buy your system, you know, when it comes out at launch, just

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:58.120
know that you're not gonna actually have access to their little service to purchase virtual

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.400
console games.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.200
Nice.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.300
And then also they're saying via the system update, you're gonna get some other online

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:10.080
features that they were touting, the DSiWare service, of course, the ability to transfer

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:16.080
DSiWare games from the DSi or DSi XL to your system, the web browser, and of course the

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.200
eShop, which will include the whole virtual console stuff.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.940
So let me get this straight.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:30.480
Your console's not done, because that's what it sounds like to me, that you don't have

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:36.120
one of the advertised features, web browser and all that stuff, at launch.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.840
So your console's not done.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.840
It's not ready.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.200
You're releasing it too early, is what it sounds like.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.000
And that might explain why you don't have enough games out for it, because you wanna

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.680
push this thing out to pad your fiscal year numbers.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680
Is that it?

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.880
Because it's coming out the very end of the month, or the very end of their fiscal year?

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.140
Interesting.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:01.840
And then of course, they're also so gracious to allow us to record video with the 3D camera,

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:08.740
which I gotta admit is kinda cool, and it's definitely something that is popular.

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.960
That is pretty cool.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.240
But once again, can I share these videos with my friends?

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.280
Can I email you a 3D video they shot?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.040
Can I do anything with that?

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.360
Once again, I don't know, because they haven't said, and great, I shot a 3D video of me doing

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.960
something.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.680
If I can't share that with anybody, it doesn't matter.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:34.800
And I guess, I don't know if I could anyways, because with all their online stuff being

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.320
disabled until May, I don't know.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.920
I'm curious about your thoughts on this comment in our chatroom at chat.orangishunterday.com.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:47.440
Akuma JP says, I think it's just Nintendo can't do so many stuff in that short time.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.040
Maybe they really have kind of rushed this thing out, and maybe they are kind of putting

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:57.160
something out that they are still trying to develop as it goes.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.640
I definitely think it's that.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.280
And I think that they did the exact same thing with, well they did the exact same thing with

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.720
the Wii, because they had a member of the web browser, I believe didn't come out right

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:08.720
away.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.400
It got released later on, it wasn't too later on, I mean we are only talking like a month

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:25.600
or two for this online shop thing, but it's just, if they had it ready to go at launch,

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:32.520
they could be making so much, it's time wasted and money lost, because they could be selling

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.520
a bunch of stuff.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.640
And the fact that they are just like, yeah you know, we are just not going to put virtual

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.400
console games on there because, I don't know.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.780
I don't know why they are not putting virtual, like actual virtual console stuff that's on

01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.960
there for the Wii.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.680
Why don't they put Nintendo games or Super Nintendo games, they have all this stuff already

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.040
done, it's already ready to go, and maybe they have to convert it over to something

01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.080
special or redo it for the 3DS maybe.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.120
But I mean come on, we are talking like emulators here, it can't be that difficult to port this

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.120
stuff over.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.080
I mean come on, if the homebrew community can do it on the Game Boy Advance and the

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:18.720
Nintendo DS, and this thing does support Nintendo DS games, it should be able to do this.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:25.120
It should have no problem doing this whatsoever, unless they are going to do something cool,

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.640
because they said that, oh hey we are going to release, I don't know, some new games or

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:34.800
games with 3D support or something like that.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.940
That may be the gimmick that they are going to do, hey look it's Super Mario Brothers

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.720
in 3D or something.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.380
Why aren't they releasing Virtual Boy games for this?

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:48.920
It makes perfect sense that they would have Virtual Boy games on the 3DS.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.800
They may have all sucked, but still though, there's a lot of games that they released

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:57.800
on the Virtual Console that did suck, but still a lot of people haven't gotten a chance

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:02.920
to play them because that console is out for such a short amount of time.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:13.400
And then lastly, apparently almost all DSiWare games will be available at the 3DS eShop launch,

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.040
and then of course they have some limits as far as the transfers and stuff.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:23.880
It says, of course we've got Virtual Console games, anything that is rendered in 3D, converted

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:31.400
into 3D is called a 3D Classic, so they are going to have some converted games I guess.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.160
And it said that, I guess downloadable games will be under the eShop banner.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:44.160
They're saying that pretty much the whole DSiWare lineup will be available at launch,

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.600
there may be a few exceptions, but the majority of all the games will come over, a few games

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:55.320
are being left off the 3DS's eShop for undisclosed reasons.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.520
So they're saying it's not the number of transferred games, it would be the same, they're saying

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:11.720
that the transfer feature will be coming in late May, and it would be the same game, the

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.280
number of times you can transfer it from device to device, so if you build up a large category

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:22.200
of DSiWare games, you won't be penalized just how many times you can move it, move that

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.760
same group of games, there will be a limit on it.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.360
So I guess they're not saying the amount of games, there's not going to be a limit on

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:33.080
the amount of games you can move over, but how many times you can move it, so that's

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.080
it.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:45.720
And if they were nice, which they're not, they would also allow you to do that same

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.080
kind of transfer thing with the Wii and the Virtual Console stuff that you downloaded,

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.240
whether or not.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:58.480
To be fair, I mean, Microsoft allows you to transfer it once a year, and I don't even

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.100
know Sony's thing, Sony's pretty locked down, aren't they?

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:06.320
You can transfer, actually you can transfer it quite a few times, because they have people

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320
sharing stuff.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.240
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.240
And that's per game.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:20.000
I don't know, it's, whatever, you know, it is what it is.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.520
There's going to be a lot of disappointing stuff, I think, as far as how they support

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520
their online stuff.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:30.320
And you know what, it's unfortunately just, they could be making a lot more money than

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.320
they are.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.840
If that's really what they're concerned about, and making people happy and stuff, they could

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.920
do it really easy.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.400
They're just not.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:43.840
Alright, well, let's move on from all the 3DS talk.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.080
Although I am still excited about the 3D video, but I think you make a point, they gotta let

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080
you share it.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.280
But here's something that a lot of people are also very excited about.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.720
That feature alone makes the device worth a lot more than I think it is.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.680
And maybe that's why they're trying to rush it out, too, is because they want to get ahead

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.360
of a lot of those cameras that are out there on the marketplace that are very expensive

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.360
right now.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.840
You know, they're trying to maybe get the jump on that, I don't know.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840
Cheap alternative, who knows.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.280
Anyhow, I want to mention this, because a lot of folks are excited about this.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:16.400
The game Catherine, which is coming out overseas, it is also coming out in the US, summer of

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400
2011.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.000
It is coming out this summer, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.280
There's a preview site already up.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.580
You can pre-order the game on Amazon.com.

01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.160
What makes this game so special?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.180
Well, it's a little bit dirty.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.980
It's more of one of those erotic thrillers.

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:35.980
So a lot of folks were very excited about this in Japan, because, you know, it's a little

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:39.280
bit naughty, and folks were planning on importing it.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.720
And now that it's coming out over here, a lot of people are like, what, this game's

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.720
coming out over here?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:49.960
I don't think we know all the details exactly on what's sanitized yet, but give it time.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.920
I'm sure that's details they want to keep under wraps until a little close to the release

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.920
date.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.520
But some folks are still very excited about the release of that game.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.200
All right, since that game is coming out in a couple months, let's talk about something

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.480
that's coming out a long time ago.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.120
It's the classic game of the week.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.400
We like to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a classic video game that's been

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.120
out for years and years, and it's something that maybe you should be checking out.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.680
Dark Soccer's going to step into the vault and find a game.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.760
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.520
Classic game of the week is Willow, and before people say, you've done Willow before!

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.800
This is a different Willow.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.400
It is the side-scrolling arcade version of Willow.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.400
Yay!

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.920
So not the NES arcade game, er, not the NES RPG game, many people remember, that you have

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.920
done before.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:39.920
This is the arcade version.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.320
It was released by Capcom in the arcade, and it's freaking hard.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:53.640
So basically, this one's a platformer, and it has six stages where Willow gets to go

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:59.440
kick some butt, and sometimes you can play Mad Mardigan, and you basically, it's its

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.600
typical platformer, left or right to move, press the A button to use a weapon, you can

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.280
hold it down and fire charged shots, you've got a magic power gauge, you have a B button

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:16.880
to jump, and you can go up ledges and do all kinds of stuff, you can climb down them, and

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:24.560
you can open chests, and you can get gold and buy items from the Owl Mage, and buy all

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.040
kinds of stuff, including a life pack, and a 1-up, and information.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.240
But it's pretty hard.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:45.800
I love the music in it, though, can you play a little bit of that, Rob?

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.760
Isn't that good?

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:56.760
It's a really pretty game, too, and the only version that was out was the arcade one.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:21:02.160
It was a CPS1 game, um, pretty much you could fight a giant rat.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.440
That was pretty fun.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:15.200
Um, it is, uh, you know, unlike the NES version, which was an adventure RPG, and, uh...

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.560
Which is weird, because Capcom did them both.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560
Yeah.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:23.160
Well, I think that Capcom was notorious for bringing out different versions of games that

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:28.280
were one thing in the arcade, but did them different for the NES.

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.000
You know what this game looks a lot like is Magic Sword, actually, so I'm really surprised

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.920
I've never played this before.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.560
Because there's a lot, like, just watching this, there's a lot in common with Magic Sword.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.560
This is very interesting to me.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.760
Well, it's just that whole side-scrolling thing, but, I mean, pretty much, I mean, it's

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:47.760
really gorgeous.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:55.600
You've got all the story elements, you even have, like, the monsters from the, uh, uh...

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.400
From the, uh, movie, and pretty cool cinematic, you know, area series, but it's just gorgeous

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.080
artwork in it.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.360
And basically, like, in the first- Ah, scary-looking Val Kilmer, sorry.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:09.360
Yeah.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.360
Ah!

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:19.560
Well, and his, uh, weapon is kinda like, uh, the cipher from Strider, but, uh, it can be

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:25.440
charged up and increases range and potency, and basically, uh, you can also, uh, you can

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.800
also get, uh, buy swords when you, you know, stop in the shop.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.720
And, uh, it's just really cool, although he's got, like, very pretty boy-looking features

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.600
when he plays with him.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.600
Mad Marduken, that is.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.600
Very, very brown here.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.600
And Lilloo just looks adorable.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:50.120
But yeah, it's, it's a, it's a fun game, pretty tough, but lots of fun.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.120
Alright.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.800
There it is.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.400
The classic video game of the week for the arcades, not the NES.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.400
Willow.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:04.640
A very Magic Sword-esque kinda game, but with a bitchin' movie franchise behind it.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.320
Although I gotta admit, I always like the, uh, video game way better than I like the

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.320
movie.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.320
That's just me.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.280
Alright, anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.400
There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:18.240
When we come back for part B, we're gonna be talking about dev kits for the Kinect.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.920
Yes, it could be really happening.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:26.280
Super Tag's being freed up, and a classic, classic PC game making its way to the iOS

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.280
system.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.360
So we're gonna talk all about that when we come back from a break here with more of Orange

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:38.040
Lounge Radio.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.760
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:48.440
We are live on this Sunday, March the 6th of 2011 for the 404th episode of our podcast.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:49.440
We 404'd.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.440
That's right.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:55.040
We didn't make enough 404 jokes in the opening, but yes, it is episode 404 of our show.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.400
But we are here, and we're not missing anyone this week like we were last week.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.640
Maybe last week would have been a better 404, at least as far as Loki's concerned.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.640
But he's back.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.480
We're all back and talking about games.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:07.880
We're gonna get into some rapid-fire news in just a minute, but first, some plugs for

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:10.660
some other shows that Dark Soccer and myself work on.

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:13.160
If you like Orange Lounge Radio, you might just like these shows too.

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.200
We have Comic Insanity, which goes live every Tuesday at Infamous.net.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.480
It's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.520
We are awesome.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:29.320
It's me and Maron Marvel and Dan Shadow, and we're pretty geeky, pretty comicky, and we're

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.840
pretty awesome.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.280
And Insanity.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.980
The Insanity is there too, yeah.

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.280
And some Infamy along with it, and some other in stuff.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.280
Nice.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.620
And Rob.

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.620
And the best little horde house in Azeroth is All Things World of Warcraft.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:51.360
It's not taped live anywhere right now, but we do put out a pretty fun podcast on Thursdays-ish

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.760
and you can look that up online at the best little horde house in Azeroth in iTunes.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.400
Just search for horde house and it'll come right up or whatever your preferred finder

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400
of podcast is.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.720
There is a website coming very soon.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.560
I'm hoping next week we'll have more details on that.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.600
We have the early workings underway.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.600
Very exciting.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.920
And now an official guild for this show as well.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.100
So check that out.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.560
This week's show, by the way, was particularly off-color and explicit.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:20.160
So now's a great time to check it out at the best little horde house in Azeroth.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.480
Loki has a show called Raising a Baby.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.960
Well, it's not really a show.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960
It's just what he does.

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.200
I wouldn't have a show even if I didn't have a baby.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.680
Been there, tried that, don't think so.

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.680
I know.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.600
And I've said it before, it's a crime how undervalued your mix show was because you

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600
were pretty good at it.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.000
But oh well, some things are just not meant to be.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.720
And took too damn long.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:46.340
What is meant to be, more gaming news and Twitter topics very soon on the Twitters.

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:48.520
But first, some rapid news, Loki.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.480
Yes, of course we knew the Gears of War 3 beta was coming soon thanks to Bulletstorm.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:59.840
Bulletstorm players will actually get access to the Gears of War 3 beta April 18th.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:06.120
And then of course, if you don't have Bulletstorm, you can also get into the beta if you've preordered

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.880
Gears of War 3 from Gamestop.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.080
Those players will be able to get in a week later on April 25th.

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:20.480
And of course, multiplayer beta, they're seeing some of the beta unlockables you're gonna

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:24.680
get as well in Gears of War 3.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:31.200
The beta tester medal, if you complete one match in the beta, you unlock the beta tester

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:36.880
medal, which will be carried over to your gamer profile in the final game.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:44.960
Also you get the thrash ball coal, which is the fictional sport that's in Gears of War.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.000
And you get the variant skin for that.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.040
The gold plated retro lancer, possible if you complete a bunch of levels in that, 90

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.040
matches.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.400
That's a lot of matches.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:06.760
The flaming hammer burst, if you complete one match by Sunday April 24th.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.800
Also the flaming lancer by one match during the week of April 25th.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.840
The flaming sawed off shotgun, one match during the week of May 2nd.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.840
And the flaming gnasher shotgun during the next week, May 9th.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840
What isn't flaming?

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.640
Not much.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.160
Not me.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.680
So that's coming soon, and check it out if you haven't yet.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.240
I am so excited to get my next issue of Game Informer.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.280
The cover game, of course, is Saints Row the 3rd.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:41.280
God, I love that game.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.440
Saints Row is seriously, you know, what Grand Theft Auto used to be as far as over the top

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.960
and ridiculous.

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:54.100
Not that I don't, you know, not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto 4 because I've made it over

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:58.920
the top and ridiculous, but Saints Row is awesome.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:05.440
But that is coming out on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC this holiday, and the game looks

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:06.440
awesome.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.120
Well, the cover or whatever that they have looks awesome.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:19.240
And apparently the game's gonna be taking place, I guess, in Stillwater still.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:27.160
Also I guess there's this gang called the Syndicate, a criminal organization, that has

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:32.400
certain, you know, contacts in different parts of the world, and they're saying that it ultimately

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.400
propels you into a new city that hosts the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:47.600
And they're saying, you know, judging by the cover here, nine-way free-fall gun battle

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.960
from a plane.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:50.960
I can dig that.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.160
But yeah, the game, seriously Saints Row 2 is awesome, and hell, I mean, they have a

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.960
double pack you can get for like 20 bucks nowadays.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.520
I mean, if you haven't played it, you should really do that.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.960
It's a fun game.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.200
But yeah, that's a day one purchase for me, right there.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:11.320
But unfortunately, you know, we do play Saints Row online, but online's not as fun.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.800
I do respect the fact that they have SystemLink.

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:17.600
That came in handy when our internet is down at work, you know, for a while, or Live is

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.320
down and we can play, you know, SystemLink games.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.480
I'm hoping, granted, that's out of five, or whatever it is, the next one has SystemLink

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.960
as well, like Red Dead Redemption did, because seriously, that saves us a lot of time.

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:30.960
Or Hasselhoff.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.960
Or Hasselhoff.

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:32.960
Or Hasselhoff.

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:33.960
Yes.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:40.280
And then finally, the Panasonic Jungle is not gonna be coming out.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:48.720
It was kind of an ambitious idea for a portable handheld MMO system, just...

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.880
Oh, the MMO thing!

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880
Yeah.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.120
Nobody understood that anyway, so that's fine.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:58.720
It's just not feasible.

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:03.360
Why don't they just say, nobody got it?

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.880
It's not a thing that...

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:08.000
It's not that nobody got it, I think, it's just, I don't know if we'd be able to run

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.800
a lot of the popular MMOs, like, that wouldn't be able to run World of Warcraft, for sure.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.040
You know, they're saying, oh, it would have been able to, you know, use titles like Stellar

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.640
Down, Battlestar Galactica, and RuneScape.

01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.200
It's really a Battlestar game.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.920
And Rift, it's all about Rift right now.

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:29.560
Yeah, I mean, so, it just doesn't have enough oomph to be able to, you know, work.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560
Alright.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:36.120
Can you imagine, though, if they ported World of Warcraft to, like, the iPad, the new iPad

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.120
or something?

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:40.760
It won't happen, but I'm just saying, something of that caliber to something like that, that'd

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.760
be ridiculous.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.200
Well, they do have people just moving into their bathrooms.

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200
I know, they have that, like...

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.960
There's some pretty complex MMOs that are on iOS.

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:52.520
What's the one, Legends, or whatever it's called, Play Legends?

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.400
It's pretty intense.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:56.400
I believe it's free.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.800
It's a freemium one, where if you want the Uber stuff, you gotta pay for it, you know?

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.920
Kind of like Lords of the Ring Online, all that.

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920
Yeah.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920
Alrighty.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.680
Moving on to some other rapid-fire news.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.960
This is a game I really liked on PSP, Half-Minute Hero.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:15.000
It's gonna be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, called Super Mega Neo Climax.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
That's right.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.400
Yeah, weird that they're kind of changing up the name, but yeah.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.200
I think that's supposed to be the Super Neo Mega Climax edition of Half-Minute Hero.

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.960
Well, whatever.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.760
It's coming out, and I'm just bitter because I paid 30 bucks for this on the PSP, and it'll

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.720
probably only be 10 on Xbox Live Arcade, but hey, it's a pretty neat concept, so it'll

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.600
give a whole new audience a chance to check this out.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.120
Thank you, Australian Classification Board, for spoiling it, as you do many video game

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.120
releases.

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.120
Check that out.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.720
ModNation Racers has reached a milestone this week.

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:49.040
Two million user-created items.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:53.360
Plenty more download content on the way, according to the PlayStation blog, including a parts

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.480
pack that's already available on the PlayStation Store, more track packs to make new tracks,

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.280
western and pirate-themed, more career DLC coming as well.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.240
The party is not stopping at ModNation Racers.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.160
Two million user-created items.

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160
Mario Kart Wii, zero.

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.160
That's pretty crazy.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.160
Alright.

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.160
PlayStation Home.

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.400
Well, technically they do have user-created maps.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.400
Officially supported.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.400
No.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400
Alright.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:21.880
PlayStation Home was announced that's upgraded to version 1.5, and some of the new features

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.960
that are coming out in 1.5 of the home client.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:30.660
Games that run within Home, there's already kind of some of these, but they're trying

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:35.920
to take it kind of up to the next step with low-lag, real-time multiplayer gaming, allowing

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.240
more first-person shooters, racing games, and so forth.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.240
A demo was shown for sodium 2 project velocity that shows some of this.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:46.360
Hey, you gotta admit, sodium was one of the more interesting things that happened with

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:47.360
Home.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.480
I realize it's stretching it, but it was interesting.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.360
That's just a sad, if that's, you know, what's the big thing about Home.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.880
Well, but they say now it looks like Wipeout HD, and to that I go, oh, now that's interesting,

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.840
because Wipeout HD is kind of badass.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:04.320
So I, if that is true, that you're going to see more stuff like that in Home, okay, bring

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.320
it on.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:06.320
It's free anyway.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:08.520
It's hard to complain about something free.

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.520
Uh, yeah.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.480
Well, free for the first few levels, and then you got paid for it the rest of the time.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.480
That's true, that's true.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:19.040
Alright, uh, and I guess some more super smooth frame rates, better graphics engines, and

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.040
so forth.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:25.640
Uh, still no word if clubhouses will actually be useful.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640
Somehow doubt it.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:27.640
DarkSakura?

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:33.560
Well, here's some news from a game developer's conference.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.560
Ninja Gaiden 3!

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.480
Um, wait, didn't we already have a Ninja Gaiden 3?

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:39.480
Wasn't it on NES?

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:43.680
Yeah, but this time it doesn't involve Ancient Kingdoms, or whatever the subtitle was, the

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.440
Ancient Warships, whatever it was.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:51.360
This one has a, uh, a bloody, uh, Ryu on it, so that should be really, really hot.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.400
I mean, really, really cool, yeah.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.120
And then, we have the Rock Band releases, which a friend of mine who is completely nuts

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.360
over Depeche Mode is all happy with this.

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.140
We have the Depeche Mode pack that has Never Let Me Down Again and Personal Jesus and Policy

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:13.080
of Truth, and then I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab for Cutie, so.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:19.800
I wish they had more Exciter stuff in there, because that one was awesome.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.380
And last but never least, we have more news for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:28.600
We have the dates for Jill Valentine and Shuma Garath.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:37.560
They will be, um, on March 15th for Xbox Live, 400 points and pop, and then, um, on March

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.840
16th for the PS3.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.640
You gotta wait on PS3, ha ha ha ha.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:48.080
And you heard that right, for people that aren't familiar with Microsoft Space Dollars.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.520
Um, $5 a character.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.000
Thank you, Capcom.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.160
You suck.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.320
$5 a character.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320
I don't think so.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.460
I'm gonna get Jill.

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.460
Pay to unlock content.

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.060
It, yeah, it is pay to unlock content.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.060
It's on the disc already.

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.060
Thank you, Capcom.

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:06.320
You suck balls.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.640
You're just mad at everyone tonight.

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.640
No, seriously.

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:09.640
I mean, come on.

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.640
That is ridiculous.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.640
Oh, I put it on there.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.640
Oh, but we're dicks, so I'm sorry.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.040
You need to say something nice about a video game company to balance all this hatred coming

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.440
out of you tonight.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.160
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an awesome game, but they're dicks for charging $5 a character.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:25.160
I'm sorry.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.160
It's stupid.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:32.600
I mean, characters should be, like, $2 at the most, and especially stuff that's not

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.600
on the disc.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.360
This stuff is already on the disc.

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.680
They're just being dicks.

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.800
They didn't even spend the time to, like, apparently polish it up.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.560
There's no actual storylines or whatever for them.

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.640
They didn't do any cutscenes for them.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.880
They're just assholes.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880
That's all they are.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:51.160
And if you buy them, you're supporting assholes, okay?

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
So just keep that in mind.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:57.640
SSG100 Matt in our chatroom says, Deadpool better make Jill sandwich jokes.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640
Seriously.

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.280
That's a good point.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.280
Do you think Deadpool should make a Jill sandwich joke?

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.560
No doubt he probably would, if silently.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.120
Now, does he ever do anything silently?

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120
No.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:13.040
Alright, let's get to the Twitter and read some of the topics that you guys sent to us

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.040
tonight.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.800
Twitter.com slash OLR is the place you can send us tweets, and we read them live.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.640
Not all of them, though, but most of them.

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.320
Spazinator PSN sends us an FYI about the PSN video store.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:34.160
There's currently a free anime pilot, Hikaru no Go, and a movie rental, Stranger Than Fiction,

01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.360
on the PSN video store.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:38.600
Yeah, I heard PSN was giving away more movies.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.080
Not that these are all movies people are lining up to see, but hey, it's free.

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.360
Stranger Than Fiction wasn't terrible.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.720
Yeah, if you like free stuff, why not?

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.160
There you go.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.080
SilverSonic1534 is sending us a tweet.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.280
Did you see this video?

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.620
It shows some of Super Mario 3DS screenshots.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:59.180
It looks to be a game like Super Mario Bros. 3, and then follows that up with a correction.

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:02.040
It's not looking like Super Mario Bros. 3, but apparently it's going to have some of

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:09.400
the powers that were on Super Mario Bros. 3 on the game, and they sent us a Twitter

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:19.480
link to an IGN video that I guess is kind of showing, I don't want to watch all these

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.480
talking heads.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.720
All they did was show the stupid.

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.080
It looks like they're comparing it to Mario Galaxy, and I heard about how the raccoon

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.480
tail was visible in the little logo that they teased.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:33.120
Yeah, and they're kind of showing this a little bit in the video, so.

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.720
Well I'm sure, you know, people, one thing they do love about Mario is all these little

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:41.880
like powers like the raccoon and please the Tanooki suit, that would be amazing if they

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880
brought that back.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.840
You know, that's kind of one of the things that made Mario Galaxy fun.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.280
The bee suit was awesome.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:51.520
I'm sure some of that stuff, it's all going to be, anything that tickles your retro bone

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.060
and gets you to drop 40, 50 bucks on the games.

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:59.360
And by the way, all of that information that was from IGN right there was all speculation

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.320
because all they showed was the stupid logo.

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.040
They're like, oh it's going to be Mario 3, let's speculate on what it's going to look

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.040
like.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.160
I don't think it, of course, it's going to look like there's successful Mario games,

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.400
but 3D, I mean it's not that hard to figure out I don't think.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.400
Am I crazy?

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.400
I don't know.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.200
Alright, going to actdeft who sends us a little twit pic, and it's a collection of little

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.920
pokey dolls.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.960
He showed us his pokeymans live on air.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.840
But the question that goes with this, do you collect video game paraphernalia or have a

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.560
collection besides the vault?

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.560
So I guess this is.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.240
Well we put it all in the vault.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.040
I guess this might be more of a question for Loki and myself, IDK.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.520
You guys go ahead and answer that because it's a stupid question.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.160
To be honest, hey now there's no such thing as a stupid question.

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:46.640
I said for me.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.000
Oh for you.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.280
For me, I got to be honest, not really.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.680
For a while I seemed like I had an Xbox Live Arcade collection going on because I was downloading

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:55.680
everything.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.760
But I don't really collect.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.280
I don't buy games just because they're rare.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.640
I don't really have a lot of autograph things or collectibles.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:06.520
I rarely, if ever, buy limited editions.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:11.320
I think the last limited edition I remember buying was that Final Fantasy XII at GameStop

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:14.240
that had the extra little frills.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:16.060
I mean it's got to be a really big game.

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.360
I don't even buy Collector's Edition of Warcraft exception.

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:24.000
I did buy Collector's Editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King but it

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
was at a charity event.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
It was at the first Doom Loud.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I did buy those.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.020
So that's for different reasons.

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:32.240
And I ended up giving away the Burning Crusade one to my friend for Christmas.

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.800
So different thing.

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.200
Loki, you a collector?

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.760
I am not a collector of anything but I have like, you know, I get tchotchkes sometimes

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.400
so I have a bunch of stuff at my desk at work.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:50.520
I've got like, well I used to collect Gundam models but then I bought pretty much all of

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.520
them.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:56.520
And then, that's still fun every now and then.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:03.600
I do have for the last Samurai Warriors game I think, Samurai Warriors 3, they have these

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.600
little mini figurines.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.000
I have almost the whole collection of those because we got a bunch of boxes of them and

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.440
so I opened all of them to try to create a whole collection.

01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.000
A missy one though, I think.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Here's the other thing I should say about why I don't collect.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.280
I got hoarding tendencies as it is.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.680
If I really was a rabid collector it would be really bad, you guys.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.140
So I can't.

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.840
I can't get rid of the stuff I have.

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:31.520
I have my Japanese copy of Smash Bros. at my desk sitting there since I don't need the

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:35.800
Japanese version anymore, the real version.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.280
And what else did I have that's really weird?

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.040
I have a poster for the Atari Pac-Man.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.280
I want it for a penny on eBay.

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:52.340
But nothing to the scale of Dark Sakura's Vault.

01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:55.240
That is a whole little special level all on its own.

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:59.600
Some of our stuff that we've gotten that we've really looked into, it's just sort of like,

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.720
it'll be there and we'll see it and it's cool.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:08.400
We've gotten all kinds of neat collector stuff through Dan getting some swag from the local

01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.000
reps and going to conventions and things.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:19.920
I still think the coolest, one of the coolest things we got was the Goemon doll.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.480
Because we bought our Twilight Zone pinball game from the guy who owned Working Designs.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.800
And he just gave one to Dan.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.800
So that was pretty cool.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:39.840
One of my favorite things in there is I have a little Pac-Man doll from 1982 that has the

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.840
ghost in his mouth.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:46.960
I'll take a picture of it and put it up, but that's one of my favorite things in the vault.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.200
They've just got stuff everywhere.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:59.120
Even in here we've got all these Guitar Hero face plates that Dan got for cheap slash free

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.640
on the wall and just stuff we've looked into.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.200
I mean, sometimes this stuff just falls in our lap.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:10.200
It's not like we're trying to collect it on purpose.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:14.640
And then Dan says from the other room, and some of it we spent stupid money on.

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:16.840
Alright, well let's move on.

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.520
A couple tweets coming to us from Tigerclaw.

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:27.360
Tigerclaw linking us to this story, I guess a quote from Cliffy B, Cliff Blazinski, Mary

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.120
Gamers, don't date them.

01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:34.560
I'm going to read verbatim this article from Joystick with a Q, a proper credit to them

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.520
because I was tweeted this story and didn't have a chance to skim things in advance for

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.240
the relevant stuff.

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.880
In a candid talk during the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Epic Games Design

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:50.200
Director Cliff Blazinski advised attendees to have an educated gut and to be cognizant

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.220
of the value of marketing and long-term relationships with customers.

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:57.960
He encapsulated his talk in the Power Creative, a project member who is unique, valuable and

01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.940
visibly tied to the game's identity.

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:00.940
This could be anyone.

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:01.940
I see.

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:06.080
So it's more like he's not saying that in the literal sense, like Mary Gamers, he's

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:12.200
saying kind of, you know, be educated as to the long-term relationships you build with

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200
the gamers.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.640
Let me read another paragraph from the article here.

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.560
With consumers constantly immersed in an information feed via social networking platforms like

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:25.720
Twitter and Facebook, it's important for game designers to be surgical and devious in creating

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.720
IPs that thrive in an always on heavily branded world.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.900
According to Blazinski, the market only tolerates games that land on the far end of the spectrum

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.480
between freemium snack games and big budget games like Gears of War.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.040
I believe the middle class game is dead.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.640
The Power Creative understands how to engage fans over a long period of time.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:47.560
Make gamers marry your game, not just date it.

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:52.240
Again, if you want to read the rest of that story, it's on joystickwithacue.com as tweeted

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:54.080
to us tonight.

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.080
Hmm.

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:59.120
Do game developers, some of them need to work on the relationship with the fan and that

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.360
whole idea of marry your audience and don't just take them out on one night stands?

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:07.000
Or do you think that that whole little comparison is way out of...

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.520
You need to satisfy your market.

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:13.000
If you don't satisfy them, they'll leave.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.480
All right.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:21.040
They'll leave you for other developers who love them longer and harder.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.040
You know, I got to say this.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.960
Some people do get very passionate about certain development houses, you know, especially the

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.120
ones that seem to treat them well.

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:31.360
I mean, especially in light of everything that Loki had said a minute ago about Capcom,

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.960
for the most part, they touch into their fan base pretty well.

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.440
They have a lot of fans through their blogs and the things that they do online.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.320
You know, they really do seem to give the fans what they want despite some of these

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.560
oversights and things, except Mega Man Universe.

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:45.560
Whatever happened to that?

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.560
Hello?

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.560
What happened to Mega Man Universe?

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:48.560
Where'd it go?

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.560
Anybody seen it?

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.560
Anyhow.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:56.800
Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw, a link to a story on Kotaku about the Social Game

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.200
Developers Rant.

01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.560
Ah, now I did hear about this.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.640
Apparently, there was a panel at Game Developers Conference where a bunch of the folks that

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.040
develop for these social game companies like Zynga and Playdom and all this, they basically

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.800
got up and said, hey, you know what, stop picking on us.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.200
Screw you.

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:15.200
We're not that bad.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:16.920
And it was just this whole panel.

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.360
Kind of sounds like straight out of like a really bad panel at an anime convention or

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:24.320
something where it's just dudes up on a stage ranting about shit they don't like.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.600
It's kind of like what they did here, but it was about like social network and why do

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:31.880
people always pick on us type of thing.

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:32.880
Interesting.

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.440
So they also did a little mini game where the developers were encouraged, I'm sorry,

01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.880
the people attending the panels were encouraged to collect coins and whoever could get the

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.080
most coins got to do a rant of their own, which is kind of funny because that's kind

01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:47.440
of like how a social game would actually work.

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:48.440
So ha.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.960
So there you go.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:53.960
Is that it for tweets?

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.960
Oh no, one last tweet from Blue Swim.

01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:00.760
Orange Lounge Foodio question, which is better, Cadbury Creme Eggs or Marshmallow Peeps?

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.960
Also welcome back, Loki.

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.240
Cadbury Creme Eggs since marshmallows are disgusting.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.240
I actually disagree.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:11.240
I prefer Marshmallow Peeps because they can joust in the microwave and Cadbury Creme Eggs

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.240
are too much.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.160
Like, if I'm going to eat a Cadbury Creme Egg, it needs to be one of those little mini

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.160
ones.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.840
I can't, the big ones are too much, too rich.

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:18.840
You know what's fantastic?

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.600
It's going to Touch of Britain and getting the Mars eggs.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.040
Those are fantastic.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040
Orange Creme Eggs.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.400
I still kind of prefer Marshmallow Peeps personally.

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.320
I don't know.

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:34.600
I'm not a big fan of either one.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.320
Creme Eggs, I guess.

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Alright.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320
That's it for tweets.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.360
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.360
In the meantime, let's get back into some other video game news before we get to the

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.920
mailbag, the FUs, and of course your phone calls.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:50.140
Alright.

01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:56.680
So this is kind of neat and kind of along the lines of stuff that they were pimping

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:57.680
out before.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:04.240
Of course, the Kinect, there is supposed to be a dev kit coming officially for Microsoft,

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.760
but until then, there's going to be another dev kit coming out from a different company.

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:16.360
The dev kit is called ISU, or I guess the software platform, ISU which stands for the

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:23.600
interface is you, and of course it's Soft Connect's 3D gesture recognition software

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.440
development kit, now available for qualified developers, and they can license it for free.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:37.360
It says they'll work with all 3D depth sensing devices, which includes support for the Kinect,

01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:45.040
and I guess it's a strictly non-commercial software development kit, and commercial version

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.440
of course can be purchased from them as well, but that's kind of neat, and it says there's

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.840
going to be different ones actually coming out from Evaloos, PrimeSense, and of course

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.840
Microsoft.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.360
So neat to see that there's going to be some, I'm actually, I'd be kind of curious to see

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.040
what the first like real retail game that comes out that supports Kinect, that'd be

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.040
kind of neat.

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:13.000
And then of course, not to be outdone by that, PlayStation, the PlayStation Move I should

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.880
say, they actually have some tools as well to be able to program stuff that supports

01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:26.400
the PlayStation, iCamera, and the Move controllers.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.520
It's called MoveMe, and it's a software tool that's going to be using the PlayStation Move

01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:37.520
technology to create unique applications, and of course it's coming soon.

01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.800
They're saying that MoveMe is going to be a downloadable application for the PS3 that

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:48.440
allows researchers, students, hobbyists, developers, or anyone the ability to develop for the PlayStation

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:53.440
Move, and they said they want to see what innovative applications programs can create

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.240
using the PlayStation Move controller, the PS3 system, and the PlayStation iCamera, and

01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.620
the PC.

01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:05.560
So apparently it's going to be available on the PlayStation Network this spring, but people

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.240
that are interested will be able to apply for it as well.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:18.520
You can go to, I believe, usplaystation.com slash ps3 slash playstation dash move slash

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.200
move dash me, and check that out.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.200
That's kind of neat.

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.980
What do you think will ultimately come of this?

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.400
Maybe some applications or whatever.

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:31.760
I think there's a lot of stuff that they could do with the PlayStation that they're not.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.800
I mean, remember like a long time ago, they were showing some of the stuff, even what

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:37.240
they could do with the PlayStation iCamera.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:39.240
Like they're all, hey look, we made a combat game.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:43.000
It was the developers for the PlayStation i stuff.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.280
They're showing, hey look, we can make a combat game where you draw, you know, your tanks

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.280
that you use and you can scan them in and play a game with it.

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.320
They did all those cool tech demos, but never released them.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.780
It's like, you know, you could have done something cool with that, but no.

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:04.360
Do you see more like bite-sized applications coming maybe to the PlayStation Network?

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:05.360
They should.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.560
That was the whole point with like even on the PSP, how they have the PlayStation Network

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.160
on the PSP and they have the PSP minis and stuff.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.160
It was supposed to be more of like those bite-sized applications.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:23.240
I'm hoping that, you know, they kind of look at the next PlayStation Portable as, hey,

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.520
you know what, we're going to try to make this thing more like a smartphone or something

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.280
where we're going to have not only the applications that are going to be games, but we're also

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.760
going to have, you know, like a Twitter program or, you know, a Facebook program or, you know,

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.760
a bunch of other stuff that people can develop like, you know, just non-gaming applications

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760
for.

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760
And I think that's smart.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:52.200
And I think that should really be on all portable systems that are coming out, Nintendo.

01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.400
It just, it makes sense.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:51:00.720
It's just what, you know, that kind of industry's popular for now is applications.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.440
People love their applications.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.440
Alright.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:08.440
Well, on a completely different kind of topic, we're going to talk about kind of a cleanup

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.640
that's going on on Xbox Live right now.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.760
No, they're not cleaning out games or anything, but they are cleaning out gamertags.

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.560
You know, Xbox Live has been around quite a while.

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:19.600
It's been around, what, since about, uh, 02 was when it launched, right?

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.600
So it's been around, well, about as long as Orange Launch Radio has.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.480
And amongst that time, they have collected a lot of gamertags that really just didn't

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:30.240
end up getting used because people changed them or, what, they made them on the old Xbox

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.000
and never really migrated them or what have you.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.680
So Major Nelson made an announcement, uh, this week that they have begun the process

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:41.760
of making previously used and unavailable Xbox Live gamertags available.

01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:44.760
They're not saying what meets the qualifications for dead.

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:52.680
I am assuming that ones that were used on the old Xbox, because old Xbox Live is gone,

01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.320
that never migrated to a 360 account, I'm assuming that's what qualifies, but it's a

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:57.320
huge assumption.

01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:01.840
Um, I think part of what definitely falls into this, people that changed their name,

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.560
their old name would still be unavailable, so I think a lot of that is kind of getting

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.840
moved permanently.

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:11.600
So, uh, the, also it's stressed on here, uh, the process will take time to complete.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.360
They will, will not be able to tell you when a gamertag that you want is available.

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.240
You should always check back regularly because they are reviving gamertags daily.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.440
You can go into the Xbox channel and change gamertag to see if the gamertag you want is

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:24.440
available.

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.400
I tried to get Major Nelson, but it was taken.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:29.400
So there you go.

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.160
I did notice though, one name I would be interested in changing to was available.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.680
So uh, who knows?

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:41.000
I'm not sure how I feel about $10 just to change my gamertag, but you never know, we'll

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
see.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Anything's possible.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.840
Would anyone, would anyone try to change their name to something else?

01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:50.160
Loki, you should see if maybe Loki without the OLR is available.

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:52.160
It's not, I'm sure it's not.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.960
Well, and even still, it's, it's fine.

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:55.960
I'll leave it as is.

01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:56.960
Yeah.

01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:57.960
I'm happy with mine.

01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.720
I don't really play that much because it sort of kills me.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.720
Yeah.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:05.400
Makes my hands hurt, which, uh, nevermind.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:10.840
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some more stories, Darth Zira.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:12.800
Well today's other story is Metal Cthulhu.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:14.120
No, I'm just kidding.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:15.800
Um, Another World.

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:16.800
You remember this game?

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:17.800
It came out in the nineties.

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:18.800
Oh my God.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:19.800
I do remember that game.

01:53:19.800 --> 01:53:23.320
It was, it was epic when it came out.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:27.120
Well, it's, it actually first came out in 1991.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.240
It was a cinematic sci-fi side-scroller, and it's going to be brought up to date to come

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:33.680
out for iPhone and iPad.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:42.400
It's being ported by Dotemu, so, uh, it, they haven't said anything about new features,

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.440
but they're saying that they want it to be the best experience on iOS.

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:51.120
Sorry, I'm looking at a video on YouTube of this game being played, actually, so I can

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.040
kind of re- take, take me back a little bit, let me skip ahead, this is somebody playing

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.040
it on an Amiga.

01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.040
Sorry.

01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:04.800
Well, it, it really is a pretty game, I mean, it's, it was great, and this is, uh, supposed

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:08.620
to be just a big, uh, a big ol' update.

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:15.360
And they're also working on, um, an Ubisoft, uh, game called From Dust that's gonna be

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:19.160
out on PC, and PSN, and Xbox Live Arcade.

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.160
Nice.

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:22.220
But, dude, another world.

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:27.640
This game was kind of like, um, a souped-up version of, uh, Prince of Persia, but, like,

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:33.920
I, that's really, it's like Prince of Persia in space, but with epic cutscenes involved,

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.920
I don't know.

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:39.200
Kind of a little flashback, too, what that came out after.

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:40.200
Yeah.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.200
Running away from a killer bear.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.440
Yeah, this game was so epic when it came out.

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:46.960
Wasn't, like, Out of This World or something like that.

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.800
Um, it was called, uh, oh, in the States.

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:53.320
Yeah, in the US it was called Out of This World.

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:56.600
Another world was the UK release.

01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.640
Yet I still know it by that name.

01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.640
Yeah.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:00.640
Anyhow.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.640
Very cool.

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.960
Uh, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, that game is fucking amazing, but it's hard as

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.960
fuck.

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:11.280
I have no idea how you can play it without tactical, tactile controls.

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.760
And I got the HD version they put out, like, four years ago.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.920
I didn't realize they'd done a remake already.

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:17.380
And damn good point.

01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:20.680
It's cool that they're putting it out again in nostalgia and all that on the iOS, but

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:25.980
again, no joystick means hard game is very, very hard.

01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.480
So I don't know.

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:29.480
We'll see.

01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:32.920
Um, anyhow, uh, let's move on with a few more stories.

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:36.400
The mailbag is coming up as well as the Skype line.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:41.680
Um, so they've got, uh, some cool stuff coming to OnLive.

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:46.680
Um, some of the things that they announced at Game Developers Conference, uh, that they're

01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.840
gonna be offering to developers that want to put their games on to the platform.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:57.760
They're saying, uh, voice chat, game invite for multiplayer games, uh, the ability to

01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:03.880
directly upload brag clips to YouTube, and then also achievements, um, which they're

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:08.800
guessing is gonna be stuff derived from console versions, um, but, you know, hey, if they

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:12.520
want to put up an old retro game or something like that and add achievements to it, they

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:13.520
can.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.720
And then, um, also they're gonna allow, uh, developers to let their games support wireless

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:25.200
controllers when played on mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, um, or Android powered,

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:30.760
um, phones or tablets.

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.400
Basically they need some controllers for some of those devices.

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.600
Kind of interesting though how this thing is like kind of turning into a gaming console

01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:42.600
like in reverse, like the way it kind of all mapped out and like now they have the, you

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:45.880
know, the streaming thing and now they're talking about voice chat.

01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.640
But the lineup of games, if I'm not mistaken, is still relatively weak for this console,

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.640
right?

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:54.780
I mean, there's a few good ones in there, but it's not like you have the gigantic array

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:58.200
of games like it's available on most gaming consoles.

01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:59.200
That's true.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.400
I mean, it didn't launch that long ago, it was like a few months ago.

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.400
True.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:06.360
So, I don't know, they're doing alright, I think.

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.200
I think they're making progress and it's definitely been, you know, it works, so.

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.400
I think it's worked a lot better than anybody thought it would.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.880
I think a lot of people wrote this thing off when it first came out, or before it came

01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:17.880
out really.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:18.880
So.

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:19.880
Hmm.

01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:21.580
Well, we'll see what continues with that.

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:23.560
It's neat that they're still going with it.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.380
That type of device though, um, you know how they have the micro console and stuff like

01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:33.760
that, if they can do MMOs on that, that's how you would get a device like the Jungle,

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.060
where it would basically be something that runs on a server, you know, at some company

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:43.600
or whatever, like World of Warcraft or something like that, and you have your controls on there,

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:48.020
it's very limited, but you don't need to have the powerhouse of like, you know, a tablet

01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:53.960
or whatever in this device, because all it's doing is streaming stuff over wifi.

01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:59.360
Although I don't know if you can do that over wifi very well, it would be pretty slow.

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.760
But um, you know, once, once our internet catches up to the speeds that there are in

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.340
other countries, you know, it might be a little bit different, you know, 5G, 6G, whatever

01:58:10.340 --> 01:58:17.280
the next, you know, speed increase that we're going to see here, stupid 4G, but yeah, once

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.840
it gets up to that, then you'll see stuff like that happening.

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.640
Alright, well, let's move on to another quick story before we get to the mailbag, and this

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.480
is about the game DJ Max.

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.980
It's a music game, of course on the PSP, has a very cult-like following, of course a lot

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:34.060
of the folks that followed BeatMania 2DX and DDR back in the day still follow this series.

01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:38.240
It's filled with a lot of Korean music, K-pop and so forth, and the music's pretty popular

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:42.480
amongst the crowd, but usually there's not a real legitimate, anyway, way to get the

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.180
music outside of Korea.

01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.180
Well guess what?

01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:49.860
Starting in March, it was announced, Pentavision has announced that the soundtracks for DJ

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:53.020
Max are going to be published on iTunes.

01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:58.000
Three albums followed by a new album every week, I guess until they get caught up, because

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.360
that's a lot of albums, but there have been quite a few DJ Max games at this point, so

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:08.080
fans of that series are going to be very happy that they get their nice CD-quality sound

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:09.080
out of iTunes.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:12.480
That'll be pretty cool, if they didn't already get it through other means from the Korean

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:13.480
albums.

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.480
That's pretty cool.

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:17.960
You know iTunes has been doing a lot of different Japanese pop artists, like the really big

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:21.280
names like Ayumi and Gokt and...

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:24.440
Yeah, I bought an Ayumi song on there not that long ago, it's kind of funny.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:27.320
I got a Lark and Seal album, like a while back.

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.160
They also do a lot of video game soundtracks.

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:34.340
It's interesting to me that they don't have a gaming section in their store.

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:35.340
Maybe I missed it.

01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:39.120
I think there is a soundtracks section, so maybe it's buried in there and I've just missed

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:43.880
it, but there's more and more gaming soundtracks on there, like the Pac-Man Championship Edition,

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.160
the Deluxe that has the awesome techno music.

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:50.900
That soundtrack's on there, you can get that, and there's, you know, pretty much every Final

01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:52.660
Fantasy soundtrack's on there now.

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:56.760
You know, in some of the newer games, DDR has soundtracks on there now, so a lot of

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.320
games have been showing up.

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.260
Warcraft has a soundtrack there too.

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:05.040
Lots of games starting to get showing up on iTunes, so it's kind of neat.

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:06.040
Yeah.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.080
Especially for those that like the music in their games, I wish there's a lot of really

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:14.040
good stuff that the mass market doesn't often get to hear, so that's pretty cool.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:18.080
So maybe it will expose more fans to DJ Max.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:20.320
I guess that's the ultimate goal for this.

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.320
We'll see.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.320
Might be.

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.320
Might be.

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:25.520
Before we get to the mailbag here in a minute, I wanted to back up a minute, because we were

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.320
talking about Out of This World or Another World.

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:32.000
Do you think there's any other PC games that ought to be coming out for iOS that maybe

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
they've missed?

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.320
Because that's definitely a classic.

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:35.320
Loom.

02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.320
Loom.

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.320
Loom.

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.320
Didn't they, they did something.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.320
I guess it was a hack.

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:40.320
Loom's on Steam.

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:41.320
It was like a hack.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.320
Oh yeah, it's on Steam.

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.320
I want to say there was like a hack for the iOS or something.

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:44.320
Of course.

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:45.320
You know I got Loom on Steam.

02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.400
Somebody wants to hack the old LucasArts stuff for that.

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.720
You know, I actually have a copy of Loom for PC.

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:52.080
I bought it on eBay.

02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.080
Nice.

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:54.080
Because I love that game.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.080
It's pretty nice.

02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:58.880
I hardly remember how to play it, because of all the chords and stuff, and I've remembered

02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:03.280
some of the chords and I do them way too early, but Loom would be fun one.

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.280
Scorched Earth.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:05.280
Yes!

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:09.120
Oh man, it's been years since I've played Scorched Earth, absolutely.

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.720
What about Phantasmagoria?

02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:14.160
That's not outside the realm of possibility.

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:17.920
There was a news on that not that long ago.

02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.160
I know they brought out the seventh guest, which I know it's a completely different company,

02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.280
but for some reason these go together in my mind, and they were talking about the eleventh

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.640
hour, and I want to say around that same time we had heard something about Phantasmagoria.

02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:31.960
So that'd be pretty cool if that were to come out for iOS.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.560
The point-and-click games would lend themselves much better to the iOS system.

02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.600
So maybe like Chirandia would be awesome if we could get that.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:44.760
Obviously, you know, I gotta say King's Quest would be kind of neat.

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:51.200
And there was the whole Flash versions that got shut down, so we know it's kind of possible.

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.560
Good Ol' Games had a Phantasmagoria for digital download last year.

02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.560
Maybe that's why we reported on it.

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:02.760
They do have the SCUMM emulator, so for jailbroken devices.

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:06.560
And you know me, I'd like to see more classic Commodore 64 games show up outside of just

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.560
the emulator.

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:10.640
There's the emulator that's available, but it keeps going up and down and up and down.

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:12.640
I don't even know if it's still on the store right now.

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:18.520
They also have... there's some other emulator that was out there that was...

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:20.520
iDOS was an emulator.

02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.640
I had Duke Nukem and all that.

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.400
I have it on my phone, but it's pulled from the store now.

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.400
iDOS.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:26.400
There's another one.

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:29.880
I did get the... they finally leaked that out too.

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.120
Remember that Minecraft client that got uploaded for just a brief millisecond or whatever?

02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.720
Yeah, I finally found that.

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.720
Nice.

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:42.080
But I don't have a Minecraft account, so I can't play it yet.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.040
Alright, well let's get to the mailbag.

02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.400
You guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaungeready.com.

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.640
Dark Sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.120
The first email is actually directed towards me.

02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:00.240
It says, hello, I heard last week that Dark Sakura is going to Faname Con.

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:01.560
I will be going this year as well.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.360
How about an OLR meetup at the convention?

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.080
Hope to see you, Sakura.

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.000
She and I.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.720
If everything works out, I'm not making any supreme promises or anything, because honestly

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:15.120
I miss cosplaying and I think I wouldn't mind doing it again.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.440
But we definitely need to see about getting our panel.

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:19.440
That would be...

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.800
Might be a little late for that.

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.800
We're almost into...

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.800
We're like mid-March.

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.480
If we could swing it, yeah, I'd love to do it.

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.160
I'll probably be here that weekend, so yeah.

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.960
I'll bring the dolls again.

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:33.720
The scary creepy dolls.

02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:34.720
Next email.

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:35.720
Hey, OLR.

02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.800
How would you feel if Konami gave the DDR series a reboot on the Kinect?

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:45.000
The game would feature songs from DDR's history and songs found in the charts today, and it

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.520
would also feature an online mode where players can compete in dance battles or form their

02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.040
own dance groups and choreograph their own dances.

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.040
Oh.

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.040
Yeah.

02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:58.120
I think, unfortunately, Konami's already kind of screwed the pooch with that, because Dance

02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.040
Masters is kind of that.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:06.120
At least it's a lot of the old DDR songs, but in that whole para-slash-dance-central-esque

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.120
kind of format.

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.000
And there's a demo available now on Xbox 360 if you want to see what this game's all about.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.080
But yeah, I think you have some good ideas, but the weird thing is...

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:20.840
And I don't know, did he say with a dance mat and Kinect?

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:23.400
Because that might be a little weird for some people.

02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:24.400
If you...

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:25.400
Hey, guess what?

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.200
We do use a Kinect, though, with DDR, the upcoming DDR game, Dance Dance Revolution,

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.200
because they made it just...

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:34.680
We covered last week where there's a hack for it that they're trying to...

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:38.200
No, that's StepMania, but I'm talking about the actual Dance Dance Revolution member,

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:43.200
the one that came out on PS3 with move support and then on the Wii as well.

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:49.960
Well, it's coming out in April on Xbox 360, and it uses the Xbox Vision camera, which

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:54.520
is now also technically the Kinect, but you can do crap with that.

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:57.920
But seriously, you need...

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.720
We don't need to give Konami reasons to make more gimmicky crap for Dance Dance Revolution.

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:06.680
They just need to stick to the core mechanics and improve on that, or just basically do

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:12.480
what they were doing back, like, years ago, and they would be fine, but they're trying...

02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.440
I don't know what they're doing anymore, and I don't think...

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:17.960
Uh, they need to just reform Konami Hawaii and give them the game.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.960
That's really the only thing that would really get me, like, super interested in DDR again.

02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:22.960
Put me in charge!

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.040
I will make you a game that's gonna be perfect.

02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.040
More emails?

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:30.480
Yes, there was actually more to this email.

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480
Oh, my bad.

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:35.200
Finally, it would be great if you guys would give my video game blog a quick plug on the

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.480
show, which I will be happy to do.

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:38.480
No!

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:39.480
That'll be $50.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:40.480
Hush.

02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:41.480
Here's a link.

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:42.480
PlayStationUK.wordpress.com.

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:43.480
Thanks, Liam.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.480
Okay, Liam.

02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:45.480
Send me...

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:51.960
I would like to know Liam's thoughts on the whole LG lawsuit that we covered at the top

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.840
of the show, since that is affecting the UK.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:54.840
Yeah.

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:55.840
Maybe it's on his blog.

02:05:55.840 --> 02:06:01.520
Well, we'll have to just go there later, and maybe look later.

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:03.320
So, next email.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.320
Greetings, OLR.

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.920
This is your neighborhood turtle again.

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:10.840
I've included a link you guys should check out concerning Unreal Engine 3.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:15.120
Looking at the screen caps plus the previews of Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3, I'm incredibly

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:17.880
impressed mostly with the lighting.

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:22.080
Being a graphics whore, all these next-gen games look very promising.

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:26.000
I know y'all like the retro games, but isn't there a part of you that loves beautiful graphics

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
in your games?

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Fuck yeah.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.920
As the only turtle gamer I know, I have to say that I get more immersed in games that

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.440
look realistic.

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:37.640
Keep up the best podcasts on the internet to your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:39.960
I love pretty things.

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.040
Why else did I sit through the first 13 hours of Final Fantasy 13?

02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:44.360
I mean, really.

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:47.800
No, the lighting is really tremendous.

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:48.800
It's amazing.

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.880
You know, Unreal Engine, the last one, was amazing enough.

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.800
I'm sure the new one's just gonna be even more of an improvement.

02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:56.800
It's gonna be great.

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:57.800
I don't think that's four.

02:06:57.800 --> 02:06:59.800
That's just the new updates that they did for three.

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:00.800
Oh my gosh.

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:01.800
I thought that was the...

02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:02.800
I thought...

02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:03.800
I thought this is the new engine.

02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.720
No, that's just the tweaks that they did for three, I think, because remember...

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.720
That's a pretty crazy poly count these things are running, too.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.400
I don't think they have Unreal.

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:15.800
Remember, the next one's Rage, I thought, from...

02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:17.800
Was Epic Rage?

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:18.800
No.

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:19.800
I don't remember.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:23.920
But I know Rage is the next big engine, but yeah, I don't think that's Unreal 4.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.520
That's just tweaks to the new three, if I remember correctly.

02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:31.400
I also wanna see what crazy non-shooting things come out of the engine, because you know,

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.920
we've been getting some really random things in the Unreal Engine.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:39.160
There's a few role-playing games from Square that were done in the engine.

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.160
The last...

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.240
Was it Last Remnant that was in Unreal?

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:43.560
No, Last Remnant was.

02:07:43.560 --> 02:07:47.320
Well, I've been looking at this, and this is kinda funny since I've been taking my 3D

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:48.320
class.

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:52.120
It's just, now that I actually understand the physics behind some of this, it's pretty

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:55.640
cool seeing, you know, what happens by layer.

02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:56.640
It's just amazing.

02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:03.140
Like, I'm gonna share this picture with the chatroom, because this is a really good example.

02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:08.520
It's the one of the dude's face where they'd start with the...

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:10.980
It's basically just a demo of the subsurface scattering.

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:14.360
It's really cool.

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.760
They also showing how cool smoking is.

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.440
Yeah, like...

02:08:18.440 --> 02:08:27.480
Honestly, a falling cigarette is a good showing of lighting and physics in action.

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:30.360
Because that was clearly part of their demo.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:35.000
And it also shows that Epic has set the release Falling Cigarette the Game after Gears of

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.840
War 3, and I can't be any more excited than I am possibly right now.

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.720
Next email.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:42.720
Hi guys...

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:43.720
Cigarettes will fall.

02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:44.720
Fall of 2012.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:48.720
Hi guys, since the website won't let me post this because it's too long, I figured I'd

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:49.720
just email it.

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:50.720
Oh good.

02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:51.720
Bleh.

02:08:51.720 --> 02:08:54.560
Yay, DarkSakura loves long emails.

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.360
Especially after my mouth is dry from just having a beer.

02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.640
It seems, first off, if I ever call the show again, I have to close the all-games window.

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:05.760
Twice, it just suddenly turned itself back on while I was in the call.

02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:06.760
Weird.

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.760
Anywho, I just thought I'd give a very interesting story.

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:13.960
Now I know I've stated before how much I like PC gaming and console these days for various

02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:14.960
reasons.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:17.680
Recently I was a bit bored and was curious, so I decided to try out a game I heard a lot

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:20.120
about, Mass Effect 2 on the PC.

02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:24.200
Now the game ran smooth-smooth-ly, not smooth, dude.

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:26.360
The game looked great.

02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:31.320
And honestly, after playing out the entire demo, I was impressed enough that I made plans

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:33.360
to purchase the game at a later time.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:36.740
A few days ago on a whim, and because of the common thoughts of how important frames per

02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:40.880
second is to me, I can tell the difference even after 60 FPS.

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.520
Despite people saying it's impossible, but that's another story.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.400
I decided to download the PS3 demo.

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:50.880
Now granted, it looked the same, with a bit less framerate, but it wasn't too bad.

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:54.200
After the first part of the demo, where the big shit blew up, I looked at my girlfriend

02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:59.060
who was watching the game with me, and all I heard was, can I see more?

02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:02.080
Her saying that about a game is not something I've seen every day.

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:03.560
Wouldn't I be hearing every day?

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:04.560
Anyway.

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:11.280
In fact, I think this is the third game ever she's been that impressed.

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:14.920
So of course I went through the rest of the demo, even showing her how much customization

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.520
was involved in creating your character, and following the storylines and how they can

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:19.520
branch off.

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.880
After the full demo, I found that while the controls aren't as good as I'd like them to

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.840
be, they're far better than the Xbox 360.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:31.460
In fact, I would rather use the PS3 controller for first person shooters than the Xbox.

02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:36.220
And yes, the framerate isn't as silky smooth, but it still looks great and felt like a movie.

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:40.200
My girl just had the biggest jaw drop and grins, so in a rarity, I'm going to get the

02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:43.440
PS3 version mainly so she can watch and enjoy the story.

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:48.400
For me, any game that causes a casual person to stop and take notice wins more in my book

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.680
than something that's designed for hardcore fans.

02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:53.560
Again, another topic for another day.

02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.600
Also why the PS3 over Xbox?

02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.480
Besides control, the download content comes with it, instead of having to buy it.

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.960
Besides, it's very rare that a game does better on PS3 for me than the Xbox 360.

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:08.080
And to end it, her final thought after I turned off the demo sure beats Halo.

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:09.960
I think that sealed the deal.

02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:12.840
Sometimes having the audience there while playing a game is more fun than playing it

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:13.840
alone.

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:16.800
Well, you won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:20.360
Oh no, well, won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.880
And that was from Mantis Knight.

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:23.880
That's another one of those games.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.000
You know, it's funny because I brought up Beyond Good and Evil earlier in the show,

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.400
and it's one of those games like everybody played and loved, and I'm just now catching

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:31.400
up on it.

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.400
Yeah, put Mass Effect in that same bin.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.200
It's funny.

02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:37.360
Now, last email.

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.520
Hey, OLR gang.

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:40.800
ACHP here.

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:44.320
I know a lot of people who listen to this show probably want to work in games.

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.460
I know I do.

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:47.000
And I thought I'd share some advice.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.540
Meet people who make games.

02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:52.300
While not being able to afford a $1000 pass to get into a game developer's conference

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:55.560
this weekend, I was able to squeeze myself into some post-hours events.

02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:59.120
And let me tell you, it is probably the best thing I have ever done for my professional

02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.120
career.

02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.320
You'd be surprised at how willing people are to chat and network with complete strangers

02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.320
who don't even work in the industry.

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:08.720
At a random party for a company I've never heard of, I was able to meet the business

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:13.740
developer managers for Q Entertainment, met a guy who knew a guy who was there with a

02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:17.660
recruiter who is now helping me find placement as an entry-level programmer.

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:22.780
So if you want to get your foot in the door and haven't booked a ticket for PAX, do it.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:28.300
And if you have, go look up your favorite com- go look up if your favorite company is

02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:30.760
doing any meet-and-greet type of activities.

02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:32.520
You may be glad you did.

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:34.320
Hope this helps someone as DHP.

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.320
T.S.

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:38.680
Game developers are definitely the most socially awkward people ever.

02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:43.000
With an open bar and go-go dancers on the tables, they are just idly chatting or playing

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:44.000
on their phone.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I lulled.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
P.P.S.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.960
I wrote this on my Android phone, again to prove that you can write grammatically correct

02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:51.920
and properly spelled and punctuated words without a keyboard or autocorrect.

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.920
Cheers!

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.100
He said he'd be very patient.

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.000
But yeah, I agree.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.600
Some of the best parts, at least about E3, which is one I was going to pretty regularly

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:06.820
for a while, some of the best part is networking.

02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:08.880
So yeah, absolutely.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.480
If you're going to be going to any of those shows, just don't be shy.

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:13.820
Just say hi to people.

02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.800
You can tell when somebody doesn't want to talk to you or if you're bugging somebody

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.200
or what have you.

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:22.960
You know, but most of the times at these expos, people kind of, you know, they want to be

02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:23.960
social.

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:24.960
They want to hang out.

02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.960
They want to talk.

02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:26.960
They're a game.

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:28.200
So, good email.

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.200
Was that it?

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.200
That was it?

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.200
Excuse me.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.200
Chat.orangelouncerator.com.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.200
If you want to chat, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelouncerator.com.

02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:39.600
S.H.A. 100 Matt throws in our chat room.

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.640
There are a ton of networking panels at PAX East this year.

02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:47.000
So coming up, I would like to know how the networking is at PAX East.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.040
For those of you guys that are going, I want to know how you guys, you know, if you find

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.960
people or what you discover.

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:53.960
So let us know.

02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:58.380
In the meantime, we need to stop being so nice talking about all this networking and

02:13:58.380 --> 02:13:59.380
hand-holding and partying.

02:13:59.380 --> 02:14:17.280
It's time to get angsty with the FUs of the week.

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:22.600
I would like to give a big fuck you to the Library of Congress, more specifically their

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:30.040
website in trying to help my client copyright his book.

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.260
It's not letting me do the regular copyright submission.

02:14:35.260 --> 02:14:40.120
It wants me to do the pre-registration submission, which actually isn't even necessary to do.

02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.400
Online registration is $35.

02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:43.400
Pre-registration is $150.

02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:47.600
Now, what do you think we want to do, especially since I've made sure that the book is fully

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.400
the way it needs to be?

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:50.400
Everything's ready.

02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.400
We've got it publisher.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:55.360
I mean, just frustrations.

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.200
So bite my butt, Library of Congress.

02:14:58.200 --> 02:14:59.200
Loki?

02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:08.160
FU to Dominic's New York pizza and Italian deli for not realizing that Philly cheesesteak

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:14.200
has cheese on it and giving me a sandwich that does not have cheese on it.

02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.200
And it wasn't that great.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:17.200
So I have to throw it away.

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:21.320
But yes, next time I will not be buying the Philly cheesesteak sandwich from you because

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:30.400
you have omitted cheese, although my wife does like the clam pizza.

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:31.400
Not my thing.

02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:40.200
Alright, and my FU goes to those big Belgian waffles for being so yummy and delicious and

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:41.200
very fattening.

02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.280
FU to food for making me fat.

02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:45.280
That's my FU.

02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.640
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:52.120
username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:53.440
We're not ready for that just yet.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.400
We have a couple more stories for you.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:02.320
Capcom would like to remind you that Street Fighter II has turned 20.

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:06.480
It's been 20 years since the game was released in arcades in 1991.

02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:14.200
It's seen six arcade iterations and of course a ton of ports across consoles, PCs, and handhelds.

02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:17.960
And definitely one of the top arcade games out there.

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:23.080
They are still assholes though for charging $5 for download content for Marvel vs. Capcom

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.280
3, I'd like to add.

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:31.680
But happy birthday, Street Fighter, and your 20 different iterations to go with those 20

02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:32.680
years, right?

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:36.680
Pretty soon Street Fighter IV will have just as many.

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:39.600
Which is one of the more interesting launch games on the 3DS, might I add, a game that

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:44.600
I played, what, a year and a half ago, two years ago for the first time?

02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:48.440
It's, it's, you know Dead or Alive is not a launch game anymore?

02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:53.720
Yeah, no, I, it's a launch window game, I'm sorry, that's not a launch game, okay, a launch

02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:55.640
game is a game that comes out day one.

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.960
That is a launch game.

02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.920
I'd even give you a week or two after that.

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:02.580
A game that comes out two months after that is not a launch game.

02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.520
That is a launch window game.

02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.080
Well my launch window is four years after the console comes out.

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:09.000
It's a launch game.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.100
That's Nintendo for ya, thanks.

02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:13.640
Way to, way to spin that.

02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:17.040
Oh, we don't have a lot of games on our system, but that's okay because we considered the

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.520
launch four years after it comes out.

02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:23.000
Alright, Angry Loki, let's move on to another story.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:29.240
This is about Steam and Steam possibly invading your television, that's right, here's a quote

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.580
from Doug Lombardi, the Vice President of Marketing for Valve from earlier this week

02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:36.160
in preparation for Game Developers Conference.

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.760
Our partners and customers have asked us to make Steam available in more places.

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:43.280
With the introduction of Steam on the Mac and soon in Portal 2 on the Playstation 3,

02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:44.600
we've done just that.

02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:48.460
With big picture mode, gaming opportunities for Steam partners and customers become possible

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:53.920
via PCs and Macs on any TV or computer display in the house.

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:59.320
So it's not necessarily there's gonna be some type of like little hookup kit or something,

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:04.620
it's that they're talking about actually putting your PC games on the television, a big picture

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:11.000
mode and I guess a controller friendly version when you wanna play on your TV.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.200
That's pretty cool.

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.520
More plans were announced to Game Developers Conference this past week.

02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:20.240
But you know, I think a lot of you are just gonna wait and get Portal 2 on the consoles

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.000
if you're not gonna, if you don't already have it planned on the PC, not to disrespect

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.400
those that do their gaming on the PCs cause they'll certainly be a lot of people buying

02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.400
it there.

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:32.880
Or I don't know, I gotta admit that Playstation 3 deal where you get it in both places looks

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:33.880
awesome.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.120
And the whole where you buy Playstation 2, or absolutely, you buy Portal 2 on the Playstation

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:42.440
3 and then you get the Steam copy on PC for free, I think that's how you gotta do it.

02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:46.040
Microsoft's gonna be hurting to sell copies of that.

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.040
We'll see.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:51.440
Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:52.440
is ORANGELAUNGERADIO.

02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:56.240
The Skype line is open right now for you guys to give us a call.

02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.880
While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.040
Uh, I don't know.

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.040
Maybe.

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.560
Um, let's see here.

02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:14.200
I'm trying to think of what we haven't covered yet, other than my hatred for what Nintendo's

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:20.800
doing with the 3DS.

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:24.240
There was some new hackers, well not really hacker, but stuff that's going on with the

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.680
whole George Hotch thing and being sued.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:35.160
Apparently there's some drama over the third party company that Sony, or I should say the

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:39.760
law office, the court has going through his hard drives.

02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:44.840
Apparently Sony's trying to get a copy of the hard drive for themselves, even though

02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:49.720
third party's supposed to be the only ones looking at the hard drive basically, but Sony

02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:53.720
wants to know what's on there and possibly the steal information it sounds like, or maybe

02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:55.920
manipulating the system a little bit.

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:59.000
So people are kind of up in arms about that.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I don't know.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.400
This is kind of interesting also.

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:09.880
The NGP, I guess the games of course, they're coming on kind of a cartridge or memory card

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:11.120
type device.

02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:18.880
They're going to be coming on 2 and 4 gigabyte cards with room for game saves and patches

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:23.560
because the actual system will not have any on board storage, or at least that's what

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:24.800
the thought is.

02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.680
Is that kind of one of the ways they're trying to get around all the hacking?

02:20:27.680 --> 02:20:32.440
I don't think it's going to work because the way I'm thinking it now, what are you going

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:35.300
to save your downloaded games to then?

02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:40.200
Because obviously they're going to have some sort of online market or something like that,

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.120
and I know it has a second memory card slot for stuff like that.

02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:54.000
So it might be a way to get around it, but it didn't work for the Nintendo DS.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.580
Are they trying to do it maybe because it's a non-standard format or something?

02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:05.120
Maybe just to make it easy, but I'm sure it's got to be some sort of...

02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:09.280
It's partly probably anti-piracy.

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:10.280
And then...

02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:15.860
Again, the phone number 1877-GAMELR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:18.740
If you want to get through tonight, I would advise calling now because the way these things

02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:22.840
go is I say the number like 20 times and nobody ever calls, and then suddenly, just at the

02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:25.240
last minute, everybody calls at once.

02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:29.000
And then I say, well, we've taken enough calls, so I'm just saying.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.120
Get in early.

02:21:30.120 --> 02:21:38.980
Microsoft has gone the route of Spore, where you can basically take your avatars now.

02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:44.920
You can create poses or whatever with them, and then you can get jumbo wall prints of

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:45.920
your avatar.

02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:51.020
If you want to put yourself up on the wall, you can get a 16 gigabyte zoom with your avatar

02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:56.200
on it etched in, or a $60 figurine of your avatar.

02:21:56.200 --> 02:22:00.960
And of course, the wall print's gonna cost you $150, so that better be damn big, and

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:04.360
the zoom will cost you $170 with the figurine, $60.

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:09.520
So that'd be kind of neat to have at my desk.

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.520
Not the wall print.

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:11.520
That's retarded.

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.520
That's gonna cost you a bit of money, though, isn't it?

02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:15.360
Yeah, I'd probably wait.

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:19.000
But I'd want to see what these things look like in the size, because I'm not gonna pay

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.400
$60 for, like, a three inch, you know, statue.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.400
Better be something pretty significant.

02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:25.400
Alright, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:26.400
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:27.400
Who's this?

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.400
Hi, this is Bazzinator.

02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:29.400
Hey, Spazzinator.

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.400
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:37.680
Uh, yeah, I'm just calling in about the whole home thing that you were mentioning earlier.

02:22:37.680 --> 02:22:42.080
Yeah, about the whole upgrades in home, where they're gonna have more built-in stuff.

02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:43.080
What do you think of all that?

02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:53.120
Well, I'm probably in the minority here in this, but my whole opinion kind of goes along

02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:54.960
the lines of, who cares?

02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:02.080
I mean, you know, you kind of sort of touched on it a little bit to a degree, but when you

02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.760
said, you know, when are they gonna do anything with the club houses?

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:07.760
Yeah.

02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:14.720
I mean, you know, there's so much they could be doing with home to make it a little bit

02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:15.720
more interesting.

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:22.920
Like, if you look right and well, it's kind of hard to, you know, talk about something

02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:27.520
unless you're really looking at it, but you know how the one wall behind the stage is

02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:32.160
supposed to be, like, a video screen in the clubhouse?

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:33.160
Yeah.

02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:39.960
Like, they could be doing something with the video screen, like, you guys could be showing

02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:45.360
off some of the videos that you guys have made for Orange Lounge.

02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:49.400
I will tell you this much, the minute that Sony allows us to put some type of video on

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:55.320
that monitor, I'll do something exclusive video content-wise that won't even be on YouTube.

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.880
We will only put it in Sony Home.

02:23:57.880 --> 02:23:59.480
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:03.280
My camera is still in a box, because I don't see that happening.

02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:10.400
Yeah, you could, you know, there's always that, and also, you know, with our own private

02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:17.280
spaces, you know, whether it be the log cabin space or the default one, whatever you happen

02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:25.520
to have, you know, they could sell, like, virtual jukeboxes and virtual TVs.

02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:33.240
They'll allow you to stream all the MP3s that you got on your PS3's hard drive, or the video

02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:39.080
content that you had filed through the video servers, or what have you.

02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:43.320
Although I'm with you to a point here, Spaznator, I gotta ask this question, I gotta play Devil's

02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:45.520
Advocate and ask this question.

02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:51.860
Since the PlayStation 3 is a gaming system, why not have enhancements to the gaming mechanisms

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:55.600
within Home and making the gaming within Home better?

02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.120
Well, there's that too.

02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:09.080
I can certainly see your point, but, you know, perhaps Bobby Blackwood likes and loves to

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:18.800
point out from time to time, I'm really heavily into the whole PlayStation 3, more so than

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:19.800
my 360.

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:20.800
No!

02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:27.160
Your 360 handle, I'm not gonna give away your 360 handle, but it has PSN in it, and that

02:25:27.160 --> 02:25:30.720
always cracks me up that PSN is in your 360 handle.

02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:36.360
Yeah, well, my point being, you know, you would think, you know, with that being said,

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:43.560
you know, I would be all over Home, like, here on the gorilla, but the thing is, I really

02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:47.000
haven't touched Home in, God knows how long.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:54.080
And the last time I even bothered with Home the last time is because someone in the All

02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:01.140
Games community said the invite to join them in Home, and that was about that.

02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:04.080
There's nothing to do in there but dance with furries right now.

02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.740
But hopefully Sodium 2 will bring people back, if not at least for a day, while everybody's

02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:11.520
curious and checks it out, right?

02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:17.160
Yeah, but, you know, if they implemented some of the ideas that I'd just thrown out, you

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.640
know, I would be using Home left and right, you know.

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:26.280
But, you know, until then, you know, the only reason I would even consider using it is I

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:31.840
would have to be bored out of my mind, like borderline comatose bored, you know?

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:35.120
Well, maybe you need to go to Game Developers Conference and tell them your ideas, I don't

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.120
know.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.120
All right.

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:38.120
Well, as far as they are, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so

02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:39.120
much for the call, buddy.

02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:40.120
Take care.

02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:41.120
Yeah, sure, have a good one.

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:42.120
All right.

02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:44.800
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:48.560
By the way, screen filled up with phone calls while Spaz was on the line.

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.560
What did I tell you?

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.920
What did I tell you?

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:53.680
The minute one person tries to call, then everybody's gonna try to call.

02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:54.680
So there you go.

02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:55.680
It is open now.

02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:56.680
We'll see if somebody gets through.

02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.040
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:01.720
Any other last minute stories that we have?

02:27:01.720 --> 02:27:04.760
Logie's looking for stuff for after the show, so I don't know.

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:05.760
I guess, is that it?

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:06.760
You done?

02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:07.760
No, I've got stuff.

02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:08.760
Oh, okay.

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:15.160
O-L-A is becoming a game that's gonna be downloadable on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:20.200
Being developed by Konami, so, you know, I guess that's needed.

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.200
I don't know.

02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:22.280
It's a movie game.

02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.280
So what do you expect?

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:24.280
Hopefully that'll be coming out soon.

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.280
Oh, next month.

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.280
Yeah.

02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:32.080
It's right in time for the movie, I guess, considering it comes out like in a week.

02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:35.880
It is being developed by the people that did Time Shift, Saber Interactive.

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.200
Yay, we got more calls coming in.

02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:39.200
Yay.

02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:40.200
Let's go to the phones.

02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:41.200
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.200
Who's this?

02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:43.200
Hey, it's Ron.

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:44.200
How are you guys doing tonight?

02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.320
Of course, because when I say, you know, get through now, you know how to get through the

02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:49.920
system and beat everybody else.

02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:52.760
It's, it's, I don't know, you've got some type of psychic prowess.

02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:54.120
I don't know what it is.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.560
It's a blessing and a curse.

02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.560
It's a blessing for you, a curse for us.

02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.560
No, I'm kidding.

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.560
Funny.

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:01.560
All right.

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.120
First thing, I just wanna say, Logie, welcome back.

02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.840
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:06.840
Thank you.

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:07.840
You got it.

02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:08.840
Thank you.

02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.080
But don't ever talk like that in the opening of the show ever again, am I right?

02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.080
Maybe.

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.080
Just kidding.

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:16.080
Yeah.

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:22.200
In regards to what Logie said about the re-release of Mario All-Stars for the Wii, this is not

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:25.720
the first time Nintendo has pulled something like this.

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:26.720
Yeah.

02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:27.720
Oh, yeah.

02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:34.000
I'm just reminded of when DDO Mario Mix came out and everyone went nuts and bought it and

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.480
then you found out, oh, we're no longer making copies of this game, and I remember my friends

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:48.040
going on eBay, spending up to 80 to 100 bucks for the game, the special dance pad, and both.

02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:54.680
I do remember that, oh yeah, those were selling for crazy money for a while, and then, what

02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.680
happened?

02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:56.680
Reprint.

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.240
Hey, even more recent than that, the Wii system.

02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:06.600
Everyone was like, oh, hey, we can't make enough of these, they're just so hard to put

02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:11.000
together, such advanced technology that's been around since the GameCube, how do we

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
do it?

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Yeah.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.440
Yeah, like I'm supposed to believe there was a shortage on those that wasn't on purpose.

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.320
Sure, whatever you say, Nintendo, I'll believe you.

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:26.560
Oh, God.

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:30.040
So what do you think about the 3DS?

02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:36.520
I really want one, but to be perfectly honest, I think I'm going to do what SSJ100Matt said.

02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:37.760
Wait a while.

02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.760
Just see.

02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:39.760
Yeah.

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:40.760
That's good advice.

02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:42.800
You know, you asking about all this Nintendo stuff, though, reminded me.

02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:47.000
I had a big question I was going to ask Loki in part A when we were doing all the 3DS stories.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.400
He was so ranty, I got completely sidetracked, so I'm going to ask it now with you on the

02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:52.400
line, Robin.

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:54.040
He's just making it for last week, so yeah.

02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:55.040
I know, I know.

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:56.040
He's got to do double duty this week.

02:29:56.040 --> 02:29:58.080
No, I want to ask this question, because this is a serious question.

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:03.440
This is one I was talking the other day with some people about is, what's the Wii going

02:30:03.440 --> 02:30:05.120
to give us this year?

02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:12.000
Like, Nintendo at E3 this year, we know they're going to announce a Mario game for 3DS, duh.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.680
We know they'll be talking about the other 3DS titles throughout Christmas.

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:17.560
What have they got going on the Wii right now?

02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:19.280
Skyward Sword, that's about it.

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:22.840
And they're dragging that shit out as long as possible.

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:28.920
Is it possible, not to sound fanboy-esque here, but is it possible that Zelda was pushed

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:32.560
back because this is the year they're going to announce a Wii HD?

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:33.560
No.

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:35.760
And not a Wii 2, but a Wii HD.

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:41.520
No, this is exactly what happened to the last Metroid Other M. You know, they announced

02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:45.120
it way too damn early, it gets delayed forever.

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:48.640
It's just like the Metroid Prime trilogy.

02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:54.440
They're just pushing shit back longer and longer, and they keep announcing stuff well

02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:59.960
and too much in advance, just so they have something to fill up their E3 press conference

02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.960
with.

02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:04.320
Because, I mean seriously, if they cut out all the stuff that's supposed to be coming

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:10.520
out this year, I mean, well they announced Skyward Sword, and that was a big part of

02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:11.520
their thing.

02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:15.320
And I bet you right now it's going to be a big part of their press conference, you know,

02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:16.320
coming soon.

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:19.600
Either there'll be a Just Dance 3, that they can always, you know, have.

02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:20.600
Exactly.

02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:26.240
I mean, that's just a no-brainer, but from Nintendo themselves, I would assume a new

02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:33.880
Pikmin game, which is great for people that like it, but honestly, I could, I don't care.

02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:34.880
It's not a game I'm interested in.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.880
It's different to play a whole lot of Pikmin.

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:39.080
I think so.

02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:42.980
I don't know, there's a part of me that feels like now is the time for Nintendo to come

02:31:42.980 --> 02:31:48.400
out and say, and maybe, it's gotta be next year, if not this year, it's got to be next

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:49.400
year.

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:50.800
Because the 3DS will be standard by then.

02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:53.920
And they've gotta come out and say, okay, here's the next Wii.

02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:58.600
But I don't think it would be the Wii 2, so much as it would be comparing the DS to the

02:31:58.600 --> 02:31:59.600
DS Lite.

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:02.280
If it's the Wii 2, is it the Wii Wii?

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:03.520
Shut up.

02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:11.560
I would think if they're going to release an HD system like that, then what they're

02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:16.920
going to have to do is do something more along the lines of the DS and the DSi, where it

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:21.840
plays the old Wii games, it plays the GameCube games, but it also plays these new HD Wii

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:22.840
games.

02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:23.840
And why wouldn't it?

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:28.760
I mean, because one thing that Nintendo has done pretty well is the whole, I guess really

02:32:28.760 --> 02:32:33.960
it's only been on the one series of games, backwards compatibility, with the Wii, every

02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.680
GameCube game is playable on the Wii.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.400
Well, I mean, for the portable systems, it's been pretty good.

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:39.400
That's true.

02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:43.680
It's had the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that, and Game Boy Advance had the Game Boy.

02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:47.360
When you were doing cartridge formats, you kind of couldn't, so I get that.

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.480
But you know, you get the sense that if there is going to be a Wii HD or whatever, a Wii

02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:56.440
D, I like that, there's going to be a Wii, then it's got to be backwards compatible with

02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:59.200
everything else from GameCube on up.

02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:02.400
But I mean, it's an interesting idea as that sounds.

02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:03.800
I don't think they're going to do it.

02:33:03.800 --> 02:33:04.800
Why?

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:08.120
Because they feel that graphics aren't really an issue for people.

02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:13.840
It's all about gameplay, and that's why they're not going to embrace that type of mentality.

02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:18.080
Because why should they put out a new console that has better graphics on it?

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:20.080
People don't care.

02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:23.480
According to them, people don't care, and really, they're just going to be releasing

02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:24.840
quality games.

02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:27.720
Same reason with the whole online argument.

02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:28.720
They don't care.

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.060
People don't care about online.

02:33:30.060 --> 02:33:32.960
They just want to play family games and party games.

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:34.200
That's what the Wii's for.

02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.320
It's for families and stuff like that.

02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.480
Well, once again, the Wii was supposed to be something that was, hey, we're going to

02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:46.240
break the mold and make it so that the system isn't just for kids and stuff, it's for everybody,

02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:47.240
but they didn't.

02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:49.440
Sorry, I'm laughing about this in our chat room.

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:52.760
Spazinator says, Wii 2 would be Wii-Nii in Japanese.

02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:53.760
Haha, Wii-Nii.

02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:54.760
Get it?

02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.720
That name will never get old.

02:33:57.720 --> 02:33:59.160
Alright, fine.

02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:00.160
You make a good point.

02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:02.640
Maybe this will be the year we finally fucking get F-Zero on the Wii.

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:03.640
How about that?

02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:04.640
No, not going to happen.

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:05.640
Why not?

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.640
You're ruining everything.

02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:10.080
No, you have to understand, what you're going to get is you're going to get New Super Mario

02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:11.080
Brothers 2.

02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:12.080
No!

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:13.080
It's just going to have some different levels and stuff.

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:14.080
What goddamn F-Zero game?

02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:19.400
Wait, I can go for New Super Mario Brothers 2, but if Nintendo re-releases Super Mario

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:23.480
Brothers 64 for the 3DS, I will nerd rage.

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:30.280
I'm telling you, look, despite all the hatred, all the vicious, vile hatred that Loki's been

02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:35.080
throwing out of Nintendo this entire show, I am telling you, if Reggie comes out at E3

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:41.440
and announces the Wii HD with F-Zero as a launch title, I will jump on stage and do

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:42.440
something very naughty.

02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:43.440
I would not buy it.

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:44.440
He's going to snog him.

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.440
No, I'm sorry.

02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:46.440
I would not buy it.

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.440
He's still kissing one of the lips.

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:52.560
I have a Wii that's gathering dust because I don't play it, and there's nothing I want

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:53.560
to play on it.

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:54.560
We loaned our Wii out.

02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:59.200
I mean, I could play New Super Mario Brothers on it, or Mario Galaxy 2 or something like

02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:02.600
that, but I haven't even finished Galaxy, so I don't know why I'd want to play Mario

02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:04.600
Galaxy 2.

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:05.600
It doesn't interest me.

02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:09.100
The only thing that interests me, and this is going back to, once again, what they could

02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:12.960
have done right with Mario Kart, is the modded tracks for Mario Kart, because that sounds

02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:13.960
interesting.

02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:14.960
Ooh, new tracks for Mario Kart.

02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.680
I can go play that game again.

02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:18.800
Hell, what's to stop them?

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:21.720
Seriously, what is to stop them, other than the fact that they probably didn't program

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:26.960
DLC into Mario Kart, but let's just imagine a world where they are forward thinking and

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.340
actually did that.

02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:30.000
What's to stop them from saying, hey, you know what?

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.640
Instead of putting out a new Mario Kart game, we're just going to have this $10 expansion

02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:36.620
that's going to add 16 new tracks to the game.

02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:38.040
People would be damn excited about that.

02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:39.040
That would be awesome.

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.040
But they're not going to do that.

02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:47.080
This is such a forward thinking company that they're like, oh, patches to games, we don't

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:48.080
need that.

02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:49.080
Games are perfect when they come out.

02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:50.960
There's never going to be glitches that we'll need to fix.

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:54.720
No, let's not even bother putting a system in there for that.

02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:58.920
Did you hear that David Jaffa, completely random tangent, did you hear that David Jaffa

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:03.540
was out there at a game developers conference, and I was reading some article about he said

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:09.720
that companies should be limited to only three patches in a calendar year and they should

02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:13.760
not be allowed to patch a game until at least six weeks after release.

02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.480
No, because you know what all that's going to do is that's just going to leave a broken

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:18.480
game for longer.

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:19.480
I know what he's thinking.

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:24.120
He's thinking, oh, if we limit them to this, then they have to make sure the game is working

02:36:24.120 --> 02:36:25.360
and spend extra time.

02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:26.520
No, they don't give a shit.

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:29.120
They'll just wait longer for it to be fixed.

02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:30.120
That's all that's going to create.

02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:33.960
And he should shut the hell up and just make his Twisted Metal and God of Wars and be done

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:38.200
with it because his crappy Calling All Cars game was terrible.

02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.960
And he talks too much, and he's seriously annoying.

02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:43.840
Damn, Loki, why don't you switch to decaf?

02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:44.840
He complained.

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:45.840
He's like, I made God of War!

02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:46.840
I know everything!

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:48.600
Oh, I made Twisted Metal!

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:50.680
You know, he's a dumbass.

02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:55.080
He's just like Cliffy B and fucking, you know, or actually it wasn't even him, it was Mark

02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.160
Rain with Epic Games, you know, said, oh, you know, he was saying, like, the Wii's terrible.

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.800
And all of a sudden, oh, hey, you know, maybe we should develop games for the Wii because

02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:03.800
it's popular!

02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:07.280
I mean, so wishy-washy.

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:12.040
But no, seriously, that's a dumb idea with limiting people to patches and stuff like

02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.040
that.

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:18.560
I think even some companies, I want to say, it's either Microsoft or Sony charges companies

02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:21.600
for putting out patches or title updates for their games.

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:24.040
I want to say, probably Microsoft that does that.

02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:26.800
They'd like them to put out.

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:31.800
So I don't know, I just don't think it's a good idea.

02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:37.040
What they should do, though, is if games are buggy, they should have some sort of, I don't

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:41.180
know, penalize the developer somehow for putting out buggy games.

02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.080
They have to figure out a system to do that.

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:46.160
Make it more expensive to patch?

02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:48.780
No, because once again, it just leaves broken games.

02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:51.840
Because look at Activision, like, you know, Black Ops and stuff like that.

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.960
There's a lot of stuff that's just broken with that game, and it took them forever to

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:58.400
patch that stuff.

02:37:58.400 --> 02:37:59.400
It's just...

02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:02.320
A lot of times you just don't care.

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.360
They don't care because their game's selling like crazy, and so what if it's buggy or you

02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.360
bought the game?

02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:08.840
They already have the money from you.

02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:13.860
And in all sense, actually, they already had the money from you before you even bought

02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:17.340
the game because somebody's got to buy the game to put the game in the store.

02:38:17.340 --> 02:38:21.760
So unless you're buying it directly from them, they have your money already.

02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:23.240
They have the game store's money.

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:27.040
Well, Rama, thanks for sitting on the line while Loki bitches.

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.040
Appreciate it.

02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:32.360
I'm glad to do my dutiful duty as a proud member of the O.L. Army.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.840
There's going to be so much Nintendo fanboy hate mail this week.

02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:35.840
I can't wait.

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:36.840
All right.

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.040
Well, Rama, thank you, as always, for your call.

02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:42.040
Have a good one, buddy.

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:43.040
Later.

02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:44.040
Too bad Loki took up all your time.

02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:46.040
All right.

02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:47.040
I'm kidding.

02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.200
You know what?

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:51.540
I've had friends tell me the best part of the show is when Loki gets mad at something.

02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:52.880
Well, no.

02:38:52.880 --> 02:38:53.880
It's just annoying.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:56.240
It's just honesty.

02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.720
It's just how it is.

02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:02.560
Game companies now, they know that they don't have to put out a perfect game.

02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:04.200
They can just release it buggy.

02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:08.480
They get a few more sales out there because they don't have to wait for development.

02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:13.560
Then they patch it later on when they let people basically test it out.

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:18.360
Why should they hire beta testers when they can go ahead and have the public test it out

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:21.120
and they figure out what all the bugs are, read their forms or whatever.

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.280
Go fix those bugs and then let it percolate a little bit more and see if there's any other

02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:28.240
bugs.

02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:30.280
It will save them a little bit of money on the back end.

02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:37.200
Maybe they, for example, the developers or whatever of these games, have deadlines with

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:41.840
their publishers and publishers will pay them bonuses if they hit their deadlines.

02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:45.320
Why would they wait extra time to polish a game when they can just release it?

02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:48.840
It still sells a lot and they get their extra bonus.

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:50.680
That's how the game industry works.

02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:57.880
Fortunately since now these games can be patched on the fly, there's less focus on putting

02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:01.640
out a game that's not buggy from the beginning.

02:40:01.640 --> 02:40:03.520
Alright well that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:05.200
Thanks to those of you guys that got through.

02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:07.440
To those who didn't get through, call sooner next time.

02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:10.360
Probably could have fit in another call or two if we had some sooner.

02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.440
Alright but for now we're going to go ahead and close the Skypline.

02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.720
If you do want to elaborate on some thoughts though or you want to respond to Loki, mailbag

02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:18.920
at orangehonestreader.com is a great place to do it or on our Twitter at twitter.com

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:19.920
slash o-l-r.

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:23.360
But for now it's going to be about 9 o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast.

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:26.720
It's probably about time we start to wrap up the show with some final thoughts.

02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:27.840
Let me check in real quick.

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:34.280
Any other last minute stories we want to throw in before we wrap up the show?

02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:35.280
Let's see here.

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:36.960
I don't think so.

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:40.720
We'll have a lot of fun stuff coming from PAX East and I expect those of you guys that

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:43.880
are at PAX East next week, I want phone calls.

02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:44.880
This is kind of neat I guess.

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:48.760
Infamous 2 is going to let you create your own missions.

02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:51.680
There's something, you know, it doesn't even have to be a Mario Kart type game.

02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.080
You can just have a game where you just create your own levels and stuff and people eat that

02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:57.920
shit up now.

02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:59.960
That's what the trend is nowadays.

02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:00.960
That play, share, create.

02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:01.960
Sony gets it.

02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:02.960
Somewhat.

02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:03.960
Home sucks.

02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:07.600
But you can't be right all the time.

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:08.760
Alright.

02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:10.440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:11.440
I'm getting worried.

02:41:11.440 --> 02:41:13.360
Loki might need to get some eyeball here pretty soon.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:15.680
No, I'm just giving you a hard time.

02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:16.680
Just menstruating.

02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:18.680
Alright, he's menstruating all over the place.

02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:19.680
I'm just...

02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:20.680
Copyright.

02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:21.680
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:22.680
One more last thing.

02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:23.680
Oh please!

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:24.680
By all means.

02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:25.680
And this is just a rumor I guess.

02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.880
It's a rumor that Strider and Frank West are coming as download content.

02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:29.520
Those will be $5 each too!

02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:30.520
Thank you Capcom.

02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:33.240
I will pay $5 for Strider Hear You.

02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:34.240
I know, I was like...

02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.240
Is this with Dan and the other room?

02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:39.880
I was like, the minute that word Strider left your mouth, I'm like, oh, Jamie and Dan will

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:40.880
get it.

02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:41.880
No questions.

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:44.200
I really want to play the old Strider NES game.

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:47.120
I know you guys don't like it as much as the Genesis one, but I fondly remember...

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:48.520
The Genesis one's authentic.

02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:50.840
I fondly remember the NES one from my childhood.

02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:51.840
I really want to play that again.

02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:52.840
It's been a long time.

02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:55.680
You should come over some time and play through Strider 2 with us.

02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:56.680
On the Genesis?

02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:57.680
No, no, no, no.

02:41:57.680 --> 02:41:58.680
The PS...

02:41:58.680 --> 02:41:59.680
Oh!

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:00.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:01.680
Oh god.

02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:02.680
It's such a fun game.

02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:03.880
It's super easy, but it's lots of fun.

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:04.880
Fun is what's important.

02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:05.880
Alright, Loki.

02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:06.880
Anything else?

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:07.880
That's it.

02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:08.880
You sure?

02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:09.880
I'm done.

02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:10.880
Alright.

02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:11.880
Do you need some, you know, Allways or something?

02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:12.880
Alright.

02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:13.880
Anyhow.

02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:17.880
Let's go ahead and wrap up the show tonight by going around in Garibay's final thoughts.

02:42:17.880 --> 02:42:18.880
Dark Sakura.

02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.800
I'm sure glad Loki's back after a C-section.

02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:26.120
My final thought tonight is...

02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:27.120
Ow.

02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:29.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Uh...

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.960
I don't know.

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:35.720
I thought with a week being off I'd be able to get more done with the Grand Theft Auto

02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:39.520
stuff, but some things just take time, I guess, when it comes to modding this stuff.

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.320
And also, I will still be angry at Nintendo because they just continue to disappoint.

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:44.320
I can't help it.

02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:48.960
If you make stupid decisions, I'm just gonna call you out on it.

02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:49.960
Alright.

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:52.360
We'll have plenty more next week on the show.

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.800
Dark Sakura, sadly not joining us next week.

02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:55.800
I won't be sad, though.

02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.240
But we, I know you won't, but we will be back with another edition of Orange Launch Radio.

02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:00.240
I don't know if we'll have a...

02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:01.240
I'll call in from the road.

02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:03.520
I don't know if we'll have a temp co-host or what we'll do.

02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:04.520
You have to call me.

02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:05.520
Uh...

02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:06.520
What's that?

02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:07.520
You have to call me.

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:08.520
We can.

02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:09.520
Yeah.

02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:10.520
So...

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:11.520
On the road.

02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:12.520
Yep.

02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:13.520
That's it.

02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:16.840
We'll do this all again next week, but in the meantime, that's another week of Orange

02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:17.840
Launch Radio.

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:20.800
Remember, of course, if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, we are

02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.240
not a gigantic website with millions of hits.

02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:28.000
We don't have a magazine that backs us or a gaming company that backs us.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.640
We don't throw a bunch of commercials in your face.

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.640
So all we ask, if you enjoy Orange Launch Radio, tell some friends about the show.

02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:38.160
The example at the start of the show where a friend was playing it at his LAN party,

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:41.240
perfect example, is an awesome A-plus move.

02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:42.920
So just tell people about the show.

02:43:42.920 --> 02:43:44.880
Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:48.760
Get us some more voices to bring to the table here at the show.

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:51.360
Don't send DarkSakura a dollar.

02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:54.600
But come back next week for more of Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:58.560
You've been listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:02.280
Orange Launch Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:10.920
To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific time.

02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:16.280
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Launch Radio do not necessarily reflect those

02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:22.240
of the entire staff of Orange Launch Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right

02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:23.240
anyway.

02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:41.920
See you next week!
