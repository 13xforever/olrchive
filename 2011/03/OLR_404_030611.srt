00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:24,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, March 6, 2011, the PlayStation 3 stops shipping in one country, GameStop becomes the target of a class action lawsuit, and Microsoft clears up some old gamer tags.

2
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:36,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the interwebs and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It is that show about video games.

4
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:42,920
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show that brings every gamer a voice as we have over the past nine years.

5
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:48,864
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

6
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:50,245
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

8
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Shimei.

10
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:57,290
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

11
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:57,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Shimei.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Shemazel.

13
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we the Laverne and Shirley opening?

14
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:06,745
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be showing up on our photo feed shortly.

15
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:12,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Because today's alcoholism is brought to you by Chimay, which is tasty.

16
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:16,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, you're not drinking during the show again, because last week, oh boy, that was a rough show.

17
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:18,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch me.

18
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:18,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm drinking.

19
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello and welcome back.

20
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:22,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki is back with us tonight.

21
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:22,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

22
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,246
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

23
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:24,787
[SPEAKER_06]: You feeling better?

24
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:26,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We told all the listeners why you were gone.

26
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:29,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry if you want to keep it a secret.

27
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:29,634
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

28
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:30,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured you'd tweet about it.

29
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:31,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

30
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:31,737
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

31
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:33,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I told him that we played a song in Tribute.

32
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, we did play Living with a Hernia on our way out.

33
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:49,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it was something, I don't know, I guess it was something I had for a long time or something, but on Tuesday last week, all of a sudden, my innie became an outie, and it's like, oh, this kind of hurts.

34
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:50,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this hurting?

35
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:51,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to the doctor.

36
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:54,318
[SPEAKER_04]: The doctor said, hey, you better go.

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'm going to make an appointment with the surgeon right now so you can go get checked out.

38
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:01,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went to the surgeon's office, and they're like,

39
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:03,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We can take care of this right now if you want.

40
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, all right.

41
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:12,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did that, and it hurt like a bitch for, well, during the operation.

42
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, operations tend to hurt.

43
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:14,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they put you under?

44
00:02:14,913 --> 00:02:18,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, it's local, and that felt weird.

45
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:19,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I bet.

46
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:24,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, no, then it's just like really stiff and sore for a couple days.

47
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to point out they don't knock you out for a vasectomy either if you want to.

48
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:28,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that would.

49
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:29,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard.

50
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,504
[SPEAKER_04]: That probably wouldn't have hurt as bad as, you know.

51
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:34,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even really hurting, it's weird stuff.

52
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:44,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine someone putting their finger into your belly button underneath and then pulling muscle down or something like that.

53
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the feeling.

54
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,635
[SPEAKER_06]: The synchronized sounds of barfing.

55
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:56,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the feeling of someone electrocuting fat or something on you and popping and then smelling that fat burning.

56
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Once in a while we do talk about video games, I promise.

57
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I'm feeling better.

58
00:03:01,462 --> 00:03:02,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, did they turn the fat into bacon?

59
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:03,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not.

60
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:04,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not smell like bacon.

61
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:09,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even... Human flesh smells like chicken burning.

62
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not smell like chicken burning.

63
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not pleasant.

64
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:16,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not pleasant to feel it burning either.

65
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:24,753
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, look, all this gross medical talk house aside, hopefully you had a chance to play a lot of games while you were recovering.

66
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,034
[SPEAKER_04]: and so forth.

67
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:29,658
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an umbilical hernia.

68
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:34,483
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as I can remember, my belly button feels weird.

69
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:37,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like there was a tube on the other side or something like that.

70
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You never had a baby to lift before.

71
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know if it was that.

72
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your intestines hooked up to the wrong space?

73
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what happens with hernia is sometimes fat or tissue can get trapped inside of it, and then the circulation gets cut off and it dies.

74
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:56,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what started to happen with some of that, so that's why it started hurting.

75
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:03,799
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to get rid of that so that it wouldn't turn into gangrene or something.

76
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:21,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go to our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com let me read you some of the comments in our chatroom right now we are live at chat.orangeloungeradio.com OMFG Loki stop can't Loki just talk about Grand Theft Auto or Earth Defense Force instead Orange Lounge Trauma Center

77
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:23,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about both of those.

78
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:33,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the new little trailer or like behind the scenes, or not really a trailer, it was like a behind the scenes thing or a preview of Earth Defense.

79
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:36,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

80
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:37,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so awesome.

81
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:39,398
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

82
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:40,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

83
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:41,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

84
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:44,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to follow that up, but I guess we'll... No, I'm fine now.

85
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, I'm not supposed to be lifting anything or doing anything, but I feel fine.

86
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've been lifting my son and stuff.

87
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not like, you know... It's because you're secretly a cyborg.

88
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:58,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to go, you know, try to get more cat litter or something like that.

89
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:02,726
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a 30-pound... It's basically, if it hurts, stop doing it.

90
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:28,316
[SPEAKER_06]: uh well you were missed last week Loki but our aim's improving now that you're within targeting range because last week seriously we had a drunk Jamie we had the Oscars girl I was tipsy we had a drunk Jamie and then Mystique came in middle of the show and I don't even know what happened I did pretty good on my Oscar picks I think I haven't got a chance to be back to my work but I hope I won something that'd be kind of cool

91
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:33,344
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

92
00:05:33,424 --> 00:05:34,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I played well.

93
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:35,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn you.

94
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:36,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Addict.

95
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Dealer.

96
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:43,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I joined the Horde House Guild and made a death knight because I did not want to start from one.

97
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the interesting thing about having a new guild.

98
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my spinoff show, Horde House with Extover, has an official guild now.

99
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the details are on the last show.

100
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,554
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Goober server.

101
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:56,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, on what WowWiki calls a server full of bad players.

102
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:56,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to roll there.

103
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:57,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to roll there.

104
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:58,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Had to do it.

105
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything's starting from scratch.

106
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,781
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been very weird.

107
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:04,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I've run into nothing but assholes.

108
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:04,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

109
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:05,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for us.

110
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:08,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

111
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,907
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one nice person who wanted to group with me, but I'm like, I don't want to play with you.

112
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just been MMOs for you?

113
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:21,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, today I went in either room because I wanted to play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Dan was playing through Shinobi.

114
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:27,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So I sit down with my sleeping bag because it's really warm.

115
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:29,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was super cold.

116
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:33,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So I sat with my sleeping bag and I fell asleep to Shinobi and woke up to Ikaruga.

117
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that counts that I can sleep to video games.

118
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently at some point Dan beat it because I opened my eyes and saw the ending and I was like, whatever.

119
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:48,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's about it.

120
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:49,224
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

121
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:11,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we were talking about Rygar, the arcade game.

122
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, not the NES game that most everybody remembers.

123
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:14,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also an arcade game.

124
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:19,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was talking about the Tidal Arcade Classics that is on Xbox, the old school one.

125
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:21,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It has Rygar, it has Tecmo Bowl, a bunch of other stuff in it.

126
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:24,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And, like, I've been really wanting to play that.

127
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:28,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to it today, but, like, ever since our little conversation this morning, I've been dying to go back and play some Rygar.

128
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been like an old school arcade day.

129
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, I think, one of the backwards compatible games.

130
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:33,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

131
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:33,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

132
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,751
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I know I can play it.

133
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:35,832
[SPEAKER_07]: That came up in our discussion today.

134
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:36,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

135
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:39,903
[SPEAKER_06]: So, because I don't think Dan knew that it was backwards compatible and is one of the few.

136
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he checked.

137
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Taito had like the Rainbow Islands and Bubble Bobble.

138
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:45,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember what was in that collection.

139
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It was years ago that I first got it but now it's pretty awesome.

140
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:49,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Parasol Stars.

141
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of those arcade games kind of get recycled and they want to charge you five, ten bucks a piece for them.

142
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Parasol Stars.

143
00:07:54,454 --> 00:08:01,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I found a copy of Parasol Stars for a PC Engine and they wanted like a bunch of money for it which was retarded.

144
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

145
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:03,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was stupid.

146
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:05,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I offended some retarded people out there.

147
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:06,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

148
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:18,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to see if I could find the Taito Arcade Classics page, but I can't find it.

149
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,729
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an older game, so it's probably harder to find.

150
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to hear anything about Pokemans.

151
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:25,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you jealous?

152
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:28,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already heard about Pokemans from when Shane was playing through Pokemans.

153
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:29,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all old news.

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:59,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I find it fascinating how many people are going to get Pokemon Black and White on the 3DS even though you can play it on a DS Lite but because the launch lineup for 3DS is not as strong as it could have been there's a lot of people that want to use Pokemon to kind of fill in the gap Pokemon fans are pretty rabid so it's a big day for a lot of people Dan has announced that we are waiting for Star Fox to get our 3DS and I want Kid Icarus

155
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,127
[SPEAKER_06]: GameDevStory GameDevStory GameDevStory GameDevStory

156
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:37,395
[SPEAKER_04]: and so you can develop games and stuff like that and I'm just kicking ass at it and it's kind of funny though because

157
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:59,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes place during pre-Nintendo and stuff like that, but there's all these different systems with different names that are supposed to be those consoles, like the Nintendo IES or the Neon Geon, stuff like that.

158
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:03,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my company, Orange Lounge, here.

159
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me go over some of the past products that we have put out and that have sold well.

160
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:15,205
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, everything is really inappropriate, so that's awesome.

161
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:16,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Very awesome.

162
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our first games, Two Girls, One Cup, sold 847,000 units.

163
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's early on.

164
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:30,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemans, we put out a game called Pokemans, sold 2.7 million units.

165
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:47,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other more popular games, Fucked Your Mom, 4 million units, Pokemon 3, 11 million, You Is Stupid, which is our You Don't Know Jack game.

166
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:54,741
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course I ripped off other things obviously since Nintendo doesn't exist so we have Mario RPG as well.

167
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:59,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Online, 54 million copies.

168
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,528
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.

169
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course our last music game DDR, Olarmy, 46 million.

170
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:15,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on our console, the glory hole, because they happen to be watching the soup at the time.

171
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:21,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And our console is kicking the PlayStation's ass.

172
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:23,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

173
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:26,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta do a quick correction, so I apologize.

174
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I blended my companies together.

175
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:34,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rygar and Tecmo Bowl, of course, are in the Tecmo Classic Arcade Collection, not Taito.

176
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:42,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, a very similar sounding in my arcade classic knowledge failed me for a moment, but there's Tecmo Classic Arcade.

177
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:43,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the one that is backwards compatible.

178
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:48,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomb Jack, Rygar, Tecmo Bowl, Solomon's Key, lots of awesome ones.

179
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,791
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a separate game called Tidal Legends.

180
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:58,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember if this one was backwards compatible, but this was the one that had like the Bubble Bobble, Space Invaders, Elevator Action, New Zealand Story, and some of those games.

181
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oops!

182
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:02,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting old, sorry.

183
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:04,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And these games are how many years old?

184
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:11,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And funny enough, Frisbee, uh, Fucked Your Mom, the sequel, Fucked Your Dad, that is actually the sequel, so, uh, pretty funny.

185
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:17,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, but the game, it's all, like, done in pixel art, and it's, um, it's pretty fun.

186
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:31,194
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically, you hire people, fire people, you train them, that you can, uh, eventually get, like, uh, you can go to E3, or, I think they call it Game Dex, it's like, uh, Comdex, um,

187
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:36,759
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt wants to know what theyplay.com Snap is selling.

188
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an old school by the way.

189
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have that game yet.

190
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:43,182
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have to develop that game.

191
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:48,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just put out Call of Duty and sold 7 million units in the first week.

192
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:53,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't forget my dream game for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade would be Granny's Got a Gun.

193
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Granny's Got a Gun.

194
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,570
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the Golden Girls with machine guns.

195
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it's great though because you can see what your console, how it's doing and stuff in the marketplace.

196
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,160
[SPEAKER_04]: They even have the Virtual Boy.

197
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:15,586
[SPEAKER_04]: and all the console stuff since we kind of know what's going on with the game industry and everything.

198
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:19,668
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, here comes the virtual kid.

199
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 3D handheld or 3D portable.

200
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'll be developing on that because I think it's going away really fast.

201
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, it goes away really fast.

202
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the other ones.

203
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:33,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the Saturn, it's the Uranus.

204
00:13:36,385 --> 00:14:04,382
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's pretty fun Definitely worth picking up Game Dev Story And they have the new one They don't have it over here yet But they have some spa sim They have the spa sim over here Which is kind of dumb But they have a game store It's called the Game Dealer And you play like a GameStop type thing It's a similar game, Dev Story I've heard about that But yeah, definitely, Game Dev Story Check it out, it's awesome Alright

205
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:07,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then other things.

206
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

207
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

208
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:08,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto.

209
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:10,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course.

210
00:14:10,595 --> 00:14:12,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't be a week on OLR without Grand Theft Auto.

211
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:16,718
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, was that what you were playing a minute ago that was in like debug mode or something where you had the flying ice cream truck?

212
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,279
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was the PC version.

213
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:28,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on mod stuff for it because I've edited the water and everything to create this kind of a hydro thunder type track thing in there.

214
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:32,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm building, I've done the water part of it.

215
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Called Ice Cream Thunder.

216
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

217
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:34,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

218
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack in the Box Jack in the Box

219
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:37,035
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but you can... Some other map edit stuff I was working on, I was doing some tweaks to the physics of the bus and the ambulance, and so now I can clear Central Park with a ramp, which is awesome.

220
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That bus moves fast.

221
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:39,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

222
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:40,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

223
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:45,020
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to bring back something like hard drive and modernize it with more stunts.

224
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess you could say, well, like, Burnout or whatever.

225
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:50,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that would technically be... Well, yeah, I mean, like, I understand.

226
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:54,844
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as, like, that game Stunts, I guess that would be Trackmania.

227
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:56,024
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be kind of similar to Stunts.

228
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:56,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, Trackmania.

229
00:15:56,944 --> 00:16:01,526
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, as far as, like, a simulation racing game like that, I don't think they have that.

230
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, but hey, you know, EA, Need for Speed, you know, maybe some Need for Speed stunt game or something like that.

231
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:07,869
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

232
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my gaming week.

233
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,231
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the same stuff.

234
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really invested a lot in new games lately.

235
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:15,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I was tempted the other day, though, man.

236
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,055
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dreamcast Collection with Space Channel 5 Part 2.

237
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:23,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure, which are already out on Xbox Live Arcade.

238
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:29,160
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't because I figured the game I really, really want, it'll come out on Xbox Live Arcade eventually.

239
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I really, really, really wanted to play it, I could probably just borrow, you know, Alan's copy or Jamie's copy or something.

240
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:34,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

241
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:38,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just wait a little longer for some choo-choo in Space Channel 5 Part 2.

242
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:45,390
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as games I actually did play, went back, today I was feeling really old school for some reason.

243
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I went back and played Bionic Commando Rearmed because I was going through my Xbox games because I bought a lot of arcade games back in the day and I was like,

244
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:52,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

245
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:11,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can't forget.

246
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:15,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially for you folks who are just now getting Xbox 360s.

247
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:19,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I think sometimes you can get a little bit distracted by all the arcade games that are out there now.

248
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:25,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, there's a lot of old school stuff that's really pretty good out on Xbox Live Marketplace.

249
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So do your research because...

250
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

251
00:17:46,002 --> 00:18:00,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, as far as other games I played this week, I did check out the demo for one new game, Beyond Good and Evil HD, which is of course the big Xbox Live title that came out this week, which made a lot of people really excited because the original game has lots and lots and lots of fans, and

252
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:02,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me admit something to you guys.

253
00:18:02,393 --> 00:18:03,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really played the original.

254
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know it was like a huge game, had its fans on PC, PS2.

255
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:17,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think the original kind of came out during a time where I wasn't, either I was way too hardcore into the music games where I was missing a lot of this stuff, or I don't know.

256
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:21,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, there's not enough time in the day to play everything, so I missed this the first time around.

257
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But I checked it out this time, and I at least played through the demo, and I was left wanting to get the full version.

258
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool.

259
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So having not played the original, I can't sit here and profess to know a lot about what they upgraded, but I will tell you it was widescreen.

260
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:42,886
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely seemed like there was a lot of water effects that seemed to be somewhat new, and everything seemed to be very, very smooth.

261
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It did kind of look like an up-resed PlayStation 2 game, but that's okay.

262
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:55,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I hear a lot of people are really drawn to this game because of the story, and I know this game really throws you in right away.

263
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:57,753
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

264
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:21,941
[SPEAKER_06]: having to play the first 30 minutes or so in the demo was nice.

265
00:19:22,181 --> 00:19:28,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will check out more of that if I don't get too distracted by Torchlight next week because that is the Xbox Live game I am waiting for.

266
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the PC one.

267
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so excited to see how it translates to console.

268
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:37,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really worried I'm getting my expectations way too high that I'm going to be just left disappointed next week.

269
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,131
[SPEAKER_06]: But hopefully I can fit in Beyond Good and Evil HD too.

270
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,693
[SPEAKER_07]: According to GameGuru, Space Channel 5 is on Steam.

271
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:44,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it did.

272
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out, I believe, over the weekend on Steam.

273
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:48,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It just kind of suddenly showed up.

274
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if you want to check that out on the PC, that'd be cool.

275
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

276
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Those two games and some of the usual stuff.

277
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,401
[SPEAKER_06]: WoW and some other PC games and so forth.

278
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Meat Boy, getting frustrated.

279
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Tried some of those new levels that we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show.

280
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:07,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't even beat one.

281
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't even beat stage one on some of those really hard ones.

282
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:11,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Disgusting.

283
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:12,906
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow.

284
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:17,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some housekeeping and then we will get into the gaming news for tonight.

285
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:23,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot to say for housekeeping except DarkSakura sadly will not be joining us next week, but there will still be an OLR.

286
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki and I will be here.

287
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:27,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps a guest host.

288
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:28,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

289
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,359
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

290
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:29,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be in a car.

291
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're going far away.

292
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Far, far away.

293
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:34,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you have fun.

294
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go too far that you can't come back.

295
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:39,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we can go one week, but I don't know about two weeks.

296
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Not be back.

297
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:41,469
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

298
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

299
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:48,214
[SPEAKER_06]: You can join us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Laundry.

300
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:54,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Twitter, I'm peeking at it a little early tonight, and I thought this was a really funny tweet from Defective Candy sent us a tweet.

301
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm getting to Twitter early, so shoot me.

302
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Introducing OLR to seven of my friends tonight.

303
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:04,377
[SPEAKER_06]: We're partying it up with some old school Unreal LAN partying and tuning in.

304
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:07,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, shout out to you guys at the LAN party.

305
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,081
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty awesome.

306
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Kicking it old school with Unreal.

307
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:16,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, this might be a little more even old school than Unreal, but back in the day we used to get together and play Quake.

308
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:18,289
[SPEAKER_06]: That used to be kind of the big thing.

309
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,891
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like way before MMOs and all that.

310
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:21,892
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd get together and play Quake like online.

311
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a lot of fun.

312
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:24,455
[SPEAKER_07]: My first LAN was Duke Nukem 3D.

313
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:25,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah?

314
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I used to do that on the modem, the dial-up thing.

315
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of fun.

316
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:32,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Duke Nukem and Command & Conquer Red Alert were fun over the modem.

317
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:32,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

318
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I hope you guys are having fun and thanks for spreading the word of the show.

319
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:37,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

320
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the news.

321
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki's going to start us off tonight.

322
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

323
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Much busier week than last week, that's for sure.

324
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:51,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it helps to have stuff going on and conferences and whatnot.

325
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:59,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We did talk about this a little bit, that it was a possibility, especially with LG suing Sony over the Blu-ray technology.

326
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,203
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

327
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:25,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I only know what that's supposed to do for 10 days.

328
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:34,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the consoles collected are temporarily being held in Dutch warehouses until the case moves forward.

329
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:38,336
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, they're expected to...

330
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:56,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess retailers are expected to have enough PS3s the last 2 or 3 weeks so you may not necessarily see any shortages or something like that you may if this case goes further and they end up winning everything because somebody's going to have to pay them some money

331
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:03,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think maybe that's just what's going to ultimately happen, is that this all gets settled out of court to stop this from happening?

332
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It all depends.

333
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:08,385
[SPEAKER_04]: 90% of the game lawsuit stories end up settled out of court.

334
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:11,266
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends whether they feel they're in the right or not.

335
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: If Sony knows that they have no chance at winning this, then they probably won't fight it, but...

336
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: If they think that they're in the right and they don't need to pay them any royalties or whatever, they're going to fight it because it saves them money if they don't have to pay these royalties on every single console shipped.

337
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:36,038
[SPEAKER_06]: How damaging is this to Sony, do you think?

338
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:42,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I look at this and go, well, if they can't ship it to stores, are stores still okay for a little bit because stores have what's on hand?

339
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

340
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a shortage for 10 days.

341
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no big deal.

342
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

343
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:51,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like the PlayStation 3 has a must-have game coming out this week or something.

344
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:54,624
[SPEAKER_04]: People deal with shortages on stuff for a lot longer than 10 days.

345
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at the Wii.

346
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:56,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just fine.

347
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt this will make any sort of impact.

348
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just everybody likes reporting on this stuff because, ha-ha, Sony's getting their taste of legal battles since they're suing GeoHot and stuff like that.

349
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:09,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

350
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:11,133
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just...

351
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

352
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:14,376
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't say this is so much a patent troll thing.

353
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:14,776
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is not.

354
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:15,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

355
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well we'll see what comes of this.

356
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: The legal team at Sony working overtime these next couple weeks for sure.

357
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:41,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, big gaming news and kind of always divisive when I talk about Apple.

358
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:46,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And Apple did announce the iPad 2 is coming out March 11th and you bet this is gaming news because...

359
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks are gaming on the Apple these days with the iPhone and the iOS.

360
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:54,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, big system.

361
00:24:54,647 --> 00:25:00,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Controversial, too, if you want to get into the whole fact that they charge very little for the games on the iPhone.

362
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:04,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people have a problem with that, as we learned at GDC this week.

363
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:29,965
[SPEAKER_06]: but I digress iPad 2 was announced this week it is coming out on March 11th it will cost you anywhere between $629 and $829 if you want a unit with 3G lowest you can go though is $499 if you want the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi only up to $699 just throwing it out there too if you wanted to get the original iPad those are now sliced in price by $100 so those are now out as well

364
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:45,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the big things that are supposed to be coming out with the iPad 2, it's not just the fancy colors, but of particular interest is this cable that will allow you to hook up the iPad to your television and get the output in 1080p display, which is making a lot of people very excited.

365
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:51,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, streaming movies that are on the device makes it very easy to bypass the Apple TV and so forth in order to do that.

366
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:59,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people also wondering, could this have some feature for games going with it?

367
00:25:59,306 --> 00:26:04,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you could use the cord to have the iPad as a control device for something on your TV?

368
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Angry Birds HD No, I mean, who wants to be tethered to a TV?

369
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they have some sort of wireless thing, it's not

370
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Which quite frankly I'm surprised they don't through the whole Apple TV thing They may later on They can stream stuff through Apple TV and it could be something that comes through iOS later on We did have the story last week or two weeks ago about the whole people were playing PS3 games through the iOS was a whole thing that had been set up The technology is getting there and that has nothing to do with Apple themselves That was kind of a

371
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Filed in the Hack and Crack bin

372
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's a little in the reverse.

373
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:58,394
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not necessarily... I mean, playing PlayStation 1 emulated games, that's through the actual system that's running that.

374
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:04,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But streaming stuff from the PlayStation 3, though, that's a little bit different.

375
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:05,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just streaming video.

376
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I'm sure that the... Obviously, since the iPad 2 is a dual-core system, I'm sure it can handle streaming stuff, but...

377
00:27:15,062 --> 00:27:23,427
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the Apple TV goes, that thing is just like an Intel Atom little box.

378
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:29,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it has enough oomph to do 1080p.

379
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's capped at 720p because I think that's what iTunes is.

380
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,153
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that are out there now, yeah, 720p.

381
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:41,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me throw this question out there to you guys here in studio and the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

382
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:50,282
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of talk this week with this news and in the game blogs and so forth about the 3DS, which we'll get into some of that news in a little while, and the iPad 2.

383
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,731
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

384
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:10,752
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys kind of think?

385
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:15,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the 3DS really have to worry about iPad 2 or vice versa?

386
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:20,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do these things kind of coexist and neither really has to really worry about the other?

387
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:21,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So why are they dogging on each other?

388
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the latter, but you know how companies are.

389
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:27,002
[SPEAKER_07]: They like to look for drama where there isn't.

390
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:30,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, the rivalry is only good for both of them.

391
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:33,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Establishing some type of farcical rivalry.

392
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:34,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

393
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:44,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, Nintendo will never be able to compete with Apple as far as their online marketplace goes because their online marketplace is open.

394
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an open marketplace for all these developers to basically create these games, submit them, get approval, and then they are up on the marketplace really quickly.

395
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you get like...

396
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:56,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

397
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:23,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but see, that's what Nintendo needs, because, unfortunately, you're never gonna be able to compete the level with these guys if you're just releasing, like, three games a week, you know, on that.

398
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:27,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I'm sorry, but, you know, the virtual console stuff...

399
00:29:28,263 --> 00:29:29,004
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Cut the Rope, the stuff that's really good on iOS, of which there isn't much, but there are some really, really good games on there.

401
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:57,570
[SPEAKER_04]: There are good games on the iOS platform, and it's just some of these games that people just decide that they like.

402
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Angry Birds, I don't think is a great game.

403
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:01,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

404
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:02,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game that's popular.

405
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:05,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Sam's Frustrating Game is what it is.

406
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,098
[SPEAKER_04]: But the public disagrees.

407
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:09,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Public's dumb.

408
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:10,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's selling very well.

409
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, okay.

410
00:30:12,238 --> 00:30:13,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's all that either.

411
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer Cut the Rope.

412
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can say, okay, it's selling like... But exactly.

413
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, though?

414
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:21,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be surprised.

415
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:25,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no reason why they can't have Angry Birds on the Nintendo DS.

416
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:27,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, on the DSi.

417
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:29,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't they have Angry Birds on there?

418
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it should be able to run.

419
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:33,125
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP has it.

420
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a download game.

421
00:30:34,426 --> 00:30:36,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't... I mean, it came out way later.

422
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,067
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean...

423
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That's even the problem with the PSP.

424
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Their little online stuff, it's so closed that they just can't get games fast enough.

425
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:49,436
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to really open it up.

426
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:56,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think the closest thing to the App Store is probably the Xbox Indie games.

427
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Because your lease is there, you're seeing a lot of games coming out.

428
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:02,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, a lot of them are crap, but that's the same with the App Store.

429
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:03,483
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it is crap.

430
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:05,204
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you open it up...

431
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:08,726
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot more stuff comes out.

432
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:12,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, you're going to get a lot of crappy games, but you're also going to get a lot of good games.

433
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:23,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're smart and know how to highlight those good games and know how to push that platform forward, then that is good for you.

434
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:28,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with Nintendo, though, is if they do that and they start pushing that platform forward...

435
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to want to pay $50 for a game?

436
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:38,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then they can just get some really quality games for like 99 cents or a few bucks instead of $50.

437
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:43,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I pay $50 for a 3DS game like Zelda?

438
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:44,266
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's 3D!

439
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:45,506
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if it's 3D?

440
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:51,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that those digital download games aren't 3D.

441
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,591
[SPEAKER_04]: They could easily program for 3D.

442
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:59,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like there's going to be indie games that are going to support the Kinect eventually once they open it up for everybody.

443
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:03,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I have to pay that kind of money?

444
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they're complaining about.

445
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:10,204
[SPEAKER_04]: They're complaining about the fact that they think that these games are devaluing their games.

446
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:12,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, why do you think that?

447
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously if you think your games are so much better...

448
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:18,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

449
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to comments from our chat room.

450
00:32:32,637 --> 00:32:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com for some comments.

451
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:41,403
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTitsuya says, I think Nintendo's just jealous because they can't keep releasing all new hardware after a year the way Apple seems to.

452
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:42,643
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need to.

453
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:43,644
[SPEAKER_06]: They do, but they do.

454
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:48,607
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS Lite, the DS Lite in new colors, the DSi.

455
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:50,048
[SPEAKER_06]: The XL.

456
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:54,011
[SPEAKER_06]: As of lately, I would say they have been doing something new every year.

457
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:54,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the XL.

458
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:54,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

459
00:32:55,692 --> 00:32:59,934
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, that's even retarded too, because what's the point of making the system larger?

460
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:02,755
[SPEAKER_04]: How is this supposed to drive sales for you guys?

461
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I never understood that.

462
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make a portable system larger now.

463
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:07,037
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

464
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:07,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

465
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:10,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, oh, let's make the Game Boy Micro.

466
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,880
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru says Nintendo pretty much dumped every game they do own on the virtual console.

467
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least, well, every game they could dump.

468
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:21,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe a dig at EarthBound, because the whole trouble's there.

469
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not thinking...

470
00:33:21,923 --> 00:33:29,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is they're a few steps behind when it comes to embracing online.

471
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:33,448
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not where these first party companies are.

472
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not supporting download content as well.

473
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't there downloadable tracks for Mario Kart?

474
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:41,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

475
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's stupid simple.

476
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:47,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You could easily just put out all... Because the Wii can't handle it.

477
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:48,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know it can.

478
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:49,454
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii can handle it.

479
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:55,177
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, the problem with the Wii, though, is because they, you know...

480
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:56,818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

481
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's that easy, open it up like Mod Nation Racers.

482
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, you've got a community of people that are excited about a game.

483
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:25,883
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even start charging for some download content, different tools and stuff that you can put in there like LittleBigPlanet.

484
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,404
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make money off this.

485
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is they need to change their stupid business model in order for it to work.

486
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:35,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but I just don't see them ever embracing online like that.

487
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:43,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you this and then kind of try to close to this thought because I want to come, believe it or not, I want to come back to the Wii thing later in the show because I have another question about it.

488
00:34:43,598 --> 00:34:44,338
[SPEAKER_06]: But let me ask this.

489
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:52,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You say they need to change their business model, but at the same time, numbers say they have the number one console in America, period.

490
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:55,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so why do they need to change their business model?

491
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: They're number one.

492
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.

493
00:34:58,591 --> 00:34:59,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You hate it.

494
00:34:59,312 --> 00:35:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: We all hate it, but they are number one for right now.

495
00:35:03,379 --> 00:35:04,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the problem.

496
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,580
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cocky attitude though.

497
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,421
[SPEAKER_04]: If you say, oh, but we're number one, we can do whatever the hell we want.

498
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:16,584
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great until Apple decides to put out a console and then they have this app store and you can download all these games for 99 cents.

499
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Or let's just say that they're iPad prices and it's like two bucks a game or something like that.

500
00:35:22,826 --> 00:35:30,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but a lot of people, there are a lot of good games out there that are on these marketplaces, even like the Android marketplace and stuff.

501
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:39,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody really wants you to spend the kind of development time that it costs for a $50 game.

502
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,513
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, a perfect example...

503
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:43,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite Truck.

504
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:44,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that game.

505
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
[SPEAKER_04]: That game is awesome.

506
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,802
[SPEAKER_04]: All they needed to do was release download content for it or a sequel that had basically the same style of gameplay, just more track.

507
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:52,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Excite Bots.

508
00:35:52,762 --> 00:35:53,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Excite Bots.

509
00:35:53,642 --> 00:35:56,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Excite Bots was... I don't even know what the hell they were doing.

510
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,084
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know Nintendo was behind that kind of crap.

511
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what would be better?

512
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:03,025
[SPEAKER_04]: If we made some more minigames in there.

513
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:07,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not belong... Minigames do not belong in a racing game.

514
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:08,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

515
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:11,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, really stupid.

516
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,704
[SPEAKER_04]: All they had to do was download content.

517
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:20,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could have still made some money on top of that.

518
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Games like that, even if they have download content, do not devalue their sequels when they come out.

519
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if there's good download content for that?

520
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:33,523
[SPEAKER_04]: People will be more willing to buy the next game because they know they're going to be supporting download content on top of that.

521
00:36:34,003 --> 00:36:42,725
[SPEAKER_04]: or hell, you can put out the game for a cheaper cost and then have in-game downloads or something like that you can add to it and increase value that way.

522
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:47,786
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just so many ways that they could do it but they don't want to because you know what?

523
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't download games.

524
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:50,667
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they think.

525
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:51,827
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't download games.

526
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:54,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think Apple would disagree with you on that.

527
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let me ask this question.

528
00:36:58,191 --> 00:37:00,133
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you kind of feel about Nintendo right now?

529
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:05,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do notice you're looking at eBay on your computer looking for 3DSs right now.

530
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:09,161
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a part of you that must... There's something Nintendo's doing right for you.

531
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just get every console, okay?

532
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:18,990
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't even necessarily... And I was just looking to see if anybody's actually offering up a Japanese system for a decent price.

533
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:30,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but even though $350 is a good price for a Japanese console, and it is in California, although his reserve price is probably $500, so screw that.

534
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:32,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You know me, I like getting stuff early.

535
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but no, I'm not actually going to probably buy that.

536
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:45,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I will buy a 3DS when it comes out because I think it's a cool technology, but I got to be honest, the launch lineup is very disappointing.

537
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:57,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like sitting there going, looking at the tiles coming out, I'm like, well, I'll pick up Pilotwings because that looks fun, but it's like, and then Nintendo's like, but we have Steel Diver.

538
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,208
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 2D submarine game.

539
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.

540
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, that's neat, I guess.

541
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:07,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, you know, hey, we have Nintendogs.

542
00:38:08,282 --> 00:38:09,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Arf, arf, and cats.

543
00:38:09,442 --> 00:38:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Meow, meow.

544
00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:10,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendogs and cats.

545
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, hey, hey, hey, we've got Ocarina of Time.

546
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was reading the news articles.

547
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:23,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, Master Quest is in Ocarina of Time for the 3DS.

548
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:24,285
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so amazing.

549
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,268
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru says, your Mario Kart example doesn't work.

550
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:27,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo only makes one Mario Kart per system.

551
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about other consoles though.

552
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: This is even bad now as far as the trend goes.

553
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:53,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember before with Mario Kart for the GameCube I think was the first one they did?

554
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh look, we've got some of the older tracks in there.

555
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:56,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

556
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,042
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of retro nostalgia there.

557
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Boy Advance Super Nintendo Nostalgia

558
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,072
[SPEAKER_04]: and now all of them do.

559
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:15,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Half the tracks are all old tracks.

560
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, man.

561
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:19,496
[SPEAKER_04]: That's lazy right there.

562
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to admit, Rainbow Road's pretty sweet.

563
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:26,981
[SPEAKER_04]: They have Rainbow... But yeah, I understand it's really sweet, but there's a new Rainbow Road in every game.

564
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:32,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessary to put in one of the...

565
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Circuit Tracks from the Game Boy Advance and my 3DS version or something like that they just have such potential a track editor would be so awesome but they'll never do it because they're afraid that people will

566
00:39:54,187 --> 00:39:56,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Drive Mario into a fire repeatedly over and over again

567
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:10,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

568
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, people.

569
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:36,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart's a cool game and stuff.

570
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:38,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Even your Mario games are fun or Zelda or whatever.

571
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:44,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you throw in some sort of community aspect to it, people get really excited about it.

572
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:46,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's going to speak a lot louder than...

573
00:40:48,107 --> 00:40:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh hey, we put out a Mario Kart game.

574
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:51,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know you're going to put out a Mario Kart game on the 3S.

575
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:54,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also going to put out a Mario Kart game on the next console you put out.

576
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:55,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's dumb.

577
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:56,616
[SPEAKER_04]: In a Zelda game.

578
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:58,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we know that's coming.

579
00:41:00,481 --> 00:41:01,702
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be dumb to think otherwise.

580
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:08,870
[SPEAKER_04]: But they have such potential, they just really are squandering it.

581
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:10,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

582
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,894
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's been waiting to talk about her next story.

583
00:41:14,014 --> 00:41:14,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I've given up.

584
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at Monday through Friday.

585
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:17,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

586
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,579
[SPEAKER_06]: More to come later though.

587
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't finished the Nintendo news yet and I've got another killer question for Loki in a little bit here on the show.

588
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:30,331
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop has yet another class action lawsuit.

589
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:35,154
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten a lot of money from GameStop because of employee stuff.

590
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:46,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently now people should be getting more... Anyone who's bought anything ever from GameStop, actually, that used their credit card to buy it, should be getting their $5.

591
00:41:47,583 --> 00:42:00,792
[SPEAKER_07]: because apparently they acquire additional personal information including the cardholder's physical residential address by pairing the personal identification information with the cardholder's name obtained from the credit card.

592
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:03,794
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, you swipe your card, they get all your info.

593
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:10,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not saying what they're doing with it, but they're supposedly doing it against your knowledge.

594
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:16,687
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, everywhere that you use your credit card does that without your knowledge.

595
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is me, we're going to have class action lawsuits against the grocery store and the porn shop and...

596
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:52,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's necessarily that I think it's more because you have to put in all your personal info for like trades or whatever that they're basically saying okay this person here's this person and this person paid here's their name okay we're going to link their card number to this address now which is not good especially if that information just kind of gets leaked out I'm sure those GameStop employees are very trustworthy as far as you know

597
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:55,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Minimum wage, that has a lot of trust built into it.

598
00:42:55,768 --> 00:43:00,493
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of should have some people's addresses on file, though, for the people that like to sell back stolen games.

599
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:04,237
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the point, too, is that I think that it's a good idea.

600
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:10,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't see any problem with it as long as they're not selling it, and if you're on the opt-out list, then they can't.

601
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:11,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

602
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:14,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Identity theft sucks and so forth.

603
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:49,339
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't something that... Unless someone actually breaks into a database that all of their stuff is uploaded to and steals the information directly out of the database, I don't think that there's much of a problem.

604
00:43:51,422 --> 00:43:54,703
[SPEAKER_06]: William Murderface in our chatroom says, so GameStop wants to troll me?

605
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:55,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to react.

606
00:43:56,663 --> 00:43:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma in our chatroom says, I hate when I swipe my card.

607
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Some terminals require your zip code and you can't continue your transaction without it.

608
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that a credit card protection thing?

609
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at Chevron, a gas station, I don't know if those are everywhere.

610
00:44:07,886 --> 00:44:13,267
[SPEAKER_06]: But at Chevron, when I do the swipe, it always makes me put in my zip code because that's how it knows that I'm... Yeah.

611
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:18,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it's illegal, but I still don't see what the big deal is.

612
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:25,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not like they can actually go out and sell your information without your permission.

613
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they have to let you know that they're doing it.

614
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:37,127
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is just something that automatically pops up, especially if they need to do consumer tracking, I don't see what the big problem is.

615
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:38,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't.

616
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:43,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Even... I mean, I really... I think that people are just being paranoid.

617
00:44:43,772 --> 00:44:44,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Really.

618
00:44:44,512 --> 00:44:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to get your $5, go ahead.

619
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:47,414
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you're going to get.

620
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:48,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe $1.50.

621
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:57,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other thing with these class action lawsuits is that, well, you know, even though you might go, eh, GameStop's getting sued, likely they'll settle out of court because that's the way these things tend to go.

622
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:05,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it'll be like $2 to those that send in a form that swear on an affidavit that their privacy was breached or whatever.

623
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it'll be interesting to see how that goes.

624
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:09,429
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

625
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:16,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Marisa Congusto in our chatroom says, gas stations are allowed to do this because they do not store it for marketing.

626
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:18,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We just discussed this in Business Law the other day.

627
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they keep it for marketing either.

628
00:45:23,174 --> 00:45:23,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

629
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:28,036
[SPEAKER_07]: We bought stuff at GameStop and never gotten offers and stuff.

630
00:45:28,216 --> 00:45:30,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've never been spammed by them or what have you.

631
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:34,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We only ever got coupons and stuff when we had a subscription to Game Informer and it came with our magazine.

632
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I am spammed by them.

633
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you?

634
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you sign up for their little card though?

635
00:45:38,901 --> 00:45:39,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's why.

636
00:45:39,847 --> 00:45:44,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I signed up for their card, and then I get two emails from them every week.

637
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:46,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I told them, like, I'm on your mailing list twice.

638
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:47,530
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to take me off there.

639
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:48,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

640
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:50,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Never happened.

641
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:58,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also get, oh, hey, you know, you can get this special, you know, this is for GameStop people only.

642
00:45:59,054 --> 00:46:00,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a special survey thing.

643
00:46:00,314 --> 00:46:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You go fill out surveys and you get cash.

644
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, stop bothering me with that crap.

645
00:46:05,756 --> 00:46:12,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Ram on our chatroom says, when I swipe my CC to refill my MetroCard, it asks for verification that I get, but not when I'm in Kmart.

646
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:13,722
[SPEAKER_06]: It asks every single time.

647
00:46:13,762 --> 00:46:14,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not credit card protecting.

648
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:15,823
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pulling for where people live.

649
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:17,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Kohl's does that, too.

650
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,545
[SPEAKER_06]: They always ask your zip code.

651
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:21,807
[SPEAKER_04]: That is actually illegal to ask that.

652
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:22,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine.

653
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:23,928
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for demographic information.

654
00:46:24,429 --> 00:46:25,650
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still legal to ask that.

655
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,171
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a... I never said it wasn't.

656
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:29,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't you just say no?

657
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:30,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can say no.

658
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:35,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they don't... You can tell them you don't want to give it, and that can't stop them from...

659
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:39,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of those people that are working there anyway will just be like, alright, whatever.

660
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: What they'll do, they'll just put in a different zip code.

661
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:45,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I bet most of them do.

662
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:48,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell them no, they just make up a zip code.

663
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,211
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that's what's happening.

664
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:54,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the people on the front lines like that don't care.

665
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I sometimes feel bad for them because then they're the ones that take the brunt of all this hatred towards the collecting and so forth.

666
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:05,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on.

667
00:47:06,016 --> 00:47:06,817
[SPEAKER_06]: More news.

668
00:47:07,218 --> 00:47:09,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates coming up with Classic Game of the Week as well.

669
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:11,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

670
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is interesting.

671
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: BurgerTime HD, or as I like to call it, BurgerTime Galaxy, because that's certainly what it looks like.

672
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:23,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being developed, I guess, by Monkey Paw Games.

673
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and PC, I'm guessing as part of their digital platforms, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, WiiWare.

674
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:46,148
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're introducing new monsters or I guess carrots, apple cores, hot peppers, oversized monsters and other fun stuff.

675
00:47:46,368 --> 00:47:47,869
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had some video online of it.

676
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:49,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks interesting though.

677
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually play it multiplayer, split screen, which is kind of cool.

678
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:55,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it definitely looks like BurgerTime Galaxy.

679
00:47:57,693 --> 00:47:58,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

680
00:47:59,867 --> 00:48:03,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I do love me some BurgerTime, the old school 80s machine.

681
00:48:03,188 --> 00:48:04,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the video of it?

682
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:06,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't actually watched it yet.

683
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:07,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it on YouTube?

684
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

685
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I can pull it up here real quick for you.

686
00:48:14,511 --> 00:48:14,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

687
00:48:14,931 --> 00:48:15,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be more prepared.

688
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can find it here on YouTube.

689
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

690
00:48:18,012 --> 00:48:19,952
[SPEAKER_06]: BurgerTime HD level complete gameplay.

691
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:21,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at this here.

692
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:24,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to make sure there's no commercial.

693
00:48:25,434 --> 00:48:26,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy moly.

694
00:48:29,522 --> 00:48:36,147
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like running around this 3D-looking circle thing, like all the levels have been changed into this giant cylinder.

695
00:48:39,529 --> 00:48:42,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very different look for the game, but it's kind of the same damn game.

696
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:45,613
[SPEAKER_06]: At least at first glance.

697
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's this co-op thing going on.

698
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's not the same game.

699
00:48:51,597 --> 00:48:53,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

700
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see where you're getting BurgerTime Galaxy, absolutely.

701
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:56,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

702
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,574
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks like it could be interesting.

703
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look at the demo for that when that comes out.

704
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:19,594
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an old school 80s game I really liked.

705
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:21,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious how the co-op works.

706
00:49:21,314 --> 00:49:22,795
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something else.

707
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:23,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys want to see it?

708
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:25,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I just typed BurgerTimeHD into YouTube.

709
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:26,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It came right up.

710
00:49:27,916 --> 00:49:34,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, speaking of guilty pleasure games, this is one of my biggest guilty pleasure games ever and it's been so long since I've played one of these games.

711
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat.

712
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:36,919
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

713
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:42,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat 9 or really it's the reboot, just Mortal Kombat is coming out soon.

714
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:43,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

715
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:03,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, March 8th, by the time some of you guys hear this, here's the catch.

716
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:07,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be a PlayStation Plus member because they are the ones that are getting the demo first.

717
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:14,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to play a Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, and Johnny Cage in the Living Forest or the Fire Pit.

718
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:16,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.

719
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:17,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad.

720
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:20,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Most fighting game demos only have two characters, so it's kind of neat that they have four.

721
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:21,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

722
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:23,521
[SPEAKER_06]: One or two players.

723
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm imagining not online, though.

724
00:50:25,462 --> 00:50:32,104
[SPEAKER_06]: The other cool news is that not just the demo on March 8th for PlayStation Plus, but everybody will get it March 15th.

725
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're like, I don't really want to sign up for PlayStation Plus, you can just wait one more week and you'll be able to get it.

726
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I should say this though.

727
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:42,191
[SPEAKER_06]: That is only on PlayStation Network.

728
00:50:42,451 --> 00:50:45,735
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not have a firm date for when Xbox Live is getting it.

729
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:47,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Just later.

730
00:50:48,418 --> 00:50:50,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be a lot closer to the game's release in that regard.

731
00:50:52,062 --> 00:50:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Very curious about that.

732
00:50:53,203 --> 00:51:14,681
[SPEAKER_06]: by the way also a small follow-up on Mortal Kombat 9 I don't know if you guys heard but it was banned in Australia because they refused to rate the game and when they refuse to rate a game that basically means that the game is banned well the publishers behind Mortal Kombat they are appealing this decision we'll see just how far they get with it so

733
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see before the game's release.

734
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:21,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, it's probably going to end up getting delayed in Australia.

735
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:25,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a lot of people just going to import the damn thing from somewhere else.

736
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably be out there.

737
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:32,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though that's supposed to be illegal as well, I don't see them exactly banging down doors because people got bootleg copies of Mortal Kombat.

738
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:34,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see what happens.

739
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:38,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it has to be bootleg, I'm sure that you can just import it.

740
00:51:38,363 --> 00:51:39,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of those games are region free.

741
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:40,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean like actual bootlegs.

742
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:44,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean like, you know, PlayStation 3 is region free.

743
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:46,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll probably be lots of people just...

744
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:48,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitting up Amazon or something, getting a friend in the U.S.

745
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,132
[SPEAKER_06]: to buy it and then ship it to him.

746
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,214
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

747
00:51:53,596 --> 00:52:18,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So, also, on Mortal Kombat, one other thing, I remember reading a story about this this week, I wanted to throw this out there, is that there's this whole challenge mode in it, too, and I remember watching a video for it on YouTube, and they were all talking all excited about this, where, I guess, like, 300 levels, and they say you get something super special if you get all the way to the end, I'm assuming you unlock a bonus character or something, that's just my assumption, but it's like all these cool modifiers, like, there's some modifiers, like, Headless Kombat, where you fight with no head, right?

748
00:52:19,714 --> 00:52:36,953
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of reminds me of some old tacky fighting games upside down mode where the image is flipped upside down and that's how you have to play I just thought it was kind of funny so 300 levels though that might be overkill I don't know about that that's going to take a serious investment to get through but we'll see

749
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:38,566
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

750
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:00,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

751
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:04,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think I might have drunk a little too much Chimay and it's baffling me.

752
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:06,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually kind of does.

753
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:11,692
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that wait to buy a use to just save the $5 because it's cheaper.

754
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:14,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see this.

755
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:19,796
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some people that sell back their games fast too.

756
00:53:19,836 --> 00:53:22,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I picked up Tron Evolution maybe a week after it was out.

757
00:53:22,838 --> 00:53:24,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I realize why someone sold it back so quick.

758
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:27,740
[SPEAKER_06]: But some games you can get pretty quick that way.

759
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, ones they already have on...

760
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:32,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, oh, Dan, you gotta say that on the air.

761
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, Dan.

762
00:53:33,731 --> 00:53:34,271
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Dan?

763
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:37,553
[SPEAKER_01]: GameCrazy fucking did that for free.

764
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:38,014
[SPEAKER_06]: How so?

765
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:39,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you just could put your name on a list?

766
00:53:39,394 --> 00:53:43,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you could come in and say, hey, can you give me a call when this game comes in used?

767
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:44,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it.

768
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:46,159
[SPEAKER_01]: But they went out of business.

769
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:47,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And why did they go out of business?

770
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Hollywood Entertainment sucked.

771
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to hear it.

772
00:53:54,585 --> 00:54:02,148
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, some of the games on the list already are Crysis 2, Homefront Dragon Age 2, Shift 2 Unleashed, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12.

773
00:54:05,149 --> 00:54:08,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, you can pay five pounds and save a game that's not out yet.

774
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:13,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we'll just go to show you, game stores will take your five dollars for anything.

775
00:54:14,173 --> 00:54:25,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone probably had that copy, or when it comes out, they probably got that copy, said this game sucks, and, you know, spanked over it or something, and then took it back, and then you get the spank version.

776
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,200
[SPEAKER_07]: You get it christened with the love of another man.

777
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Be careful, though.

778
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:36,883
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be one of those games that you can't sell back, like DC Universe Online, One Unique Key.

779
00:54:37,383 --> 00:54:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So be careful what you pre-order used.

780
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:41,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they've got a specific list for it.

781
00:54:43,316 --> 00:54:47,259
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru in our chatroom says, oh great, GameStop is going to push pre-orders of used games now?

782
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:49,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, no, no, this is Game in the UK.

783
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:56,785
[SPEAKER_06]: However, you know if it does well for them, it'll just get copied by everybody else.

784
00:54:57,421 --> 00:54:57,762
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

785
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:17,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and games that are coming out real soon.

786
00:55:18,236 --> 00:55:23,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually, today, Pokemon Black and White came out, so that's pretty exciting if you're a fan of the Pokemans.

787
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:27,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Which there are some real rabid fans of Pokemon out there that are over the age of 30.

788
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,082
[SPEAKER_04]: As on the Nintendo DS.

789
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:34,725
[SPEAKER_04]: This week I actually have a new Kinect game, U-Star 2 in the movies.

790
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember U-Star was that camera green screen system that they were selling on TV that only worked with PC at one point.

791
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:47,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there already a crappy game like that on 360 that had the vision camera like you in the movies or something?

792
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a little different though.

793
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That was more of like you're doing mini games and then it puts you into the game or the movie.

794
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes a little short film.

795
00:55:57,303 --> 00:56:00,846
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually, it's like karaoke for movie lines.

796
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:07,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you recite movie lines and you can play different people in there and it will actually kind of...

797
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:13,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Crop the actor or actress out of the scene and it'll put you in their place.

798
00:56:13,753 --> 00:56:18,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can get scored for accuracy and stuff like that.

799
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:20,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat, I guess.

800
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's certainly not a lot of Kinect games coming out.

801
00:56:24,578 --> 00:56:28,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on PlayStation 3 with Move support.

802
00:56:28,139 --> 00:56:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: You do need the PlayStation Eye camera, though, if you want to play that.

803
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,402
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, on Xbox 360 for the Kinect.

804
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:39,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Age 2 PC, Playstation 3, Xbox 360 Wii, The One Million Dollar Pyramid

805
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Another TV show game.

806
00:56:53,308 --> 00:56:54,609
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple MLB games this week.

807
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:56,650
[SPEAKER_04]: MLB 2011 The Show.

808
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,692
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on PlayStation 2, PS3, and the PlayStation Portable.

809
00:57:01,312 --> 00:57:10,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, MLB 2K11 on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP, I believe.

810
00:57:12,278 --> 00:57:15,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Pets Bunnies Bunch on Nintendo DS.

811
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's gearing up for Easter.

812
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:18,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

813
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,501
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this?

814
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:24,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Beastly Frantic Photo?

815
00:57:28,526 --> 00:57:33,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is some sort of stupid application that ties into that crappy movie Beastly.

816
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:37,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, there was a movie with Vanessa Hutchins that came out called Beastly.

817
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's what this is.

818
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not heard of that, but that's kind of funny.

819
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:47,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I think it's some sort of photo game, and it looks like crap.

820
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Vanessa Hudgens' Snap?

821
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be.

822
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:53,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they have a trailer for the movie.

823
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:54,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really care about that.

824
00:57:57,024 --> 00:57:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

825
00:57:58,765 --> 00:58:01,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Beastly like a knockoff of Twilight?

826
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:04,410
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.

827
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:06,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

828
00:58:07,912 --> 00:58:15,141
[SPEAKER_06]: A modern day retelling of the fairy tale but not with the underground community The guy is suddenly turned ugly by some witch girl and he has to stay in his expensive penthouse

829
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Be Our Guest

830
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:45,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just like how, you know, Little Red Riding Hood, I don't remember werewolves being in Little Red Riding Hood.

831
00:58:45,779 --> 00:58:50,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be, it's been a while since I heard Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't remember werewolves being in there.

832
00:58:50,663 --> 00:58:52,905
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think emo people were in there as well.

833
00:58:52,925 --> 00:58:54,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're making emo Snow White too.

834
00:58:54,287 --> 00:59:01,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on, the original Little Red Riding Hood, she gets eaten by the wolf and gets digested and dies.

835
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

836
00:59:04,122 --> 00:59:05,823
[SPEAKER_04]: As should those types of movies.

837
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Atari's Greatest Hits Vol.

838
00:59:08,624 --> 00:59:10,185
[SPEAKER_04]: 2 on Nintendo DS coming out this week.

839
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantom Brave, Heroes of the Hermuda Triangle for the PSP.

840
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:18,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the Bermuda, the Hermuda.

841
00:59:18,169 --> 00:59:19,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Hermuda, like hermaphrodite.

842
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:22,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

843
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:25,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

844
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:27,956
[SPEAKER_04]: What else we got here?

845
00:59:28,036 --> 00:59:31,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Sims 3, Barnacle Bay on PC, in case you want to get your pirate on.

846
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:34,621
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Sims 3 there.

847
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:42,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some crappy Wii games, Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing, and Maximum Racing, Dragon Sox.

848
00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:43,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And just don't even bother, seriously.

849
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:44,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, because...

850
00:59:46,911 --> 01:00:02,218
[SPEAKER_04]: and I gotta go on the rant mode about this but I'm sorry but like here we go just because Nintendo is so gracious for everybody for a limited time and this is the last time that they're reprinting this game from the Super Nintendo Super Mario All-Stars will be coming out one week from today

851
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:10,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The Limited Edition, oh my god, limited, going on eBay for $80 because, oh my god, I've never played a game that was on the Super Nintendo on the Wii.

852
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That is coming out once again on the Wii.

853
01:00:13,524 --> 01:00:16,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it now before it goes away forever.

854
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:18,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, if you buy this, you're stupid.

855
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

856
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You are stupid.

857
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:22,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

858
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:23,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid.

859
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:29,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Just spend the money on the virtual console.

860
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:32,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Better yet, just buy the freaking Super Nintendo and the original game.

861
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't need this limited soundtrack and a little art book.

862
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

863
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think your rants are funnier with Mario Brothers music in the background.

864
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:43,242
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

865
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so...

866
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:48,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we have coming out this week.

867
01:00:48,488 --> 01:00:51,252
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously though, they are taking you guys for fools.

868
01:00:51,332 --> 01:00:54,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, $30 for a Super Nintendo game.

869
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,017
[SPEAKER_04]: What's next, okay?

870
01:00:56,077 --> 01:00:59,781
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have like Game Boy Advance, you know, Mario Land or something.

871
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,543
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to put no new color in it.

872
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:02,925
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to do shit to it.

873
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:07,069
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they're not even going to change, you know... Aren't all those going to be coming on the 3DS?

874
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The virtual console, actually.

875
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:12,371
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing shit to them.

876
01:01:12,851 --> 01:01:13,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

877
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:14,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing at all.

878
01:01:14,512 --> 01:01:16,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to charge tons of money for that.

879
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what you can buy a Game Boy for nowadays?

880
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably $30 including that stupid... Probably even less than that.

881
01:01:23,394 --> 01:01:25,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably find them dirt cheap at a garage sale.

882
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:26,734
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't even know what they are.

883
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to get rid of them.

884
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:28,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

885
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:31,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.

886
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't feed the beast.

887
01:01:34,097 --> 01:01:34,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't.

888
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:37,598
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very beastly week in U.S.

889
01:01:37,678 --> 01:01:38,778
[SPEAKER_04]: releases, apparently.

890
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:40,259
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just encouraging them.

891
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: The message that you're sending loud and clear to Nintendo is, we like your old shit, please bring it back and charge us a lot of money for it.

892
01:01:47,322 --> 01:01:48,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that they're doing.

893
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:50,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

894
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: People are dumb because they're like, oh, Mario must buy.

895
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:54,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario must buy.

896
01:01:54,404 --> 01:01:55,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they can put out like,

897
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario teaches brain surgery or something like that.

898
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:02,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario's a wonderful douche.

899
01:02:02,325 --> 01:02:04,327
People would buy it because it's got Mario in it.

900
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:04,768
You got it!

901
01:02:16,534 --> 01:02:17,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mario!

902
01:02:46,774 --> 01:02:48,375
[SPEAKER_06]: and novel thing that's been ported.

903
01:02:48,616 --> 01:02:51,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been on the PS2, Windows, PSP, all this stuff before.

904
01:02:51,878 --> 01:02:55,240
[SPEAKER_06]: It is coming out on the Xbox 360 as well now with some extra stuff.

905
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:00,524
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, I guess, I don't even know if it's like an interactive anime or anything, but who knows?

906
01:03:01,484 --> 01:03:03,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that is coming out this week.

907
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:05,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably nothing that'll ever see the light of day over here, I gotta be honest.

908
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:11,291
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have heard something about an English translation patch on some of the other versions for those that are into it.

909
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:18,746
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3 coming out this week, there's an all-new console coming out in Japan this week.

910
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is a satin silver model.

911
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:25,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what is coming out to kind of drive the sales of that.

912
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:32,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Heavy Rain is getting a price reduction over there, and there is Shin Sangoku Musou 6 comes out this week as well.

913
01:03:32,814 --> 01:03:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Koei.

914
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:35,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this Dynasty Warriors 6?

915
01:03:36,197 --> 01:03:36,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what this is?

916
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:02,623
[SPEAKER_06]: and Rurouni Kenshin.

917
01:04:26,724 --> 01:04:30,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Meiji, Kenkaku, Ramatan, Saisen comes out from Namco Bandai this week.

918
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:32,448
[SPEAKER_07]: What the crap are they doing another Kenshin game for?

919
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the public demands it?

920
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:36,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

921
01:04:36,732 --> 01:04:37,172
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go.

922
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:38,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it for your Japanese releases.

923
01:04:39,954 --> 01:04:42,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for the UK, we have a few things.

924
01:04:42,436 --> 01:04:44,818
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 9th is Torchlight.

925
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the 11th, we have Brunswick Pro Bowling.

926
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:53,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Age 2, Homefront, and U-Star 2.

927
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:55,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

928
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:57,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

929
01:04:58,578 --> 01:05:03,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some more news and then the Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.

930
01:05:04,346 --> 01:05:06,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy, can't wait for this next story.

931
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, take it away.

932
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:11,368
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, just to go back real quick about my complaining about All-Stars.

933
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:15,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, this is Nintendo we're talking about here.

934
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:16,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a step backwards with this game.

935
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Smash Bros., once again.

936
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:19,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Smash Bros.

937
01:05:19,831 --> 01:05:20,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl.

938
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:20,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect example.

939
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:25,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you treat a franchise as far as nostalgia purposes.

940
01:05:26,332 --> 01:05:30,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They had demos for virtual console games on there for some of the old stuff.

941
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:32,154
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

942
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:52,352
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

943
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:18,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing is seriously one of the best games that's come out in the past 10 years.

944
01:06:19,368 --> 01:06:20,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, it really is.

945
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:21,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking the original.

946
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Not any of the sequel.

947
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:23,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Not any of them.

948
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:25,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Not any of the re-releases.

949
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:27,874
[SPEAKER_06]: But the original is one of my favorite games to have come out in the past 10 years.

950
01:06:28,254 --> 01:06:28,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Easily.

951
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Another perfect example, I might add, of a game that Nintendo has done absolutely nothing with.

952
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:35,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

953
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:38,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nothing with from game to game.

954
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:41,423
[SPEAKER_04]: How much really have they changed from each sequel?

955
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:42,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

956
01:06:42,677 --> 01:06:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the same damn game presented in a slightly different way.

957
01:06:46,424 --> 01:06:47,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean very slight.

958
01:06:47,707 --> 01:06:49,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of the times, it's not a good way.

959
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:54,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, we're seriously, we're just encouraging this crap.

960
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:57,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you got some Nintendo news to report for us, Loki?

961
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

962
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so, we've got some interesting stuff.

963
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this is all from Game Developers Conference.

964
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:14,024
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking a little bit about the 3DS and some neat stuff, I guess.

965
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:17,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, once again, you can't read too much into this because...

966
01:07:19,821 --> 01:07:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

967
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:28,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, the first part we have here, apparently the 3DS will have access to 10,000 AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots by late May.

968
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:29,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not at launch?

969
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:31,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, I don't know.

970
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,789
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

971
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Late May.

972
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's neat that they're embracing... Is that like all the airports?

973
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:39,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

974
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,836
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta be like some restaurants have them.

975
01:07:41,856 --> 01:07:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

976
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:43,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you find AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots?

977
01:07:43,818 --> 01:07:44,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess just

978
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:51,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I know that when they're selling you on their internet and stuff, but you get access to all these for free as well.

979
01:07:51,786 --> 01:07:52,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Big whoop.

980
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:54,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that how they're going to deliver the patches without asking?

981
01:07:55,129 --> 01:07:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: If you take your 3DS out in public, it finds an AT&T Wi-Fi hotspot, all of a sudden, whoop, patch.

982
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:01,456
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't, no.

983
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:05,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to agree to apply the patches.

984
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,360
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

985
01:08:33,895 --> 01:08:54,709
[SPEAKER_04]: it's their way of saying we don't have 3GS but you'll be able to get online in public at all these places that's what it says to me and then of course the 3DS Virtual Console is basically getting all the portable platforms on top of I believe Game Boy and Game Boy Color they're getting Game Gear and

986
01:08:55,369 --> 01:09:06,555
[SPEAKER_04]: and TurboGrafx-16 games because it's funny because TurboGrafx-16 played the actual console games on the handheld so you're going to be getting those games.

987
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got one of those.

988
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:10,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Turbo Express.

989
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: How funny this whole NGP joke with the Neo Geo pocket comes forward.

990
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:18,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind because TurboGrafx, not a Neo Geo.

991
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:18,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

992
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:20,642
[SPEAKER_06]: But

993
01:09:22,884 --> 01:09:29,249
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe in the future, who knows And I understand it's coming late May Why stop there?

994
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:30,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Why stop there?

995
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:51,147
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a virtual console You have virtual console stuff already out there For like Nintendo, Super Nintendo stuff Don't tell me this system can't play Nintendo games Or Genesis games Or Sega Master System games Once again This could be an open marketplace Like the iOS platforms Or Steam or something like that Where you can have a bunch of games on there

996
01:09:52,268 --> 01:10:04,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Right for the picking so people can go, oh my god, I love playing the original Mario Brothers or I love playing Mario Kart 64 or something like that on my Wii.

997
01:10:04,424 --> 01:10:05,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to take it with me.

998
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh damn, I have to buy it again.

999
01:10:08,088 --> 01:10:10,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's okay because I love Nintendo and I'll buy whatever they put out.

1000
01:10:12,529 --> 01:10:13,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a missed opportunity.

1001
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:16,711
[SPEAKER_04]: They only have these portable games coming out for it.

1002
01:10:16,771 --> 01:10:17,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1003
01:10:18,892 --> 01:10:22,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so frustrating that they could easily do this.

1004
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:24,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, nope, sorry.

1005
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:26,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to do that right now.

1006
01:10:26,415 --> 01:10:33,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, but we may announce it later on, and people will be so grateful that we've allowed them to repurchase our game again.

1007
01:10:33,158 --> 01:10:34,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha, ha, ha.

1008
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:37,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that will be coming out later on.

1009
01:10:41,457 --> 01:11:01,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just so frustrating because they're just dumb and yeah, late May, so if you buy your system when it comes out at launch, just know that you're not going to actually have access to their little service to purchase virtual console games nice

1010
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:06,493
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also they're saying via the system update you're going to get some other online features that they were touting.

1011
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:13,176
[SPEAKER_04]: The DSiWare service of course, the ability to transfer DSiWare games from the DSi or DSiXL to your system.

1012
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:21,819
[SPEAKER_04]: The web browser and of course the eShop which will include the whole virtual console stuff.

1013
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me get this straight.

1014
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:25,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Your console's not done.

1015
01:11:27,585 --> 01:11:29,206
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's what it sounds like to me.

1016
01:11:29,787 --> 01:11:35,931
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have one of the advertised features, web browser and all that stuff, at launch.

1017
01:11:36,131 --> 01:11:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: So your console's not done.

1018
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:38,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not ready.

1019
01:11:38,593 --> 01:11:40,815
[SPEAKER_04]: You're releasing it too early is what it sounds like.

1020
01:11:41,095 --> 01:11:48,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And that might explain why you don't have enough games out for it because you want to push this thing out to pad your fiscal year numbers.

1021
01:11:48,701 --> 01:11:49,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1022
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's coming out at the very end of the month.

1023
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:51,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1024
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:54,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1025
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:11,971
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1026
01:12:37,017 --> 01:12:38,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

1027
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:58,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I definitely think it's that.

1028
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:08,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that they did the exact same thing with, um... Well, they did the exact same thing with the Wii, because they had, remember, the web browser, I believe, didn't come out right away.

1029
01:13:08,046 --> 01:13:09,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It got released later on.

1030
01:13:10,028 --> 01:13:12,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, you know, too later on.

1031
01:13:12,569 --> 01:13:19,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're only talking, like, you know, a month or two for this online shop thing, but...

1032
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, if they had it ready to go at launch, they could be making so much.

1033
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:33,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time wasted and money lost because they could be selling a bunch of stuff.

1034
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:34,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fact that they're just like,

1035
01:13:35,123 --> 01:13:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, we're just not going to put virtual console games on there because... I don't know.

1036
01:13:42,544 --> 01:13:48,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're not putting actual virtual console stuff that's on there for the Wii.

1037
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:51,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they put Nintendo games or Super Nintendo games?

1038
01:13:51,546 --> 01:13:52,886
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all this stuff already done.

1039
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:53,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already ready to go.

1040
01:13:54,026 --> 01:13:59,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they have to convert it over to something special or redo it for the 3DS, maybe.

1041
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:00,988
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, come on.

1042
01:14:01,008 --> 01:14:02,868
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking, like, emulators here.

1043
01:14:03,508 --> 01:14:07,632
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be that difficult to port this stuff over.

1044
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1045
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:17,840
[SPEAKER_04]: If the homebrew community can do it on the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS, and this thing does support Nintendo DS games, it should be able to do this.

1046
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It should have no problem doing this whatsoever.

1047
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:25,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're going to do something cool.

1048
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they said that, oh hey, we're going to release...

1049
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuck.

1050
01:14:48,913 --> 01:15:00,640
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have all sucked, but still though, I mean, there's a lot of games that they release on the virtual console that did suck, but it's still a lot of people haven't gotten a chance to play them because that console is out for such a short amount of time.

1051
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:02,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1052
01:15:02,822 --> 01:15:17,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, apparently all DSi, or almost all DSiWare games will be available at the 3DS eShop launch, and of course they have some limits as far as the transfers and stuff.

1053
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:20,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, of course, we've got virtual console games.

1054
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:26,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that's rendered in 3D, converted into 3D, is called a 3D classic.

1055
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:30,282
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to have some converted games, I guess.

1056
01:15:31,242 --> 01:15:37,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And it said that, I guess, downloadable games will be under the eShop banner.

1057
01:15:38,108 --> 01:15:39,068
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that...

1058
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:44,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much the whole DSiWare lineup will be available at launch.

1059
01:15:44,226 --> 01:15:48,187
[SPEAKER_04]: There may be a few exceptions, but the majority of all the games will come over.

1060
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:52,649
[SPEAKER_04]: A few games are being left off the 3DS's eShop for undisclosed reasons.

1061
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:59,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're saying it's not the number of transferred games.

1062
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be the same... They're saying that the transfer feature will be coming in late May.

1063
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:06,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1064
01:16:09,386 --> 01:16:38,048
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't say it would be the same game the number of times you can transfer it from device to device so if you build up a large category of DSiWare games you won't be penalized just how many times you can move it move that same group of games there'll be a limit on so I guess they're not saying the amount of games there's not going to be a limit on the amount of games you can move over but how many times you can move it so that's that's it hmm and

1065
01:16:40,411 --> 01:17:01,151
[SPEAKER_04]: if they were nice which they're not they would also allow you to do that same kind of transfer thing with the Wii and the virtual console stuff that you download but they're not to be fair I mean what Microsoft allows you to transfer it once a year and I don't even know Sony's thing aren't Sony's pretty locked down aren't they

1066
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:14,120
[SPEAKER_04]: um you can transfer actually you can transfer quite a few times because they have people sharing stuff remember you can do it like five times that's right and that's per game um I I don't know it's

1067
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1068
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,301
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it is what it is.

1069
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a lot of disappointing stuff, I think, as far as how they support their online stuff.

1070
01:17:24,444 --> 01:17:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1071
01:17:25,324 --> 01:17:30,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunately just... They could be making a lot more money than they are.

1072
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:35,689
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's really what they're concerned about and making people happy and stuff, they could do it really easy.

1073
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:37,129
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just not.

1074
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:42,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's move on from all the 3DS talk.

1075
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:46,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I am still excited about the 3D video, but I think you make a point.

1076
01:17:47,015 --> 01:17:48,596
[SPEAKER_06]: They gotta let you share it.

1077
01:17:49,076 --> 01:17:51,358
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's something that a lot of people are also very excited about.

1078
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:55,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that feature alone makes the device worth a lot more than...

1079
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:01,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe that's why they're trying to rush it out, too, is because they want to get ahead of a lot of those cameras that are out there on the marketplace that are very expensive right now.

1080
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:03,707
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to maybe get the jump on that.

1081
01:18:03,787 --> 01:18:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1082
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:05,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheap alternative.

1083
01:18:05,508 --> 01:18:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1084
01:18:06,249 --> 01:18:09,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, I want to mention this because a lot of folks are excited about this.

1085
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: The game Catherine, which is coming out overseas, it is also coming out in the U.S.

1086
01:18:15,796 --> 01:18:18,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Summer of 2011 it is coming out this summer.

1087
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:20,040
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1088
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,181
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a preview site already up.

1089
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,723
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pre-order the game on Amazon.com.

1090
01:18:24,463 --> 01:18:25,083
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:18:48,573 --> 01:19:15,084
[SPEAKER_06]: but give it time I'm sure that's details they want to keep under wraps until a little close to the release date but some folks still very excited about the release of that game alright since that game is coming out in a couple months let's talk about something that's coming out a long time ago it's the classic game of the week we like to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a classic video game that's been out for years and years and it's something that maybe you should be checking out

1092
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is going to step into the vault and find a game.

1093
01:19:18,658 --> 01:19:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1094
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Classic game of the week is Willow.

1095
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:27,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And before people say, you've done Willow before, this is a different Willow.

1096
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:30,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the side-scrolling arcade version of Willow.

1097
01:19:34,028 --> 01:19:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So not the NES RPG game many people remember that you have done before.

1098
01:19:38,693 --> 01:19:39,534
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the arcade version.

1099
01:19:39,714 --> 01:19:44,279
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was released by Capcom in the arcade and it's freaking hard.

1100
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:48,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically this one's platformer.

1101
01:19:49,885 --> 01:20:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: and it has six stages where Willow gets to go kick some butt and sometimes you can play Mad Mardigan and you basically it's typical platformer left or right to move press the A button to use a weapon you can

1102
01:20:04,682 --> 01:20:28,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold it down and fire charge shots, you've got magic power gauge, you have a B button to jump, and you can go up ledges and do all kinds of stuff, you can climb down them, and you can open chests, and you can get gold and buy items from the Owl Mage, and buy all kinds of stuff, including a life pack, a 1-up, and information.

1103
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:31,536
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, it's pretty hard.

1104
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:34,305
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the music in it, though.

1105
01:20:34,345 --> 01:20:35,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you play a little bit of that, Rob?

1106
01:20:47,714 --> 01:20:48,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that good?

1107
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:48,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

1108
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:51,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really pretty game, too.

1109
01:20:51,735 --> 01:20:56,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only version that was out was the arcade one.

1110
01:20:56,736 --> 01:20:58,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a CPS1 game.

1111
01:21:00,017 --> 01:21:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much you could fight a giant rat.

1112
01:21:02,777 --> 01:21:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty fun.

1113
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:12,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It is unlike the NES version, which was an adventure RPG.

1114
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is weird, because Capcom did them both.

1115
01:21:17,065 --> 01:21:27,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, I think that Capcom was notorious for bringing out different versions of games that were one thing in the arcade, but did them different for the NES.

1116
01:21:28,212 --> 01:21:31,755
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this game looks a lot like is Magic Sword, actually.

1117
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:34,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really surprised I've never played this before.

1118
01:21:35,717 --> 01:21:39,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a lot, like just watching this, there's a lot in common with Magic Sword.

1119
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,841
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very interesting to me.

1120
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that whole side-scrolling thing.

1121
01:21:44,802 --> 01:21:47,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's really gorgeous.

1122
01:21:47,784 --> 01:21:49,545
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got all the story elements.

1123
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:56,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You even have the monsters from the movie.

1124
01:21:57,791 --> 01:22:00,393
[SPEAKER_07]: And pretty cool cinematic areas.

1125
01:22:00,413 --> 01:22:02,114
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just gorgeous artwork in it.

1126
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:07,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, like in the first... Ah, scary-looking Val Kilmer, sorry.

1127
01:22:07,498 --> 01:22:07,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1128
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:09,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah!

1129
01:22:10,908 --> 01:22:23,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, his weapon is kind of like the cipher from Strider, but it can be charged up and increases range and potency.

1130
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:28,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, you can also buy swords when you stop in the shop.

1131
01:22:30,616 --> 01:22:33,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it's just really cool.

1132
01:22:33,799 --> 01:22:38,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Although he's got, like, very pretty boy-looking features when you play with him.

1133
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Mad Mardigan, that is.

1134
01:22:40,506 --> 01:22:42,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very brown hair.

1135
01:22:43,188 --> 01:22:44,429
[SPEAKER_07]: And Willow just looks adorable.

1136
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:47,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's a fun game.

1137
01:22:47,993 --> 01:22:49,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty tough, but lots of fun.

1138
01:22:50,518 --> 01:22:52,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is.

1139
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,663
[SPEAKER_06]: The classic video game of the week for the arcades, not the NES.

1140
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:57,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Willow.

1141
01:22:59,065 --> 01:23:03,169
[SPEAKER_06]: A very Magic Sword-esque kind of game, but with a bitchin' movie franchise behind it.

1142
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:08,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I gotta admit, I always like the video game way better than I like the movie.

1143
01:23:08,934 --> 01:23:09,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just me.

1144
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:12,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break, but don't go anywhere.

1145
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:14,279
[SPEAKER_06]: There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1146
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:17,822
[SPEAKER_06]: When we come back for Part B, we're going to be talking about dev kits for the Kinect.

1147
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:20,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it could be really happening.

1148
01:23:20,743 --> 01:23:26,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamertags being freed up and a classic, classic PC game making its way to the iOS system.

1149
01:23:26,747 --> 01:23:31,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk all about that when we come back from a break here with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1150
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:40,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:23:40,737 --> 01:23:48,222
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live on this Sunday, March the 6th of 2011 for the 404th episode of our podcast.

1152
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: We 404'd.

1153
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:49,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1154
01:23:49,643 --> 01:23:53,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say we didn't make enough 404 jokes in the opening, but yes, it is episode 404.

1155
01:23:54,546 --> 01:23:56,008
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura and myself work on.

1156
01:23:56,028 --> 01:23:58,090
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like Orange Launch Radio, you might just like these shows too.

1157
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:18,052
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Comic Insanity, which goes live every Tuesday at Infamous.net.

1158
01:24:18,072 --> 01:24:19,853
[SPEAKER_07]: That's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

1159
01:24:20,453 --> 01:24:21,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We are awesome.

1160
01:24:21,433 --> 01:24:24,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's me and Mar and Marvel and Dan Shadow.

1161
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:28,496
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're pretty geeky and pretty comic-y.

1162
01:24:29,157 --> 01:24:29,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're pretty awesome.

1163
01:24:30,757 --> 01:24:31,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And Insanity?

1164
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:33,458
[SPEAKER_07]: The Insanity's there too.

1165
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:34,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1166
01:24:34,919 --> 01:24:37,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And some Infamy along with it and some other in stuff.

1167
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:38,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1168
01:24:39,101 --> 01:24:39,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob.

1169
01:24:40,502 --> 01:24:44,683
[SPEAKER_06]: and The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth is all things World of Warcraft.

1170
01:24:45,563 --> 01:24:56,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not taped live anywhere right now but we do put out a pretty fun podcast on Thursdays-ish and you can look that up online at The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth in iTunes.

1171
01:24:56,626 --> 01:25:01,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Just search for Horde House and it'll come right up or whatever your preferred finder of podcasts is.

1172
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:02,708
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a website coming very soon.

1173
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:05,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping next week we'll have more details on that.

1174
01:25:05,529 --> 01:25:07,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the early workings underway.

1175
01:25:07,489 --> 01:25:08,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Very exciting.

1176
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:10,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And now an official guild for this show as well.

1177
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:11,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

1178
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:15,459
[SPEAKER_06]: This week's show, by the way, was particularly off-color and explicit.

1179
01:25:15,519 --> 01:25:19,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So now's a great time to check it out at the best little hoard house in Azeroth.

1180
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:22,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki has a show called Raising a Baby.

1181
01:25:23,168 --> 01:25:24,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's not really a show.

1182
01:25:24,931 --> 01:25:25,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just what he does.

1183
01:25:26,572 --> 01:25:28,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have a show even if I didn't have a baby.

1184
01:25:29,115 --> 01:25:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Been there, tried that, don't think so.

1185
01:25:30,956 --> 01:25:31,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1186
01:25:32,277 --> 01:25:37,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've said it before, it's a crime how undervalued your mix show was because you were pretty good at it.

1187
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:39,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh well, some things are just not meant to be.

1188
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:41,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It took too damn long.

1189
01:25:41,665 --> 01:25:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: What is meant to be?

1190
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:45,969
[SPEAKER_06]: More gaming news and Twitter topics very soon on the Twitters.

1191
01:25:46,289 --> 01:25:47,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, some rapid news, Loki.

1192
01:25:48,621 --> 01:25:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course, we knew the Gears of War 3 beta was coming soon, thanks to Bulletstorm.

1193
01:25:53,504 --> 01:25:59,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Bulletstorm players will actually get access to the Gears of War 3 beta on April 18th.

1194
01:25:59,807 --> 01:26:07,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, if you don't have Bulletstorm, you can also get into the beta if you've pre-ordered Gears of War 3 from GameStop.

1195
01:26:08,772 --> 01:26:11,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Those players will be able to get in a week later on April 25th.

1196
01:26:12,034 --> 01:26:16,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, you know, multiplayer beta, so...

1197
01:26:17,617 --> 01:26:18,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War 3 Beta Tester Medal

1198
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:44,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you get the Thrashball Cole, which is the fictional sport that's in Gears of War.

1199
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:48,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get the variant skin for that.

1200
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:55,692
[SPEAKER_04]: The gold-plated Retro Lancer, possible if you complete a bunch of levels in that, 90 matches.

1201
01:26:57,394 --> 01:26:58,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of matches.

1202
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:05,539
[SPEAKER_04]: The Flaming Hammerburst, if you complete one match by Sunday, April 24th.

1203
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the Flaming Lancer by one match during the week of April 25th.

1204
01:27:11,764 --> 01:27:16,187
[SPEAKER_04]: The Flaming Sawed-Off Shotgun, one match during the week of May 2nd.

1205
01:27:16,747 --> 01:27:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Flaming Nasher Shotgun during the next week, May 9th.

1206
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:21,691
[SPEAKER_07]: What isn't flaming?

1207
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:25,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

1208
01:27:25,553 --> 01:27:25,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Not me.

1209
01:27:28,106 --> 01:27:31,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's coming soon, and check it out if you haven't yet.

1210
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I am so excited to get my next issue of Game Informer.

1211
01:27:36,253 --> 01:27:39,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The cover game, of course, is Saints Row III.

1212
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:41,117
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I love that game.

1213
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:48,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Saints Row, seriously, you know, what Grand Theft Auto used to be as far as, you know, over the top and ridiculous.

1214
01:27:48,903 --> 01:27:50,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I don't, you know...

1215
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:55,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto 4 because I've made it over top and ridiculous.

1216
01:27:56,008 --> 01:27:58,429
[SPEAKER_04]: But Saints Row is awesome.

1217
01:27:58,869 --> 01:28:03,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC this holiday.

1218
01:28:04,432 --> 01:28:06,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game looks awesome.

1219
01:28:07,433 --> 01:28:10,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the cover or whatever that they have looks awesome.

1220
01:28:11,055 --> 01:28:18,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently the game is going to be taking place I guess in Stillwater still.

1221
01:28:19,079 --> 01:28:19,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

1222
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:38,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess there's this gang called the Syndicated Criminal Organization that has contacts in different parts of the world and they're saying that it ultimately propels you into a new city that hosts the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.

1223
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saying, judging by the cover here, nine-way free-fall gun battle from a plane.

1224
01:28:50,023 --> 01:28:52,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I do respect the fact that they have System Link.

1225
01:29:13,772 --> 01:29:14,213
[SPEAKER_04]: or Hasselhoff.

1226
01:29:34,874 --> 01:29:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, the Panasonic Jungle is not going to be coming out.

1227
01:29:40,298 --> 01:29:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of an ambitious idea.

1228
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:43,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1229
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an ambitious idea for a portable handheld MMO system.

1230
01:29:47,802 --> 01:29:50,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Just... Oh, the MMO thing.

1231
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:51,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1232
01:29:52,245 --> 01:29:54,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody understood that anyway, so that's fine.

1233
01:29:54,506 --> 01:29:58,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not feasible.

1234
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,969
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

1235
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they just say, nobody got it?

1236
01:30:03,332 --> 01:30:06,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a thing that, it's not that nobody got it, I think.

1237
01:30:06,913 --> 01:30:09,495
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't know if we'd be able to run a lot of the popular MMOs.

1238
01:30:09,515 --> 01:30:11,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that wouldn't be able to run World of Warcraft, for sure.

1239
01:30:12,777 --> 01:30:19,180
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're saying, oh, it would have been able to, you know, use titles like Stellar Down, Battlestar Galactica, and RuneScape.

1240
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,201
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really Battlestar Galactica.

1241
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:22,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rift, it's all about Rift right now.

1242
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:28,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, so, it just doesn't have enough oomph to be able to, you know, work.

1243
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:31,327
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1244
01:30:31,447 --> 01:30:35,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine, though, if they ported World of Warcraft to, like, the iPad?

1245
01:30:35,509 --> 01:30:36,009
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't happen.

1246
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:41,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't happen, but I'm just saying something of that caliber to something like that would be ridiculous.

1247
01:30:41,431 --> 01:30:44,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have people just moving into their bathrooms.

1248
01:30:44,312 --> 01:30:44,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1249
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:47,833
[SPEAKER_06]: They have that, like... There's some pretty complex MMOs that are on iOS.

1250
01:30:47,893 --> 01:30:49,074
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the one?

1251
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:50,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Legends or whatever it's called.

1252
01:30:50,554 --> 01:30:51,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Legends?

1253
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:51,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

1254
01:30:52,555 --> 01:30:55,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mega Neo Climax Super Mega Neo Climax

1255
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,151
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1256
01:31:42,868 --> 01:31:45,390
[SPEAKER_06]: ModNation Racers has reached a milestone this week.

1257
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:48,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Two million user-created items.

1258
01:31:48,813 --> 01:31:55,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty more download content on the way, according to the PlayStation blog, including a parts pack that's already available on the PlayStation Store.

1259
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: More track packs to make new tracks.

1260
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Western and pirate-themed.

1261
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:02,924
[SPEAKER_06]: More career DLC coming as well.

1262
01:32:03,284 --> 01:32:05,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The party is not stopping at ModNation Racers.

1263
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Two million user-created items.

1264
01:32:07,107 --> 01:32:08,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart Wii Zero.

1265
01:32:08,348 --> 01:32:09,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty crazy.

1266
01:32:09,249 --> 01:32:09,549
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1267
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:16,392
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation Home was announced that it's upgraded to version 1.5 and some of the new features that are coming out in 1.5 of the home client.

1268
01:32:16,752 --> 01:32:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Games that run within home

1269
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:39,018
[SPEAKER_06]: There's already kind of some of these, but they're trying to take it kind of up to the next step with low lag, real time multiplayer gaming, allowing more first person shooters, racing games and so forth.

1270
01:32:39,338 --> 01:32:42,859
[SPEAKER_06]: A demo was shown for Sodium 2 Project Velocity that shows some of this.

1271
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:46,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you gotta admit, Sodium was one of the more interesting things that happened with Home.

1272
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize it's stretching it, but it was interesting.

1273
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:52,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a sad... That's, you know, what's the big thing about Home.

1274
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but they say now it looks like Wipeout HD.

1275
01:32:54,774 --> 01:32:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And to that I go, oh, now that's interesting because Wipeout HD is kind of badass.

1276
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So I... If that is true, that you're going to see more stuff like that in Home...

1277
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,300
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1278
01:33:27,944 --> 01:33:32,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's some news from a game developers conference.

1279
01:33:33,227 --> 01:33:34,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninja Gaiden 3!

1280
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:38,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, wait, didn't we already have a Ninja Gaiden 3?

1281
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't it on NES?

1282
01:33:40,432 --> 01:33:43,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this time it doesn't involve Ancient Kingdoms or whatever the subtitle was.

1283
01:33:43,654 --> 01:33:45,174
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ancient Warships, whatever it was.

1284
01:33:45,335 --> 01:33:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: This one has a bloody Ryu on it, so that should be really, really hot.

1285
01:33:51,678 --> 01:33:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really, really cool.

1286
01:33:53,379 --> 01:33:53,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1287
01:33:55,246 --> 01:34:03,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have the Rock Band releases, which a friend of mine who was completely nuts over Depeche Mode is all happy with this.

1288
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:09,594
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Depeche Mode pack that has Never Let Me Down Again and Personal Jesus and Policy of Truth.

1289
01:34:10,374 --> 01:34:13,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab for Cutie.

1290
01:34:13,436 --> 01:34:17,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they had more Exciter stuff in there because that album was awesome.

1291
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:23,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but never least, we have more news for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1292
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:27,566
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the dates for Jill, Valentine, and Shuma Garath.

1293
01:34:28,567 --> 01:34:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They will be on March 15th for Xbox Live, 400 points a pop.

1294
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:39,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on March 16th for the PS3.

1295
01:34:39,753 --> 01:34:42,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta wait on PS3, ha ha ha ha.

1296
01:34:43,093 --> 01:34:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And you heard that right.

1297
01:34:44,935 --> 01:34:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: For people that aren't familiar with Microsoft Space Dollars.

1298
01:34:49,538 --> 01:34:50,078
[SPEAKER_04]: $5 a character.

1299
01:34:50,358 --> 01:34:51,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Capcom.

1300
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck.

1301
01:34:54,281 --> 01:34:55,242
[SPEAKER_04]: $5 a character.

1302
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:56,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

1303
01:34:56,263 --> 01:34:57,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get Jill.

1304
01:34:57,384 --> 01:34:58,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay to unlock content.

1305
01:34:59,005 --> 01:35:00,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is pay to unlock content.

1306
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:02,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on the disc already.

1307
01:35:02,887 --> 01:35:03,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Capcom.

1308
01:35:04,008 --> 01:35:04,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You suck balls.

1309
01:35:06,274 --> 01:35:07,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just mad at everyone tonight.

1310
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:08,014
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously.

1311
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:08,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1312
01:35:08,775 --> 01:35:09,535
[SPEAKER_04]: That is ridiculous.

1313
01:35:09,735 --> 01:35:10,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we put it on there.

1314
01:35:11,115 --> 01:35:12,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but we're dicks.

1315
01:35:12,556 --> 01:35:13,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry.

1316
01:35:13,556 --> 01:35:18,677
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to say something nice about a video game company to balance all this hatred coming out of you tonight.

1317
01:35:19,258 --> 01:35:23,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an awesome game, but they're dicks for charging $5 a character.

1318
01:35:24,279 --> 01:35:25,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it's stupid.

1319
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:30,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, characters should be like $2 at the most.

1320
01:35:30,844 --> 01:35:33,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially stuff that's not on the disc.

1321
01:35:33,526 --> 01:35:34,927
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff is already on the disc.

1322
01:35:35,268 --> 01:35:36,248
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just being dicks.

1323
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:40,652
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't even spend the time to apparently polish it up.

1324
01:35:40,672 --> 01:35:43,294
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no actual storylines or whatever for them.

1325
01:35:43,534 --> 01:35:45,295
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't do any cutscenes for them.

1326
01:35:45,535 --> 01:35:46,656
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just assholes.

1327
01:35:46,736 --> 01:35:47,497
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all they are.

1328
01:35:47,837 --> 01:35:50,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you buy them, you're supporting assholes, okay?

1329
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So just keep that in mind.

1330
01:35:53,141 --> 01:35:57,322
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says Deadpool better make Jill sandwich jokes.

1331
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:57,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1332
01:35:59,043 --> 01:35:59,663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

1333
01:36:00,223 --> 01:36:02,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think Deadpool should make a Jill sandwich joke?

1334
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,845
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt he probably would if silently.

1335
01:36:06,325 --> 01:36:07,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Does he ever do anything silently?

1336
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:07,865
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1337
01:36:09,466 --> 01:36:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the Twitter and read some of the topics that you guys sent to us tonight.

1338
01:36:14,907 --> 01:36:19,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR is the place you can send us tweets and we read them live.

1339
01:36:20,689 --> 01:36:21,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them though.

1340
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:45,971
[SPEAKER_06]: but most of them Spazinator PSN sends us an FYI about the PSN video store there's currently a free anime pilot Hikaru no Go and a movie rental Stranger Than Fiction on the PSN video store yeah I heard PSN was like giving away more movies you know not that these are all movies like people are lining up to see but hey it's free Stranger Than Fiction wasn't terrible yeah if you like free stuff why not there you go

1341
01:36:47,132 --> 01:36:49,554
[SPEAKER_06]: SilverSonic1534 is sending us a tweet.

1342
01:36:50,034 --> 01:36:51,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see this video?

1343
01:36:51,295 --> 01:36:54,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows some of Super Mario 3DS screenshots.

1344
01:36:54,616 --> 01:36:56,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks to be a game like Super Mario Bros.

1345
01:36:57,058 --> 01:36:56,597
3.

1346
01:36:57,398 --> 01:36:58,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And then follows that up with a correction.

1347
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not looking like Super Mario Bros.

1348
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:04,642
[SPEAKER_06]: 3, but apparently it's going to have some of the powers that were on Super Mario Bros.

1349
01:37:05,002 --> 01:37:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 on the game.

1350
01:37:07,684 --> 01:37:11,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us a Twitter link to an IGN video.

1351
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:20,149
[SPEAKER_06]: That I guess is kind of showing... I don't want to watch all these talking heads.

1352
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:23,630
[SPEAKER_06]: All they did was show the stupid... It looks like they're comparing it to Mario Galaxy.

1353
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:27,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And I heard about how the raccoon tail was visible in the little logo that they teased.

1354
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they're kind of showing this a little bit in the video.

1355
01:37:30,632 --> 01:37:30,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1356
01:37:33,064 --> 01:37:41,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure, you know, people, one thing they do love about Mario is all these little, like, powers, like the raccoon and, please, the Tanooki suit.

1357
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:42,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be amazing if they brought that back.

1358
01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:44,970
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's kind of one of the things that made Mario Galaxy fun.

1359
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:45,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I want this shoe.

1360
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:47,291
[SPEAKER_06]: The bee suit was awesome.

1361
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:53,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of that stuff, it's all going to be anything that tickles your retro bone and gets you to drop 40, 50 bucks on the games.

1362
01:37:54,074 --> 01:38:01,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, all of that information that was from IGN right there was all speculation because all they showed was the stupid logo.

1363
01:38:02,237 --> 01:38:03,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's going to be Mario 3.

1364
01:38:03,898 --> 01:38:05,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's speculate on what it's going to look like.

1365
01:38:05,979 --> 01:38:10,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it... Of course, it's going to look like they're successful Mario games, but 3D.

1366
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:13,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not that hard to figure out, I don't think.

1367
01:38:13,822 --> 01:38:14,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I crazy?

1368
01:38:14,662 --> 01:38:15,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1369
01:38:15,443 --> 01:38:18,184
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, going to Actdeft, who sends us a little twit pic.

1370
01:38:18,944 --> 01:38:21,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a collection of little Pokey dolls.

1371
01:38:21,965 --> 01:38:23,846
[SPEAKER_06]: He showed us his Pokemans live on air.

1372
01:38:24,146 --> 01:38:24,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1373
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:30,989
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question that goes with this, do you collect a video game paraphernalia or have a collection besides the vault?

1374
01:38:32,577 --> 01:38:34,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Will we put it all in the vault?

1375
01:38:35,403 --> 01:38:37,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this might be more of a question for Loki and myself, IDK.

1376
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:41,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys go ahead and answer that because it's a stupid question.

1377
01:38:41,532 --> 01:38:44,674
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest... Hey, now there's no such thing as a stupid question.

1378
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:46,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I said for me.

1379
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:47,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for you.

1380
01:38:48,015 --> 01:38:49,616
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I gotta be honest, not really.

1381
01:38:50,317 --> 01:38:55,019
[SPEAKER_06]: For a while, I seemed like I had an Xbox Live Arcade collection going on because I was downloading everything.

1382
01:38:55,419 --> 01:38:56,780
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't really collect.

1383
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy games just because they're rare.

1384
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:03,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have a lot of autograph things or collectibles.

1385
01:39:03,963 --> 01:39:33,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I rarely if ever buy limited editions I think the last like limited edition I remember buying was that Final Fantasy 12 at GameStop that had like the extra little frills I mean it's got to be a really big game I don't even buy collector's edition of Warcraft exception I did buy collector's editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King but it was at a charity event it was at the first Doom Loud I did buy those so and so that's for different reasons and I ended up giving away the Burning Crusade one to my friend for Christmas so different thing

1386
01:39:34,207 --> 01:39:35,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you a collector?

1387
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:43,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not a collector of anything, but I have like, you know, I get tchotchkes sometimes, so I have a bunch of stuff at my desk at work.

1388
01:39:43,502 --> 01:39:48,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got like, well, I used to collect Gundam models, but then I bought...

1389
01:39:49,502 --> 01:39:52,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much all of them.

1390
01:39:54,204 --> 01:39:55,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still fun every now and then.

1391
01:39:56,645 --> 01:40:05,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have, for the last Samurai Warriors game, I think, Samurai Warriors 3, they have these little mini figurines.

1392
01:40:05,690 --> 01:40:12,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I have almost a whole collection of those because we got a bunch of boxes of them, and so I opened all of them to try to create a whole collection.

1393
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:14,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm missing one, though, I think.

1394
01:40:14,914 --> 01:40:16,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the other thing I should say about why I don't collect.

1395
01:40:17,055 --> 01:40:18,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hoarding tendencies as it is.

1396
01:40:19,296 --> 01:40:22,617
[SPEAKER_06]: If I really was a rabid collector, it would be really bad, you guys.

1397
01:40:22,677 --> 01:40:24,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't.

1398
01:40:24,258 --> 01:40:25,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get rid of the stuff I have.

1399
01:40:25,959 --> 01:40:28,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my Japanese copy of Smash Bros.

1400
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:35,062
[SPEAKER_04]: at my desk sitting there since I don't need the Japanese version anymore, the real version.

1401
01:40:35,663 --> 01:40:37,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else did I have that's really weird?

1402
01:40:37,924 --> 01:40:37,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1403
01:40:42,186 --> 01:40:44,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a poster for the Atari Pac-Man.

1404
01:40:45,110 --> 01:40:46,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I want it for a penny on eBay.

1405
01:40:47,353 --> 01:40:47,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1406
01:40:49,255 --> 01:40:52,139
[SPEAKER_06]: But nothing to the scale of DarkSakura's vault.

1407
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:55,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a whole little special level all on its own.

1408
01:40:55,203 --> 01:40:58,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our stuff that we've gotten that we've really looked into is just sort of like...

1409
01:40:59,608 --> 01:41:01,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be there and we'll see it and it's cool.

1410
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:11,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've gotten all kinds of neat collector stuff, you know, through Dan getting some swag from the local reps and, you know, going to conventions and things.

1411
01:41:12,236 --> 01:41:27,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think the coolest, one of the coolest things we got was the Goemon doll because we bought our Twilight Zone pinball game from the guy who owned Working Designs and he just gave one to Dan.

1412
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:27,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1413
01:41:28,766 --> 01:41:30,527
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1414
01:41:59,162 --> 01:42:02,568
[SPEAKER_07]: on the wall and just stuff we've looked into.

1415
01:42:02,809 --> 01:42:05,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sometimes this stuff just falls in our lap.

1416
01:42:05,233 --> 01:42:07,396
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like we're trying to collect it on purpose.

1417
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1418
01:42:10,163 --> 01:42:14,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Dan says from the other room, and some of it we spent stupid money on.

1419
01:42:15,826 --> 01:42:16,726
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on.

1420
01:42:17,306 --> 01:42:20,208
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple tweets coming to us from Tigerclaw.

1421
01:42:20,528 --> 01:42:22,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw linking us to this story.

1422
01:42:22,889 --> 01:42:26,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a quote from Cliffy B., Cliff Blazinski.

1423
01:42:27,231 --> 01:42:28,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Merry gamers, don't date them.

1424
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to read verbatim this article from Joystick with a Q. Proper credit to them because I was tweeted this story and didn't have a chance to skim things in advance for the relevant stuff.

1425
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:52,842
[SPEAKER_06]: In a candid talk during the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Epic Games Design Director Cliff Pazinski advised attendees to have an educated gut and to be cognizant of the value of marketing and long-term relationships with customers.

1426
01:42:53,222 --> 01:42:59,564
[SPEAKER_06]: He encapsulated his talk in the Power Creative, a project member who is unique, valuable, and visibly tied to the game's identity.

1427
01:42:59,865 --> 01:43:00,985
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be anyone.

1428
01:43:01,465 --> 01:43:01,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

1429
01:43:01,805 --> 01:43:05,947
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's more like he's not saying that in the literal sense, like Merry Gamers.

1430
01:43:06,027 --> 01:43:07,848
[SPEAKER_06]: He's saying kind of, you know, be...

1431
01:43:09,068 --> 01:43:09,709
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1432
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:38,229
[SPEAKER_06]: According to Blazinski, the market only tolerates games that land on the far end of the spectrum between freemium snack games and big budget games like Gears of War.

1433
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the middle class game is dead.

1434
01:43:41,071 --> 01:43:44,172
[SPEAKER_06]: The power creative understands how to engage fans over a long period of time.

1435
01:43:44,552 --> 01:43:47,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Make gamers marry your game, not just date it.

1436
01:43:49,065 --> 01:43:53,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you want to read the rest of that story, it's on JoystickWithACue.com as tweeted to us tonight.

1437
01:43:55,047 --> 01:44:03,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Do game developers, some of them, need to work on the relationship with the fan and that whole idea of marry your audience and don't just take them out on one night stands?

1438
01:44:04,391 --> 01:44:08,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think that whole little comparison is way out of... You need to satisfy your market.

1439
01:44:10,533 --> 01:44:12,354
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't satisfy them, they'll leave.

1440
01:44:15,826 --> 01:44:19,992
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll leave you for other developers who love them longer and harder.

1441
01:44:34,209 --> 01:44:35,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man Universe Mega Man Universe

1442
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:58,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, another tweet to us from Tigerclaw, a link to a story on Kotaku about the social game developers rant.

1443
01:44:59,005 --> 01:45:00,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I did hear about this.

1444
01:45:00,265 --> 01:45:11,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there was a panel at Game Developers Conference where a bunch of the folks that develop for these social game companies like Zynga and Playdom and all this, they basically got up and said, Hey, you know what?

1445
01:45:11,449 --> 01:45:12,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop picking on us.

1446
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw you.

1447
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1448
01:45:34,511 --> 01:46:01,600
[SPEAKER_06]: they also did a little mini game where the developers were encouraged I'm sorry the people attending the panels were encouraged to collect coins and whoever could get the most coins got to do a rant of their own which is kind of funny because it's like that's kind of like how a social game would actually work so ha so there you go is that it for tweets oh no one last tweet from blue swim orange lounge foodio question which is better Cadbury cream eggs or marshmallow peeps also welcome back Loki

1449
01:46:01,874 --> 01:46:04,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Cadbury cream eggs and marshmallows are disgusting.

1450
01:46:06,336 --> 01:46:07,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually disagree.

1451
01:46:07,216 --> 01:46:09,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Marshmallow peeps because they can joust in the microwave.

1452
01:46:10,077 --> 01:46:11,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And Cadbury cream eggs are too much.

1453
01:46:12,638 --> 01:46:15,299
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to eat a Cadbury cream egg, it needs to be one of those little mini ones.

1454
01:46:15,999 --> 01:46:17,740
[SPEAKER_06]: The big ones are too much, too rich.

1455
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,720
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's fantastic?

1456
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:22,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to Touch of Britain and getting the Mars eggs.

1457
01:46:23,162 --> 01:46:23,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are fantastic.

1458
01:46:24,823 --> 01:46:25,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the orange cream eggs.

1459
01:46:26,023 --> 01:46:27,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I still kind of prefer marshmallow peeps personally.

1460
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1461
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:32,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big fan of either one.

1462
01:46:34,301 --> 01:46:35,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Cream eggs, I guess.

1463
01:46:37,222 --> 01:46:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1464
01:46:37,882 --> 01:46:38,562
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for tweets.

1465
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:40,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

1466
01:46:41,403 --> 01:46:46,624
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, let's get back into some other video game news before we get to the mailbag, the FUs, and of course, your phone calls.

1467
01:46:47,744 --> 01:46:49,125
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1468
01:46:50,085 --> 01:46:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of neat and kind of along the lines of stuff that

1469
01:46:55,487 --> 01:46:56,007
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1470
01:47:15,223 --> 01:47:29,216
[SPEAKER_04]: ISU which stands for the interfaces you and of course it's SoftConnect's 3D gesture recognition software development kit now available for qualified developers and they can license it for free.

1471
01:47:30,177 --> 01:47:36,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It says it's going to work with all 3D depth sensing devices, which includes support for the Kinect.

1472
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:42,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's a strictly non-commercial software development kit.

1473
01:47:43,767 --> 01:47:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And a commercial version, of course, can be purchased from them as well.

1474
01:47:47,589 --> 01:47:48,550
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's kind of neat.

1475
01:47:48,670 --> 01:47:52,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says there's going to be different ones actually coming out from it.

1476
01:47:52,992 --> 01:47:55,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Evoluce, PrimeSense, and of course, Microsoft.

1477
01:47:55,794 --> 01:48:05,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So, neat to see that there's going to be some... I'm actually, I'd be kind of curious to see what the first, like, real retail game that comes out that supports Kinect.

1478
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:06,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of neat.

1479
01:48:07,543 --> 01:48:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, not to be outdone by that, PlayStation, the PlayStation Move, I should say,

1480
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:25,811
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have some tools as well to be able to program stuff that supports the PlayStation, iCamera, and the Move controllers.

1481
01:48:26,371 --> 01:48:34,714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called MoveMe and it's a software tool that's going to be using the PlayStation Move technology to create unique applications.

1482
01:48:35,494 --> 01:48:37,436
[SPEAKER_04]: and, of course, it's coming soon.

1483
01:48:37,456 --> 01:48:48,706
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that MoveMe is going to be a downloadable application for the PS3 that allows researchers, students, hobbyists, developers, or anyone to build the ability to develop for the PlayStation Move.

1484
01:48:49,347 --> 01:48:57,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said they want to see what innovative applications programs can create using the PlayStation Move controller, the PS3 system, and the PlayStation Eye camera and the PC.

1485
01:48:58,595 --> 01:48:58,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1486
01:49:00,475 --> 01:49:09,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, it's going to be available on the PlayStation Network this spring, but people that are interested will be able to apply for it as well.

1487
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:20,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to, I believe, usplaystation.com slash ps3 slash playstation-move slash move-me and check that out.

1488
01:49:21,128 --> 01:49:21,728
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of neat.

1489
01:49:21,748 --> 01:49:22,969
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think will ultimately come of this?

1490
01:49:23,509 --> 01:49:23,549
Oh.

1491
01:49:23,829 --> 01:49:25,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some applications or whatever.

1492
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:26,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're... I don't know.

1493
01:49:27,471 --> 01:49:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff that they could do with the PlayStation that they're not.

1494
01:49:31,773 --> 01:49:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, remember a long time ago they were showing some of the stuff, even what they could do with the PlayStation Eye camera.

1495
01:49:37,156 --> 01:49:39,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they're all, hey, look, we made a combat game.

1496
01:49:39,117 --> 01:49:42,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the developers for the PlayStation Eye stuff.

1497
01:49:42,899 --> 01:49:46,360
[SPEAKER_04]: They were showing, hey, look, we can make a combat game where you draw your...

1498
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:51,303
[SPEAKER_04]: and tanks that you use and you can scan them in and play a game with it.

1499
01:49:52,264 --> 01:49:55,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They did all those cool tech demos but never released them.

1500
01:49:56,326 --> 01:50:00,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, you could have done something cool with that but no.

1501
01:50:00,769 --> 01:50:04,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see more like bite-sized applications coming maybe to the PlayStation Network?

1502
01:50:04,651 --> 01:50:04,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They should.

1503
01:50:05,012 --> 01:50:12,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was the whole point with like even on the PSP how they have the PlayStation Network on the PSP and they have the PSP minis and stuff.

1504
01:50:13,157 --> 01:50:16,178
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be more of like those bite-sized applications.

1505
01:50:16,219 --> 01:50:16,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping...

1506
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:19,241
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on and so forth.

1507
01:50:42,014 --> 01:50:42,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1508
01:51:03,413 --> 01:51:05,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live has been around quite a while.

1509
01:51:05,957 --> 01:51:06,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been around since about 2002.

1510
01:51:18,877 --> 01:51:19,337
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1511
01:51:41,647 --> 01:51:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not saying what meets the qualifications for dead.

1512
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:54,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I am assuming that ones that were used on the old Xbox, because old Xbox Live is gone, that never migrated to a 360 account.

1513
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:57,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that's what qualifies, but it's a huge assumption.

1514
01:51:57,922 --> 01:52:03,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I think part of what definitely falls into this, people that change their name, their old name would still be unavailable.

1515
01:52:03,867 --> 01:52:06,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a lot of that is kind of getting moved permanently.

1516
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:27,568
[SPEAKER_06]: so uh also it's stressed on here uh the process will take time to complete they will will not be able to tell you when a gamer tag that you want is available you should always check back regularly because they are reviving gamer tags daily you can go into the xbox channel and change gamer tag to see if the gamer tag you want is available I tried to get Major Nelson but it was taken hmm

1517
01:52:28,334 --> 01:52:42,263
[SPEAKER_06]: so there you go I did notice though one name I would be interested in changing to was available so who knows I'm not sure how I feel about $10 just to change my gamer tag but you never know we'll see anything's possible

1518
01:52:43,925 --> 01:52:45,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with some more stories, DarkSakura.

1519
01:53:10,745 --> 01:53:13,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, today's other story is Metal Cthulhu.

1520
01:53:13,029 --> 01:53:13,751
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

1521
01:53:14,633 --> 01:53:15,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Another World.

1522
01:53:15,755 --> 01:53:16,536
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember this game?

1523
01:53:16,576 --> 01:53:17,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out in the 90s.

1524
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:19,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I do remember that game.

1525
01:53:19,702 --> 01:53:22,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It was epic when it came out.

1526
01:53:23,414 --> 01:53:26,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it actually first came out in 1991.

1527
01:53:27,115 --> 01:53:29,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a cinematic sci-fi side-scroller.

1528
01:53:29,436 --> 01:53:32,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be brought up to date to come out for iPhone and iPad.

1529
01:53:33,597 --> 01:53:35,878
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being ported by Dotemu.

1530
01:53:40,439 --> 01:53:46,421
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't said anything about new features, but they're saying that they want it to be the best experience on iOS.

1531
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:50,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm looking at a video on YouTube of this game being played, actually.

1532
01:53:51,849 --> 01:53:53,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking me back a little bit, let me skip ahead.

1533
01:53:53,472 --> 01:53:54,794
[SPEAKER_06]: This is somebody playing it on an Amiga.

1534
01:53:56,117 --> 01:53:56,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1535
01:53:56,866 --> 01:54:00,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it really is a pretty game.

1536
01:54:00,267 --> 01:54:01,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was great.

1537
01:54:02,008 --> 01:54:08,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is supposed to be just a big old update.

1538
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:18,853
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're also working on an Ubisoft game called From Dust that's going to be out on PC and PSN and Xbox Live Arcade.

1539
01:54:19,393 --> 01:54:19,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1540
01:54:21,074 --> 01:54:21,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, another world.

1541
01:54:22,134 --> 01:54:33,861
[SPEAKER_06]: This game was kind of like a souped-up version of Prince of Persia, but, like, that's really... It's like Prince of Persia in space, but with epic cutscenes involved.

1542
01:54:33,981 --> 01:54:34,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1543
01:54:34,461 --> 01:54:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of a little flashback, too.

1544
01:54:37,143 --> 01:54:38,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1545
01:54:39,884 --> 01:54:41,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Running away from a killer bear.

1546
01:54:41,765 --> 01:54:43,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this game was so epic when it came out.

1547
01:54:43,646 --> 01:54:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't, like, Out of This World or something like that?

1548
01:54:47,788 --> 01:54:48,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called...

1549
01:54:50,868 --> 01:54:53,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in the US it was called Out of This World.

1550
01:54:53,113 --> 01:54:55,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Another World was the UK release.

1551
01:54:56,521 --> 01:54:57,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet I still know it by that name.

1552
01:54:58,205 --> 01:54:58,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1553
01:54:59,548 --> 01:54:59,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

1554
01:55:02,506 --> 01:55:28,796
[SPEAKER_06]: very cool Salacious Pop in our chatroom says that game is fucking amazing but it's hard as fuck I have no idea how you can play it without tactile controls and I got the HD version they put out like four years ago I didn't realize they'd done a remake already and damn good point it's cool that they're putting it out again and nostalgia and all that on the iOS but again no joystick means hard game is very very hard so I don't know we'll see

1555
01:55:30,566 --> 01:55:32,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on with a few more stories.

1556
01:55:32,912 --> 01:55:34,937
[SPEAKER_06]: The mailbag is coming up as well as the Skype line.

1557
01:55:38,707 --> 01:56:06,873
[SPEAKER_04]: so they've got some cool stuff coming to OnLive some of the things that they announced at Game Developers Conference that they're going to be offering to developers that want to put their games on to the platform they're saying voice chat game invites for multiplayer games the ability to directly upload brag clips to YouTube and then also achievements which they're guessing is going to be stuff derived from console versions

1558
01:56:09,094 --> 01:56:12,115
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to put up an old retro game or something like that and add achievements to it, they can.

1559
01:56:13,015 --> 01:56:27,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to allow developers to let their game support wireless controllers when played on mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, or Android-powered phones or tablets.

1560
01:56:30,603 --> 01:56:33,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, they need some controllers for some of those devices.

1561
01:56:35,307 --> 01:56:35,467
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

1562
01:56:35,487 --> 01:56:35,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1563
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, they're doing alright, I think.

1564
01:57:06,402 --> 01:57:12,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're making progress, and it's definitely been, you know, it works, so... I think it's worked a lot better than anybody thought it would.

1565
01:57:12,730 --> 01:57:15,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people wrote this thing off when it first came out.

1566
01:57:15,674 --> 01:57:16,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1567
01:57:16,335 --> 01:57:17,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Before it came out, really.

1568
01:57:18,758 --> 01:57:18,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1569
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see what continues with that.

1570
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:23,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It's neat that they're still going with it.

1571
01:57:23,382 --> 01:57:46,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That type of device, though, how they have the micro-console and stuff like that, if they can do MMOs on that, that's how you would get a device like the Jungle, where it would basically be something that runs on a server at some company or whatever, like World of Warcraft or something like that, and you have your controls on there, and it's very limited, but you don't need to have the powerhouse of...

1572
01:57:46,796 --> 01:57:49,401
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1573
01:58:01,345 --> 01:58:02,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1574
01:58:20,612 --> 01:58:20,772
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Maxx

1575
01:58:37,106 --> 01:58:43,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And the music's pretty popular amongst the crowd, but usually there's not a real legitimate anyway way to get the music outside of Korea.

1576
01:58:44,111 --> 01:58:44,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

1577
01:58:44,851 --> 01:58:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting in March, it was announced, Pentavision has announced that the soundtracks for DJ Maxx are going to be published on iTunes.

1578
01:58:52,836 --> 01:59:21,081
[SPEAKER_06]: three albums followed by a new album every week I guess until they get caught up because that's a lot of albums but there have been quite a few DJ Max games at this point so fans of that series are going to be very happy that they get their nice CD quality sound out of iTunes that'll be pretty cool if they didn't already get it through other means from the Korean albums that's pretty cool you know iTunes has been doing a lot of different Japanese pop artists like the really big names like Ayumi and Goct and

1579
01:59:21,721 --> 01:59:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I bought an Ayumi song on there not that long ago.

1580
01:59:23,764 --> 01:59:27,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a Larkin CL album a while back.

1581
01:59:27,308 --> 01:59:29,090
[SPEAKER_06]: They also do a lot of video game soundtracks.

1582
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:34,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting to me that they don't have a gaming section in their store.

1583
01:59:34,177 --> 01:59:34,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I missed it.

1584
01:59:34,958 --> 01:59:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there is a soundtracks section, so maybe it's buried in there and I've just missed it.

1585
01:59:39,563 --> 01:59:40,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1586
02:00:05,529 --> 02:00:05,689
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Maxx

1587
02:00:28,325 --> 02:00:28,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Loom

1588
02:00:36,112 --> 02:00:36,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Loom.

1589
02:00:36,953 --> 02:00:37,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they?

1590
02:00:37,433 --> 02:00:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: They did something.

1591
02:00:38,534 --> 02:00:39,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it was a hack.

1592
02:00:39,094 --> 02:00:39,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Loom's on Steam.

1593
02:00:39,814 --> 02:00:41,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's on Steam.

1594
02:00:41,055 --> 02:00:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was like a hack for the iOS or something, of course.

1595
02:00:43,397 --> 02:00:44,677
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I got Loom on Steam.

1596
02:00:44,757 --> 02:00:47,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody wants to hack the old LucasArts stuff for that.

1597
02:00:47,399 --> 02:00:50,301
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I actually have a copy of Loom for PC.

1598
02:00:50,881 --> 02:00:51,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought it on eBay.

1599
02:00:51,942 --> 02:00:52,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1600
02:00:52,622 --> 02:00:53,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I love that game.

1601
02:00:54,643 --> 02:00:58,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I hardly remember how to play it because of all the chords and stuff.

1602
02:00:58,226 --> 02:01:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember some of the chords and I do them way too early.

1603
02:01:00,967 --> 02:01:02,028
[SPEAKER_07]: But Loom would be fun on Steam.

1604
02:01:02,848 --> 02:01:03,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Scorched Earth.

1605
02:01:04,429 --> 02:01:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1606
02:01:05,449 --> 02:01:06,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

1607
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:08,211
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been years since I played Scorched Earth.

1608
02:01:08,351 --> 02:01:09,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1609
02:01:09,091 --> 02:01:10,292
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Phantasmagoria?

1610
02:01:11,472 --> 02:01:13,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not outside the realm of possibility.

1611
02:01:13,893 --> 02:01:16,595
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a news on that not that long ago.

1612
02:01:18,075 --> 02:01:23,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they brought out the seventh guest, which I know it's a completely different company, but for some reason these go together in my mind.

1613
02:01:23,958 --> 02:01:27,880
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were talking about the 11th hour, and I want to say around that same time we had heard something about Phantasmagoria.

1614
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:31,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be pretty cool if that were to come out for iOS.

1615
02:01:31,941 --> 02:01:36,423
[SPEAKER_06]: The point and click games would lend themselves much better to the iOS system.

1616
02:01:36,523 --> 02:01:41,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe like Kyrandia would be awesome if we could get that.

1617
02:01:41,884 --> 02:01:44,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, I've got to say King's Quest would be kind of neat.

1618
02:01:44,685 --> 02:01:49,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was the whole Flash versions that got shut down, so we know it's kind of possible.

1619
02:01:51,127 --> 02:01:51,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Good old games.

1620
02:01:52,728 --> 02:01:55,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a Phantasmagoria for digital download.

1621
02:01:55,409 --> 02:01:56,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's why we reported on it.

1622
02:01:56,849 --> 02:02:02,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you have the SCUMM emulators though for jailbroken devices.

1623
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know me, I'd like to see more classic Commodore 64 games show up outside of just the emulator.

1624
02:02:07,273 --> 02:02:10,614
[SPEAKER_06]: There is the emulator that's available but it keeps going up and down and up and down.

1625
02:02:10,654 --> 02:02:12,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if it's still on the store right now.

1626
02:02:12,594 --> 02:02:17,456
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have there's some other emulator that was out there that was

1627
02:02:18,334 --> 02:02:20,576
[SPEAKER_06]: iDOS was an emulator.

1628
02:02:20,596 --> 02:02:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Duke Nukem and all that.

1629
02:02:21,737 --> 02:02:23,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it on my phone, but it's pulled from the store now.

1630
02:02:24,218 --> 02:02:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: iDOS.

1631
02:02:25,459 --> 02:02:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one.

1632
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:29,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get the, they finally leaked that out too.

1633
02:02:29,742 --> 02:02:34,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that Minecraft client that got uploaded for just a little brief millisecond or whatever?

1634
02:02:35,407 --> 02:02:36,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I finally found that.

1635
02:02:37,748 --> 02:02:40,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't have a Minecraft account, so I can't play it yet.

1636
02:02:42,293 --> 02:02:44,678
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's get to the mailbag.

1637
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:48,767
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

1638
02:02:49,348 --> 02:02:52,295
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air.

1639
02:02:53,675 --> 02:02:55,836
[SPEAKER_07]: The first email is actually directed towards me.

1640
02:02:56,517 --> 02:02:59,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Hello, I heard last week that DarkSakura is going to Faname Con.

1641
02:03:00,378 --> 02:03:01,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be going this year as well.

1642
02:03:01,559 --> 02:03:03,360
[SPEAKER_07]: How about an OLR meetup at the convention?

1643
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:04,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope to see you, Sakura.

1644
02:03:05,021 --> 02:03:05,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Jinai.

1645
02:03:06,061 --> 02:03:14,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if everything works out, I'm not making any, like, supreme promises or anything because, honestly, I miss cosplaying and I think I wouldn't mind doing it again.

1646
02:03:14,906 --> 02:03:17,647
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, we definitely need to see about getting our panel.

1647
02:03:18,348 --> 02:03:20,709
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be... Might be a little late for that.

1648
02:03:20,729 --> 02:03:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: We're almost into... Oh, we're at, like, mid-March...

1649
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:26,218
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could swing it, yeah, I'd love to do it.

1650
02:03:26,538 --> 02:03:27,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably be here that weekend.

1651
02:03:28,198 --> 02:03:29,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bring the dolls again.

1652
02:03:29,878 --> 02:03:30,939
[SPEAKER_07]: The scary, creepy dolls.

1653
02:03:33,519 --> 02:03:34,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

1654
02:03:34,859 --> 02:03:39,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, how would you feel if Konami gave the DDR series a reboot on the Kinect?

1655
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:51,443
[SPEAKER_07]: The game would feature songs from DDR's history and songs found in the charts today, and it would also feature an online mode where players can compete in dance battles or form their own dance groups and choreograph their own dances.

1656
02:03:54,064 --> 02:03:59,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, unfortunately, Konami's already kind of screwed the pooch with that because Dance Masters is kind of that.

1657
02:04:00,048 --> 02:04:06,972
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it's a lot of the old DDR songs, but in that whole Para slash Dance Central-esque kind of format.

1658
02:04:06,992 --> 02:04:10,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a demo available now on Xbox 360 if you want to see what this game's all about.

1659
02:04:11,975 --> 02:04:12,595
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I...

1660
02:04:13,896 --> 02:04:20,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you have some good ideas, but the weird thing is, I don't know, did he say with a dance mat and Kinect?

1661
02:04:21,081 --> 02:04:23,602
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it just says Kinect.

1662
02:04:23,662 --> 02:04:24,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

1663
02:04:24,783 --> 02:04:34,069
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to use a Kinect, though, with DDR, the upcoming DDR game, Dance Dance Revolution, because, you know, they made it just... We covered last week where there's a hack for it that they're trying to...

1664
02:04:35,183 --> 02:04:37,866
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Step Mania, but I'm talking about the actual Dance Dance Revolution.

1665
02:04:37,886 --> 02:04:43,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the one that came out on PS3 with Move support and then on the Wii as well?

1666
02:04:43,414 --> 02:04:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's coming out in April on Xbox 360 and it uses the Xbox Vision Camera.

1667
02:04:49,922 --> 02:04:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is now also technically the Kinect, but you can do crap with that.

1668
02:04:54,445 --> 02:05:02,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, we don't need to give Konami reasons to make more gimmicky crap for Dan Says Revolution.

1669
02:05:02,731 --> 02:05:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They just need to stick to the core mechanics and improve on that, or just basically do what they were doing back years ago, and they would be fine.

1670
02:05:10,156 --> 02:05:11,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're trying...

1671
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they're doing anymore.

1672
02:05:14,742 --> 02:05:17,286
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to just reform Konami Hawaii and give them the game.

1673
02:05:17,867 --> 02:05:21,934
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the only thing that would get me super interested in DDR again.

1674
02:05:21,974 --> 02:05:22,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Put me in charge.

1675
02:05:22,675 --> 02:05:25,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make you a game that's going to be perfect.

1676
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:28,470
[SPEAKER_06]: More emails?

1677
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:30,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there was actually more to this email.

1678
02:05:30,571 --> 02:05:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

1679
02:05:31,611 --> 02:05:37,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, it would be great if you guys would give my video game blog a quick plug on the show, which I will be happy to do.

1680
02:05:37,213 --> 02:05:37,613
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1681
02:05:37,873 --> 02:05:38,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be $50.

1682
02:05:38,913 --> 02:05:39,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Hush.

1683
02:05:39,893 --> 02:05:40,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the link.

1684
02:05:41,254 --> 02:05:45,595
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStationUK.wordpress.com Thanks, Liam.

1685
02:05:46,375 --> 02:05:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Liam.

1686
02:05:48,496 --> 02:05:53,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know Liam's thoughts on the whole LG lawsuit that we covered at the top of the show, since that is affecting the UK.

1687
02:05:53,818 --> 02:05:54,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1688
02:05:54,178 --> 02:05:55,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's on his blog.

1689
02:05:56,138 --> 02:05:58,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll have to just go there later.

1690
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:01,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe look later.

1691
02:06:02,022 --> 02:06:03,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So, next email.

1692
02:06:03,283 --> 02:06:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Greetings, OLR.

1693
02:06:04,123 --> 02:06:05,664
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your neighborhood turtle again.

1694
02:06:06,144 --> 02:06:09,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I've included a link you guys should check out concerning Unreal Engine 3.

1695
02:06:10,627 --> 02:06:17,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at the screen caps plus the previews of Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3, I'm incredibly impressed, mostly with the lighting.

1696
02:06:17,771 --> 02:06:21,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Being a graphics whore, all these next-gen games look very promising.

1697
02:06:22,174 --> 02:06:22,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I love pretty things.

1698
02:06:22,815 --> 02:06:25,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Why else did I sit through the first 13 hours of Final Fantasy XIII?

1699
02:06:25,196 --> 02:06:25,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really.

1700
02:06:44,634 --> 02:06:47,695
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the lighting is really tremendous.

1701
02:06:47,755 --> 02:06:48,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

1702
02:06:48,455 --> 02:06:52,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Unreal Engine, the last one, was amazing enough.

1703
02:06:52,976 --> 02:06:56,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the new one's just going to be even more of an improvement.

1704
02:06:56,077 --> 02:06:56,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be great.

1705
02:06:56,537 --> 02:06:57,317
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's four.

1706
02:06:57,377 --> 02:06:59,737
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the new updates that they did for three.

1707
02:06:59,898 --> 02:07:00,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my gosh.

1708
02:07:00,878 --> 02:07:03,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was the new engine.

1709
02:07:03,858 --> 02:07:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's just the tweaks that they did for three, I think.

1710
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty crazy poly count these things are running, too.

1711
02:07:10,841 --> 02:07:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have Unreal Remember the next one's Rage, I thought

1712
02:07:15,171 --> 02:07:17,112
[SPEAKER_04]: from, was it Epic Rage?

1713
02:07:17,673 --> 02:07:17,873
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1714
02:07:18,553 --> 02:07:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1715
02:07:19,814 --> 02:07:21,755
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know Rage is the next big engine.

1716
02:07:21,956 --> 02:07:23,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I don't think that's Unreal 4.

1717
02:07:23,797 --> 02:07:26,439
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just tweaks to the three, if I remember correctly.

1718
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to see what crazy, like, non-shooting things come out of the engine.

1719
02:07:29,921 --> 02:07:33,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, like, we've been getting some really random things in the Unreal Engine.

1720
02:07:35,384 --> 02:07:39,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there was a few role-playing games from Square that were done in the engine.

1721
02:07:40,508 --> 02:07:42,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Last Remnant that was in Unreal?

1722
02:07:42,249 --> 02:07:42,289
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1723
02:07:42,715 --> 02:07:43,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Last tournament was?

1724
02:07:43,776 --> 02:07:47,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've been looking at this, and this is kind of funny since I've been taking my 3D class.

1725
02:07:48,259 --> 02:07:55,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, now that I actually understand the physics behind some of this, it's pretty cool seeing, you know, what happens by layer.

1726
02:07:55,564 --> 02:07:56,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just amazing.

1727
02:07:56,605 --> 02:08:01,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm going to share this picture with the chat room because this is a really good example.

1728
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:10,715
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one of the dude's face where they start with the, it's basically just a demo of the subsurface scattering.

1729
02:08:10,916 --> 02:08:11,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really cool.

1730
02:08:14,284 --> 02:08:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also showing how cool smoking is.

1731
02:08:18,629 --> 02:08:26,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, a falling cigarette is a good showing of lighting and physics in action.

1732
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was clearly part of their demo.

1733
02:08:30,270 --> 02:08:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: and it also shows that Epic has set the release Falling Cigarette the game after Gears of War 3 and I can't be any more excited than I am possibly right now.

1734
02:08:39,597 --> 02:08:40,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Next email.

1735
02:08:41,639 --> 02:08:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi guys.

1736
02:08:42,219 --> 02:08:43,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Cigarettes will fall.

1737
02:08:44,721 --> 02:08:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Fall of 2012.

1738
02:08:45,682 --> 02:08:46,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi guys.

1739
02:08:46,122 --> 02:08:49,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the website won't let me post this because it's too long I figured I'd just email it.

1740
02:08:49,585 --> 02:08:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh good.

1741
02:08:52,393 --> 02:08:53,994
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura loves long emails.

1742
02:09:20,072 --> 02:09:20,973
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1743
02:09:40,792 --> 02:09:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1744
02:09:59,029 --> 02:10:02,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Her saying that about a game is not something I've seen every day.

1745
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:03,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't I be hearing every day?

1746
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, in fact, I think this is the third game ever she's been that impressed.

1747
02:10:11,211 --> 02:10:19,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, I went through the rest of the demo, even showing her how much customization was involved in creating her character and following the storylines and how they can branch off.

1748
02:10:19,233 --> 02:10:24,454
[SPEAKER_07]: After the full demo, I found that while the controls aren't as good as I'd like them to be, they're far better than the Xbox 360.

1749
02:10:25,814 --> 02:10:27,356
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1750
02:10:43,374 --> 02:10:50,458
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, any game that causes a casual person to stop and take notice wins more in my book than something that's designed for hardcore fans.

1751
02:10:51,238 --> 02:10:52,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, another topic for another day.

1752
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:55,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, why the PS3 over Xbox?

1753
02:10:55,581 --> 02:10:59,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides control, the download content comes with it instead of having to buy it.

1754
02:10:59,923 --> 02:11:04,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides, it's very rare that a game does better on PS3 for me than the Xbox 360.

1755
02:11:04,886 --> 02:11:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And to end it, her final thought after I turned off the demo, sure beats Halo.

1756
02:11:08,167 --> 02:11:09,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that sealed the deal.

1757
02:11:09,928 --> 02:11:33,942
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes having the audience there while playing a game is more fun than playing it alone well you won't be on this week but we'll catch you guys later oh no well won't be on this week but we'll catch you guys later and that was from Mantis Knight that's another one of those games you know it's funny because I brought up Beyond Good and Evil earlier in the show and it's one of those games like everybody played and loved and I'm just now catching up on it yeah put Mass Effect in that same bin it's funny

1758
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:37,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Last email.

1759
02:11:38,406 --> 02:11:40,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR gang, ACHP here.

1760
02:11:40,887 --> 02:11:44,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of people who listen to this show probably want to work in games.

1761
02:11:44,389 --> 02:11:44,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I do.

1762
02:11:45,409 --> 02:11:46,769
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought I'd share some advice.

1763
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Meet people who make games.

1764
02:11:48,450 --> 02:11:55,413
[SPEAKER_07]: While not being able to afford the $1,000 pass to get into Game Developers Conference this weekend, I was able to squeeze myself into some post-hours events.

1765
02:11:55,853 --> 02:11:59,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me tell you, it is probably the best thing I have ever done for my professional career.

1766
02:12:00,035 --> 02:12:04,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be surprised at how willing people are to chat and network with complete strangers who don't even work in the industry.

1767
02:12:05,297 --> 02:12:25,502
[SPEAKER_07]: at a random party for a company I've never heard of I was able to meet the business developer managers for Q Entertainment met a guy who knew a guy who was there with a recruiter who's now helping me find placement as an entry-level programmer so if you want to get your foot in the door and haven't booked a ticket for PAX do it if you and if you have go look up your favorite company

1768
02:12:26,562 --> 02:12:30,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Go look up if your favorite company is doing any meet and greet type of activities.

1769
02:12:30,706 --> 02:12:31,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You may be glad you did.

1770
02:12:32,427 --> 02:12:33,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope this helps someone.

1771
02:12:33,388 --> 02:12:35,009
[SPEAKER_07]: ACHP P.S.

1772
02:12:35,069 --> 02:12:38,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Game developers are definitely the most socially awkward people ever.

1773
02:12:38,632 --> 02:12:43,596
[SPEAKER_07]: With an open bar and go-go dancers on the tables, they are just idly chatting or playing on their phone.

1774
02:12:43,716 --> 02:12:44,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I lulled.

1775
02:12:44,897 --> 02:12:45,358
[SPEAKER_07]: P.P.S.

1776
02:12:45,798 --> 02:12:51,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote this on my Android phone, again to prove that you can write grammatically correct and properly spelled and punctuated words without a keyboard or autocorrect.

1777
02:12:51,963 --> 02:12:52,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheers.

1778
02:12:52,624 --> 02:12:53,645
[SPEAKER_06]: You said to be very patient.

1779
02:12:54,966 --> 02:12:56,126
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I agree.

1780
02:12:56,927 --> 02:13:05,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best parts, at least about E3, which is one I was going to pretty regularly for a while, some of the best part is networking.

1781
02:13:06,770 --> 02:13:08,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, absolutely.

1782
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:12,072
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to be going to any of those shows, just don't be shy.

1783
02:13:12,272 --> 02:13:13,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say hi to people.

1784
02:13:13,772 --> 02:13:18,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell when somebody doesn't want to talk to you or if you're bugging somebody or what have you, you know.

1785
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:23,287
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the times at these expos, people kind of, you know, they want to be social.

1786
02:13:23,327 --> 02:13:24,008
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to hang out.

1787
02:13:24,149 --> 02:13:25,491
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to talk their game.

1788
02:13:26,432 --> 02:13:27,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So good email.

1789
02:13:28,175 --> 02:13:28,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that it?

1790
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:29,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it?

1791
02:13:30,641 --> 02:13:31,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1792
02:13:31,521 --> 02:13:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to chat.

1793
02:13:33,462 --> 02:13:37,265
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us emails, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1794
02:13:37,345 --> 02:13:39,366
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt throws in our chat room.

1795
02:13:39,526 --> 02:13:42,768
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a ton of networking panels at PAX East this year.

1796
02:13:43,588 --> 02:13:44,249
[SPEAKER_06]: So coming up.

1797
02:13:44,689 --> 02:13:47,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know how the networking is at PAX East for those of you guys that are going.

1798
02:13:47,971 --> 02:13:52,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know how you guys, you know, if you find people or what you discover.

1799
02:13:52,913 --> 02:13:53,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So let us know.

1800
02:13:54,115 --> 02:13:59,646
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, we need to stop being so nice talking about all this networking and hand-holding and partying.

1801
02:14:00,027 --> 02:14:01,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to get angsty with the FUs of the week.

1802
02:14:17,304 --> 02:14:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to give a big fuck you to the Library of Congress, more specifically their website, in trying to help my client copyright his book.

1803
02:14:29,907 --> 02:14:35,128
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not letting me do the regular copyright submission.

1804
02:14:35,208 --> 02:14:39,309
[SPEAKER_07]: It wants me to do the pre-registration submission, which actually isn't even necessary to do.

1805
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Online registration is $35.

1806
02:14:42,231 --> 02:14:43,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-registration is $150.

1807
02:14:43,212 --> 02:14:45,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what do you think we want to do?

1808
02:14:45,773 --> 02:14:48,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially since I've made sure that the book is fully the way it needs to be.

1809
02:14:49,076 --> 02:14:49,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's ready.

1810
02:14:49,997 --> 02:14:51,518
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a publisher.

1811
02:14:51,838 --> 02:14:54,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just frustrations.

1812
02:14:55,321 --> 02:14:57,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So, bite my butt, Library of Congress.

1813
02:14:59,324 --> 02:14:59,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1814
02:15:00,865 --> 02:15:27,251
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Dominic's New York Pizza and Italian Deli for not realizing that Philly Cheesesteak has cheese on it and giving me a sandwich that does not have cheese on it and it wasn't that great so I have to throw it away but yes next time I will not be buying the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich from you because you have omitted cheese although my wife does like the clam pizza

1815
02:15:30,303 --> 02:15:30,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my thing.

1816
02:15:31,704 --> 02:15:32,025
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1817
02:15:32,666 --> 02:15:40,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And my FU goes to those big Belgian waffles for being so yummy and delicious and very fattening.

1818
02:15:42,612 --> 02:15:44,013
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to food for making me fat.

1819
02:15:44,153 --> 02:15:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my F you.

1820
02:15:45,654 --> 02:15:47,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1821
02:15:47,314 --> 02:15:52,036
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1822
02:15:52,057 --> 02:15:53,397
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not ready for that just yet.

1823
02:15:53,437 --> 02:15:54,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a couple more stories for you.

1824
02:15:55,358 --> 02:16:01,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom would like to remind you that Street Fighter 2 has turned 20.

1825
02:16:02,241 --> 02:16:05,343
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been 20 years since the game was released in arcades in 1991.

1826
02:16:05,483 --> 02:16:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seen six arcade iterations and of course a ton of ports, cross consoles, PCs, and

1827
02:16:12,486 --> 02:16:17,409
[SPEAKER_04]: and definitely one of the top arcade games out there.

1828
02:16:17,889 --> 02:16:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: They are still assholes though for charging $5 for download content for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I'd like to add.

1829
02:16:27,214 --> 02:16:32,077
[SPEAKER_06]: But happy birthday Street Fighter and your 20 different iterations to go with those 20 years, right?

1830
02:16:32,938 --> 02:16:34,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty soon Street Fighter 4 will have just as many.

1831
02:16:36,621 --> 02:16:39,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is one of the more interesting launch games on the 3DS, might I add.

1832
02:16:39,266 --> 02:16:41,770
[SPEAKER_06]: A game that I played, what, a year and a half ago?

1833
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:42,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years ago for the first time?

1834
02:16:46,469 --> 02:16:48,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Dead or Alive is not a launch game anymore?

1835
02:16:49,112 --> 02:16:49,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.

1836
02:16:50,093 --> 02:16:51,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a launch window game.

1837
02:16:51,234 --> 02:16:53,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that's not a launch game.

1838
02:16:53,456 --> 02:16:55,398
[SPEAKER_04]: A launch game is a game that comes out day one.

1839
02:16:55,518 --> 02:16:56,559
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a launch game.

1840
02:16:56,899 --> 02:16:58,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd even give you a week or two after that.

1841
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: A game that comes out two months after that is not a launch game.

1842
02:17:02,484 --> 02:17:04,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a launch window game.

1843
02:17:04,466 --> 02:17:06,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my launch window is four years after the console comes out.

1844
02:17:07,029 --> 02:17:07,769
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a launch game.

1845
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:09,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Nintendo for you.

1846
02:17:09,841 --> 02:17:10,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1847
02:17:11,061 --> 02:17:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to spin that.

1848
02:17:14,223 --> 02:17:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we don't have a lot of games on our system.

1849
02:17:15,804 --> 02:17:18,786
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's okay because we considered the launch four years after it comes out.

1850
02:17:20,727 --> 02:17:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Angry Loki.

1851
02:17:22,027 --> 02:17:23,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to another story.

1852
02:17:23,128 --> 02:17:27,530
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about Steam and Steam possibly invading your television.

1853
02:17:27,610 --> 02:17:28,011
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1854
02:17:28,071 --> 02:17:35,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a quote from Doug Lombardi, the Vice President of Marketing for Valve, from earlier this week in preparation for Game Developers Conference.

1855
02:17:36,135 --> 02:17:36,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh...

1856
02:17:55,015 --> 02:17:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not necessarily there's going to be some type of little hookup kit or something.

1857
02:17:59,301 --> 02:18:10,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that they're talking about actually putting your PC games on the television, a big picture mode, and I guess a controller-friendly version when you want to play on your TV.

1858
02:18:10,955 --> 02:18:11,496
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

1859
02:18:13,130 --> 02:18:42,121
[SPEAKER_06]: more plans were announced to Game Developers Conference this past week but you know I think a lot of you are just going to wait and get Portal 2 on the consoles if you don't already have it planned on the PC not to disrespect those that do their gaming on the PCs because there will certainly be a lot of people buying it there or I don't know I got to admit that PlayStation 3 deal where you get it in both places looks awesome where you buy Portal 2 on the PlayStation 3 and then you get the Steam copy on PC for free I think that's how you got to do it

1860
02:18:43,607 --> 02:18:45,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft's going to be hurting to sell copies of that.

1861
02:18:45,989 --> 02:18:46,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1862
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:52,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1863
02:18:52,435 --> 02:18:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: The Skype line is open right now for you guys to give us a call.

1864
02:18:56,158 --> 02:18:59,981
[SPEAKER_06]: While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

1865
02:19:02,023 --> 02:19:03,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1866
02:19:04,065 --> 02:19:04,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1867
02:19:06,607 --> 02:19:07,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1868
02:19:09,389 --> 02:19:14,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think what we haven't covered yet other than my hatred for what Nintendo's doing with the 3DS.

1869
02:19:19,503 --> 02:19:26,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there was some new hackers, well, not really hackers, but stuff that's going on with the whole George Hotz thing and being sued.

1870
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:39,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, there's some drama over the third-party company that Sony, or I should say the law, the court has going through his hard drives.

1871
02:19:39,442 --> 02:19:42,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Sony's trying to get a copy of the hard drive for themselves.

1872
02:19:44,307 --> 02:20:00,102
[SPEAKER_04]: and even though a third party is supposed to be the only ones looking at the hard drive basically but somebody wants to know what's on there and possibly the steel information it sounds like or maybe manipulating the system a little bit so people are kind of up in arms about that I don't know

1873
02:20:01,923 --> 02:20:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of interesting.

1874
02:20:02,983 --> 02:20:10,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the NGP, I guess the games, of course, they're coming on kind of a cartridge or memory card type device.

1875
02:20:11,025 --> 02:20:24,267
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be coming on two and four gigabyte cards with room for game saves and patches because the actual system will not have any onboard storage, or at least that's what the thought is.

1876
02:20:24,787 --> 02:20:27,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that kind of one of the ways you're trying to get around all the hacking?

1877
02:20:27,944 --> 02:20:34,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to work because the way I'm thinking it now what are you going to save your downloaded games to then?

1878
02:20:35,090 --> 02:20:56,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously they're going to have some sort of online market or something like that and I know it has a second memory card slot for stuff like that so I mean it might be a way to get around it but I mean it didn't work for the Nintendo DS Are they trying to do it maybe because it's a non-standard format or something?

1879
02:20:57,551 --> 02:21:06,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe just to make it, you know, easy, but I'm sure that's gotta be some sort of, um, you know, it's partly probably anti-piracy.

1880
02:21:09,218 --> 02:21:29,310
[SPEAKER_06]: and then again the phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to get through tonight I would advise calling now because the way these things go is I say the number like 20 times and nobody ever calls and then suddenly just at the last minute like everybody calls at once and then I say well we've taken enough calls so I'm just saying get in early

1881
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:45,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft has gone the route of Spore, where you can basically take your avatars now, you can create poses or whatever with them, and you can get jumbo wall prints of your avatar.

1882
02:21:46,034 --> 02:21:56,217
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to put yourself up on the wall, you can get a 16GB Zune with your avatar on it, etched in, or a $60 figurine of your avatar.

1883
02:21:57,057 --> 02:22:12,865
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course the wall print is going to cost you $150 so that better be damn big and the zoom will cost you $170 figuring $60 that would be kind of neat to have at my desk not the wall print, that's retarded that's going to cost you a bit of money though, isn't it?

1884
02:22:13,525 --> 02:22:26,572
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I'd probably wait I'd want to see what these things look like in the size, because I'm not going to pay $60 for a 3 inch statue, it better be something pretty significant alright, we've got calls coming in, so let's go to it hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1885
02:22:27,677 --> 02:22:29,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1886
02:22:29,198 --> 02:22:30,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind, buddy?

1887
02:22:31,739 --> 02:22:37,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just calling in about the whole home thing that you were mentioning earlier.

1888
02:22:37,923 --> 02:22:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, about the whole upgrades in home where they're going to have more built-in stuff.

1889
02:22:42,045 --> 02:22:42,745
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of all that?

1890
02:22:44,666 --> 02:22:54,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm probably in the minority here on this, but my whole opinion is kind of like kind of goes along the lines of who cares?

1891
02:22:55,032 --> 02:22:55,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean,

1892
02:22:56,081 --> 02:23:06,426
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you kind of sort of touched on it a little bit to a degree, but when you said, you know, when are they going to do anything with the clubhouses?

1893
02:23:07,187 --> 02:23:07,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1894
02:23:08,668 --> 02:23:15,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, there's so much they could be doing with home to make it a little bit more interesting.

1895
02:23:16,232 --> 02:23:20,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if you look right, well, it's kind of hard to...

1896
02:23:21,792 --> 02:23:31,876
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, talk about something like you're really looking at, but you know how the one wall behind the stage is supposed to be like a video screen in Clubhouse?

1897
02:23:32,136 --> 02:23:32,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1898
02:23:32,636 --> 02:23:40,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they could be doing something with the video screen, like you guys could be showing off...

1899
02:23:41,519 --> 02:24:07,559
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the videos that you guys have made for Orange Lounge I will tell you this much the minute that Sony allows us to put some type of video on that monitor I'll do something exclusive video content wise that won't even be on YouTube we will only put it in Sony Home but I'm not going to hold my breath my camera is still in a box because I don't see that happening yeah you could there's always that and also um

1900
02:24:08,590 --> 02:24:25,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with our own private spaces, whether it be the log caping space or the default one, whatever you happen to have, they could sell virtual jukeboxes and virtual TVs.

1901
02:24:25,378 --> 02:24:32,201
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll allow you to stream all the MP3s that you got on your PS3's hard drive or

1902
02:24:32,881 --> 02:24:37,302
[SPEAKER_00]: The video content that you add to the video servers or what have you.

1903
02:24:39,082 --> 02:24:42,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I'm with you to a point here, Spazinator, I got to ask this question.

1904
02:24:42,823 --> 02:24:45,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to play devil's advocate and ask this question.

1905
02:24:45,403 --> 02:24:54,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Since the PlayStation 3 is a gaming system, why not have enhancements to the gaming mechanisms within home and making the gaming within home better?

1906
02:24:56,345 --> 02:24:59,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's that too.

1907
02:24:59,226 --> 02:25:01,086
[SPEAKER_00]: I can certainly see your point.

1908
02:25:01,940 --> 02:25:19,025
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, perhaps Bobby Blackwood loves to point out from time to time, I'm really heavily into the whole PlayStation 3, more so than my 360.

1909
02:25:19,906 --> 02:25:20,186
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1910
02:25:22,026 --> 02:25:29,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Your 360 handle, I'm not going to give away your 360 handle, but it has PSN in it, and that always cracks me up that PSN is in your 360 handle.

1911
02:25:30,732 --> 02:25:40,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, my point being, you know, you would think, you know, with that being said, you know, I would be all over home like here on the gorilla.

1912
02:25:40,936 --> 02:25:46,318
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, I really haven't touched home in God knows how long.

1913
02:25:47,298 --> 02:25:52,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last time I, the only reason I even bothered with home the last time is because, uh,

1914
02:25:53,460 --> 02:25:57,741
[SPEAKER_00]: and all games community said the invite to join them at home.

1915
02:25:58,922 --> 02:26:01,002
[SPEAKER_00]: That was about it.

1916
02:26:01,022 --> 02:26:03,583
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to do in there but dance with furries right now.

1917
02:26:04,003 --> 02:26:10,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But hopefully Sodium 2 will bring people back if not at least for a day while everybody's curious and checks it out, right?

1918
02:26:11,425 --> 02:26:11,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1919
02:26:12,245 --> 02:26:19,907
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if they implemented some of the ideas that I just thrown out, you know, I would be using home left and right, you know.

1920
02:26:20,507 --> 02:26:22,368
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, until then, you know,

1921
02:26:23,726 --> 02:26:31,107
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I would even consider using it is I would have to be bored out of my mind, like borderline comatose bored, you know?

1922
02:26:32,048 --> 02:26:34,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe you need to go to Game Developers Conference and tell them your ideas.

1923
02:26:35,008 --> 02:26:35,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1924
02:26:35,388 --> 02:26:35,648
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1925
02:26:35,848 --> 02:26:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Spaz, we're going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much for the call, buddy.

1926
02:26:39,589 --> 02:26:39,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

1927
02:26:39,969 --> 02:26:40,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.

1928
02:26:40,249 --> 02:26:40,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1929
02:26:40,829 --> 02:26:42,030
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1930
02:26:42,050 --> 02:26:44,530
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1931
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:48,371
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, screen filled up with phone calls while Spaz was on the line.

1932
02:26:48,471 --> 02:26:49,191
[SPEAKER_06]: What did I tell you?

1933
02:26:50,592 --> 02:26:53,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you, the minute one person tries to call, then everybody's going to try to call.

1934
02:26:53,735 --> 02:26:54,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1935
02:26:54,416 --> 02:26:55,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It is open now.

1936
02:26:55,097 --> 02:26:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if somebody gets through.

1937
02:26:55,957 --> 02:26:59,101
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1938
02:26:59,982 --> 02:27:01,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other last minute stories that we have?

1939
02:27:01,664 --> 02:27:04,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's looking for stuff for after the show, so I don't know.

1940
02:27:04,787 --> 02:27:05,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, is that it?

1941
02:27:06,589 --> 02:27:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've got stuff.

1942
02:27:08,490 --> 02:27:14,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Battle LA is becoming a game that's going to be downloadable on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1943
02:27:15,094 --> 02:27:20,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Being developed by Konami, so I guess that's needed.

1944
02:27:20,738 --> 02:27:22,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a movie game, so wait and expect.

1945
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:23,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that'll be coming out soon.

1946
02:27:24,601 --> 02:27:25,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, next month.

1947
02:27:27,643 --> 02:27:31,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Right in time for the movie, I guess, considering it comes out in a week.

1948
02:27:32,047 --> 02:27:35,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It is being developed by the people that did Timeshift, Saber Interactive.

1949
02:27:35,850 --> 02:27:38,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, we got more calls coming in.

1950
02:27:38,412 --> 02:27:39,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, let's go to the phones.

1951
02:27:39,513 --> 02:27:40,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1952
02:27:40,313 --> 02:27:40,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1953
02:27:41,795 --> 02:27:42,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Ron.

1954
02:27:42,595 --> 02:27:43,676
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you guys doing tonight?

1955
02:27:43,956 --> 02:27:49,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, because when I say get through now, you know how to get through the system and beat everybody else.

1956
02:27:49,821 --> 02:27:52,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, you've got some type of psychic prowess.

1957
02:27:52,783 --> 02:27:53,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is.

1958
02:27:54,062 --> 02:27:55,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a blessing and a curse.

1959
02:27:56,943 --> 02:27:58,464
[SPEAKER_06]: A blessing for you, a curse for us.

1960
02:27:58,524 --> 02:27:59,444
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

1961
02:27:59,744 --> 02:28:00,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny.

1962
02:28:02,145 --> 02:28:04,126
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing, I just want to say, Loki, welcome back.

1963
02:28:04,146 --> 02:28:05,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you're feeling much better.

1964
02:28:05,686 --> 02:28:06,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1965
02:28:06,827 --> 02:28:08,748
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.

1966
02:28:08,788 --> 02:28:11,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't ever talk like that in the opening of the show ever again, am I right?

1967
02:28:13,169 --> 02:28:13,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1968
02:28:14,570 --> 02:28:14,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1969
02:28:15,470 --> 02:28:17,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, I do remember that.

1970
02:28:45,444 --> 02:28:55,092
[SPEAKER_06]: The Special Dance Pad, and both I do remember that Oh yeah, those were selling for crazy money for a while And then, what happened?

1971
02:28:55,452 --> 02:28:56,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Reprint?

1972
02:28:57,014 --> 02:29:11,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more recent than that, the Wii System Everyone was like, oh hey, we can't make enough of these They're just so hard to put together Such advanced technology that's been around since the GameCube How do we do it?

1973
02:29:12,387 --> 02:29:12,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah

1974
02:29:13,208 --> 02:29:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I'm supposed to believe there was a shortage on those that wasn't on purpose.

1975
02:29:17,931 --> 02:29:19,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, whatever you say, Nintendo.

1976
02:29:19,932 --> 02:29:20,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll believe you.

1977
02:29:23,854 --> 02:29:24,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1978
02:29:26,535 --> 02:29:29,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what do you think about the 3DS?

1979
02:29:30,358 --> 02:29:36,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want one, but to be perfectly honest, I think I'm going to do what SSJ100Matt said.

1980
02:29:36,441 --> 02:29:37,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a while.

1981
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:38,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just see.

1982
02:29:38,598 --> 02:29:39,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's good advice.

1983
02:29:40,139 --> 02:29:42,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you asking about all this Nintendo stuff, though, reminded me.

1984
02:29:42,881 --> 02:29:46,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a big question I was going to ask Loki in Part A when we were doing all the 3DS stories.

1985
02:29:47,205 --> 02:29:49,706
[SPEAKER_06]: He was so ranty, I got completely sidetracked.

1986
02:29:49,887 --> 02:29:52,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to ask it now with you on the line, Robin.

1987
02:29:52,328 --> 02:29:54,110
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just making up for last week, so yeah.

1988
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

1989
02:29:54,690 --> 02:29:55,871
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got to do double duty this week.

1990
02:29:55,891 --> 02:29:58,033
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I want to ask this question because this is a serious question.

1991
02:29:58,073 --> 02:30:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one I was talking the other day with some people about is...

1992
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the Wii going to give us this year?

1993
02:30:05,972 --> 02:30:10,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo at E3 this year, we know they're going to announce a Mario game for 3DS.

1994
02:30:10,756 --> 02:30:11,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Duh!

1995
02:30:12,016 --> 02:30:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: We know they'll be talking about the other 3DS titles throughout Christmas.

1996
02:30:15,639 --> 02:30:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: What have they got going on the Wii right now?

1997
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:18,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Skyward Sword, that's about it.

1998
02:30:19,261 --> 02:30:21,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're dragging that shit out as long as possible.

1999
02:30:22,882 --> 02:30:32,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible, not to sound fanboy-esque here, but is it possible that Zelda was pushed back because this is the year they're going to announce a Wii HD?

2000
02:30:32,689 --> 02:30:32,829
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2001
02:30:33,329 --> 02:30:35,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And not a Wii 2, but a Wii HD.

2002
02:30:35,791 --> 02:30:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is exactly what happened to the last Metroid Other M. They announced it way too damn early.

2003
02:30:42,755 --> 02:30:44,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets delayed forever.

2004
02:30:44,977 --> 02:30:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like the Metroid Prime Trilogy.

2005
02:30:48,559 --> 02:31:18,242
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just pushing shit back longer and longer and they keep announcing stuff well into it much in advance just so they have something to fill up their E3 press conference with because I mean seriously if they cut out all the stuff that's supposed to be coming out this year I mean well they announced Skyward Sword and that was a big part of their thing and I bet you right now it's going to be a big part of their press conference you know coming soon and I'm sure there'll be a Just Dance 3 that they can always

2006
02:31:18,302 --> 02:31:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Differ play a whole lot of Pikmin?

2007
02:31:36,963 --> 02:32:01,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so I don't know, there's a part of me that feels like now is the time for Nintendo to come out and say it's gotta be next year if not this year, it's got to be next year because the 3DS will be standard by then and they've gotta come out and say okay, here's the next Wii but I don't think it would be the Wii 2 so much as it would be comparing the DS to the DS Lite If it's the Wii 2, is it the Wii Wii?

2008
02:32:02,661 --> 02:32:04,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up Maybe it's the Weed

2009
02:32:05,763 --> 02:32:05,963
[SPEAKER_04]: VD Sure

2010
02:32:22,661 --> 02:32:23,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And why wouldn't it?

2011
02:32:23,441 --> 02:32:33,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because one thing that Nintendo has done pretty well is the whole back, well, I guess really it's only been on the one series of games, backwards compatibility with the Wii.

2012
02:32:33,745 --> 02:32:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Every GameCube game is playable on the Wii.

2013
02:32:35,566 --> 02:32:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, for the portable systems, it's been pretty good.

2014
02:32:38,627 --> 02:32:38,967
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2015
02:32:38,987 --> 02:32:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the DS had the Game Boy Advance.

2016
02:32:40,668 --> 02:32:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff like that.

2017
02:32:42,248 --> 02:32:43,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And Game Boy Advance had the Game Boy.

2018
02:32:43,609 --> 02:32:45,830
[SPEAKER_06]: When you were doing cartridge formats, you kind of couldn't.

2019
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:46,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get that.

2020
02:32:47,150 --> 02:32:47,630
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2021
02:33:09,426 --> 02:33:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why they're not going to embrace that type of mentality because why should they put out a new console that has better graphics on it people don't care and according to them people don't care and really they're just going to be releasing quality games same reason with the whole online argument is like they don't care people don't care about online

2022
02:33:29,841 --> 02:33:30,902
[SPEAKER_04]: We too would be weenie in Japanese

2023
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:55,030
Get it?

2024
02:33:55,670 --> 02:33:57,170
[SPEAKER_06]: That name will never get old.

2025
02:33:58,031 --> 02:33:58,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

2026
02:33:59,151 --> 02:33:59,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You make a good point.

2027
02:33:59,951 --> 02:34:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this will be the year we finally fucking get F-Zero on the Wii.

2028
02:34:02,671 --> 02:34:03,131
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

2029
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not gonna happen.

2030
02:34:03,852 --> 02:34:04,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

2031
02:34:04,592 --> 02:34:05,332
[SPEAKER_06]: God, Loki!

2032
02:34:05,452 --> 02:34:06,692
[SPEAKER_04]: You're ruining everything!

2033
02:34:06,732 --> 02:34:07,672
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to understand.

2034
02:34:07,732 --> 02:34:10,313
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're gonna get is you're gonna get New Super Mario Bros.

2035
02:34:10,333 --> 02:34:10,313
2.

2036
02:34:10,353 --> 02:34:10,433
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

2037
02:34:10,453 --> 02:34:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gonna have some different levels and stuff.

2038
02:34:12,913 --> 02:34:13,993
[SPEAKER_03]: What a goddamn F-Zero game!

2039
02:34:14,534 --> 02:34:16,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I can go for New Super Mario Bros.

2040
02:34:16,654 --> 02:34:19,794
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, but if Nintendo re-releases Super Mario Bros.

2041
02:34:20,094 --> 02:34:22,575
[SPEAKER_03]: 64 for the 3DS, I will nerd rage.

2042
02:34:24,405 --> 02:34:42,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, despite all the hatred, all the vicious, vile hatred that Loki's been throwing at Nintendo this entire show, I am telling you, if Reggie comes out at E3 and announces the Wii HD with F-Zero as a launch title, I will jump on stage and do something very naughty.

2043
02:34:42,381 --> 02:34:43,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not buy it.

2044
02:34:43,122 --> 02:34:44,102
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gonna snog him.

2045
02:34:44,342 --> 02:34:44,983
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

2046
02:34:45,083 --> 02:34:45,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not buy it.

2047
02:34:46,243 --> 02:34:53,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a Wii that's gathering dust because I don't play it and there's nothing I want to play on it.

2048
02:34:54,248 --> 02:34:56,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I could play New Super Mario Bros.

2049
02:34:56,589 --> 02:35:03,013
[SPEAKER_04]: on it or Mario Galaxy 2 or something like that, but I haven't even finished Galaxy, so I don't know why I'd want to play Mario Galaxy 2.

2050
02:35:03,253 --> 02:35:03,473
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

2051
02:35:05,294 --> 02:35:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that interests me, and this is going back to once again what they could have done right with Mario Kart, is the modded tracks for Mario Kart.

2052
02:35:12,236 --> 02:35:13,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that sounds interesting.

2053
02:35:13,336 --> 02:35:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, new tracks for Mario Kart.

2054
02:35:14,917 --> 02:35:16,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go play that game again.

2055
02:35:17,697 --> 02:35:18,538
[SPEAKER_04]: What's to stop them?

2056
02:35:18,618 --> 02:35:22,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, what is to stop them other than the fact that they probably didn't program DLC into Mario Kart?

2057
02:35:23,039 --> 02:35:27,860
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's just imagine a world where they are forward thinking and actually did that.

2058
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: What's to stop them from saying, hey, you know what?

2059
02:35:30,381 --> 02:35:35,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of putting out a new Mario Kart game, we're just going to have this $10 expansion that's going to add 16 new tracks to the game.

2060
02:35:36,384 --> 02:35:38,005
[SPEAKER_04]: People would be damn excited about that.

2061
02:35:38,105 --> 02:35:38,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be awesome.

2062
02:35:38,886 --> 02:35:39,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going to do that.

2063
02:35:39,626 --> 02:35:41,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this mean you can borrow your President Cat?

2064
02:35:41,947 --> 02:35:44,589
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such a forward-thinking company that they're like, oh!

2065
02:35:45,389 --> 02:35:46,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Patches to games?

2066
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:47,451
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need that.

2067
02:35:47,491 --> 02:35:48,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Games are perfect when they come out.

2068
02:35:48,632 --> 02:35:50,794
[SPEAKER_04]: There's never going to be glitches that we'll need to fix.

2069
02:35:51,334 --> 02:35:54,337
[SPEAKER_04]: No, let's just not even bother putting a system in there for that.

2070
02:35:54,657 --> 02:36:13,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that David Jaffe, completely random tangent, did you hear that David Jaffe was out there at a Game Developers Conference and I was reading some article about he said that companies should be limited to only three patches in a calendar year and they should not be allowed to patch a game until at least six weeks after release.

2071
02:36:13,692 --> 02:36:16,133
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because you know what all that's going to do?

2072
02:36:16,314 --> 02:36:18,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just going to leave a broken game for longer.

2073
02:36:18,575 --> 02:36:19,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what he's thinking.

2074
02:36:19,315 --> 02:36:25,239
[SPEAKER_04]: He's thinking, oh, if we limited them to this, then they have to make sure the game is working and spend extra time.

2075
02:36:25,479 --> 02:36:26,460
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't give a shit.

2076
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,921
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll just wait longer for it to be fixed.

2077
02:36:28,981 --> 02:36:30,042
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that's going to create.

2078
02:36:30,182 --> 02:36:37,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And he should shut the hell up and just make his Twisted Metals and God of Wars and be done with it because his crappy Calling All Cars game was terrible.

2079
02:36:38,106 --> 02:36:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And he talks too much, and he's seriously annoying.

2080
02:36:41,789 --> 02:36:43,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, Loki, won't you switch to decaf?

2081
02:36:58,459 --> 02:36:59,960
[SPEAKER_04]: He was saying, like, the Wii's terrible.

2082
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:03,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, oh, hey, you know, maybe we should develop games for the Wii because it's popular.

2083
02:37:04,644 --> 02:37:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so wishy-washy.

2084
02:37:07,166 --> 02:37:12,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, seriously, that's a dumb idea with limiting people to patches and stuff like that.

2085
02:37:12,430 --> 02:37:21,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I think even some companies... I want to say it's either Microsoft or Sony charges companies for putting out patches or title updates for their games.

2086
02:37:21,657 --> 02:37:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it's probably Microsoft that does that.

2087
02:37:24,319 --> 02:37:26,380
[SPEAKER_07]: They like them to put out... So...

2088
02:37:29,454 --> 02:37:29,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2089
02:37:29,835 --> 02:37:31,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think it's a good idea.

2090
02:37:31,716 --> 02:37:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: What they should do though is if games are buggy, they should have some sort of, I don't know, penalize the developers somehow for putting out buggy games.

2091
02:37:41,141 --> 02:37:42,682
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to figure out a system to do that.

2092
02:37:43,983 --> 02:37:45,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it more expensive to patch?

2093
02:37:46,863 --> 02:37:48,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because once again, it just leaves broken games.

2094
02:37:48,867 --> 02:37:51,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Activision, Black Ops and stuff like that.

2095
02:37:51,732 --> 02:37:53,936
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff that's just broken with that game.

2096
02:37:54,417 --> 02:37:56,901
[SPEAKER_04]: It took them forever to patch that stuff.

2097
02:37:58,364 --> 02:37:58,725
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

2098
02:38:01,417 --> 02:38:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2099
02:38:24,625 --> 02:38:26,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Ranma, thanks for sitting on the line while Loki bitches.

2100
02:38:27,087 --> 02:38:28,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

2101
02:38:28,788 --> 02:38:32,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to do my dutiful duty as a proud member of the OL Army.

2102
02:38:32,271 --> 02:38:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be so much Nintendo fanboy hate mail this week.

2103
02:38:34,813 --> 02:38:35,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait.

2104
02:38:35,974 --> 02:38:36,254
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2105
02:38:36,775 --> 02:38:39,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Ranma, thank you, as always, for your call.

2106
02:38:39,997 --> 02:38:40,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

2107
02:38:41,839 --> 02:38:42,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

2108
02:38:42,779 --> 02:38:43,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad Loki took up all your time.

2109
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:44,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2110
02:38:46,122 --> 02:38:46,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

2111
02:38:46,642 --> 02:38:47,083
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2112
02:38:48,264 --> 02:38:51,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had friends tell me the best part of the show is when Loki gets mad at something.

2113
02:38:51,807 --> 02:38:53,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's just annoying.

2114
02:38:54,309 --> 02:38:55,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just honesty.

2115
02:38:56,130 --> 02:38:57,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how it is.

2116
02:38:59,553 --> 02:39:02,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Game companies nowadays know that they don't have to put out a perfect game.

2117
02:39:02,554 --> 02:39:03,775
[SPEAKER_04]: They can just release it buggy.

2118
02:39:04,175 --> 02:39:08,498
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a few more sales out there because they don't have to wait for development.

2119
02:39:08,538 --> 02:39:13,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they patch it later on when they let people basically test it out.

2120
02:39:13,501 --> 02:39:18,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should they hire beta testers when they can go ahead and have the public test it out?

2121
02:39:18,764 --> 02:39:22,707
[SPEAKER_04]: They figure out what all the bugs are, read their forums or whatever, go fix those bugs, and then...

2122
02:39:23,587 --> 02:39:24,968
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2123
02:39:48,323 --> 02:39:50,345
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the game industry works.

2124
02:39:50,425 --> 02:40:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, since now these games can be patched on the fly, there's less focus on putting out a game that's not buggy from the beginning.

2125
02:40:01,678 --> 02:40:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2126
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:05,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to those of you guys who got through.

2127
02:40:05,261 --> 02:40:07,524
[SPEAKER_06]: To those who didn't get through, call sooner next time.

2128
02:40:08,085 --> 02:40:10,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably could have fit in another call or two if we had some sooner.

2129
02:40:10,697 --> 02:40:12,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but for now we're going to go ahead and close the skyline.

2130
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:19,786
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do want to elaborate on some thoughts, though, or you want to respond to Loki, mailbag at orangelonestrater.com is a great place to do it, or on our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

2131
02:40:20,086 --> 02:40:23,329
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, it's getting to be about 9 o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast.

2132
02:40:23,369 --> 02:40:26,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably about time we start to wrap up the show with some final thoughts.

2133
02:40:26,812 --> 02:40:27,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me check in, though, real quick.

2134
02:40:27,833 --> 02:40:30,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other last-minute stories we want to throw in before we wrap up the show?

2135
02:40:31,356 --> 02:40:31,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

2136
02:40:34,244 --> 02:40:34,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2137
02:40:35,125 --> 02:40:37,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

2138
02:40:37,708 --> 02:40:42,914
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a lot of fun stuff coming from PAX East and I expect those of you guys that are at PAX East next week, I want phone calls.

2139
02:40:43,822 --> 02:40:44,803
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of neat, I guess.

2140
02:40:44,883 --> 02:40:47,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Infamous 2 is going to let you create your own missions.

2141
02:40:48,644 --> 02:40:49,265
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something.

2142
02:40:49,885 --> 02:40:51,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even have to be a Mario Kart type game.

2143
02:40:51,686 --> 02:40:55,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just have a game where you just create your own levels and stuff.

2144
02:40:55,588 --> 02:40:56,748
[SPEAKER_04]: People eat that shit up now.

2145
02:40:57,769 --> 02:40:59,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the trend is nowadays.

2146
02:41:00,130 --> 02:41:00,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Play, share, create.

2147
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony gets it.

2148
02:41:02,451 --> 02:41:02,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhat.

2149
02:41:03,631 --> 02:41:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope sucks.

2150
02:41:05,492 --> 02:41:06,333
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't be right all the time.

2151
02:41:07,553 --> 02:41:07,974
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2152
02:41:08,674 --> 02:41:10,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2153
02:41:10,856 --> 02:41:11,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting worried.

2154
02:41:11,477 --> 02:41:13,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki might need to get some Eidol here pretty soon.

2155
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

2156
02:41:15,561 --> 02:41:16,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Dismanstrating.

2157
02:41:16,542 --> 02:41:16,802
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2158
02:41:16,862 --> 02:41:18,424
[SPEAKER_06]: He's manstrating all over the place.

2159
02:41:19,845 --> 02:41:20,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Copyright.

2160
02:41:20,706 --> 02:41:21,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2161
02:41:21,467 --> 02:41:22,187
[SPEAKER_04]: One more last thing.

2162
02:41:22,247 --> 02:41:22,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please.

2163
02:41:22,848 --> 02:41:23,308
[SPEAKER_04]: By all means.

2164
02:41:23,428 --> 02:41:25,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just a rumor, I guess.

2165
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:27,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a rumor that Strider and Frank West are coming as download content.

2166
02:41:28,013 --> 02:41:29,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Those will be $5 each, too.

2167
02:41:29,414 --> 02:41:30,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Capcom.

2168
02:41:30,675 --> 02:41:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I will pay $5 for Strider to hear you.

2169
02:41:33,388 --> 02:41:43,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to play the old Strider NES game I know you guys don't like it as much as the Genesis one but I fondly remember the NES one from my childhood I really want to play that again, it's been a long time

2170
02:41:52,785 --> 02:41:53,025
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

2171
02:42:18,939 --> 02:42:20,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure glad Loki's back after a C-section.

2172
02:42:23,781 --> 02:42:26,282
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is... Ow.

2173
02:42:27,542 --> 02:42:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2174
02:42:29,503 --> 02:42:31,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2175
02:42:32,044 --> 02:42:39,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought with a week being off, I'd be able to get more done with the Grand Theft Auto stuff, but some things just take time, I guess, when it comes to modding this stuff.

2176
02:42:39,467 --> 02:42:43,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I will still be angry at Nintendo because they just continue to disappoint.

2177
02:42:43,288 --> 02:42:44,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't help it.

2178
02:42:44,128 --> 02:42:47,310
[SPEAKER_04]: If you make stupid decisions, I'm just going to call you out on it.

2179
02:42:48,910 --> 02:42:49,331
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2180
02:42:49,871 --> 02:42:52,093
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have plenty more next week on the show.

2181
02:42:52,193 --> 02:42:54,574
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, sadly not joining us next week.

2182
02:42:54,915 --> 02:42:56,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't be sad, though.

2183
02:42:56,276 --> 02:42:56,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you won't.

2184
02:42:56,776 --> 02:42:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will be back with another edition of Orange Launch Radio.

2185
02:42:59,338 --> 02:43:00,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call in from the road.

2186
02:43:01,119 --> 02:43:03,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we'll have a temp co-host or what we'll do.

2187
02:43:03,501 --> 02:43:04,121
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to call me.

2188
02:43:05,562 --> 02:43:05,842
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

2189
02:43:06,103 --> 02:43:06,683
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to call me.

2190
02:43:06,803 --> 02:43:07,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We can.

2191
02:43:07,644 --> 02:43:07,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2192
02:43:08,755 --> 02:43:09,355
[SPEAKER_06]: On the road.

2193
02:43:09,715 --> 02:43:10,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, that's it.

2194
02:43:10,956 --> 02:43:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

2195
02:43:11,556 --> 02:43:12,977
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here until next week.

2196
02:43:13,377 --> 02:43:14,637
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do this all again next week.

2197
02:43:14,678 --> 02:43:17,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, that's another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2198
02:43:17,599 --> 02:43:23,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, of course, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, we are not a gigantic website with millions of hits.

2199
02:43:24,201 --> 02:43:27,603
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a magazine that backs us or a gaming company that backs us.

2200
02:43:27,963 --> 02:43:30,124
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't throw a bunch of commercials in your face.

2201
02:43:30,584 --> 02:43:34,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So all we ask, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, tell some friends about the show.

2202
02:43:34,606 --> 02:43:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The example at the start of the show where a friend was playing it at his lamb party.

2203
02:43:38,067 --> 02:43:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect example is an awesome A-plus move.

2204
02:43:41,189 --> 02:43:42,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So just tell people about the show.

2205
02:43:42,810 --> 02:43:44,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.

2206
02:43:44,791 --> 02:43:48,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Get us some more voices to bring to the table here at the show.

2207
02:43:48,613 --> 02:43:50,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't send DarkSakura a dollar.

2208
02:43:51,295 --> 02:43:54,377
[SPEAKER_06]: But come back next week for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2209
02:43:55,237 --> 02:43:58,038
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2210
02:43:58,559 --> 02:44:01,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2211
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2212
02:44:11,404 --> 02:44:23,009
[SPEAKER_02]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2213
02:44:23,609 --> 02:44:24,430
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week!

2214
02:44:26,702 --> 02:44:27,774
Thanks for watching!
