00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,740
Today, March 6th, 2011, the PlayStation 3 stops shipping in one country, GameStop becomes

2
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:31,720
the target of the class-action lawsuit, and Microsoft clears up some old gamer tags.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the interwebs and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Radio.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,960
It is that show about video games.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
It's the show that brings every gamer a voice as we have over the past nine years.

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
We do tape live Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,320
Black Wolf show.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
My name is Rob Roberts.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,160
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,080
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Shamae.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
How are you?

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Shamae.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Shamazzle.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,360
Are we the Laverne and Shirley opening?

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,640
This will be showing up on our photo feed shortly.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
Shortly.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,000
Because today's alcoholism is brought to you by Shamae, which is tasty.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,640
Uh oh, you're not drinking during the show again because last week, oh boy, that was

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
a rough show.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Alright.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Watch me.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
You're not drinking.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,080
Say hello and welcome back.

26
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,600
Loki is back with us tonight.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Hello.

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
How are you doing?

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
You feeling better?

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Um, yeah, I guess.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,480
We told all the listeners why you were gone.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Sorry if you want to keep it a secret.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
No, I don't.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
We forget to tweet about it.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I don't care.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Yeah, it's fine.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
I told him that we played a song in tribute.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
That's right.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
We did play living in a hernia.

40
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Living with a hernia on our way out.

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,040
Apparently it was something, I don't know, I guess it was something I had for a long

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,820
time or something, but like on Tuesday last week, like all of a sudden my innie became

43
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,920
an Audi and it's like, oh, this kind of hurts, you know, why is this hurting?

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,800
So I went to the doctor, doctor said, um, you know, hey, you better go, you know, here,

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm going to make an appointment with the surgeon right now so you can go get checked

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
out.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
And then the went to the surgeon's office and they're like, well, we can take care of

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
this right now if you want.

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm like, all right.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
So they're wet.

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
They did that.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,560
And it hurt like a bitch for, well, during the operation because, you know, operations

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
tend to hurt.

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Did they put you under?

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't know.

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
It's local.

57
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
And that felt weird.

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Yeah, I bet.

59
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Oh.

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,040
Um, but then, uh, no, then it's just like really stiff and sore for a couple of days.

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
I just want to point out, they don't knock you out for a vasectomy either.

62
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,320
If you want to, I'm sure that I've heard, I haven't had, that probably wouldn't have

63
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,560
heard as bad as, you know, it's not even really hurting.

64
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
It's weird stuff.

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,460
Like imagine someone putting like their finger into your belly button underneath and then

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,640
pulling muscle, you know, down or something like that.

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,520
That's kind of the feeling that stuff or nice sounds of barf or the, um, the feeling of

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,580
someone electrocuting fat or something on you and popping and then smelling that fat

69
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
burning.

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,200
Once in a while we do talk about video games, I promise, but no, I'm feeling, I'm feeling

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
better.

72
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
Did they turn the fat into bacon?

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
They did not.

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
It does not smell like bacon.

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,920
It's not even, it's not good.

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,560
Smells like a chicken burning does not smell like chicken burning.

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,840
It's not pleasant and it's not pleasant to feel it burning either.

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,920
All right, well look, all this gross medical talk house aside, um, hopefully you had a

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,440
chance to play a lot of games while you were recovering.

80
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Yeah.

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,160
And it was, it was an umbilical hernia.

82
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,320
It was something I think, cause like for the long, like as long as I can remember, it was

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,360
like my belly button feels weird.

84
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,080
Like it felt like there was like a tube on the other side or something like that.

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,680
Well you never had a baby to lift before and it's probably what, I don't even know if it

86
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
does that.

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,520
It was just, if it was there, your intestines hooked up to the wrong spot.

88
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,200
Basically what happened was is like it, what happens with hernia is sometimes fat can,

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,600
fat or tissue can get trapped inside of it and then it gets, the circulation gets caught

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
off and it dies.

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Well, that's what started to happen with some of that.

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,120
So that's why I started hurting.

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,760
Um, so they had to, you know, get rid of that so that, you know, wouldn't turn, you know,

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,520
into gangrene or something.

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,680
I got to go to our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Let me read you some of the comments from our chat room right now.

97
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
We are live.

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
Uh, at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
OMFG.

100
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Loki.

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
Stop.

102
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Gah.

103
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Yeah.

104
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,040
Can't Loki just talk about grand theft or earth defense force instead?

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,360
Orange lounge trauma center.

106
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,880
I can talk about both of those.

107
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,240
I saw the, I saw the new little, uh, trailer or like behind the scenes or not really a

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
trailer.

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
It was like a behind the scenes thing on, um, or a preview of earth defense.

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,000
It's awesome.

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So awesome.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Anyhow, wow.

114
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,720
I don't know how to follow that up, but, uh, I guess we'll find now that technically I'm

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,880
not supposed to be lifting anything or doing anything, but I feel fine.

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,560
Um, and so I've been lifting my son's stuff.

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm just not like, you know, not because you're secretly a cyborg.

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm not going to go, you know, try to get more cat litter or something like that.

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
It was like a 30 pound.

120
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,200
It's basically if it hurts, stop doing it.

121
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,720
Uh, well you were missed last week.

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Loki.

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
But our aims improving now that you're with the targeting range.

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Was last week.

125
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Seriously.

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
We had a drunk Jamie.

127
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
We had the Oscars.

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I was tipsy.

129
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,080
We had a drunk Jamie and the mystique came in middle of the show and I don't even know

130
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
what happened.

131
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Shut off our Batman shoes.

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I did pretty good on my Oscar picks.

133
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,640
I think I haven't got a chance to be back to my work yet, but I hope I won something

134
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,240
that'd be kind of cool.

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,160
All right, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming weeks.

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Dark soccer.

137
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
How was your gaming week?

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I played well.

139
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Damn you addict dealer.

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,280
I joined the Horde house guild and made a death night because it did not want to start

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
from one.

142
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,920
That's the interesting thing about having a new guild.

143
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah.

144
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
My a spinoff show.

145
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,120
Horde house with extra for has an official guild now and all the details are on the last

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,840
show or the goober server Twitter.

147
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Yeah.

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Uh, on what?

149
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Wow.

150
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Wiki calls a server full of bad players.

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
So we had to roll there.

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
We had to roll there.

153
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Had to do it.

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
So, but everything's starting from scratch has been very weird.

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
I've run into nothing but assholes really except for us.

156
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Of course.

157
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,120
Um, well, I know there was one nice person who wanted to group with me, but I'm like,

158
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
I don't want to play with you.

159
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,520
So it's just been MMOs for you?

160
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,680
Well, today I went in either room cause I wanted to play Marvel versus Capcom three

161
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,380
and I was in, and Dan was playing through Shinobi.

162
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,360
So I sit down with my, uh, my sleepy, I sleep with a sleeping bag because it's really warm

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,240
and cause I was super cold, so I sat with my sleeping bag and I fell asleep to Shinobi

164
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,200
and woke up to Ikaruga.

165
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,160
So I guess that counts that I can sleep to video games apparently at some point Dan beat

166
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,080
it cause I opened my eyes and saw the ending and it was like, Oh, whatever.

167
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,760
And uh, I think that's about it.

168
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,920
You know, um, uh, off show stuff, we were, um, out to brunch earlier today cause I've

169
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,520
been promising you brunch when Alan was in town for a long time.

170
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Best French toast ever.

171
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Well, I had the waffle.

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
It was pretty good.

173
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,080
But, um, we were kind of talking about old school video games and I had mentioned, uh,

174
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
ever since then, cause we were talking about, um, a certain game that's going to come up

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
later in the show.

176
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,400
And then we were talking about Rygar, the, uh, the arcade game, like not the NES game

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
that most everybody remembers.

178
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
It was also an arcade game.

179
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,520
And I was talking about the Taito arcade classics that is on Xbox, the old school one.

180
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,000
It has Rygar, has tech mobile, a bunch of other stuff in it.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Uh, and like how I've been really wanting to play that.

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
I didn't get to it today, but like ever since our little conversation this morning, I've

183
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
been dying to go back and play some Rygar.

184
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,520
It's been like an old school arcade day.

185
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,640
It is, I think one of the backwards compatible.

186
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It is.

187
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
It is.

188
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
That's why I know I can play it.

189
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
That came up in our discussion today.

190
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Yeah.

191
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,680
So, cause I don't think Dan knew that it was backwards compatible and it is one of the

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
few.

193
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
I don't think he checked.

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
Did Taito, I think Taito had like the Rainbow Islands and Bubble Bobble.

195
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
I can't remember what was in that collection.

196
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,560
It was years ago that I first got it, but now it's pretty awesome considering a lot

197
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,560
of those arcade games kind of get recycled and they want to charge you five, 10 bucks

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
a piece for them.

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I love Parasol Stars.

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,160
I found a copy of Parasol Stars for a PC Engine and they wanted like a bunch of money for

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
it, which was retarded.

202
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Which was stupid.

204
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm sorry if I offended some retarded people out there.

205
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Whatever.

206
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,520
I was trying to see if I could find the, uh.

207
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,360
Oh, now I'm sorry if I offended stupid people.

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,880
I was trying to see if I could find the Taito arcade classics page, but I can't find it.

209
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,760
An older game, so it's probably harder to find.

210
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
And I don't want to hear anything about Pokemans.

211
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Are you jealous?

212
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,920
Cause I've already heard about Pokemans from when Shane was playing through Pokemans.

213
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,480
It's all old news.

214
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Old news.

215
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,160
I find it fascinating how many people are going to get Pokemon black and white on the

216
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,600
3DS, even though you can play it on a DS Lite, but because the launch lineup for 3DS is not

217
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,760
as strong as it could have been, uh, there's a lot of people that want to use Pokemon to

218
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,920
kind of fill in the gap.

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
So we're waiting.

220
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Pokemon fans are pretty rabid, so it's a big day for a lot of people.

221
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,360
Dan has announced that we are waiting for Star Fox to get our 3DS.

222
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
And I want Kid Icarus.

223
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Yeah, hopefully those will all be up on the holidays.

224
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,640
All those other bitches can shut up.

225
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Alright.

226
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Anything else for your gaming week you want to share?

227
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Shime.

228
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Let's go to Loki.

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
How was your gaming week, Loki?

230
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
And I know you had time to play a lot.

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Yeah, but I didn't play a lot.

232
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,680
But I did play a few things, and it's funny.

233
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,320
So I finished Sword and Poker 2 finally, so I stopped playing that.

234
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,160
And I'm playing a new iOS game, Game Dev Story.

235
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,060
It's the one where it's a game developer sim, and so you can develop games and stuff like

236
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
that.

237
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,160
And, uh, you know, I'm just kicking ass at it.

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:44,560
And it's kind of funny, though, because it's, uh, it takes place, like, during, you know,

239
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,240
pre-Nintendo and stuff like that, but there's all these different systems with different

240
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,840
names that are supposed to be the, you know, those consoles, like the Nintendo IES, or,

241
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,720
you know, the Neon Gion, stuff like that.

242
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,200
So I have my company, Orange Lounge, here, and let me go over some of the past products

243
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,360
that we have put out, and that have sold well.

244
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,600
And of course, everything is really inappropriate, so that's awesome.

245
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
Very awesome.

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,080
One of our first games, Two Girls, One Cup, sold 847,000 units, of course, that's early

247
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
on.

248
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,920
Pokemans, we put out a game called Pokemans, sold 2.7 million.

249
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,040
Some of the other more popular games, um, Fucked Your Mom, 4 million units, Pokemans

250
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:50,240
3, 11 million, You Is Stupid, which is our You Don't Know Jack game, and then of course

251
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,480
I ripped off other things, obviously, since Nintendo doesn't exist, so we have Mario RPG

252
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
as well.

253
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:05,080
Pokeman Online, 54 million copies, that's pretty awesome, and then of course our last

254
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,600
music game, TDR Ol' Army, 46 million.

255
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,240
And that's on our console, the glory hole, because they happened to be watching the soup

256
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,800
at the time, so, and our console is kicking the Playstation's ass.

257
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Wow.

258
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,600
I gotta do a quick correction, so I apologize, I blended my companies together.

259
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,160
The Rygar and Tecmo Bowl, of course, are in the Tecmo Classic Arcade Collection, not Taito,

260
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,640
sorry, a very similar sounding in my arcade classic knowledge failed me for a moment,

261
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,920
but there's Tecmo Classic Arcade, that is the one that is backwards compatible, Bombjack

262
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,840
Rygar, Tecmo Bowl, Solomon's Key, lots of awesome ones.

263
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,380
There is a separate game called Taito Legends, I can't remember if this one was backwards

264
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,080
compatible, but this was the one that had like the Bubble Bobble, Space Invaders, Elevator

265
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,740
Action, New Zealand Story, and some of those games, so, oops!

266
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
I'm getting old, sorry.

267
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,920
And these games are how many years old?

268
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,960
And funny enough, Frisbee, Fucked Your Mom, The Sequel, Fucked Your Dad, that is actually

269
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,240
the sequel, so, pretty funny.

270
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,440
But the game, it's all done in pixel art, and it's pretty fun, and basically you hire

271
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,400
people, fire people, you train them, you can eventually get like, you can go to E3, or

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:35,240
I think they call it Game Decks, it's like Com Decks, SSJ100 Matt wants to know how what

273
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,520
theyplay.com snap is selling.

274
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,360
That's an old school, by the way.

275
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't have that game yet.

276
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
You might have to put that in there.

277
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
We may have to develop that game.

278
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,080
But we just put out Call of Duty, and sold 7 million units in the first week.

279
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,080
And don't forget my dream game for the Xbox Live Indie Arcade would be Granny's Got a

280
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Gun.

281
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Granny's Got a Gun?

282
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,080
That would be Granny's Got a Gun, and it's the Golden Girls with machine guns.

283
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,900
Yes, and it's great though because you can see what your console, how it's doing and

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,080
stuff in the marketplace, and they even have the Virtual Boy, and all the console stuff

285
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,600
since we kinda know what's going on with the game industry and everything, it's like, okay,

286
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,800
here comes the Virtual Kid, it's a 3D portable, I don't think I'll be developing on that because

287
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,440
I think it's going away really fast, and sure enough it goes away really fast, just like

288
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,460
the other ones, instead of the Saturn it's the Uranus.

289
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,360
But yeah, it's pretty fun.

290
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Definitely worth picking up Game Dev Story, and they have the new one, they don't have

291
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,720
it over here yet, but they have some spa sim, they have the spa sim over here, which is

292
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,200
kinda dumb, but they have a game store, it's called the Game Dealer, and you play like

293
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
a Game Stop type thing, it's a similar game, Dev Story.

294
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,880
I've heard about that.

295
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,960
But yeah, definitely, Game Dev Story, check it out, it's awesome.

296
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Alright.

297
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,280
Oh, and then other things, I'm sorry, Grand Theft Auto.

298
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,320
Of course, of course, wouldn't be a week on OLR without Grand Theft Auto.

299
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,400
In fact, was that what you were playing a minute ago, it was in like debug mode or something

300
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,800
where you had the flying ice cream truck?

301
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,680
No, that was the PC version, I'm working on mod stuff for it, because I've edited the

302
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,400
water and everything to create this kind of a hydro thunder type track thing in there,

303
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,840
so I'm building, I've done the water part of it, called ice cream thunder.

304
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,320
No, the ice cream truck has nothing to do with it.

305
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,760
The whole reason there was an ice cream truck that was flying around like a helicopter is

306
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,360
because the annihilator helicopter fires guns off of it, and I was trying to make a vehicle

307
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,200
that drives around that fires guns out of the front of it, that happens to be an ice

308
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,200
cream truck just like, you know, Sweet Tooth and Twisted Metal, so.

309
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Was unable to do that though, because the game just crashes for no apparent reason when

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I try to make it drive.

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I don't know.

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,240
Does it play that horrible Jack in the Box style music while you're driving it?

313
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,400
It does when it, because that, all I did was I replaced the image of it, so.

314
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,320
But the actual ice cream truck does play all the like, you know, that type of music.

315
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,760
Can you do not just an ice cream truck, but what do they call it, the Roach Coaches that,

316
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
you know, the trucks start to incorporate buildings?

317
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
They don't have the Roach Coaches.

318
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,640
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,560
No but you can, like I've, some other map edit stuff I was working on, I was doing some

320
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,800
tweaks to the physics of the bus and the ambulance, and so now I can clear Central Park with a

321
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
ramp, which is awesome.

322
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
That bus moves fast.

323
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
I don't know.

324
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,280
They need to bring back something like hard driving and modernize it with more stunts.

325
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,720
I mean I guess you could say, well like Burnout or whatever, but like.

326
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,560
Well that would technically be, well yeah, I mean like I understand, as far as like that

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,080
game Stunts, I guess that would be Trackmania, it would be kind of similar to Stunts.

328
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Oh yeah, Trackmania.

329
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,320
But um, you know, as far as like a simulation racing game like that, I don't think they

330
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
have that.

331
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,080
Hey but hey, you know, EA, Need for Speed, you know, maybe some Need for Speed stunt

332
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,400
game or something like that.

333
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,040
That would be fun.

334
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,680
Alright, uh, My Gaming Week, a lot of the same stuff, I haven't really invested a lot

335
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
in new games lately.

336
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I was tempted the other day though, man, the Dreamcast Collection with Space Channel 5

337
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,480
Part 2, uh, Crazy Taxi and Sonic Adventure, which are already out on Xbox Live Arcade,

338
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,240
but I didn't because I figured the game I really, really want, it'll come out on Xbox

339
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,640
Live Arcade eventually, and if I really, really, really wanted to play it, I could probably

340
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,000
just borrow, you know, Alan's copy or Jamie's copy or something, so I'll just wait a little

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
longer for some choo choo in Space Channel 5 Part 2.

342
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,640
As far as games I actually did play, went back, today I was feeling really old school

343
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,120
for some reason, I went back and played Bionic Commando Rearmed, because I was going through

344
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
like my Xbox games, because I bought a lot of arcade games back in the day, and I was

345
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,920
like, which one of these did I not play enough of?

346
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,280
I got down to B before I found the game, I was like, shit, I need to play more of this.

347
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,980
So I spent some quality time with Bionic Commando Rearmed, and I don't know why I just stopped

348
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,320
playing that the first time, I think it just came out during a period where there were

349
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,320
a lot of games coming out, and yes, I realize there's a sequel out already, so I'm a little

350
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:15,280
bit behind, but yeah, you can't forget, especially for you folks who are just now getting Xbox

351
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,120
360s, I think sometimes you can get a little bit distracted by all the arcade games that

352
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,640
are out there now, but seriously, there's a lot of like old school stuff that's really

353
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,080
pretty good out on Xbox Live Marketplace, so do your research, because there's some

354
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,160
games you might have missed that came out even like a year ago, two years, I mean, heck,

355
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
how old's the Xbox 360 now, coming on five years old, and still some stuff that dates

356
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,160
all the way back, that's quality stuff, like Geometry Wars, the original, is still worth

357
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,360
your five bucks, and the sequel's probably worth another ten.

358
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Rest in peace, Bazaar.

359
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,320
As far as other games I played this week, I did check out the demo for one new game,

360
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,360
Beyond Good and Evil HD, which is of course the big Xbox Live title that came out this

361
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,320
week, which made a lot of people really excited, because the original game has lots and lots

362
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,960
of fans, and let me admit something to you guys, I never really played the original.

363
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,560
I know, I know, it was like a huge game, had its fans on PC, PS2, again, I think the original

364
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,680
kind of came out during a time where I wasn't, either I was way too hardcore into the music

365
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,320
games where I was missing a lot of this stuff, or I don't know, I just, you know, there's

366
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,360
not enough time in the day to play everything, so I missed this the first time around.

367
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,760
But I checked it out this time, and I at least played through the demo, and I was left wanting

368
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,520
to get the full version, it was pretty cool.

369
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Having not played the original, I can't sit here and profess to know a lot about what

370
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,120
the upgraded, but I will tell you it was widescreen, it definitely seemed like there was a lot

371
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,760
of water effects that seemed to be somewhat new, and everything seemed very, very smooth.

372
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,160
It didn't look like, it did kind of look like an up-res'd PlayStation 2 game, but that's

373
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,120
okay, I mean, I hear a lot of people are really drawn to this game because of the story, and

374
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,560
I know this game really throws you in right away.

375
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,880
There's really not a lot of background explanation given as to, you know, what's going on in

376
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,560
the game, but it was cool, like I was interested in it right up until they pulled the plug

377
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,080
on it, which was rather abruptly on the demo.

378
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,920
What a great way to try and convince people to spend ten bucks, so yeah, I'm interested

379
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,040
in going back and revisiting this game since, you know, so many people love it, and I know

380
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,840
a lot of good things about it, and having got to play the first, I don't know, thirty

381
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:24,500
minutes or so in the demo was nice, so I will check out more of that, if I don't get too

382
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,880
distracted by Torchlight next week, because that is the Xbox Live game I am waiting for,

383
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,400
I love the PC one, I'm so excited to see how it translates to console, I'm really worried

384
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm getting my expectations way too high, that I'm going to be just left disappointed

385
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,280
next week, but hopefully I can fit in Beyond Good and Evil HD 2.

386
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,000
According to Game Guru, Space Channel 5 is on Steam.

387
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,240
Yes, it did, it came out, I believe, over the weekend on Steam, it just kind of suddenly

388
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,760
showed up, so yeah, if you want to check that out on the PC, that would be cool, so, alright,

389
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,400
so that was pretty much it for my gaming week, those two games, and you know, some of the

390
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,520
usual stuff, wow, and some other PC games and so forth, Super Meat Boy, getting frustrated,

391
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,480
tried some of those new levels that we were talking about a couple weeks ago on the show,

392
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,320
couldn't even beat one, couldn't even beat stage one on some of those really hard ones,

393
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
disgusting.

394
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,920
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping, and then we will get into the gaming news

395
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,520
for tonight, not a lot to say for housekeeping except Dark Soccer, sadly, will not be joining

396
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,640
us next week, but there will still be an OLR, Loki and I will be here, perhaps a guest host,

397
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
I don't know, we'll see.

398
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
I will be in a car.

399
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,840
Yes, you're going far away, so.

400
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Far far away.

401
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I hope you have fun.

402
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,360
Don't go too far that you can't come back, because we can go one week, but I don't know

403
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
about two weeks.

404
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Not be back.

405
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Alright.

406
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,120
Join us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, you can join us on Facebook, facebook.com

407
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
slash Orange Laundry.

408
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,560
Speaking of Twitter, I'm peeking at it a little early tonight, and I thought this was a really

409
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,180
funny tweet from Defective Candy sent us a tweet, I know, I'm getting to Twitter early,

410
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,400
so shoot me, introducing OLR to seven of my friends tonight.

411
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,160
We're partying it up with some old school Unreal LAN partying and tuning in.

412
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Well shout out to you guys at the LAN party, that sounds pretty awesome, kicking it old

413
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,600
school with Unreal.

414
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,480
Back in the day, this might be a little more even old school than Unreal, but back in the

415
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,360
day, we used to get together and play Quake, that used to be kind of the big thing, this

416
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,000
is like way before MMOs and all that, we would get together and play Quake like online, it

417
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,240
was just a lot of fun.

418
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,920
My first LAN was Duke Nukem 3D.

419
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh yeah?

420
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah, I used to do that on the modem, the dial-up thing, it was a lot of fun.

421
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,920
Duke Nukem and Command & Conquer Red Alert were fun over the modem.

422
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Nice.

423
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,360
So, I hope you guys are having fun, and thanks for spreading the word of the show, appreciate

424
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
it.

425
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,720
Let's get to the news, and Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

426
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Oh yeah.

427
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
Much busier week than last week, that's for sure.

428
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,840
Yeah, it helps to have stuff going on in conferences and whatnot.

429
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,760
We may have talked about, well we did talk about this a little bit, that it was a possibility,

430
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:02,560
especially with LG suing Sony over the Blu-ray technology, but now apparently they've won

431
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:10,080
their preliminary injunction, and that means that they have blocked the sale of the Playstation

432
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,560
3 in Europe.

433
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:18,200
So basically, LG has an injunction for customs to seize and confiscate all PS3s coming into

434
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,640
Europe and from manufacturing plants, etc., up to ten days.

435
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,920
I don't really know what that's supposed to do for ten days.

436
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,760
It says, apparently they're collecting consuls, the consuls collected are temporarily being

437
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:40,720
held in Dutch warehouses until the case moves forward, but right now they're expected to,

438
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,740
I guess retailers are expected to have enough PS3s the last two or three weeks, so you may

439
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,360
not necessarily see any shortages or something like that.

440
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,560
You may, if this case goes further, and they end up winning everything, because Sony's

441
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,360
gonna have to pay them some money.

442
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,440
Do you think maybe that's just what's gonna ultimately happen, is that this all gets settled

443
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,240
out of court to stop this from happening?

444
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
It all depends-

445
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,560
It seems like 90% of the game lawsuit stories end up settled out of court.

446
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,720
It all depends whether they feel they're in the right or not.

447
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,040
If Sony knows that they have no chance at winning this, then they probably won't fight

448
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,840
it, but if they think that they're in the right and they don't need to pay them any

449
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,760
royalties or whatever, they're gonna fight it, because it saves them money if they don't

450
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,120
want to pay these royalties on every single console shipped.

451
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,040
How damaging is this to Sony, do you think?

452
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,520
Because I look at this and go, well, if they can't ship it to stores, they're still okay

453
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,880
for a little bit, because stores have what's on hand.

454
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
Come on, it's just a shortage for ten days.

455
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,880
It's no big deal.

456
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,920
It's not like the PlayStation 3 has a must-have game coming out this week or something.

457
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,560
People deal with shortages on stuff for a lot longer than ten days.

458
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,140
I mean, look at the Wii, and it's just fine.

459
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,340
I doubt this will make any sort of impact.

460
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,760
Everybody likes reporting on this stuff because, haha, Sony's getting their taste of legal

461
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,720
battles since they're suing GeoHot and stuff like that, whatever.

462
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,000
It's just another lawsuit, but at least this time it's not just something stupid like some

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,300
no-name company sitting on patents for a while and going, oh, hey, we invented, you know,

464
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,240
we patented controller.

465
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,240
That's true, you can't say this is so much a patent troll thing.

466
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
No, this is not.

467
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,240
Interesting.

468
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,280
All right, well, we'll see what comes of this, the legal team at Sony working overtime these

469
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,120
next couple weeks for sure.

470
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,800
Big, big gaming news, and kind of always divisive when I talk about Apple.

471
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,240
And Apple did announce the iPad 2 is coming out March 11th, and you bet this is gaming

472
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,160
news because, you know, a lot of folks are gaming on the Apple these days with the iPhone

473
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,720
and the iOS, you know, big, big system.

474
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,400
Controversial too if you want to get into the whole fact that they charge very little

475
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,960
for the games on the iPhone and some people have a problem with that as we learn GDC this

476
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
week.

477
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
But I digress.

478
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,280
iPad 2 was announced this week.

479
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,760
It is coming out on March 11th.

480
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,240
It will cost you anywhere between $629 and $829.

481
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,000
If you want a unit with 3G, lowest you can go though is $499 if you want the Wi-Fi only

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,600
up to $699.

483
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,640
Just throwing it out there too, if you wanted to get the original iPad, those are now sliced

484
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,560
in price by $100.

485
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,300
So those are now out as well.

486
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,920
Some of the big things that are supposed to be coming out with the iPad 2, it's not just

487
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,120
the fancy colors, but of particular interest is this cable that will allow you to hook

488
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,080
up the iPad to your television and get the output in 1080p display, which is making a

489
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
lot of people very excited.

490
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,600
You know, of course streaming movies that are on the device makes it very easy to kind

491
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,960
of bypass the Mac Mini, or I'm sorry, not the Mac Mini, the Apple TV and so forth in

492
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,200
order to do that.

493
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,000
But a lot of people also wondering, could this have some feature for games going with

494
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,200
it where you could use the cord to have the iPad as a control device for something on

495
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
your TV?

496
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Angry Birds HD?

497
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,560
No, I mean, because who wants to be tethered to a TV?

498
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,680
You know, unless they have some sort of wireless thing, it's not.

499
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,080
Which, quite frankly, I'm surprised they don't through the whole Apple TV thing that we've

500
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
seen.

501
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
They may later on.

502
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,120
I mean, they can stream stuff through Apple TV, and it could be something that comes through

503
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,760
iOS later on, but...

504
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,980
I mean, we did have the story last week or two weeks ago about the whole people were

505
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,640
playing PS3 games through the iOS, was a whole thing that had been set up.

506
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,920
So I mean, the technology is getting there, and that has nothing to do with Apple themselves.

507
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,960
That was kind of a filed-in-a-hack-and-crack bin.

508
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Yeah, but that's a little in the reverse.

509
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
That's not necessarily...

510
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,360
I mean, playing PlayStation 1 emulated games, that's through the actual system that's running

511
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
that.

512
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,320
But streaming stuff from the PlayStation 3, though, that's a little bit different.

513
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,160
That's just streaming video.

514
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,880
And I mean, I'm sure that obviously since the iPad 2 is a dual-core system, I'm sure

515
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,720
it can handle streaming stuff.

516
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:22,520
But as far as the Apple TV goes, I mean, I think it's just like an Intel Atom little

517
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
box.

518
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
I mean, it's just...

519
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,080
I don't think it has enough oomph to do 1080p.

520
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,800
I think it's capped at 720 because I think that's what iTunes is.

521
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,320
The ones that are out there now, yeah, 720.

522
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,720
Let me throw this question out there to you guys here in studio and the chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com.

523
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,280
There's been a lot of talk this week with this news and in the game blogs and so forth

524
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,200
about the 3DS, which we'll get into some of that news in a little while, and the iPad

525
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,760
2.

526
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Both had these major press conferences on the same day, literally within an hour of

527
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,720
each other, and somewhat of a dig at Apple coming from Nintendo, and kind of a lot of

528
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,880
both these devices coming out in March, and a lot of talk about kind of the future of

529
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
handheld gaming.

530
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
What do you guys kind of think?

531
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,240
Does the 3DS really have to worry about iPad 2 or vice versa, or do these things kind of

532
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,360
coexist and neither really has to really worry about the other, so why are they dogging on

533
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
each other?

534
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
I think it's the latter, but you know how companies are.

535
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,600
They like to look for drama where there isn't.

536
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,160
And on top of that, the rivalry is only good for both of them.

537
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,720
Establishing some type of farcical rivalry.

538
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,240
Unfortunately, Nintendo will never be able to compete with Apple as far as their online

539
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,360
marketplace goes, because their online marketplace is open.

540
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,280
It's an open marketplace for all these developers to basically create these games, submit them,

541
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,320
get approval, and then they are up on the marketplace really quickly.

542
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,840
That's why you get hundreds of apps each day on that marketplace.

543
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,360
Now granted, not all of them are great, but you know what?

544
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,920
That should be up to the consumer to decide what's good, and they have a good review system

545
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:11,120
I think in place on the app store that it's pretty easy to find what you're looking for

546
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,960
and know if it's crap or not.

547
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,480
But see, that's what Nintendo needs, because unfortunately you're never going to be able

548
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,240
to compete at the level with these guys if you're just releasing three games a week on

549
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
that.

550
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,640
And I'm sorry, but the virtual console stuff, at this point you know what?

551
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,520
You should just get the rights where you can, and it really shouldn't take much.

552
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,960
You've got an emulator built, just dump the ROMs, go, go, go.

553
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,880
To PlayDevil's advocate though, what if it were three quality games a week?

554
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,040
I'm talking Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, the stuff that's really good on iOS, of which

555
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,180
there isn't much, but there are some really, really good games on there.

556
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,960
There are good games on the iOS platform, and it's just some of these games that people

557
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,560
just decide that they like.

558
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,120
Angry Birds I don't think is a great game.

559
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I'm sorry, it's a game that's popular.

560
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,320
It's a trading game is what it is.

561
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,600
But the public disagrees.

562
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Public's dumb.

563
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,120
It's selling very well.

564
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,360
I don't think it's all that either, I prefer Cut the Rope, but I can say okay, it's selling

565
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,440
like shit tons of copies.

566
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
And you know what though?

567
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,560
I wouldn't be surprised, and there's no reason why they can't have Angry Birds on the Nintendo

568
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
DS.

569
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,120
Right now, on the DSi, why can't they have Angry Birds on there?

570
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:39,480
I mean, PSP has it, it was a download game, it came out way later, but that's even the

571
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,160
problem with the PSP, they're a little online stuff, it's so closed that they just can't

572
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
get games fast enough.

573
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,680
They need to really open it up, I think the closest thing to the app store is probably

574
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,080
the Xbox Indie games, because your release is there, you're seeing a lot of games coming

575
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
out.

576
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,320
A lot of crap, but that's the same with the app store, a lot of it is crap.

577
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,440
But if you open it up, a lot more stuff comes out, and yeah, you're gonna get a lot of crappy

578
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,520
games, but you're also gonna get a lot of good games, and if you're smart, and know

579
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:22,640
how to highlight those good games, and know how to push that platform forward, then that

580
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
is good for you.

581
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,560
The problem with Nintendo though is, is if they do that, and they start pushing that

582
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,560
platform forward, who's gonna want to pay $50 for a game?

583
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,360
Because then they can just get some really quality games for like 99 cents, or a few

584
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,560
bucks instead of $50.

585
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,080
Why should I pay $50 for a 3DS game like Zelda?

586
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,320
Because it's 3D!

587
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,400
So what if it's 3D?

588
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Doesn't mean that those digital download games aren't 3D, they could easily program for 3D,

589
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,640
just like there's gonna be indie games that are gonna support the Kinect, eventually,

590
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,000
once they open it up for everybody.

591
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,520
Why should I have to pay that kind of money?

592
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,600
And that's what they're complaining about.

593
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,080
They're complaining about the fact that they think that these games are devaluing their

594
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
games.

595
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Well, why do you think that?

596
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,560
Because obviously if you think your games are so much better, then how would they devalue

597
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
your games?

598
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
Oh!

599
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,240
Because they're not...

600
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,820
Your games aren't that much better.

601
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,820
That's the problem.

602
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,600
Is, you know, you've spent all this money on developing these games, they're just okay.

603
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
I mean...

604
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Let's go to comments from our chat room.

605
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
Chat.orangelandtrader.com for some comments.

606
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,580
Dark Tetsuya says, I think Nintendo's just jealous because they can't keep releasing

607
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,920
all new hardware after a year the way Apple seems to.

608
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
They don't need to!

609
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
They do!

610
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
But they do!

611
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,920
The DS Lite, the DS Lite in new colors, the DSi, the XL...

612
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,080
As of lately, I would say they have been doing something new every year.

613
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Yeah, the XL...

614
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,160
But, see, that's even retarded too, because what's the point of making the system larger?

615
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
How is this supposed to, you know, drive sales for you guys?

616
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,400
I never understood that.

617
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,520
Let's make a portable system larger now.

618
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
What?

619
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Why?

620
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,920
It's just like, oh, let's make the Game Boy micro.

621
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,200
Game Guru says Nintendo pretty much dumped every game they do own on the Virtual Console.

622
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,360
Or at least, well, every game they could dump.

623
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,000
I guess maybe a dig at Earthbound because of the whole trouble there.

624
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
They're not thinking...

625
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,040
The problem is they're a step behind when it comes to, well, they're a few steps behind

626
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,840
when it comes to embracing online.

627
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,480
They're not where these first-party companies are.

628
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,780
They're not supporting download content as well.

629
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,880
Why aren't there downloadable tracks for Mario Kart?

630
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,000
I mean, come on.

631
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,480
And that's stupid simple.

632
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,040
You could easily just put out all...

633
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,200
Says that we can't handle it.

634
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,520
No, I mean, I know it can.

635
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,400
The Wii can handle it.

636
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,480
The problem with the Wii, though, is because they, you know...

637
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,560
The problem is they just don't want to do that because then they can't sell another

638
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,840
Mario Kart game because they can put, you know, new tracks in there.

639
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,520
But here's the thing that's even funny about the Wii.

640
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,520
I mean, people can, like, they can modify the tracks that are in the game just by using

641
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,280
an SD memory card and some software.

642
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,880
So if it's that easy, open it up like ModNation Racers.

643
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,520
Oh my god, you've got a community of people that are excited about a game.

644
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,360
You can even start charging for some download content, different, you know, tools and stuff

645
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,000
that you can put in there, like LittleBigPlanet.

646
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
You can make, you know, money off this.

647
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,240
The problem is they need to change their stupid business model in order for it to work.

648
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,960
And I'm sorry, but I just don't see them ever embracing online like that.

649
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,800
Let me ask you this and then kind of try to close with this thought, because I want to

650
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
come...

651
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Believe it or not, I want to come back to the Wii thing later in the show because I

652
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,760
have another question about it.

653
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,040
But let me ask this.

654
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,640
You say they need to change their business model, but at the same time, numbers say they

655
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,600
have the number one console in America, period.

656
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
I mean, so why do they need to change their business model?

657
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
They're number one.

658
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,620
I mean, I hate it.

659
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
You hate it.

660
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
We all hate it.

661
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
But they are number one.

662
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
For right now.

663
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,520
I mean, that's the problem.

664
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
That's a cocky attitude, though.

665
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,320
If you say, oh, but we're number one, we can do whatever the hell we want.

666
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,640
That's great until Apple decides to put out a console and then they have this app store

667
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,220
and then you can download all these games for 99 cents.

668
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,040
Or let's just say that they're iPad prices and it's like two bucks a game or something

669
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
like that.

670
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,480
I'm sorry, but a lot of people, you know, there are a lot of good games out there that

671
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,880
are on these marketplaces, you know, even like the Android marketplace and stuff.

672
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,960
Not everybody really wants you to spend the kind of development time that it costs for

673
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,320
a $50 game.

674
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,720
Like for example, a perfect example, Excite Truck.

675
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
I love that game.

676
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
That game is awesome.

677
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,840
All they needed to do was release download content for it or a sequel that had basically

678
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,880
the same style of gameplay, just more tracks.

679
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Not Excite Bots.

680
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Not Excite Bots.

681
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,060
Excite Bots was, I don't even know what the hell they were doing.

682
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,120
But I know Nintendo had a problem, was behind that kind of crap.

683
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,360
Hey, you know what would be better if we made some more mini games in there?

684
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,960
It does not belong, mini games do not belong in a racing game.

685
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,300
It's stupid.

686
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,100
It's really, really stupid.

687
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,560
But all they had to do was download content, and they could have still made some money

688
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,200
on top of that, and you know what?

689
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,080
Games like that, even if they have download content, do not devalue their sequels when

690
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
they come out.

691
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,920
So what if there's good download content for that?

692
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,100
You know what?

693
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,520
People will be more willing to buy the next game because they know that they're going

694
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,040
to be supporting download content on top of that.

695
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,360
Or hell, you can put out the game for a cheaper cost and then have in-game downloads or something

696
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,240
like that, you can add to it and increase value that way.

697
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,300
There's just so many ways that they could do it, but they don't want to.

698
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
Because you know what?

699
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,120
People don't download games.

700
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
That's what they think.

701
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
People don't download games.

702
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,200
Well, I think Apple would disagree with you on that.

703
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,220
So let me ask this question.

704
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,440
How do you kind of feel about Nintendo right now?

705
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,760
Because I do notice you're looking at eBay on your computer looking for 3DSs right now.

706
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,680
So there's a part of you that must... there's something Nintendo's doing right for you.

707
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Well I want to...

708
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,080
I just get every console, okay?

709
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,480
That doesn't even necessarily... and I was just looking to see if anybody's actually

710
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
offering up a Japanese system for a decent price.

711
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm sorry but even though $350 is a good price for a Japanese console, and it is in California,

712
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,200
although his reserve price is probably $500, so screw that.

713
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
You know me, I like getting stuff early.

714
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,960
Anyways, but no, I'm not actually gonna probably buy that.

715
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,720
I will buy a 3DS when it comes out, because I think it's a cool technology, but I gotta

716
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,040
be honest, the launch lineup is very disappointing.

717
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm like sitting there going, looking at the tiles coming out, I'm like, well I'll pick

718
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,200
up pilot wings because that looks fun, but pfft, it's like... and Nintendo's like, but

719
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,600
we have Steel Diver!

720
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,720
It's a 2D submarine game!

721
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Oh, cool?

722
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,520
I mean, you know, that's neat, I guess.

723
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:14,000
Or like, you know, hey, we have Nintendogs, and Nintendogs and cats, or, hey, hey, hey,

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,520
we've got Ocarina of Time.

725
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,120
Like I was reading the news articles, they're like, oh my god, Master Quest is in Ocarina

726
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,440
of Time!

727
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,240
For the 3DS, that's so amazing!

728
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,400
Alright, I promise I won't let Dark Soccer do her story here, but I gotta read this comment

729
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
from chat, because it is kind of an interesting point.

730
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,320
Game Guru says, your Mario Kart example doesn't work, Nintendo only makes one Mario Kart per

731
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
system.

732
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,880
Well, I'm talking about other consoles though.

733
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,560
I mean, I'm saying, you know, and this is even bad now, as far as the trend goes, remember

734
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,960
before with like Mario Kart for the GameCube I think was the first one I did, it's like,

735
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,960
oh look, we've got some of the older tracks in there, oh that's kind of cool, you know,

736
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,280
a little bit of retro nostalgia there, and then they started, one of the Game Boy ones

737
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,080
I think started that whole trend, you're right, the Game Boy Advance one did, because it was

738
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,680
based off the, you know, it looked like the Super Nintendo game, and I was like, oh that's

739
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,480
kind of cool because it's nostalgia, and now all of them do, like half the tracks are all

740
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,200
old tracks.

741
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,520
Come on, man, that is just, that's lazy right there.

742
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,360
You have to admit, Rainbow Road's pretty sweet.

743
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,100
They have Rainbow, but yeah, I understand it's really sweet, but there's a new Rainbow

744
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:36,280
Road in every game, okay, and it's not necessary to put in one of the, you know, Mario Circuit

745
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,280
tracks from the Game Boy Advance and my 3DS version or something like that, they just

746
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,340
have such potential, like, you know, a track editor would be so awesome, but they'll never

747
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:54,240
do it, because they're like afraid that people will, I don't know.

748
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,720
I mean, come on, look at, here's a perfect example, a game that they did offer some sort

749
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,640
of editor for, a level editor, and it was so insignificant, but it just blew up like

750
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
crazy.

751
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,240
Smash Brothers, for the Wii, they had a level editor in there, oh my god, everybody loved

752
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,560
it, they had a website, they had websites sharing levels back and forth, IGN had this

753
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,780
big ol' thing that you can share custom levels, there was hundreds of levels to download and

754
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:29,000
play and stuff like that, it was such a minuscule thing, but it really got people excited about

755
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,800
the game, so what can I create?

756
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,760
Come on, people, Mario Kart's a cool game and stuff, and then, you know, even like your

757
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,160
Mario games are fun, or Zelda, whatever, but if you throw in some sort of like community

758
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,620
aspect to it, people get really excited about it, and I think that's gonna speak a lot louder

759
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,800
than oh hey, we put out a Mario Kart game, yeah, I know you're gonna put out a Mario

760
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,160
Kart game on 3S, you're also gonna put a Mario Kart game on the next console you put out,

761
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,880
I mean, that's dumb, in a Zelda game, I mean, we know that's coming, it's, we'd be dumb

762
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,700
to think otherwise, but they just, they have such potential, they just really are squandering

763
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,700
it.

764
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,920
Alright, let's move on, Dark Soccer's been waiting to talk about her next story.

765
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,400
I've given up, I'm looking at Monday through Friday.

766
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,800
More, more to come later though, we haven't finished the Nintendo news yet, and I've got

767
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,600
another killer question for Loki in a little bit here on the show.

768
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,120
GameStop has yet another class action lawsuit.

769
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,720
We've gotten a lot of money from GameStop because of employee stuff, and apparently

770
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,560
now people should be getting more, anyone who's bought anything ever from GameStop actually,

771
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,760
they use their credit card to buy it, should be getting their $5, because apparently they

772
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:55,240
acquire additional personal information, including the card holder's physical residential address,

773
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,160
by pairing the personal identification information with the card holder's name obtained from

774
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,280
the credit card.

775
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,040
So basically, you swipe your card, they get all your info.

776
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,800
It's not saying what they're doing with it, but they're supposedly doing it against your

777
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
knowledge.

778
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,280
But here's the thing, everywhere that you use your credit card does that without your

779
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
knowledge.

780
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,120
So this is me, we're gonna have class action lawsuits against the grocery store, and the

781
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,680
porn shop, and eBay.

782
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,200
I don't think it's necessarily that.

783
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,640
I think it's more because you have to put in all your personal info for trades or whatever,

784
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,680
that they're basically saying, okay, this is this person, here's this person, and this

785
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,400
person paid, here's their name, okay, we're gonna link their card number to this address

786
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
now.

787
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,280
Which is not good, especially if that information just kind of gets leaked out, because I'm

788
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,680
sure those GameStop employees are very trustworthy as far as, you know, minimum wage, that has

789
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,800
a lot of trust built into it.

790
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,160
They kind of should have some people's addresses on file, though, for the people that like

791
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,760
to sell back stolen games.

792
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,680
That's the point, too, is that I think that it's a good idea, I mean, I don't see any

793
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,920
problem with it as long as they're not selling it, and if you're on the opt-out list, then

794
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,920
they can't.

795
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,840
And I mean, if you get their card, if you want the magazine, you've got to fill out

796
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,000
all that stuff anyway, you know.

797
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,280
I don't see what the big deal is, but people are all butthurt over their personal information.

798
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,160
Well, privacy's a big thing, you know, especially in the past few years with Facebook and all

799
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,000
that, it's really come into the spotlight.

800
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
People are very sensitive, which, you know, I get it, identity theft sucks, and so forth.

801
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,600
But this isn't something that, unless someone actually, you know, breaks into a database

802
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,860
that all other stuff is uploaded to, and steals the information directly out of the database,

803
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,520
I don't think that there's much of a problem.

804
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,800
William Murderface in our chatroom says, so GameStop wants to troll me?

805
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I don't know how to react.

806
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,240
Rama in our chatroom says, I hate when I swipe my card.

807
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,680
Some terminals require your zip code, and you can't continue your transaction without

808
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
it.

809
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Isn't that a credit card protection thing?

810
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,680
It's like a gas station, I don't know if those are everywhere, but at Chevron, when I do

811
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,520
the swipe, it always makes me put on my zip code, because that's how it knows that I'm

812
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,360
who I, you know, somebody didn't steal my card.

813
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,400
Apparently it's illegal, but I still don't see what the big deal is, because it's not

814
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:26,120
like they can actually go out and sell your information without your permission, or they

815
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,040
have to let you know that they're doing it.

816
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,760
If this is just something that automatically pops up, you know, especially if they need

817
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,560
to do consumer tracking, I don't see what the big problem is.

818
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I really don't.

819
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,560
Even, I mean, I really, I think that people are just being paranoid, really.

820
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,880
So if you want to get your $5, go ahead, that's all you're gonna get, maybe $1.50.

821
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,080
That's the other thing with these class action lawsuits, is that, well, you know, even though

822
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,280
you might go, eh, GameStop's getting sued, likely they'll settle out of court, because

823
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:01,100
that's the way these things tend to go, and, you know, it'll be like $2 to those that send

824
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,800
in a form, that swear on an affidavit that their privacy was breached, or whatever, you

825
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
know.

826
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,320
It'll be interesting to see how that goes.

827
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,680
So Marisa Congusto in our chat room says, gas stations are allowed to do this because

828
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,480
they do not store it for marketing.

829
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,760
We just discussed this in Business Law the other day.

830
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,820
I don't think that they keep it for marketing either, really.

831
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,040
We bought stuff at GameStop and never gotten, you know, offers and stuff.

832
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,720
Yeah, I've never been, like, spammed by them, or what have you.

833
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,680
No, you only ever got coupons and stuff when we had a subscription to Game Informer, and

834
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,680
it came with our magazine.

835
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,080
I am spammed by them.

836
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Are you?

837
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,000
Did you sign up for their little card, though?

838
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Maybe that's why.

839
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,800
I signed up for their card, and then I get two emails from them every week, because I

840
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
told them, like, I'm on your mailing list twice, you need to take me off there.

841
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,920
Oh, okay.

842
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Never happened.

843
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,400
And then I also get, oh hey, you know, you can get this special, you know, this is for

844
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,140
GameStop, you know, people only.

845
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,080
It's a special survey thing, you go fill out surveys and you need cash.

846
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
It's like, stop.

847
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,760
You're bothering me with that crap.

848
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,240
Ramanarachatram says, when I swipe my CC to refill my Metro card, it asks for verification

849
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,240
that I get.

850
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,840
But not when I'm in Kmart, it asks every single time.

851
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,000
That's not credit card protecting their polling for where people live.

852
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,280
Yeah, Kohl's does that, too.

853
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,800
They always ask your zip code.

854
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,080
That is actually illegal to ask that.

855
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,540
That's fine, it's for demographic information.

856
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,720
That's still legal to ask that.

857
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,720
There's actually a court case.

858
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,200
I never said it wasn't.

859
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,440
Can't you just say no?

860
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,880
Yes, you can say no.

861
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,200
And then they don't.

862
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,320
You can tell them you don't want to give it and that can't stop them from...

863
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,640
Most of those people that are working there anyway will just be like, all right, whatever.

864
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,800
And they'll just, what they'll do, they'll just put in a different zip code.

865
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,440
That's what I bet most of them do.

866
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Make up a zip code.

867
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,880
You tell them no, they just make up a zip code.

868
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,880
Just make up a zip code.

869
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,880
One, two, three, four, five.

870
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,480
You know that's what's happening.

871
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,800
Most of the people on the front lines like that don't care.

872
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,560
I sometimes feel bad for them because then they're the ones that take the brunt of all

873
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,960
this hatred towards the collecting and so forth.

874
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,080
So all right, let's move on.

875
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,360
More news.

876
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,460
Release dates coming up at the Classic Game of the Week as well.

877
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,180
Yeah.

878
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,180
So this is interesting.

879
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,320
BurgerTime HD, or as I like to call it, BurgerTime Galaxy, because that's certainly what it

880
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,160
looks like.

881
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,280
It's being developed, I guess, by Monkey Paw Games.

882
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,460
It's coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

883
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:32,120
Wii and PC, I'm guessing, as part of their digital platforms, PlayStation Network, Xbox

884
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,960
Live, WiiWare.

885
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:43,200
And they're introducing new monsters, or I guess carrots, Apple Cores, hot peppers, oversized

886
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,160
monsters and other fun stuff.

887
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
They actually had some video online of it.

888
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,400
Looks interesting though.

889
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,160
You can actually play it multiplayer, split screen, which is kind of cool.

890
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,960
But yeah, it definitely looks like BurgerTime Galaxy.

891
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,520
Interesting.

892
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,280
I do love me some BurgerTime, the old school 80s machine.

893
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,920
Did you see the video of it?

894
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,920
I haven't actually watched it yet.

895
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Is it on YouTube?

896
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Uh, no.

897
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,920
Let's check this out.

898
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,900
I'm going to pull it up here real quick for you.

899
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
We need to be more prepared.

900
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,400
Let me see if I can find it here on YouTube.

901
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,400
There it is!

902
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,100
BurgerTime HD Level Complete Gameplay.

903
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,400
Let's take a look at this here.

904
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:29,600
Holy moly!

905
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,200
It's like running around this 3D looking circle thing.

906
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,600
All the levels have been changed into this giant cylinder.

907
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,760
It's a very different look for the game, but it's kind of the same damn game.

908
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
At least at first glance.

909
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,760
Oh, well there's this co-op thing going on, it's not the same game in my life.

910
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Very interesting.

911
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,200
BurgerTime Galaxy.

912
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,960
I do see where you get in BurgerTime Galaxy, absolutely.

913
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,840
That looks like it could be interesting.

914
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,760
Sorry for the ambient noise, it's somebody filming a screen that's probably a game developer's

915
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
conference or something.

916
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
I'm sure it is.

917
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,760
But, um, interesting.

918
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
Huh.

919
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,240
I'll have to look at the demo for that when that comes out.

920
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,760
That was an old school 80s game I really liked.

921
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,520
I'm curious how the co-op works.

922
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,920
That's something else.

923
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
You guys want to see it?

924
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,960
I just typed BurgerTime HD into YouTube and it came right up.

925
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:32,200
Alright, speaking of guilty pleasure games, this is one of my biggest guilty pleasure

926
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,480
games ever and it's been so long since I've played one of these games.

927
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,680
Mortal Kombat.

928
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,560
That's right, Mortal Kombat 9, or really it's the reboot, just Mortal Kombat, is coming

929
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
out soon.

930
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,600
My god, it's April 19th.

931
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,640
I didn't realize it was that soon.

932
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
That's my birthday.

933
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,960
You know what to get me.

934
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,040
It's pretty crazy how soon it's coming out.

935
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,120
I just kind of forgot that was on its way out, but yeah, it's coming out.

936
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,640
It's coming out on April 19th, but if you want to get your hands on it a little bit

937
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,960
sooner you'll be able to play a demo next week, March 8th, by the time some of you guys

938
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
hear this.

939
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,960
Here's the catch.

940
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,320
You've got to be a PlayStation Plus member because they are the ones that are getting

941
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,760
the demo first.

942
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,680
You'll be able to play a Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Mileena, and Johnny Cage in the living forest

943
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,360
or the fire pit.

944
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,420
So that's not bad.

945
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,240
Most fighting game demos only have two characters, so it's kind of neat that they have four.

946
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,320
So there you go.

947
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,640
One or two players.

948
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,520
I'm imagining not online though.

949
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,420
The other cool news is that not just the demo on March 8th for PlayStation Plus, but everybody

950
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,540
will get it March 15th.

951
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,080
So if you're like, I don't really want to sign up for PlayStation Plus, you can just

952
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,840
wait one more week and you'll be able to get it there.

953
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,520
Oh, I should say this though, that is only on PlayStation Network.

954
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:47,320
They do not have a firm date for when Xbox Live is getting it, just later.

955
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,280
Hmm, could be a lot closer to the game's release in that regard, so very curious about that.

956
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,800
By the way, also a small follow-up on Mortal Kombat 9.

957
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,180
I don't know if you guys heard, but it was banned in Australia because they refused to

958
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,180
rate the game.

959
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,200
When they refused to rate a game, that basically means that the game is banned.

960
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,440
Well, the publishers behind Mortal Kombat, they are appealing this decision.

961
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,040
We'll see just how far they get with it, so.

962
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,120
We'll see before the game's release.

963
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,520
Either way, it's probably going to end up getting delayed in Australia.

964
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,440
Probably a lot of people are just going to import the damn thing from somewhere else.

965
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,680
I'll probably be out there.

966
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,000
Even though that's supposed to be illegal as well, I don't see them exactly banging

967
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,280
down doors because people got bootleg copies of Mortal Kombat.

968
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,280
So we'll see what happens.

969
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,120
And then in fact if you bootleg, I'm sure that you can, you know, just import it.

970
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,360
Most of those games are region-free.

971
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,920
I don't mean like actual bootlegs, I mean like, you know, yeah, PlayStation 3 is region-free.

972
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,200
So there'll probably be lots of people just hitting up Amazon or something, getting a

973
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,880
friend in the US to buy it and then ship it to them.

974
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,620
There you go.

975
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:57,720
So also on Mortal Kombat, one other thing, I remember reading a story about this this

976
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,480
week, I wanted to throw this out there, is that there's this whole challenge mode in

977
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
it too.

978
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,880
And I remember watching a video for it on YouTube and they were all talking, all excited

979
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
about this.

980
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,880
Where I guess like 300 levels and they say you get something super special if you get

981
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
all the way to the end.

982
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,600
I'm assuming you unlock a bonus character or something, that's just my assumption.

983
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,460
But it's like all these cool modifiers, like there's some modifiers like Headless Combat

984
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:23,240
where you fight with no head, kind of reminds me of some old tacky fighting games.

985
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,760
Upside down mode, where the image is flipped upside down and that's how you have to play.

986
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,240
I just thought it was kind of funny.

987
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,880
So 300 levels though, that might be overkill, I don't know about that.

988
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,240
That's going to take a serious investment to get through, but we'll see.

989
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,280
Moving on, Dark Soccer's got a story for us, then we're going to get to release dates.

990
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,400
I do, of course I do.

991
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Game, which is a UK retailer, well they're going to be doing pre-orders for used games.

992
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,680
Yeah, they're going to be taking orders for games that people haven't bought yet.

993
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,640
But for when they're used.

994
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,640
Does that make sense?

995
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,600
Because I think I might have drunk a little too much chamois and it's baffling me.

996
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,240
It actually kind of does.

997
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,300
There's a lot of people that wait to buy it used to just save the $5 because it's cheaper,

998
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,520
you know.

999
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,120
I could see this.

1000
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,520
There's some people that sell back their games fast too.

1001
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,360
Like you know I picked up Tron Evolution like maybe a week after it was out, now I realize

1002
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,360
why someone sold it back so quick, but you know, some games you can get pretty quick

1003
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
that way.

1004
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360
Well once they already have on...

1005
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,360
Game Crazy fucking did that for free.

1006
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,840
Wait, wait, wait, oh Dan, you got to say that on the air, hold on Dan.

1007
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,700
What's that Dan?

1008
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,600
Game Crazy fucking did that for free.

1009
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,600
How so?

1010
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Like you just could put your name on a list?

1011
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Like you could come in and say, hey, can you give me a call when this game comes in used?

1012
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,120
And they did it.

1013
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
But they went out of business.

1014
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,480
And why did they go out of business?

1015
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,680
Because Hollywood Entertainment sucked.

1016
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Sorry to hear it.

1017
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,600
At any rate, some of the games on the list already are Crisis 2, Homefront Dragon Age

1018
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:05,160
2, Shift 2 Unleashed, and Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12.

1019
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,160
So yeah, you can pay 5 pounds and save a game that's not out yet.

1020
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,400
Which we'll just go to show you, game stores will take your $5 for anything.

1021
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,960
Someone probably had that copy, or when it comes out, they probably got that copy, so

1022
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,440
this game sucks.

1023
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,960
And you know, spanked over it or something, and then took it back, and then you get the

1024
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,040
spank version.

1025
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,400
You get it christened with the love of another man.

1026
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,560
Be careful though, this could be one of those games that you can't sell back.

1027
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,400
Like DC Universe Online, one unique key.

1028
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,920
So be careful what you pre-order used.

1029
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,420
I think they've got a specific list for it.

1030
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,640
Game Guru in our chat room says, oh great, GameStop is going to push pre-orders of used

1031
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,640
games now?

1032
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,960
No, no, no, this is game in the UK.

1033
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,560
However, you know if it does well for them, it'll just get copied by everybody else.

1034
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,040
That's how these things go.

1035
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,960
Look at charging for bags on airlines.

1036
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,980
A couple of them did it first, and everybody does it, except those that want to use it

1037
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,640
as a marketing point that they don't charge for it, like the Jet Blues and Southwest of

1038
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,640
the world.

1039
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,680
Alright, anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates and games that

1040
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,720
are coming out real soon.

1041
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:22,640
Yes, actually today Pokemon Black and White came out, so that's pretty exciting if you're

1042
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,280
a fan of the Pokemans.

1043
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,600
Which there are some real rabid fans of Pokemon out there that are over the age of 30.

1044
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,300
As on the Nintendo DS.

1045
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,760
This week actually we have a new Kinect game, U-Star 2 in the movies.

1046
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:41,120
Remember U-Star was that camera green screen system that they were selling on TV that only

1047
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,040
worked with PC at one point.

1048
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,840
Wasn't there already a crappy game like that on 360 that had the vision camera, like you

1049
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,240
in the movies or something?

1050
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,760
Yeah, yeah, that was a little different though.

1051
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,320
That was more of like you're doing mini games and then it puts you into the game, or the

1052
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,360
movie, it makes a little short film.

1053
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,360
This is actually, it's like karaoke for movie lines.

1054
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,880
Basically you recite movie lines and you can play different people in there and it will

1055
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,960
actually kind of crop the actor or actress out of the scene and it'll put you in their

1056
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,320
place and so you can get scored for accuracy and stuff like that.

1057
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,720
It's neat I guess and there's certainly not a lot of Kinect games coming out.

1058
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,120
That's on Playstation 3 for the Kinect, or I'm sorry, the Playstation 3 with move support.

1059
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,600
You do need the Playstation Eye camera though if you want to play that and then of course

1060
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,600
on Xbox 360 for the Kinect.

1061
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,400
Let's see, some other stuff this week.

1062
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,560
Dragon Age 2 coming out this week, that's on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360, that's

1063
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,400
a pretty big game.

1064
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,920
On the Wii, the One Million Dollar Pyramid, yet another TV show game.

1065
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:59,560
A couple MLB games this week, MLB 2011 The Show, that's on Playstation 2, PS3, and the

1066
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,480
Playstation Portable.

1067
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:12,320
Also MLB 2K11 on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PSP I believe.

1068
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:20,120
Pets Bunnies Bunch on Nintendo DS, I guess gearing up for Easter.

1069
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,480
What the hell is this?

1070
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,200
Beastly Frantic Photo?

1071
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,720
I think this is some sort of stupid application that ties into that crappy movie Beastly.

1072
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,320
I was going to say, there was a movie with Vanessa Hudgens that came out called Beastly.

1073
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,120
Yeah, I think that's what this is.

1074
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,160
I have not heard of that, but that's kind of funny.

1075
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,600
Yep, I think it's some sort of photo game, and it looks like crap.

1076
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,320
So it's Vanessa Hudgens Snap?

1077
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,280
It might be, I'm actually, oh they have a trailer for the movie, I don't really care

1078
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,280
about that.

1079
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,800
Alright, moving on.

1080
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,000
Is Beastly like a knockoff of Twilight?

1081
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,600
No, it's a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.

1082
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,240
Oh, okay.

1083
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,240
We're talking like a Beauty and the Beast that's going to be more like the old school

1084
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,240
TV show of Linda Hamilton, right?

1085
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,240
No.

1086
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,240
That show is the shit.

1087
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,360
A modern day retelling of the fairy tale, but not with the underground community.

1088
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:24,880
The guy is suddenly turned ugly by some witch girl, and he has to stay in his expensive

1089
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,020
penthouse.

1090
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,400
So no, be our guest.

1091
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,400
Be our guest.

1092
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,920
No, it's less song and dance, more emo.

1093
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
He turns emo.

1094
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,920
I see.

1095
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,920
So it is a little bit Twilight-inspired.

1096
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Ah, yeah.

1097
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Aren't they all?

1098
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,920
Do they sparkle?

1099
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
Yeah.

1100
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,840
Just like how, you know, Little Red Riding Hood, I don't remember werewolves being in

1101
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,840
Little Red Riding Hood.

1102
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,460
I could be, it's been a while since I heard Little Red Riding Hood, but I don't remember

1103
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,760
werewolves being in there, and I don't think emo people were in there as well.

1104
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,240
Now they're making emo Snow White, too.

1105
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:01,040
Come on, the original Little Red Riding Hood, she gets eaten by the wolf, and gets digested

1106
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,680
and dies.

1107
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,200
Awesome.

1108
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,080
As should those types of movies.

1109
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,680
Atari's Greatest Hits Volume 2 on the Nintendo DS coming out this week.

1110
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,880
Phantom Brave, Heroes of the Her-Muda Triangle for the PSP, another Atlus game.

1111
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,160
Not the Ber-Muda!

1112
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
The Her-Muda.

1113
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,160
Her-Muda.

1114
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
Like, hermaphrodite.

1115
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:28,080
Um, let's see here, also, um, what else we got here?

1116
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,680
Sims 3 Barnacle Bay on PC, in case you want to get your pirate on, um, for the Sims 3

1117
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,680
there.

1118
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,680
Yeah.

1119
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,720
And then some crappy Wii games, Maximum Racing, GP Classic Racing, and Maximum Racing Dragon

1120
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,000
Sword, and just don't even bother, seriously.

1121
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,800
And then, because, and I gotta go in the rant mode about this, but, I'm sorry, but like,

1122
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,800
here we go.

1123
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Just because Nintendo is so gracious for everybody, for a limited time, and this is the last time

1124
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:01,000
that they're reprinting this, game from the Super Nintendo, Super Mario All-Stars will

1125
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,160
be coming out one week from today, the limited edition, oh my god limited, going on eBay

1126
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,440
for $80 because, oh my god, I've never played a game that was on the Super Nintendo on the

1127
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,000
Wii, um, that is coming out once again on the Wii, get it now, before it goes away forever.

1128
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,400
Um, seriously, if you buy this you're stupid.

1129
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,440
I'm sorry, you are stupid.

1130
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,720
That's right, stupid.

1131
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:32,080
Just spend the money on the virtual console, better yet, just buy the freakin' Super Nintendo

1132
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,080
on the original game.

1133
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:39,240
I mean, you don't need this limited soundtrack and a little art book, I mean, come on.

1134
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,440
I just think your rants are funnier with Mario Bros. music in the background.

1135
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
That's, that's fine.

1136
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,360
But yeah, so, um, that's what we have coming out this week, but seriously though!

1137
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:55,120
They, they are taking you guys for fools, I mean, $30 for a Super Nintendo game.

1138
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,120
What's next, okay?

1139
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,880
We're gonna have, like, Game Boy Advance, you know, Mario Land or something, they're

1140
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,840
gonna put no new color in it, they're not gonna do shit to it, in fact they're not even

1141
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,240
gonna change, you know, um, aren't all those gonna be coming on the 3DS virtual, the virtual

1142
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,240
console, actually?

1143
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,600
Yeah, they're not doing shit to them, nothing, nothing at all, and they're gonna charge tons

1144
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,600
of money for that.

1145
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,920
You know what you can buy a Game Boy for nowadays?

1146
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,680
Probably 30 bucks, including that stupid, uh, probably even less than that, you probably

1147
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,860
can find them dirt cheap, at a garage sale.

1148
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,120
People don't even know what they are, they're trying to get rid of them.

1149
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:33,520
I mean, just don't, don't, don't feed the beast.

1150
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,520
Don't.

1151
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,020
It's a very beastly week in US releases, apparently.

1152
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,680
You're just encouraging them.

1153
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,040
All your, the message that you're sending loud and clear to Nintendo is, we like your

1154
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,000
old shit, please bring it back and charge us a lot of money for it, that's all that

1155
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
they're doing.

1156
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And you know what, people are dumb, because they're like, ooh, Mario must buy, Mario must

1157
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
buy!

1158
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:05,640
I mean, they can put out, like, Mario teaches, like, brain surgery or something like that.

1159
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:10,920
Mario's a wonderful douche, you know, and people would buy it, because it's got Mario

1160
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,080
in it.

1161
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,320
Are you done?

1162
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,600
I guess.

1163
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,680
Are you done with releases?

1164
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh, I'm done.

1165
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
I'm done with Nintendo.

1166
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,680
Oh, okay, alright.

1167
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,440
Let's, let's move on to the Japanese release dates, and we'll start off with Xbox 360 releases.

1168
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,360
Um, I thought this was a game at first, but I did more research on it.

1169
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:38,640
This is interesting, it's a title called Cross Channel in Memory of All People comes out

1170
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,640
this week on the Xbox 360.

1171
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:45,280
This has actually come out before, and it's a visual novel, so it's not really a game,

1172
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,800
it's this game novel thing that's been ported, it's been on the PS2, Windows, PSP, all this

1173
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,880
stuff before.

1174
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,660
It is coming out on the Xbox 360 as well now, with some extra stuff.

1175
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,040
So it's, I guess, I don't even know if it's like an interactive anime or anything, but

1176
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
who knows.

1177
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,400
So yeah, that is coming out this week.

1178
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,880
Probably nothing that'll ever see the light of day over here, I gotta be honest.

1179
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,500
But I have heard something about an English translation patch on some of the other versions,

1180
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,080
for those that are into it.

1181
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,200
On the PlayStation 3 coming out this week, there's an all-new console coming out in Japan

1182
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
this week.

1183
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,260
I think it is a satin silver model, I'm not sure what is coming out to kind of drive the

1184
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,260
sales of that.

1185
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,680
I know that Heavy Rain is getting a price reduction over there, and there is Shin Sangoku

1186
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,880
Musou 6 comes out this week as well.

1187
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,560
That's from Koei, is this Dynasty Warriors 6, is that what this is?

1188
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,320
That would, I believe, be Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1189
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,920
Ah, it is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, you're right, Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1190
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,000
Maybe that's what necessitates the new console.

1191
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I don't know.

1192
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,640
Remember, if you hear Sangoku, then it's Three Kingdoms.

1193
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,720
You think after nine years of this show, I would understand at least a couple words in

1194
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,120
Japanese by now, but no.

1195
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,600
Actually, I don't, ichimi sanshi, I can count to four.

1196
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,600
Awesome.

1197
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,080
Ah, nothing on the Wii this week in Japan, does that really surprise anybody?

1198
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,680
But on the Nintendo 3DS this week, because that's already out there, on the 10th, Ash

1199
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:12,200
Vault 3D Nitro Racing comes out this week from Konami.

1200
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,280
That is on the release date for the 3DS this week.

1201
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,040
And lastly, on the PSP this week, there's a few games, Deer Drops Distortion comes out

1202
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:29,240
this week, Fairy Tail Portable Guild 2, and Rurouni Kenshin Meiji Kenkaku Ramatan Saisen

1203
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,720
comes out from Namco Bandai this week.

1204
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,320
What the crap are they doing another Kenshin game for?

1205
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,880
Because the public demands it?

1206
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
I don't know.

1207
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,480
But there you go, that does it for your Japanese releases.

1208
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,440
Well, for the UK, we have a few things.

1209
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:50,120
On the 9th is Torchlight, and then on the 11th we have Brunswick Pro Bowling, oooh,

1210
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:57,000
Dragon Age 2, Home Front, and U-Star 2, and that's it.

1211
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,720
Alright.

1212
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,360
Let's move on with some more news, and then the Classic Game of the Week is just up ahead.

1213
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,320
Oh boy, can't wait for this next story.

1214
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,640
Loki, take it away.

1215
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:13,680
Now actually, just to go back real quick about my complaining about All-Stars, I mean seriously,

1216
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,840
this is Nintendo we're talking about here, so let's just step backwards with this game.

1217
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:23,440
Look at Smash Bros., once again, Smash Bros. Brawl, perfect example, that's how you treat

1218
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,080
a franchise as far as nostalgia purposes.

1219
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:30,920
They had demos for virtual console games on there for some of the old stuff.

1220
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:37,960
They had at the very least done that, you know, hey, guess what, you beat Mario, Super

1221
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:44,360
Mario Bros., and the remade version, you unlock the NES version or something like that.

1222
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,560
I don't understand, well I understand why they do it now, because they want people to

1223
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,680
buy it on the virtual console, but man, they were so much more giving on the GameCube than

1224
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,480
they were on the Wii.

1225
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,000
I mean, remember all those, like, oh hey, you can unlock the Game Boy version of, or

1226
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,720
you can unlock the Super Nintendo version of Metroid?

1227
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,320
Or freaking Animal Crossing, which was so badass, like that was the whole reason all

1228
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,160
of us bought it, was because you could unlock all the old NES games in it, and then it was

1229
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,720
like, hey, and the game itself is actually pretty sweet.

1230
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,000
Animal Crossing is seriously one of the best games that's come out in the past ten years.

1231
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,400
Honestly, it really is.

1232
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,120
And we're talking the original.

1233
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,120
Not any of the original.

1234
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Not any of the re-releases.

1235
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,840
But the original is one of my favorite games to have come out in the past ten years, easily.

1236
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:33,720
Another perfect example, I might add, of a game that Nintendo has done absolutely nothing

1237
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:39,320
with, nothing, absolutely nothing with, from game to game.

1238
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,920
How much really have they changed from each sequel?

1239
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,920
Nothing.

1240
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,440
It's basically the same damn game presented in a slightly different way.

1241
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,720
And I mean very slight.

1242
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,360
And most of the times, it's not a good way.

1243
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,200
I mean, come on, we're seriously, we're just encouraging this crap.

1244
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,040
So you got some Nintendo news to report for us, Loki?

1245
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,600
Yes, yes.

1246
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,600
Goodie.

1247
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:06,640
Anyways, so, we've got some interesting stuff, of course.

1248
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,840
This is all from Game Developers Conference, we're talking a little bit about the 3DS,

1249
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:16,740
and some neat stuff, I guess, but I mean, once again, you can't read too much into this

1250
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:23,920
because, I don't know, for example, the first part we have here, apparently the 3DS will

1251
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,880
have access to 10,000 AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots by late May.

1252
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,680
Why not at launch?

1253
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,680
I don't know.

1254
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
But whatever.

1255
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,680
Late May.

1256
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,520
So, that's neat that they're embracing- Is that like all the airports?

1257
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
I guess.

1258
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,760
It's gotta be like some restaurants have them.

1259
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,200
I don't know, where do you find AT&T Wi-Fi hotspots, I guess just miscellaneous restaurants

1260
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
and so forth.

1261
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,640
So, I know that when they're selling you on their internet and stuff there, but you get

1262
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,880
access to all these for free as well.

1263
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Big whoop.

1264
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,440
Is that how they're gonna deliver the patches without asking?

1265
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:00,120
If you take your 3DS out in public, it finds an AT&T Wi-Fi hotspot, all of a sudden, whoop,

1266
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,120
patch.

1267
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,120
They don't, no.

1268
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:07,640
They do, you have to agree to apply the patches, because I actually saw they had a patch for

1269
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:15,280
the 3DS in Japan, and there's a notification you get, hey, there's a patch, download it.

1270
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,840
So that's neat and all that, they're gonna have access to these Wi-Fi hotspots, but once

1271
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:27,160
again, unless they're doing a lot with it, I just don't see the point.

1272
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,460
It sounds good, but really, what's intended doing with their online stuff?

1273
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,960
It's kind of yet to be seen.

1274
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:40,200
It's their way of saying, we don't have 3GS, but you'll be able to get online in public

1275
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,560
at all these places.

1276
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,360
That's what it says to me.

1277
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:49,040
And then, of course, the 3DS Virtual Consoles basically getting all the portable platforms

1278
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:56,000
on top of, I believe, Game Boy and Game Boy Color, they're getting Game Gear, and Turbo

1279
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,040
Graphics 16 games, because it's funny, because, well, Turbo Graphics 16 played the actual

1280
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,680
console games on the handheld, so you're gonna be getting those games.

1281
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:08,240
Oh yeah, Jamie loves those games.

1282
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,240
Yeah, I've got one of those.

1283
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,240
Yeah.

1284
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,240
Turbo Express.

1285
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,240
Yeah.

1286
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,800
The whole NGP joke with the Neo Geo Pocket comes full, or no, I'm, nah, never mind, because

1287
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
Turbo Graphics.

1288
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,800
Not a Neo Geo.

1289
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Fail.

1290
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,800
But...

1291
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,920
But maybe in the future.

1292
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,920
Who knows?

1293
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,120
And I understand, it's coming late May.

1294
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,680
Why stop there?

1295
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:30,680
Why stop there?

1296
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,800
You have a Virtual Console, you have Virtual Console stuff already out there for, like,

1297
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,240
Nintendo, Super Nintendo stuff.

1298
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:42,080
Don't tell me this system can't play Nintendo games, or Genesis games, or Sega Master System,

1299
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,600
Sega Master System games.

1300
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,920
Once again, this could be an open marketplace, like the iOS platforms, or Steam, or something

1301
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,320
like that, where you can have a bunch of games on there, ripe for the picking, so people

1302
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:58,160
can go, oh my god, you know, I love playing the original Mario Brothers, or I love playing

1303
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:07,320
Mario Kart 64, or something like that, on my Wii, I wanna take it with me, oh damn,

1304
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:08,320
I have to buy it again.

1305
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,680
That's okay, because I love Nintendo, and I'll buy whatever they put out.

1306
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
Such a missed opportunity.

1307
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,960
They only have these portable games coming out for it.

1308
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,960
I mean, come on.

1309
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,360
It's so frustrating, that they could easily do this, but, nope, nope, sorry, we're not

1310
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,900
gonna do that right now, whoa, but we may announce it later on, and people will be so

1311
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:36,000
grateful that we've, you know, allowed them to repurchase our game again, ha ha ha.

1312
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,280
So yeah, that'll be coming out later on.

1313
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,300
I don't know, it's just, it's so frustrating, because they're just dumb.

1314
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,500
And yeah, late May, so if you buy your system, you know, when it comes out at launch, just

1315
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:58,120
know that you're not gonna actually have access to their little service to purchase virtual

1316
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,400
console games.

1317
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,200
Nice.

1318
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,300
And then also they're saying via the system update, you're gonna get some other online

1319
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:10,080
features that they were touting, the DSiWare service, of course, the ability to transfer

1320
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:16,080
DSiWare games from the DSi or DSi XL to your system, the web browser, and of course the

1321
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:22,200
eShop, which will include the whole virtual console stuff.

1322
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,940
So let me get this straight.

1323
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:30,480
Your console's not done, because that's what it sounds like to me, that you don't have

1324
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,120
one of the advertised features, web browser and all that stuff, at launch.

1325
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,840
So your console's not done.

1326
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,840
It's not ready.

1327
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,200
You're releasing it too early, is what it sounds like.

1328
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,000
And that might explain why you don't have enough games out for it, because you wanna

1329
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,680
push this thing out to pad your fiscal year numbers.

1330
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,680
Is that it?

1331
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:55,880
Because it's coming out the very end of the month, or the very end of their fiscal year?

1332
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,140
Interesting.

1333
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:01,840
And then of course, they're also so gracious to allow us to record video with the 3D camera,

1334
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,740
which I gotta admit is kinda cool, and it's definitely something that is popular.

1335
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:09,960
That is pretty cool.

1336
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,240
But once again, can I share these videos with my friends?

1337
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,280
Can I email you a 3D video they shot?

1338
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,040
Can I do anything with that?

1339
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,360
Once again, I don't know, because they haven't said, and great, I shot a 3D video of me doing

1340
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,960
something.

1341
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,680
If I can't share that with anybody, it doesn't matter.

1342
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:34,800
And I guess, I don't know if I could anyways, because with all their online stuff being

1343
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,320
disabled until May, I don't know.

1344
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,920
I'm curious about your thoughts on this comment in our chatroom at chat.orangishunterday.com.

1345
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,440
Akuma JP says, I think it's just Nintendo can't do so many stuff in that short time.

1346
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,040
Maybe they really have kind of rushed this thing out, and maybe they are kind of putting

1347
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:57,160
something out that they are still trying to develop as it goes.

1348
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,640
I definitely think it's that.

1349
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,280
And I think that they did the exact same thing with, well they did the exact same thing with

1350
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,720
the Wii, because they had a member of the web browser, I believe didn't come out right

1351
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,720
away.

1352
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:16,400
It got released later on, it wasn't too later on, I mean we are only talking like a month

1353
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:25,600
or two for this online shop thing, but it's just, if they had it ready to go at launch,

1354
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:32,520
they could be making so much, it's time wasted and money lost, because they could be selling

1355
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,520
a bunch of stuff.

1356
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,640
And the fact that they are just like, yeah you know, we are just not going to put virtual

1357
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,400
console games on there because, I don't know.

1358
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,780
I don't know why they are not putting virtual, like actual virtual console stuff that's on

1359
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,960
there for the Wii.

1360
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,680
Why don't they put Nintendo games or Super Nintendo games, they have all this stuff already

1361
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,040
done, it's already ready to go, and maybe they have to convert it over to something

1362
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,080
special or redo it for the 3DS maybe.

1363
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:07,120
But I mean come on, we are talking like emulators here, it can't be that difficult to port this

1364
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,120
stuff over.

1365
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,080
I mean come on, if the homebrew community can do it on the Game Boy Advance and the

1366
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:18,720
Nintendo DS, and this thing does support Nintendo DS games, it should be able to do this.

1367
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:25,120
It should have no problem doing this whatsoever, unless they are going to do something cool,

1368
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:31,640
because they said that, oh hey we are going to release, I don't know, some new games or

1369
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,800
games with 3D support or something like that.

1370
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,940
That may be the gimmick that they are going to do, hey look it's Super Mario Brothers

1371
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,720
in 3D or something.

1372
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,380
Why aren't they releasing Virtual Boy games for this?

1373
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:48,920
It makes perfect sense that they would have Virtual Boy games on the 3DS.

1374
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:53,800
They may have all sucked, but still though, there's a lot of games that they released

1375
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,800
on the Virtual Console that did suck, but still a lot of people haven't gotten a chance

1376
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,920
to play them because that console is out for such a short amount of time.

1377
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:13,400
And then lastly, apparently almost all DSiWare games will be available at the 3DS eShop launch,

1378
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,040
and then of course they have some limits as far as the transfers and stuff.

1379
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:23,880
It says, of course we've got Virtual Console games, anything that is rendered in 3D, converted

1380
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:31,400
into 3D is called a 3D Classic, so they are going to have some converted games I guess.

1381
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:38,160
And it said that, I guess downloadable games will be under the eShop banner.

1382
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:44,160
They're saying that pretty much the whole DSiWare lineup will be available at launch,

1383
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,600
there may be a few exceptions, but the majority of all the games will come over, a few games

1384
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:55,320
are being left off the 3DS's eShop for undisclosed reasons.

1385
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:02,520
So they're saying it's not the number of transferred games, it would be the same, they're saying

1386
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:11,720
that the transfer feature will be coming in late May, and it would be the same game, the

1387
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,280
number of times you can transfer it from device to device, so if you build up a large category

1388
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:22,200
of DSiWare games, you won't be penalized just how many times you can move it, move that

1389
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,760
same group of games, there will be a limit on it.

1390
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,360
So I guess they're not saying the amount of games, there's not going to be a limit on

1391
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,080
the amount of games you can move over, but how many times you can move it, so that's

1392
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:38,080
it.

1393
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:45,720
And if they were nice, which they're not, they would also allow you to do that same

1394
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:51,080
kind of transfer thing with the Wii and the Virtual Console stuff that you downloaded,

1395
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,240
whether or not.

1396
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:58,480
To be fair, I mean, Microsoft allows you to transfer it once a year, and I don't even

1397
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:03,100
know Sony's thing, Sony's pretty locked down, aren't they?

1398
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,320
You can transfer, actually you can transfer it quite a few times, because they have people

1399
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,320
sharing stuff.

1400
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,240
Oh yeah, that's right.

1401
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,240
And that's per game.

1402
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:20,000
I don't know, it's, whatever, you know, it is what it is.

1403
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,520
There's going to be a lot of disappointing stuff, I think, as far as how they support

1404
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,520
their online stuff.

1405
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,320
And you know what, it's unfortunately just, they could be making a lot more money than

1406
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,320
they are.

1407
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,840
If that's really what they're concerned about, and making people happy and stuff, they could

1408
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,920
do it really easy.

1409
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,400
They're just not.

1410
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:43,840
Alright, well, let's move on from all the 3DS talk.

1411
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,080
Although I am still excited about the 3D video, but I think you make a point, they gotta let

1412
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,080
you share it.

1413
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,280
But here's something that a lot of people are also very excited about.

1414
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,720
That feature alone makes the device worth a lot more than I think it is.

1415
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:58,680
And maybe that's why they're trying to rush it out, too, is because they want to get ahead

1416
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,360
of a lot of those cameras that are out there on the marketplace that are very expensive

1417
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,360
right now.

1418
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,840
You know, they're trying to maybe get the jump on that, I don't know.

1419
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,840
Cheap alternative, who knows.

1420
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,280
Anyhow, I want to mention this, because a lot of folks are excited about this.

1421
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:16,400
The game Catherine, which is coming out overseas, it is also coming out in the US, summer of

1422
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,400
2011.

1423
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,000
It is coming out this summer, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1424
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,280
There's a preview site already up.

1425
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,580
You can pre-order the game on Amazon.com.

1426
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,160
What makes this game so special?

1427
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,180
Well, it's a little bit dirty.

1428
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,980
It's more of one of those erotic thrillers.

1429
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,980
So a lot of folks were very excited about this in Japan, because, you know, it's a little

1430
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:39,280
bit naughty, and folks were planning on importing it.

1431
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,720
And now that it's coming out over here, a lot of people are like, what, this game's

1432
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,720
coming out over here?

1433
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:49,960
I don't think we know all the details exactly on what's sanitized yet, but give it time.

1434
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:53,920
I'm sure that's details they want to keep under wraps until a little close to the release

1435
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:54,920
date.

1436
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,520
But some folks are still very excited about the release of that game.

1437
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,200
All right, since that game is coming out in a couple months, let's talk about something

1438
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,480
that's coming out a long time ago.

1439
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,120
It's the classic game of the week.

1440
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:11,400
We like to take a trip down memory lane and talk about a classic video game that's been

1441
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:16,120
out for years and years, and it's something that maybe you should be checking out.

1442
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,680
Dark Soccer's going to step into the vault and find a game.

1443
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,760
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1444
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:26,520
Classic game of the week is Willow, and before people say, you've done Willow before!

1445
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,800
This is a different Willow.

1446
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,400
It is the side-scrolling arcade version of Willow.

1447
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,400
Yay!

1448
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:37,920
So not the NES arcade game, er, not the NES RPG game, many people remember, that you have

1449
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,920
done before.

1450
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:39,920
This is the arcade version.

1451
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,320
It was released by Capcom in the arcade, and it's freaking hard.

1452
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:53,640
So basically, this one's a platformer, and it has six stages where Willow gets to go

1453
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:59,440
kick some butt, and sometimes you can play Mad Mardigan, and you basically, it's its

1454
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,600
typical platformer, left or right to move, press the A button to use a weapon, you can

1455
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:10,280
hold it down and fire charged shots, you've got a magic power gauge, you have a B button

1456
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:16,880
to jump, and you can go up ledges and do all kinds of stuff, you can climb down them, and

1457
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:24,560
you can open chests, and you can get gold and buy items from the Owl Mage, and buy all

1458
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,040
kinds of stuff, including a life pack, and a 1-up, and information.

1459
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,240
But it's pretty hard.

1460
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:45,800
I love the music in it, though, can you play a little bit of that, Rob?

1461
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,760
Isn't that good?

1462
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:56,760
It's a really pretty game, too, and the only version that was out was the arcade one.

1463
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:02,160
It was a CPS1 game, um, pretty much you could fight a giant rat.

1464
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,440
That was pretty fun.

1465
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:15,200
Um, it is, uh, you know, unlike the NES version, which was an adventure RPG, and, uh...

1466
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,560
Which is weird, because Capcom did them both.

1467
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,560
Yeah.

1468
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,160
Well, I think that Capcom was notorious for bringing out different versions of games that

1469
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:28,280
were one thing in the arcade, but did them different for the NES.

1470
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:33,000
You know what this game looks a lot like is Magic Sword, actually, so I'm really surprised

1471
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,920
I've never played this before.

1472
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,560
Because there's a lot, like, just watching this, there's a lot in common with Magic Sword.

1473
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,560
This is very interesting to me.

1474
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:46,760
Well, it's just that whole side-scrolling thing, but, I mean, pretty much, I mean, it's

1475
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:47,760
really gorgeous.

1476
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:55,600
You've got all the story elements, you even have, like, the monsters from the, uh, uh...

1477
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:01,400
From the, uh, movie, and pretty cool cinematic, you know, area series, but it's just gorgeous

1478
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,080
artwork in it.

1479
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:08,360
And basically, like, in the first- Ah, scary-looking Val Kilmer, sorry.

1480
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,360
Yeah.

1481
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,360
Ah!

1482
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:19,560
Well, and his, uh, weapon is kinda like, uh, the cipher from Strider, but, uh, it can be

1483
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:25,440
charged up and increases range and potency, and basically, uh, you can also, uh, you can

1484
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,800
also get, uh, buy swords when you, you know, stop in the shop.

1485
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:36,720
And, uh, it's just really cool, although he's got, like, very pretty boy-looking features

1486
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,600
when he plays with him.

1487
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,600
Mad Marduken, that is.

1488
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,600
Very, very brown here.

1489
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:42,600
And Lilloo just looks adorable.

1490
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:50,120
But yeah, it's, it's a, it's a fun game, pretty tough, but lots of fun.

1491
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,120
Alright.

1492
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,800
There it is.

1493
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,400
The classic video game of the week for the arcades, not the NES.

1494
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,400
Willow.

1495
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,640
A very Magic Sword-esque kinda game, but with a bitchin' movie franchise behind it.

1496
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,320
Although I gotta admit, I always like the, uh, video game way better than I like the

1497
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
movie.

1498
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,320
That's just me.

1499
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,280
Alright, anyhow, we're gonna take a break, but don't go anywhere.

1500
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,400
There is plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come.

1501
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,240
When we come back for part B, we're gonna be talking about dev kits for the Kinect.

1502
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,920
Yes, it could be really happening.

1503
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,280
Super Tag's being freed up, and a classic, classic PC game making its way to the iOS

1504
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,280
system.

1505
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,360
So we're gonna talk all about that when we come back from a break here with more of Orange

1506
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:38,040
Lounge Radio.

1507
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,760
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1508
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:48,440
We are live on this Sunday, March the 6th of 2011 for the 404th episode of our podcast.

1509
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,440
We 404'd.

1510
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,440
That's right.

1511
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:55,040
We didn't make enough 404 jokes in the opening, but yes, it is episode 404 of our show.

1512
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,400
But we are here, and we're not missing anyone this week like we were last week.

1513
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,640
Maybe last week would have been a better 404, at least as far as Loki's concerned.

1514
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,640
But he's back.

1515
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,480
We're all back and talking about games.

1516
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,880
We're gonna get into some rapid-fire news in just a minute, but first, some plugs for

1517
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,660
some other shows that Dark Soccer and myself work on.

1518
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:13,160
If you like Orange Lounge Radio, you might just like these shows too.

1519
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:18,200
We have Comic Insanity, which goes live every Tuesday at Infamous.net.

1520
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,480
It's N-F-A-M-O-U-S dot net.

1521
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,520
We are awesome.

1522
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:29,320
It's me and Maron Marvel and Dan Shadow, and we're pretty geeky, pretty comicky, and we're

1523
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,840
pretty awesome.

1524
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,280
And Insanity.

1525
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,980
The Insanity is there too, yeah.

1526
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,280
And some Infamy along with it, and some other in stuff.

1527
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,280
Nice.

1528
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,620
And Rob.

1529
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,620
And the best little horde house in Azeroth is All Things World of Warcraft.

1530
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:51,360
It's not taped live anywhere right now, but we do put out a pretty fun podcast on Thursdays-ish

1531
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,760
and you can look that up online at the best little horde house in Azeroth in iTunes.

1532
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,400
Just search for horde house and it'll come right up or whatever your preferred finder

1533
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,400
of podcast is.

1534
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,720
There is a website coming very soon.

1535
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,560
I'm hoping next week we'll have more details on that.

1536
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,600
We have the early workings underway.

1537
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,600
Very exciting.

1538
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,920
And now an official guild for this show as well.

1539
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,100
So check that out.

1540
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,560
This week's show, by the way, was particularly off-color and explicit.

1541
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:20,160
So now's a great time to check it out at the best little horde house in Azeroth.

1542
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,480
Loki has a show called Raising a Baby.

1543
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,960
Well, it's not really a show.

1544
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,960
It's just what he does.

1545
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:29,200
I wouldn't have a show even if I didn't have a baby.

1546
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,680
Been there, tried that, don't think so.

1547
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,680
I know.

1548
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:36,600
And I've said it before, it's a crime how undervalued your mix show was because you

1549
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,600
were pretty good at it.

1550
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,000
But oh well, some things are just not meant to be.

1551
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,720
And took too damn long.

1552
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,340
What is meant to be, more gaming news and Twitter topics very soon on the Twitters.

1553
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:48,520
But first, some rapid news, Loki.

1554
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,480
Yes, of course we knew the Gears of War 3 beta was coming soon thanks to Bulletstorm.

1555
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:59,840
Bulletstorm players will actually get access to the Gears of War 3 beta April 18th.

1556
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:06,120
And then of course, if you don't have Bulletstorm, you can also get into the beta if you've preordered

1557
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,880
Gears of War 3 from Gamestop.

1558
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,080
Those players will be able to get in a week later on April 25th.

1559
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:20,480
And of course, multiplayer beta, they're seeing some of the beta unlockables you're gonna

1560
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,680
get as well in Gears of War 3.

1561
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:31,200
The beta tester medal, if you complete one match in the beta, you unlock the beta tester

1562
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:36,880
medal, which will be carried over to your gamer profile in the final game.

1563
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:44,960
Also you get the thrash ball coal, which is the fictional sport that's in Gears of War.

1564
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,000
And you get the variant skin for that.

1565
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,040
The gold plated retro lancer, possible if you complete a bunch of levels in that, 90

1566
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,040
matches.

1567
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,400
That's a lot of matches.

1568
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:06,760
The flaming hammer burst, if you complete one match by Sunday April 24th.

1569
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:11,800
Also the flaming lancer by one match during the week of April 25th.

1570
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:16,840
The flaming sawed off shotgun, one match during the week of May 2nd.

1571
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,840
And the flaming gnasher shotgun during the next week, May 9th.

1572
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,840
What isn't flaming?

1573
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,640
Not much.

1574
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,160
Not me.

1575
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,680
So that's coming soon, and check it out if you haven't yet.

1576
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:36,240
I am so excited to get my next issue of Game Informer.

1577
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,280
The cover game, of course, is Saints Row the 3rd.

1578
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,280
God, I love that game.

1579
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:47,440
Saints Row is seriously, you know, what Grand Theft Auto used to be as far as over the top

1580
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,960
and ridiculous.

1581
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:54,100
Not that I don't, you know, not that I dislike Grand Theft Auto 4 because I've made it over

1582
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,920
the top and ridiculous, but Saints Row is awesome.

1583
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:05,440
But that is coming out on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC this holiday, and the game looks

1584
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,440
awesome.

1585
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:11,120
Well, the cover or whatever that they have looks awesome.

1586
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:19,240
And apparently the game's gonna be taking place, I guess, in Stillwater still.

1587
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:27,160
Also I guess there's this gang called the Syndicate, a criminal organization, that has

1588
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,400
certain, you know, contacts in different parts of the world, and they're saying that it ultimately

1589
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:39,400
propels you into a new city that hosts the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.

1590
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:47,600
And they're saying, you know, judging by the cover here, nine-way free-fall gun battle

1591
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,960
from a plane.

1592
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:50,960
I can dig that.

1593
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,160
But yeah, the game, seriously Saints Row 2 is awesome, and hell, I mean, they have a

1594
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,960
double pack you can get for like 20 bucks nowadays.

1595
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,520
I mean, if you haven't played it, you should really do that.

1596
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,960
It's a fun game.

1597
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,200
But yeah, that's a day one purchase for me, right there.

1598
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:11,320
But unfortunately, you know, we do play Saints Row online, but online's not as fun.

1599
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,800
I do respect the fact that they have SystemLink.

1600
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,600
That came in handy when our internet is down at work, you know, for a while, or Live is

1601
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,320
down and we can play, you know, SystemLink games.

1602
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,480
I'm hoping, granted, that's out of five, or whatever it is, the next one has SystemLink

1603
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:29,960
as well, like Red Dead Redemption did, because seriously, that saves us a lot of time.

1604
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:30,960
Or Hasselhoff.

1605
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,960
Or Hasselhoff.

1606
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,960
Or Hasselhoff.

1607
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,960
Yes.

1608
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:40,280
And then finally, the Panasonic Jungle is not gonna be coming out.

1609
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:48,720
It was kind of an ambitious idea for a portable handheld MMO system, just...

1610
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,880
Oh, the MMO thing!

1611
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,880
Yeah.

1612
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,120
Nobody understood that anyway, so that's fine.

1613
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:58,720
It's just not feasible.

1614
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:03,360
Why don't they just say, nobody got it?

1615
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,880
It's not a thing that...

1616
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,000
It's not that nobody got it, I think, it's just, I don't know if we'd be able to run

1617
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,800
a lot of the popular MMOs, like, that wouldn't be able to run World of Warcraft, for sure.

1618
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,040
You know, they're saying, oh, it would have been able to, you know, use titles like Stellar

1619
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,640
Down, Battlestar Galactica, and RuneScape.

1620
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,200
It's really a Battlestar game.

1621
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,920
And Rift, it's all about Rift right now.

1622
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:29,560
Yeah, I mean, so, it just doesn't have enough oomph to be able to, you know, work.

1623
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,560
Alright.

1624
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:36,120
Can you imagine, though, if they ported World of Warcraft to, like, the iPad, the new iPad

1625
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,120
or something?

1626
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,760
It won't happen, but I'm just saying, something of that caliber to something like that, that'd

1627
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,760
be ridiculous.

1628
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,200
Well, they do have people just moving into their bathrooms.

1629
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,200
I know, they have that, like...

1630
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,960
There's some pretty complex MMOs that are on iOS.

1631
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,520
What's the one, Legends, or whatever it's called, Play Legends?

1632
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:55,400
It's pretty intense.

1633
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,400
I believe it's free.

1634
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,800
It's a freemium one, where if you want the Uber stuff, you gotta pay for it, you know?

1635
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,920
Kind of like Lords of the Ring Online, all that.

1636
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,920
Yeah.

1637
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,920
Alrighty.

1638
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,680
Moving on to some other rapid-fire news.

1639
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:09,960
This is a game I really liked on PSP, Half-Minute Hero.

1640
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,000
It's gonna be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, called Super Mega Neo Climax.

1641
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
That's right.

1642
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,400
Yeah, weird that they're kind of changing up the name, but yeah.

1643
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,200
I think that's supposed to be the Super Neo Mega Climax edition of Half-Minute Hero.

1644
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,960
Well, whatever.

1645
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,760
It's coming out, and I'm just bitter because I paid 30 bucks for this on the PSP, and it'll

1646
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,720
probably only be 10 on Xbox Live Arcade, but hey, it's a pretty neat concept, so it'll

1647
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,600
give a whole new audience a chance to check this out.

1648
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,120
Thank you, Australian Classification Board, for spoiling it, as you do many video game

1649
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,120
releases.

1650
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,120
Check that out.

1651
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,720
ModNation Racers has reached a milestone this week.

1652
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:49,040
Two million user-created items.

1653
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:53,360
Plenty more download content on the way, according to the PlayStation blog, including a parts

1654
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:58,480
pack that's already available on the PlayStation Store, more track packs to make new tracks,

1655
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:03,280
western and pirate-themed, more career DLC coming as well.

1656
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,240
The party is not stopping at ModNation Racers.

1657
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,160
Two million user-created items.

1658
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,160
Mario Kart Wii, zero.

1659
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,160
That's pretty crazy.

1660
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,160
Alright.

1661
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,160
PlayStation Home.

1662
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:14,400
Well, technically they do have user-created maps.

1663
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,400
Officially supported.

1664
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,400
No.

1665
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,400
Alright.

1666
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,880
PlayStation Home was announced that's upgraded to version 1.5, and some of the new features

1667
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,960
that are coming out in 1.5 of the home client.

1668
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,660
Games that run within Home, there's already kind of some of these, but they're trying

1669
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:35,920
to take it kind of up to the next step with low-lag, real-time multiplayer gaming, allowing

1670
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,240
more first-person shooters, racing games, and so forth.

1671
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:43,240
A demo was shown for sodium 2 project velocity that shows some of this.

1672
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,360
Hey, you gotta admit, sodium was one of the more interesting things that happened with

1673
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,360
Home.

1674
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,480
I realize it's stretching it, but it was interesting.

1675
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,360
That's just a sad, if that's, you know, what's the big thing about Home.

1676
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,880
Well, but they say now it looks like Wipeout HD, and to that I go, oh, now that's interesting,

1677
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,840
because Wipeout HD is kind of badass.

1678
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:04,320
So I, if that is true, that you're going to see more stuff like that in Home, okay, bring

1679
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,320
it on.

1680
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,320
It's free anyway.

1681
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,520
It's hard to complain about something free.

1682
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,520
Uh, yeah.

1683
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,480
Well, free for the first few levels, and then you got paid for it the rest of the time.

1684
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,480
That's true, that's true.

1685
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:19,040
Alright, uh, and I guess some more super smooth frame rates, better graphics engines, and

1686
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,040
so forth.

1687
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,640
Uh, still no word if clubhouses will actually be useful.

1688
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,640
Somehow doubt it.

1689
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,640
DarkSakura?

1690
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:33,560
Well, here's some news from a game developer's conference.

1691
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,560
Ninja Gaiden 3!

1692
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,480
Um, wait, didn't we already have a Ninja Gaiden 3?

1693
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,480
Wasn't it on NES?

1694
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,680
Yeah, but this time it doesn't involve Ancient Kingdoms, or whatever the subtitle was, the

1695
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,440
Ancient Warships, whatever it was.

1696
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:51,360
This one has a, uh, a bloody, uh, Ryu on it, so that should be really, really hot.

1697
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,400
I mean, really, really cool, yeah.

1698
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:01,120
And then, we have the Rock Band releases, which a friend of mine who is completely nuts

1699
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,360
over Depeche Mode is all happy with this.

1700
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:09,140
We have the Depeche Mode pack that has Never Let Me Down Again and Personal Jesus and Policy

1701
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:13,080
of Truth, and then I Will Possess Your Heart by Death Cab for Cutie, so.

1702
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:19,800
I wish they had more Exciter stuff in there, because that one was awesome.

1703
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,380
And last but never least, we have more news for Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1704
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:28,600
We have the dates for Jill Valentine and Shuma Garath.

1705
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:37,560
They will be, um, on March 15th for Xbox Live, 400 points and pop, and then, um, on March

1706
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,840
16th for the PS3.

1707
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,640
You gotta wait on PS3, ha ha ha ha.

1708
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:48,080
And you heard that right, for people that aren't familiar with Microsoft Space Dollars.

1709
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,520
Um, $5 a character.

1710
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,000
Thank you, Capcom.

1711
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,160
You suck.

1712
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,320
$5 a character.

1713
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,320
I don't think so.

1714
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,460
I'm gonna get Jill.

1715
01:34:57,460 --> 01:34:58,460
Pay to unlock content.

1716
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:01,060
It, yeah, it is pay to unlock content.

1717
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:03,060
It's on the disc already.

1718
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,060
Thank you, Capcom.

1719
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:06,320
You suck balls.

1720
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,640
You're just mad at everyone tonight.

1721
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:08,640
No, seriously.

1722
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:09,640
I mean, come on.

1723
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:10,640
That is ridiculous.

1724
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,640
Oh, I put it on there.

1725
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,640
Oh, but we're dicks, so I'm sorry.

1726
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,040
You need to say something nice about a video game company to balance all this hatred coming

1727
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,440
out of you tonight.

1728
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:24,160
Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is an awesome game, but they're dicks for charging $5 a character.

1729
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,160
I'm sorry.

1730
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:26,160
It's stupid.

1731
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:32,600
I mean, characters should be, like, $2 at the most, and especially stuff that's not

1732
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,600
on the disc.

1733
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,360
This stuff is already on the disc.

1734
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,680
They're just being dicks.

1735
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:40,800
They didn't even spend the time to, like, apparently polish it up.

1736
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,560
There's no actual storylines or whatever for them.

1737
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,640
They didn't do any cutscenes for them.

1738
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,880
They're just assholes.

1739
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:47,880
That's all they are.

1740
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,160
And if you buy them, you're supporting assholes, okay?

1741
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,160
So just keep that in mind.

1742
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:57,640
SSG100 Matt in our chatroom says, Deadpool better make Jill sandwich jokes.

1743
01:35:57,640 --> 01:35:58,640
Seriously.

1744
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,280
That's a good point.

1745
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,280
Do you think Deadpool should make a Jill sandwich joke?

1746
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,560
No doubt he probably would, if silently.

1747
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,120
Now, does he ever do anything silently?

1748
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,120
No.

1749
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:13,040
Alright, let's get to the Twitter and read some of the topics that you guys sent to us

1750
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,040
tonight.

1751
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,800
Twitter.com slash OLR is the place you can send us tweets, and we read them live.

1752
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,640
Not all of them, though, but most of them.

1753
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,320
Spazinator PSN sends us an FYI about the PSN video store.

1754
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:34,160
There's currently a free anime pilot, Hikaru no Go, and a movie rental, Stranger Than Fiction,

1755
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,360
on the PSN video store.

1756
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,600
Yeah, I heard PSN was giving away more movies.

1757
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:42,080
Not that these are all movies people are lining up to see, but hey, it's free.

1758
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,360
Stranger Than Fiction wasn't terrible.

1759
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,720
Yeah, if you like free stuff, why not?

1760
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,160
There you go.

1761
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,080
SilverSonic1534 is sending us a tweet.

1762
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,280
Did you see this video?

1763
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,620
It shows some of Super Mario 3DS screenshots.

1764
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:59,180
It looks to be a game like Super Mario Bros. 3, and then follows that up with a correction.

1765
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,040
It's not looking like Super Mario Bros. 3, but apparently it's going to have some of

1766
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:09,400
the powers that were on Super Mario Bros. 3 on the game, and they sent us a Twitter

1767
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:19,480
link to an IGN video that I guess is kind of showing, I don't want to watch all these

1768
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,480
talking heads.

1769
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,720
All they did was show the stupid.

1770
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:25,080
It looks like they're comparing it to Mario Galaxy, and I heard about how the raccoon

1771
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,480
tail was visible in the little logo that they teased.

1772
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:33,120
Yeah, and they're kind of showing this a little bit in the video, so.

1773
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:37,720
Well I'm sure, you know, people, one thing they do love about Mario is all these little

1774
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:41,880
like powers like the raccoon and please the Tanooki suit, that would be amazing if they

1775
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:42,880
brought that back.

1776
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,840
You know, that's kind of one of the things that made Mario Galaxy fun.

1777
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,280
The bee suit was awesome.

1778
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,520
I'm sure some of that stuff, it's all going to be, anything that tickles your retro bone

1779
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,060
and gets you to drop 40, 50 bucks on the games.

1780
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:59,360
And by the way, all of that information that was from IGN right there was all speculation

1781
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,320
because all they showed was the stupid logo.

1782
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:05,040
They're like, oh it's going to be Mario 3, let's speculate on what it's going to look

1783
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,040
like.

1784
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:10,160
I don't think it, of course, it's going to look like there's successful Mario games,

1785
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:13,400
but 3D, I mean it's not that hard to figure out I don't think.

1786
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,400
Am I crazy?

1787
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,400
I don't know.

1788
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:20,200
Alright, going to actdeft who sends us a little twit pic, and it's a collection of little

1789
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,920
pokey dolls.

1790
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,960
He showed us his pokeymans live on air.

1791
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,840
But the question that goes with this, do you collect video game paraphernalia or have a

1792
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,560
collection besides the vault?

1793
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,560
So I guess this is.

1794
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,240
Well we put it all in the vault.

1795
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:39,040
I guess this might be more of a question for Loki and myself, IDK.

1796
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,520
You guys go ahead and answer that because it's a stupid question.

1797
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,160
To be honest, hey now there's no such thing as a stupid question.

1798
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,640
I said for me.

1799
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:48,000
Oh for you.

1800
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,280
For me, I got to be honest, not really.

1801
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:54,680
For a while I seemed like I had an Xbox Live Arcade collection going on because I was downloading

1802
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,680
everything.

1803
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,760
But I don't really collect.

1804
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,280
I don't buy games just because they're rare.

1805
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:03,640
I don't really have a lot of autograph things or collectibles.

1806
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:06,520
I rarely, if ever, buy limited editions.

1807
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:11,320
I think the last limited edition I remember buying was that Final Fantasy XII at GameStop

1808
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,240
that had the extra little frills.

1809
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,060
I mean it's got to be a really big game.

1810
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:19,360
I don't even buy Collector's Edition of Warcraft exception.

1811
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:24,000
I did buy Collector's Editions of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King but it

1812
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
was at a charity event.

1813
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It was at the first Doom Loud.

1814
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I did buy those.

1815
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,020
So that's for different reasons.

1816
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:32,240
And I ended up giving away the Burning Crusade one to my friend for Christmas.

1817
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,800
So different thing.

1818
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,200
Loki, you a collector?

1819
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:39,760
I am not a collector of anything but I have like, you know, I get tchotchkes sometimes

1820
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:43,400
so I have a bunch of stuff at my desk at work.

1821
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:50,520
I've got like, well I used to collect Gundam models but then I bought pretty much all of

1822
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,520
them.

1823
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:56,520
And then, that's still fun every now and then.

1824
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:03,600
I do have for the last Samurai Warriors game I think, Samurai Warriors 3, they have these

1825
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,600
little mini figurines.

1826
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,000
I have almost the whole collection of those because we got a bunch of boxes of them and

1827
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,440
so I opened all of them to try to create a whole collection.

1828
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,000
A missy one though, I think.

1829
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Here's the other thing I should say about why I don't collect.

1830
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,280
I got hoarding tendencies as it is.

1831
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,680
If I really was a rabid collector it would be really bad, you guys.

1832
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,140
So I can't.

1833
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,840
I can't get rid of the stuff I have.

1834
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:31,520
I have my Japanese copy of Smash Bros. at my desk sitting there since I don't need the

1835
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,800
Japanese version anymore, the real version.

1836
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,280
And what else did I have that's really weird?

1837
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:45,040
I have a poster for the Atari Pac-Man.

1838
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,280
I want it for a penny on eBay.

1839
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,340
But nothing to the scale of Dark Sakura's Vault.

1840
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:55,240
That is a whole little special level all on its own.

1841
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,600
Some of our stuff that we've gotten that we've really looked into, it's just sort of like,

1842
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,720
it'll be there and we'll see it and it's cool.

1843
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:08,400
We've gotten all kinds of neat collector stuff through Dan getting some swag from the local

1844
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,000
reps and going to conventions and things.

1845
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,920
I still think the coolest, one of the coolest things we got was the Goemon doll.

1846
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:26,480
Because we bought our Twilight Zone pinball game from the guy who owned Working Designs.

1847
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,800
And he just gave one to Dan.

1848
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800
So that was pretty cool.

1849
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:39,840
One of my favorite things in there is I have a little Pac-Man doll from 1982 that has the

1850
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:40,840
ghost in his mouth.

1851
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:46,960
I'll take a picture of it and put it up, but that's one of my favorite things in the vault.

1852
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,200
They've just got stuff everywhere.

1853
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:59,120
Even in here we've got all these Guitar Hero face plates that Dan got for cheap slash free

1854
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:02,640
on the wall and just stuff we've looked into.

1855
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,200
I mean, sometimes this stuff just falls in our lap.

1856
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:10,200
It's not like we're trying to collect it on purpose.

1857
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,640
And then Dan says from the other room, and some of it we spent stupid money on.

1858
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,840
Alright, well let's move on.

1859
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:20,520
A couple tweets coming to us from Tigerclaw.

1860
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:27,360
Tigerclaw linking us to this story, I guess a quote from Cliffy B, Cliff Blazinski, Mary

1861
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,120
Gamers, don't date them.

1862
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:34,560
I'm going to read verbatim this article from Joystick with a Q, a proper credit to them

1863
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,520
because I was tweeted this story and didn't have a chance to skim things in advance for

1864
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,240
the relevant stuff.

1865
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:44,880
In a candid talk during the Game Developers Conference on Thursday, Epic Games Design

1866
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:50,200
Director Cliff Blazinski advised attendees to have an educated gut and to be cognizant

1867
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:53,220
of the value of marketing and long-term relationships with customers.

1868
01:42:53,220 --> 01:42:57,960
He encapsulated his talk in the Power Creative, a project member who is unique, valuable and

1869
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,940
visibly tied to the game's identity.

1870
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:00,940
This could be anyone.

1871
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,940
I see.

1872
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:06,080
So it's more like he's not saying that in the literal sense, like Mary Gamers, he's

1873
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:12,200
saying kind of, you know, be educated as to the long-term relationships you build with

1874
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,200
the gamers.

1875
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,640
Let me read another paragraph from the article here.

1876
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:20,560
With consumers constantly immersed in an information feed via social networking platforms like

1877
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,720
Twitter and Facebook, it's important for game designers to be surgical and devious in creating

1878
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:29,720
IPs that thrive in an always on heavily branded world.

1879
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:34,900
According to Blazinski, the market only tolerates games that land on the far end of the spectrum

1880
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:38,480
between freemium snack games and big budget games like Gears of War.

1881
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,040
I believe the middle class game is dead.

1882
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,640
The Power Creative understands how to engage fans over a long period of time.

1883
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,560
Make gamers marry your game, not just date it.

1884
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,240
Again, if you want to read the rest of that story, it's on joystickwithacue.com as tweeted

1885
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,080
to us tonight.

1886
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,080
Hmm.

1887
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:59,120
Do game developers, some of them need to work on the relationship with the fan and that

1888
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:04,360
whole idea of marry your audience and don't just take them out on one night stands?

1889
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,000
Or do you think that that whole little comparison is way out of...

1890
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,520
You need to satisfy your market.

1891
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,000
If you don't satisfy them, they'll leave.

1892
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,480
All right.

1893
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:21,040
They'll leave you for other developers who love them longer and harder.

1894
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,040
You know, I got to say this.

1895
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,960
Some people do get very passionate about certain development houses, you know, especially the

1896
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:26,120
ones that seem to treat them well.

1897
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:31,360
I mean, especially in light of everything that Loki had said a minute ago about Capcom,

1898
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,960
for the most part, they touch into their fan base pretty well.

1899
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:38,440
They have a lot of fans through their blogs and the things that they do online.

1900
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:42,320
You know, they really do seem to give the fans what they want despite some of these

1901
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,560
oversights and things, except Mega Man Universe.

1902
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:45,560
Whatever happened to that?

1903
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,560
Hello?

1904
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,560
What happened to Mega Man Universe?

1905
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:48,560
Where'd it go?

1906
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,560
Anybody seen it?

1907
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,560
Anyhow.

1908
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:56,800
Another tweet to us from Tiger Claw, a link to a story on Kotaku about the Social Game

1909
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,200
Developers Rant.

1910
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,560
Ah, now I did hear about this.

1911
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:04,640
Apparently, there was a panel at Game Developers Conference where a bunch of the folks that

1912
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:09,040
develop for these social game companies like Zynga and Playdom and all this, they basically

1913
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,800
got up and said, hey, you know what, stop picking on us.

1914
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,200
Screw you.

1915
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,200
We're not that bad.

1916
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,920
And it was just this whole panel.

1917
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,360
Kind of sounds like straight out of like a really bad panel at an anime convention or

1918
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:24,320
something where it's just dudes up on a stage ranting about shit they don't like.

1919
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,600
It's kind of like what they did here, but it was about like social network and why do

1920
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,880
people always pick on us type of thing.

1921
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:32,880
Interesting.

1922
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,440
So they also did a little mini game where the developers were encouraged, I'm sorry,

1923
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:40,880
the people attending the panels were encouraged to collect coins and whoever could get the

1924
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,080
most coins got to do a rant of their own, which is kind of funny because that's kind

1925
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,440
of like how a social game would actually work.

1926
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,440
So ha.

1927
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,960
So there you go.

1928
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:53,960
Is that it for tweets?

1929
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,960
Oh no, one last tweet from Blue Swim.

1930
01:45:55,960 --> 01:46:00,760
Orange Lounge Foodio question, which is better, Cadbury Creme Eggs or Marshmallow Peeps?

1931
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,960
Also welcome back, Loki.

1932
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:06,240
Cadbury Creme Eggs since marshmallows are disgusting.

1933
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,240
I actually disagree.

1934
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:11,240
I prefer Marshmallow Peeps because they can joust in the microwave and Cadbury Creme Eggs

1935
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,240
are too much.

1936
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:15,160
Like, if I'm going to eat a Cadbury Creme Egg, it needs to be one of those little mini

1937
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,160
ones.

1938
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,840
I can't, the big ones are too much, too rich.

1939
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:18,840
You know what's fantastic?

1940
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:22,600
It's going to Touch of Britain and getting the Mars eggs.

1941
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,040
Those are fantastic.

1942
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,040
Orange Creme Eggs.

1943
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,400
I still kind of prefer Marshmallow Peeps personally.

1944
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,320
I don't know.

1945
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,600
I'm not a big fan of either one.

1946
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,320
Creme Eggs, I guess.

1947
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,320
Alright.

1948
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,320
That's it for tweets.

1949
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,360
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1950
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:44,360
In the meantime, let's get back into some other video game news before we get to the

1951
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,920
mailbag, the FUs, and of course your phone calls.

1952
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:50,140
Alright.

1953
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:56,680
So this is kind of neat and kind of along the lines of stuff that they were pimping

1954
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,680
out before.

1955
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:04,240
Of course, the Kinect, there is supposed to be a dev kit coming officially for Microsoft,

1956
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:10,760
but until then, there's going to be another dev kit coming out from a different company.

1957
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:16,360
The dev kit is called ISU, or I guess the software platform, ISU which stands for the

1958
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:23,600
interface is you, and of course it's Soft Connect's 3D gesture recognition software

1959
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:29,440
development kit, now available for qualified developers, and they can license it for free.

1960
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:37,360
It says they'll work with all 3D depth sensing devices, which includes support for the Kinect,

1961
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:45,040
and I guess it's a strictly non-commercial software development kit, and commercial version

1962
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:50,440
of course can be purchased from them as well, but that's kind of neat, and it says there's

1963
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:54,840
going to be different ones actually coming out from Evaloos, PrimeSense, and of course

1964
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:55,840
Microsoft.

1965
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:01,360
So neat to see that there's going to be some, I'm actually, I'd be kind of curious to see

1966
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,040
what the first like real retail game that comes out that supports Kinect, that'd be

1967
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:07,040
kind of neat.

1968
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:13,000
And then of course, not to be outdone by that, PlayStation, the PlayStation Move I should

1969
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:20,880
say, they actually have some tools as well to be able to program stuff that supports

1970
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:26,400
the PlayStation, iCamera, and the Move controllers.

1971
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:31,520
It's called MoveMe, and it's a software tool that's going to be using the PlayStation Move

1972
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:37,520
technology to create unique applications, and of course it's coming soon.

1973
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,800
They're saying that MoveMe is going to be a downloadable application for the PS3 that

1974
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:48,440
allows researchers, students, hobbyists, developers, or anyone the ability to develop for the PlayStation

1975
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:53,440
Move, and they said they want to see what innovative applications programs can create

1976
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,240
using the PlayStation Move controller, the PS3 system, and the PlayStation iCamera, and

1977
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,620
the PC.

1978
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:05,560
So apparently it's going to be available on the PlayStation Network this spring, but people

1979
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:09,240
that are interested will be able to apply for it as well.

1980
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:18,520
You can go to, I believe, usplaystation.com slash ps3 slash playstation dash move slash

1981
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,200
move dash me, and check that out.

1982
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,200
That's kind of neat.

1983
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:23,980
What do you think will ultimately come of this?

1984
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,400
Maybe some applications or whatever.

1985
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:31,760
I think there's a lot of stuff that they could do with the PlayStation that they're not.

1986
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,800
I mean, remember like a long time ago, they were showing some of the stuff, even what

1987
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,240
they could do with the PlayStation iCamera.

1988
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,240
Like they're all, hey look, we made a combat game.

1989
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:43,000
It was the developers for the PlayStation i stuff.

1990
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,280
They're showing, hey look, we can make a combat game where you draw, you know, your tanks

1991
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,280
that you use and you can scan them in and play a game with it.

1992
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:56,320
They did all those cool tech demos, but never released them.

1993
01:49:56,320 --> 01:50:00,780
It's like, you know, you could have done something cool with that, but no.

1994
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:04,360
Do you see more like bite-sized applications coming maybe to the PlayStation Network?

1995
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,360
They should.

1996
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:10,560
That was the whole point with like even on the PSP, how they have the PlayStation Network

1997
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:13,160
on the PSP and they have the PSP minis and stuff.

1998
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:16,160
It was supposed to be more of like those bite-sized applications.

1999
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:23,240
I'm hoping that, you know, they kind of look at the next PlayStation Portable as, hey,

2000
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:27,520
you know what, we're going to try to make this thing more like a smartphone or something

2001
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:32,280
where we're going to have not only the applications that are going to be games, but we're also

2002
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:37,760
going to have, you know, like a Twitter program or, you know, a Facebook program or, you know,

2003
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:43,760
a bunch of other stuff that people can develop like, you know, just non-gaming applications

2004
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,760
for.

2005
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:45,760
And I think that's smart.

2006
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:52,200
And I think that should really be on all portable systems that are coming out, Nintendo.

2007
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,400
It just, it makes sense.

2008
01:50:53,400 --> 01:51:00,720
It's just what, you know, that kind of industry's popular for now is applications.

2009
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,440
People love their applications.

2010
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,440
Alright.

2011
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:08,440
Well, on a completely different kind of topic, we're going to talk about kind of a cleanup

2012
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,640
that's going on on Xbox Live right now.

2013
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:14,760
No, they're not cleaning out games or anything, but they are cleaning out gamertags.

2014
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,560
You know, Xbox Live has been around quite a while.

2015
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,600
It's been around, what, since about, uh, 02 was when it launched, right?

2016
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,600
So it's been around, well, about as long as Orange Launch Radio has.

2017
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:25,480
And amongst that time, they have collected a lot of gamertags that really just didn't

2018
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:30,240
end up getting used because people changed them or, what, they made them on the old Xbox

2019
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:33,000
and never really migrated them or what have you.

2020
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,680
So Major Nelson made an announcement, uh, this week that they have begun the process

2021
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:41,760
of making previously used and unavailable Xbox Live gamertags available.

2022
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,760
They're not saying what meets the qualifications for dead.

2023
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:52,680
I am assuming that ones that were used on the old Xbox, because old Xbox Live is gone,

2024
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:56,320
that never migrated to a 360 account, I'm assuming that's what qualifies, but it's a

2025
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,320
huge assumption.

2026
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:01,840
Um, I think part of what definitely falls into this, people that changed their name,

2027
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,560
their old name would still be unavailable, so I think a lot of that is kind of getting

2028
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,840
moved permanently.

2029
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:11,600
So, uh, the, also it's stressed on here, uh, the process will take time to complete.

2030
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,360
They will, will not be able to tell you when a gamertag that you want is available.

2031
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,240
You should always check back regularly because they are reviving gamertags daily.

2032
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:23,440
You can go into the Xbox channel and change gamertag to see if the gamertag you want is

2033
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,440
available.

2034
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:28,400
I tried to get Major Nelson, but it was taken.

2035
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,400
So there you go.

2036
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:33,160
I did notice though, one name I would be interested in changing to was available.

2037
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,680
So uh, who knows?

2038
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:41,000
I'm not sure how I feel about $10 just to change my gamertag, but you never know, we'll

2039
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
see.

2040
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Anything's possible.

2041
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,840
Would anyone, would anyone try to change their name to something else?

2042
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:50,160
Loki, you should see if maybe Loki without the OLR is available.

2043
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:52,160
It's not, I'm sure it's not.

2044
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,960
Well, and even still, it's, it's fine.

2045
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:55,960
I'll leave it as is.

2046
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:56,960
Yeah.

2047
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:57,960
I'm happy with mine.

2048
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:00,720
I don't really play that much because it sort of kills me.

2049
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:01,720
Yeah.

2050
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,400
Makes my hands hurt, which, uh, nevermind.

2051
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:10,840
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some more stories, Darth Zira.

2052
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,800
Well today's other story is Metal Cthulhu.

2053
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,120
No, I'm just kidding.

2054
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,800
Um, Another World.

2055
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:16,800
You remember this game?

2056
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,800
It came out in the nineties.

2057
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,800
Oh my God.

2058
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,800
I do remember that game.

2059
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:23,320
It was, it was epic when it came out.

2060
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:27,120
Well, it's, it actually first came out in 1991.

2061
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:31,240
It was a cinematic sci-fi side-scroller, and it's going to be brought up to date to come

2062
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:33,680
out for iPhone and iPad.

2063
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:42,400
It's being ported by Dotemu, so, uh, it, they haven't said anything about new features,

2064
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:46,440
but they're saying that they want it to be the best experience on iOS.

2065
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:51,120
Sorry, I'm looking at a video on YouTube of this game being played, actually, so I can

2066
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:54,040
kind of re- take, take me back a little bit, let me skip ahead, this is somebody playing

2067
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,040
it on an Amiga.

2068
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,040
Sorry.

2069
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:04,800
Well, it, it really is a pretty game, I mean, it's, it was great, and this is, uh, supposed

2070
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:08,620
to be just a big, uh, a big ol' update.

2071
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:15,360
And they're also working on, um, an Ubisoft, uh, game called From Dust that's gonna be

2072
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:19,160
out on PC, and PSN, and Xbox Live Arcade.

2073
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,160
Nice.

2074
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:22,220
But, dude, another world.

2075
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:27,640
This game was kind of like, um, a souped-up version of, uh, Prince of Persia, but, like,

2076
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:33,920
I, that's really, it's like Prince of Persia in space, but with epic cutscenes involved,

2077
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,920
I don't know.

2078
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:39,200
Kind of a little flashback, too, what that came out after.

2079
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,200
Yeah.

2080
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,200
Running away from a killer bear.

2081
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:43,440
Yeah, this game was so epic when it came out.

2082
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,960
Wasn't, like, Out of This World or something like that.

2083
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,800
Um, it was called, uh, oh, in the States.

2084
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,320
Yeah, in the US it was called Out of This World.

2085
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:56,600
Another world was the UK release.

2086
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,640
Yet I still know it by that name.

2087
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,640
Yeah.

2088
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,640
Anyhow.

2089
01:55:00,640 --> 01:55:01,640
Very cool.

2090
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:06,960
Uh, Salacious Pop in our chatroom says, that game is fucking amazing, but it's hard as

2091
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:07,960
fuck.

2092
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:11,280
I have no idea how you can play it without tactical, tactile controls.

2093
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,760
And I got the HD version they put out, like, four years ago.

2094
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,920
I didn't realize they'd done a remake already.

2095
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:17,380
And damn good point.

2096
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:20,680
It's cool that they're putting it out again in nostalgia and all that on the iOS, but

2097
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:25,980
again, no joystick means hard game is very, very hard.

2098
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:28,480
So I don't know.

2099
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:29,480
We'll see.

2100
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:32,920
Um, anyhow, uh, let's move on with a few more stories.

2101
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:36,400
The mailbag is coming up as well as the Skype line.

2102
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:41,680
Um, so they've got, uh, some cool stuff coming to OnLive.

2103
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:46,680
Um, some of the things that they announced at Game Developers Conference, uh, that they're

2104
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:51,840
gonna be offering to developers that want to put their games on to the platform.

2105
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:57,760
They're saying, uh, voice chat, game invite for multiplayer games, uh, the ability to

2106
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:03,880
directly upload brag clips to YouTube, and then also achievements, um, which they're

2107
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:08,800
guessing is gonna be stuff derived from console versions, um, but, you know, hey, if they

2108
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,520
want to put up an old retro game or something like that and add achievements to it, they

2109
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:13,520
can.

2110
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,720
And then, um, also they're gonna allow, uh, developers to let their games support wireless

2111
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:25,200
controllers when played on mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, um, or Android powered,

2112
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:30,760
um, phones or tablets.

2113
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:35,400
Basically they need some controllers for some of those devices.

2114
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:38,600
Kind of interesting though how this thing is like kind of turning into a gaming console

2115
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:42,600
like in reverse, like the way it kind of all mapped out and like now they have the, you

2116
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,880
know, the streaming thing and now they're talking about voice chat.

2117
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:50,640
But the lineup of games, if I'm not mistaken, is still relatively weak for this console,

2118
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:51,640
right?

2119
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:54,780
I mean, there's a few good ones in there, but it's not like you have the gigantic array

2120
01:56:54,780 --> 01:56:58,200
of games like it's available on most gaming consoles.

2121
01:56:58,200 --> 01:56:59,200
That's true.

2122
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:02,400
I mean, it didn't launch that long ago, it was like a few months ago.

2123
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,400
True.

2124
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,360
So, I don't know, they're doing alright, I think.

2125
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:10,200
I think they're making progress and it's definitely been, you know, it works, so.

2126
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,400
I think it's worked a lot better than anybody thought it would.

2127
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:16,880
I think a lot of people wrote this thing off when it first came out, or before it came

2128
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:17,880
out really.

2129
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:18,880
So.

2130
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:19,880
Hmm.

2131
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:21,580
Well, we'll see what continues with that.

2132
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:23,560
It's neat that they're still going with it.

2133
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:27,380
That type of device though, um, you know how they have the micro console and stuff like

2134
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:33,760
that, if they can do MMOs on that, that's how you would get a device like the Jungle,

2135
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:39,060
where it would basically be something that runs on a server, you know, at some company

2136
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:43,600
or whatever, like World of Warcraft or something like that, and you have your controls on there,

2137
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:48,020
it's very limited, but you don't need to have the powerhouse of like, you know, a tablet

2138
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:53,960
or whatever in this device, because all it's doing is streaming stuff over wifi.

2139
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:59,360
Although I don't know if you can do that over wifi very well, it would be pretty slow.

2140
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:05,760
But um, you know, once, once our internet catches up to the speeds that there are in

2141
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:10,340
other countries, you know, it might be a little bit different, you know, 5G, 6G, whatever

2142
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:17,280
the next, you know, speed increase that we're going to see here, stupid 4G, but yeah, once

2143
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,840
it gets up to that, then you'll see stuff like that happening.

2144
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:23,640
Alright, well, let's move on to another quick story before we get to the mailbag, and this

2145
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,480
is about the game DJ Max.

2146
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:28,980
It's a music game, of course on the PSP, has a very cult-like following, of course a lot

2147
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:34,060
of the folks that followed BeatMania 2DX and DDR back in the day still follow this series.

2148
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:38,240
It's filled with a lot of Korean music, K-pop and so forth, and the music's pretty popular

2149
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:42,480
amongst the crowd, but usually there's not a real legitimate, anyway, way to get the

2150
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,180
music outside of Korea.

2151
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:45,180
Well guess what?

2152
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:49,860
Starting in March, it was announced, Pentavision has announced that the soundtracks for DJ

2153
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:53,020
Max are going to be published on iTunes.

2154
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:58,000
Three albums followed by a new album every week, I guess until they get caught up, because

2155
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,360
that's a lot of albums, but there have been quite a few DJ Max games at this point, so

2156
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:08,080
fans of that series are going to be very happy that they get their nice CD-quality sound

2157
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,080
out of iTunes.

2158
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:12,480
That'll be pretty cool, if they didn't already get it through other means from the Korean

2159
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:13,480
albums.

2160
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:14,480
That's pretty cool.

2161
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,960
You know iTunes has been doing a lot of different Japanese pop artists, like the really big

2162
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:21,280
names like Ayumi and Gokt and...

2163
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:24,440
Yeah, I bought an Ayumi song on there not that long ago, it's kind of funny.

2164
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:27,320
I got a Lark and Seal album, like a while back.

2165
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,160
They also do a lot of video game soundtracks.

2166
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:34,340
It's interesting to me that they don't have a gaming section in their store.

2167
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,340
Maybe I missed it.

2168
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:39,120
I think there is a soundtracks section, so maybe it's buried in there and I've just missed

2169
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:43,880
it, but there's more and more gaming soundtracks on there, like the Pac-Man Championship Edition,

2170
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:46,160
the Deluxe that has the awesome techno music.

2171
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:50,900
That soundtrack's on there, you can get that, and there's, you know, pretty much every Final

2172
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:52,660
Fantasy soundtrack's on there now.

2173
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:56,760
You know, in some of the newer games, DDR has soundtracks on there now, so a lot of

2174
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,320
games have been showing up.

2175
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:01,260
Warcraft has a soundtrack there too.

2176
02:00:01,260 --> 02:00:05,040
Lots of games starting to get showing up on iTunes, so it's kind of neat.

2177
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,040
Yeah.

2178
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,080
Especially for those that like the music in their games, I wish there's a lot of really

2179
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:14,040
good stuff that the mass market doesn't often get to hear, so that's pretty cool.

2180
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:18,080
So maybe it will expose more fans to DJ Max.

2181
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:20,320
I guess that's the ultimate goal for this.

2182
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,320
We'll see.

2183
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:22,320
Might be.

2184
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,320
Might be.

2185
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:25,520
Before we get to the mailbag here in a minute, I wanted to back up a minute, because we were

2186
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,320
talking about Out of This World or Another World.

2187
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:32,000
Do you think there's any other PC games that ought to be coming out for iOS that maybe

2188
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
they've missed?

2189
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,320
Because that's definitely a classic.

2190
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:35,320
Loom.

2191
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,320
Loom.

2192
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,320
Loom.

2193
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,320
Didn't they, they did something.

2194
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:39,320
I guess it was a hack.

2195
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:40,320
Loom's on Steam.

2196
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,320
It was like a hack.

2197
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,320
Oh yeah, it's on Steam.

2198
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:43,320
I want to say there was like a hack for the iOS or something.

2199
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,320
Of course.

2200
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,320
You know I got Loom on Steam.

2201
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:47,400
Somebody wants to hack the old LucasArts stuff for that.

2202
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:50,720
You know, I actually have a copy of Loom for PC.

2203
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,080
I bought it on eBay.

2204
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,080
Nice.

2205
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,080
Because I love that game.

2206
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,080
It's pretty nice.

2207
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:58,880
I hardly remember how to play it, because of all the chords and stuff, and I've remembered

2208
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,280
some of the chords and I do them way too early, but Loom would be fun one.

2209
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:04,280
Scorched Earth.

2210
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:05,280
Yes!

2211
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:09,120
Oh man, it's been years since I've played Scorched Earth, absolutely.

2212
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:11,720
What about Phantasmagoria?

2213
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:14,160
That's not outside the realm of possibility.

2214
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:17,920
There was a news on that not that long ago.

2215
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:22,160
I know they brought out the seventh guest, which I know it's a completely different company,

2216
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:25,280
but for some reason these go together in my mind, and they were talking about the eleventh

2217
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:28,640
hour, and I want to say around that same time we had heard something about Phantasmagoria.

2218
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,960
So that'd be pretty cool if that were to come out for iOS.

2219
02:01:31,960 --> 02:01:36,560
The point-and-click games would lend themselves much better to the iOS system.

2220
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,600
So maybe like Chirandia would be awesome if we could get that.

2221
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:44,760
Obviously, you know, I gotta say King's Quest would be kind of neat.

2222
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:51,200
And there was the whole Flash versions that got shut down, so we know it's kind of possible.

2223
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:55,560
Good Ol' Games had a Phantasmagoria for digital download last year.

2224
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:56,560
Maybe that's why we reported on it.

2225
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:02,760
They do have the SCUMM emulator, so for jailbroken devices.

2226
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:06,560
And you know me, I'd like to see more classic Commodore 64 games show up outside of just

2227
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:07,560
the emulator.

2228
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:10,640
There's the emulator that's available, but it keeps going up and down and up and down.

2229
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:12,640
I don't even know if it's still on the store right now.

2230
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:18,520
They also have... there's some other emulator that was out there that was...

2231
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,520
iDOS was an emulator.

2232
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,640
I had Duke Nukem and all that.

2233
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:24,400
I have it on my phone, but it's pulled from the store now.

2234
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:25,400
iDOS.

2235
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:26,400
There's another one.

2236
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:29,880
I did get the... they finally leaked that out too.

2237
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:35,120
Remember that Minecraft client that got uploaded for just a brief millisecond or whatever?

2238
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,720
Yeah, I finally found that.

2239
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,720
Nice.

2240
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:42,080
But I don't have a Minecraft account, so I can't play it yet.

2241
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:46,040
Alright, well let's get to the mailbag.

2242
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:49,400
You guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaungeready.com.

2243
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:53,640
Dark Sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them live on air.

2244
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,120
The first email is actually directed towards me.

2245
02:02:56,120 --> 02:03:00,240
It says, hello, I heard last week that Dark Sakura is going to Faname Con.

2246
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:01,560
I will be going this year as well.

2247
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,360
How about an OLR meetup at the convention?

2248
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,080
Hope to see you, Sakura.

2249
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:07,000
She and I.

2250
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:11,720
If everything works out, I'm not making any supreme promises or anything, because honestly

2251
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:15,120
I miss cosplaying and I think I wouldn't mind doing it again.

2252
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,440
But we definitely need to see about getting our panel.

2253
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:19,440
That would be...

2254
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:20,800
Might be a little late for that.

2255
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:21,800
We're almost into...

2256
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:22,800
We're like mid-March.

2257
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,480
If we could swing it, yeah, I'd love to do it.

2258
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,160
I'll probably be here that weekend, so yeah.

2259
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,960
I'll bring the dolls again.

2260
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:33,720
The scary creepy dolls.

2261
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,720
Next email.

2262
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:35,720
Hey, OLR.

2263
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:39,800
How would you feel if Konami gave the DDR series a reboot on the Kinect?

2264
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:45,000
The game would feature songs from DDR's history and songs found in the charts today, and it

2265
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,520
would also feature an online mode where players can compete in dance battles or form their

2266
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:52,040
own dance groups and choreograph their own dances.

2267
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,040
Oh.

2268
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,040
Yeah.

2269
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:58,120
I think, unfortunately, Konami's already kind of screwed the pooch with that, because Dance

2270
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:00,040
Masters is kind of that.

2271
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:06,120
At least it's a lot of the old DDR songs, but in that whole para-slash-dance-central-esque

2272
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:07,120
kind of format.

2273
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:12,000
And there's a demo available now on Xbox 360 if you want to see what this game's all about.

2274
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,080
But yeah, I think you have some good ideas, but the weird thing is...

2275
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:20,840
And I don't know, did he say with a dance mat and Kinect?

2276
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:23,400
Because that might be a little weird for some people.

2277
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:24,400
If you...

2278
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,400
Hey, guess what?

2279
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:30,200
We do use a Kinect, though, with DDR, the upcoming DDR game, Dance Dance Revolution,

2280
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:31,200
because they made it just...

2281
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:34,680
We covered last week where there's a hack for it that they're trying to...

2282
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:38,200
No, that's StepMania, but I'm talking about the actual Dance Dance Revolution member,

2283
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:43,200
the one that came out on PS3 with move support and then on the Wii as well.

2284
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:49,960
Well, it's coming out in April on Xbox 360, and it uses the Xbox Vision camera, which

2285
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,520
is now also technically the Kinect, but you can do crap with that.

2286
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:57,920
But seriously, you need...

2287
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:02,720
We don't need to give Konami reasons to make more gimmicky crap for Dance Dance Revolution.

2288
02:05:02,720 --> 02:05:06,680
They just need to stick to the core mechanics and improve on that, or just basically do

2289
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:12,480
what they were doing back, like, years ago, and they would be fine, but they're trying...

2290
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,440
I don't know what they're doing anymore, and I don't think...

2291
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:17,960
Uh, they need to just reform Konami Hawaii and give them the game.

2292
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:21,960
That's really the only thing that would really get me, like, super interested in DDR again.

2293
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:22,960
Put me in charge!

2294
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:28,040
I will make you a game that's gonna be perfect.

2295
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:29,040
More emails?

2296
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,480
Yes, there was actually more to this email.

2297
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:31,480
Oh, my bad.

2298
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:35,200
Finally, it would be great if you guys would give my video game blog a quick plug on the

2299
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,480
show, which I will be happy to do.

2300
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:38,480
No!

2301
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,480
That'll be $50.

2302
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:40,480
Hush.

2303
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,480
Here's a link.

2304
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,480
PlayStationUK.wordpress.com.

2305
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:43,480
Thanks, Liam.

2306
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,480
Okay, Liam.

2307
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:45,480
Send me...

2308
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:51,960
I would like to know Liam's thoughts on the whole LG lawsuit that we covered at the top

2309
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:53,840
of the show, since that is affecting the UK.

2310
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:54,840
Yeah.

2311
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,840
Maybe it's on his blog.

2312
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:01,520
Well, we'll have to just go there later, and maybe look later.

2313
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:03,320
So, next email.

2314
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:04,320
Greetings, OLR.

2315
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,920
This is your neighborhood turtle again.

2316
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:10,840
I've included a link you guys should check out concerning Unreal Engine 3.

2317
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:15,120
Looking at the screen caps plus the previews of Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3, I'm incredibly

2318
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:17,880
impressed mostly with the lighting.

2319
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,080
Being a graphics whore, all these next-gen games look very promising.

2320
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:26,000
I know y'all like the retro games, but isn't there a part of you that loves beautiful graphics

2321
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
in your games?

2322
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Fuck yeah.

2323
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,920
As the only turtle gamer I know, I have to say that I get more immersed in games that

2324
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,440
look realistic.

2325
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:37,640
Keep up the best podcasts on the internet to your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.

2326
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:39,960
I love pretty things.

2327
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,040
Why else did I sit through the first 13 hours of Final Fantasy 13?

2328
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:44,360
I mean, really.

2329
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:47,800
No, the lighting is really tremendous.

2330
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:48,800
It's amazing.

2331
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:52,880
You know, Unreal Engine, the last one, was amazing enough.

2332
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:55,800
I'm sure the new one's just gonna be even more of an improvement.

2333
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:56,800
It's gonna be great.

2334
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,800
I don't think that's four.

2335
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,800
That's just the new updates that they did for three.

2336
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:00,800
Oh my gosh.

2337
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,800
I thought that was the...

2338
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,800
I thought...

2339
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,800
I thought this is the new engine.

2340
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,720
No, that's just the tweaks that they did for three, I think, because remember...

2341
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,720
That's a pretty crazy poly count these things are running, too.

2342
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,400
I don't think they have Unreal.

2343
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:15,800
Remember, the next one's Rage, I thought, from...

2344
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:17,800
Was Epic Rage?

2345
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:18,800
No.

2346
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,800
I don't remember.

2347
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,920
But I know Rage is the next big engine, but yeah, I don't think that's Unreal 4.

2348
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,520
That's just tweaks to the new three, if I remember correctly.

2349
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:31,400
I also wanna see what crazy non-shooting things come out of the engine, because you know,

2350
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:35,920
we've been getting some really random things in the Unreal Engine.

2351
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:39,160
There's a few role-playing games from Square that were done in the engine.

2352
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:40,160
The last...

2353
02:07:40,160 --> 02:07:42,240
Was it Last Remnant that was in Unreal?

2354
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:43,560
No, Last Remnant was.

2355
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:47,320
Well, I've been looking at this, and this is kinda funny since I've been taking my 3D

2356
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,320
class.

2357
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:52,120
It's just, now that I actually understand the physics behind some of this, it's pretty

2358
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:55,640
cool seeing, you know, what happens by layer.

2359
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,640
It's just amazing.

2360
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:03,140
Like, I'm gonna share this picture with the chatroom, because this is a really good example.

2361
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:08,520
It's the one of the dude's face where they'd start with the...

2362
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,980
It's basically just a demo of the subsurface scattering.

2363
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:14,360
It's really cool.

2364
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:16,760
They also showing how cool smoking is.

2365
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:18,440
Yeah, like...

2366
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:27,480
Honestly, a falling cigarette is a good showing of lighting and physics in action.

2367
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,360
Because that was clearly part of their demo.

2368
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:35,000
And it also shows that Epic has set the release Falling Cigarette the Game after Gears of

2369
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:39,840
War 3, and I can't be any more excited than I am possibly right now.

2370
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,720
Next email.

2371
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:42,720
Hi guys...

2372
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:43,720
Cigarettes will fall.

2373
02:08:43,720 --> 02:08:44,720
Fall of 2012.

2374
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:48,720
Hi guys, since the website won't let me post this because it's too long, I figured I'd

2375
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:49,720
just email it.

2376
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:50,720
Oh good.

2377
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:51,720
Bleh.

2378
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:54,560
Yay, DarkSakura loves long emails.

2379
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,360
Especially after my mouth is dry from just having a beer.

2380
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:01,640
It seems, first off, if I ever call the show again, I have to close the all-games window.

2381
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:05,760
Twice, it just suddenly turned itself back on while I was in the call.

2382
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:06,760
Weird.

2383
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:09,760
Anywho, I just thought I'd give a very interesting story.

2384
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:13,960
Now I know I've stated before how much I like PC gaming and console these days for various

2385
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:14,960
reasons.

2386
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:17,680
Recently I was a bit bored and was curious, so I decided to try out a game I heard a lot

2387
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:20,120
about, Mass Effect 2 on the PC.

2388
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:24,200
Now the game ran smooth-smooth-ly, not smooth, dude.

2389
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,360
The game looked great.

2390
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:31,320
And honestly, after playing out the entire demo, I was impressed enough that I made plans

2391
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:33,360
to purchase the game at a later time.

2392
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:36,740
A few days ago on a whim, and because of the common thoughts of how important frames per

2393
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:40,880
second is to me, I can tell the difference even after 60 FPS.

2394
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:44,520
Despite people saying it's impossible, but that's another story.

2395
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:46,400
I decided to download the PS3 demo.

2396
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:50,880
Now granted, it looked the same, with a bit less framerate, but it wasn't too bad.

2397
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,200
After the first part of the demo, where the big shit blew up, I looked at my girlfriend

2398
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:59,060
who was watching the game with me, and all I heard was, can I see more?

2399
02:09:59,060 --> 02:10:02,080
Her saying that about a game is not something I've seen every day.

2400
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:03,560
Wouldn't I be hearing every day?

2401
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:04,560
Anyway.

2402
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:11,280
In fact, I think this is the third game ever she's been that impressed.

2403
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:14,920
So of course I went through the rest of the demo, even showing her how much customization

2404
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:18,520
was involved in creating your character, and following the storylines and how they can

2405
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,520
branch off.

2406
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,880
After the full demo, I found that while the controls aren't as good as I'd like them to

2407
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,840
be, they're far better than the Xbox 360.

2408
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:31,460
In fact, I would rather use the PS3 controller for first person shooters than the Xbox.

2409
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:36,220
And yes, the framerate isn't as silky smooth, but it still looks great and felt like a movie.

2410
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:40,200
My girl just had the biggest jaw drop and grins, so in a rarity, I'm going to get the

2411
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:43,440
PS3 version mainly so she can watch and enjoy the story.

2412
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:48,400
For me, any game that causes a casual person to stop and take notice wins more in my book

2413
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:50,680
than something that's designed for hardcore fans.

2414
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:53,560
Again, another topic for another day.

2415
02:10:53,560 --> 02:10:55,600
Also why the PS3 over Xbox?

2416
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:59,480
Besides control, the download content comes with it, instead of having to buy it.

2417
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:04,960
Besides, it's very rare that a game does better on PS3 for me than the Xbox 360.

2418
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:08,080
And to end it, her final thought after I turned off the demo sure beats Halo.

2419
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:09,960
I think that sealed the deal.

2420
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:12,840
Sometimes having the audience there while playing a game is more fun than playing it

2421
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:13,840
alone.

2422
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,800
Well, you won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.

2423
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,360
Oh no, well, won't be on this week, but we'll catch you guys later.

2424
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:22,880
And that was from Mantis Knight.

2425
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:23,880
That's another one of those games.

2426
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:27,000
You know, it's funny because I brought up Beyond Good and Evil earlier in the show,

2427
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,400
and it's one of those games like everybody played and loved, and I'm just now catching

2428
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:31,400
up on it.

2429
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:33,400
Yeah, put Mass Effect in that same bin.

2430
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,200
It's funny.

2431
02:11:35,200 --> 02:11:37,360
Now, last email.

2432
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,520
Hey, OLR gang.

2433
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:40,800
ACHP here.

2434
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,320
I know a lot of people who listen to this show probably want to work in games.

2435
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:45,460
I know I do.

2436
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:47,000
And I thought I'd share some advice.

2437
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,540
Meet people who make games.

2438
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:52,300
While not being able to afford a $1000 pass to get into a game developer's conference

2439
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:55,560
this weekend, I was able to squeeze myself into some post-hours events.

2440
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:59,120
And let me tell you, it is probably the best thing I have ever done for my professional

2441
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:00,120
career.

2442
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:03,320
You'd be surprised at how willing people are to chat and network with complete strangers

2443
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,320
who don't even work in the industry.

2444
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:08,720
At a random party for a company I've never heard of, I was able to meet the business

2445
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:13,740
developer managers for Q Entertainment, met a guy who knew a guy who was there with a

2446
02:12:13,740 --> 02:12:17,660
recruiter who is now helping me find placement as an entry-level programmer.

2447
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:22,780
So if you want to get your foot in the door and haven't booked a ticket for PAX, do it.

2448
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:28,300
And if you have, go look up your favorite com- go look up if your favorite company is

2449
02:12:28,300 --> 02:12:30,760
doing any meet-and-greet type of activities.

2450
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:32,520
You may be glad you did.

2451
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,320
Hope this helps someone as DHP.

2452
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,320
T.S.

2453
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:38,680
Game developers are definitely the most socially awkward people ever.

2454
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:43,000
With an open bar and go-go dancers on the tables, they are just idly chatting or playing

2455
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
on their phone.

2456
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I lulled.

2457
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
P.P.S.

2458
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,960
I wrote this on my Android phone, again to prove that you can write grammatically correct

2459
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,920
and properly spelled and punctuated words without a keyboard or autocorrect.

2460
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:52,920
Cheers!

2461
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:55,100
He said he'd be very patient.

2462
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:57,000
But yeah, I agree.

2463
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,600
Some of the best parts, at least about E3, which is one I was going to pretty regularly

2464
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:06,820
for a while, some of the best part is networking.

2465
02:13:06,820 --> 02:13:08,880
So yeah, absolutely.

2466
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:12,480
If you're going to be going to any of those shows, just don't be shy.

2467
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,820
Just say hi to people.

2468
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:16,800
You can tell when somebody doesn't want to talk to you or if you're bugging somebody

2469
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,200
or what have you.

2470
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:22,960
You know, but most of the times at these expos, people kind of, you know, they want to be

2471
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,960
social.

2472
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:24,960
They want to hang out.

2473
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:25,960
They want to talk.

2474
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:26,960
They're a game.

2475
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,200
So, good email.

2476
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,200
Was that it?

2477
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:30,200
That was it?

2478
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:31,200
Excuse me.

2479
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,200
Chat.orangelouncerator.com.

2480
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:37,200
If you want to chat, if you want to send us emails, mailbag at orangelouncerator.com.

2481
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:39,600
S.H.A. 100 Matt throws in our chat room.

2482
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:43,640
There are a ton of networking panels at PAX East this year.

2483
02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:47,000
So coming up, I would like to know how the networking is at PAX East.

2484
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,040
For those of you guys that are going, I want to know how you guys, you know, if you find

2485
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,960
people or what you discover.

2486
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:53,960
So let us know.

2487
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:58,380
In the meantime, we need to stop being so nice talking about all this networking and

2488
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:59,380
hand-holding and partying.

2489
02:13:59,380 --> 02:14:17,280
It's time to get angsty with the FUs of the week.

2490
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:22,600
I would like to give a big fuck you to the Library of Congress, more specifically their

2491
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:30,040
website in trying to help my client copyright his book.

2492
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:35,260
It's not letting me do the regular copyright submission.

2493
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:40,120
It wants me to do the pre-registration submission, which actually isn't even necessary to do.

2494
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:42,400
Online registration is $35.

2495
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,400
Pre-registration is $150.

2496
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:47,600
Now, what do you think we want to do, especially since I've made sure that the book is fully

2497
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:49,400
the way it needs to be?

2498
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:50,400
Everything's ready.

2499
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:51,400
We've got it publisher.

2500
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:55,360
I mean, just frustrations.

2501
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:58,200
So bite my butt, Library of Congress.

2502
02:14:58,200 --> 02:14:59,200
Loki?

2503
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:08,160
FU to Dominic's New York pizza and Italian deli for not realizing that Philly cheesesteak

2504
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:14,200
has cheese on it and giving me a sandwich that does not have cheese on it.

2505
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,200
And it wasn't that great.

2506
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:17,200
So I have to throw it away.

2507
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:21,320
But yes, next time I will not be buying the Philly cheesesteak sandwich from you because

2508
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:30,400
you have omitted cheese, although my wife does like the clam pizza.

2509
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,400
Not my thing.

2510
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:40,200
Alright, and my FU goes to those big Belgian waffles for being so yummy and delicious and

2511
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,200
very fattening.

2512
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:44,280
FU to food for making me fat.

2513
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,280
That's my FU.

2514
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:50,640
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

2515
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,120
username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

2516
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:53,440
We're not ready for that just yet.

2517
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,400
We have a couple more stories for you.

2518
02:15:55,400 --> 02:16:02,320
Capcom would like to remind you that Street Fighter II has turned 20.

2519
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:06,480
It's been 20 years since the game was released in arcades in 1991.

2520
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:14,200
It's seen six arcade iterations and of course a ton of ports across consoles, PCs, and handhelds.

2521
02:16:14,200 --> 02:16:17,960
And definitely one of the top arcade games out there.

2522
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:23,080
They are still assholes though for charging $5 for download content for Marvel vs. Capcom

2523
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:27,280
3, I'd like to add.

2524
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:31,680
But happy birthday, Street Fighter, and your 20 different iterations to go with those 20

2525
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:32,680
years, right?

2526
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:36,680
Pretty soon Street Fighter IV will have just as many.

2527
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:39,600
Which is one of the more interesting launch games on the 3DS, might I add, a game that

2528
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:44,600
I played, what, a year and a half ago, two years ago for the first time?

2529
02:16:44,600 --> 02:16:48,440
It's, it's, you know Dead or Alive is not a launch game anymore?

2530
02:16:48,440 --> 02:16:53,720
Yeah, no, I, it's a launch window game, I'm sorry, that's not a launch game, okay, a launch

2531
02:16:53,720 --> 02:16:55,640
game is a game that comes out day one.

2532
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:56,960
That is a launch game.

2533
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:58,920
I'd even give you a week or two after that.

2534
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:02,580
A game that comes out two months after that is not a launch game.

2535
02:17:02,580 --> 02:17:04,520
That is a launch window game.

2536
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:07,080
Well my launch window is four years after the console comes out.

2537
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:09,000
It's a launch game.

2538
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,100
That's Nintendo for ya, thanks.

2539
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:13,640
Way to, way to spin that.

2540
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:17,040
Oh, we don't have a lot of games on our system, but that's okay because we considered the

2541
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,520
launch four years after it comes out.

2542
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:23,000
Alright, Angry Loki, let's move on to another story.

2543
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:29,240
This is about Steam and Steam possibly invading your television, that's right, here's a quote

2544
02:17:29,240 --> 02:17:33,580
from Doug Lombardi, the Vice President of Marketing for Valve from earlier this week

2545
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:36,160
in preparation for Game Developers Conference.

2546
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:39,760
Our partners and customers have asked us to make Steam available in more places.

2547
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:43,280
With the introduction of Steam on the Mac and soon in Portal 2 on the Playstation 3,

2548
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:44,600
we've done just that.

2549
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:48,460
With big picture mode, gaming opportunities for Steam partners and customers become possible

2550
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:53,920
via PCs and Macs on any TV or computer display in the house.

2551
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:59,320
So it's not necessarily there's gonna be some type of like little hookup kit or something,

2552
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:04,620
it's that they're talking about actually putting your PC games on the television, a big picture

2553
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:11,000
mode and I guess a controller friendly version when you wanna play on your TV.

2554
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,200
That's pretty cool.

2555
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,520
More plans were announced to Game Developers Conference this past week.

2556
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:20,240
But you know, I think a lot of you are just gonna wait and get Portal 2 on the consoles

2557
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:24,000
if you're not gonna, if you don't already have it planned on the PC, not to disrespect

2558
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,400
those that do their gaming on the PCs cause they'll certainly be a lot of people buying

2559
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:28,400
it there.

2560
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:32,880
Or I don't know, I gotta admit that Playstation 3 deal where you get it in both places looks

2561
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:33,880
awesome.

2562
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:38,120
And the whole where you buy Playstation 2, or absolutely, you buy Portal 2 on the Playstation

2563
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:42,440
3 and then you get the Steam copy on PC for free, I think that's how you gotta do it.

2564
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:46,040
Microsoft's gonna be hurting to sell copies of that.

2565
02:18:46,040 --> 02:18:47,040
We'll see.

2566
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,440
Alright, we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype

2567
02:18:51,440 --> 02:18:52,440
is ORANGELAUNGERADIO.

2568
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:56,240
The Skype line is open right now for you guys to give us a call.

2569
02:18:56,240 --> 02:19:00,880
While we wait for some calls, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2570
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:05,040
Uh, I don't know.

2571
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:06,040
Maybe.

2572
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:07,560
Um, let's see here.

2573
02:19:07,560 --> 02:19:14,200
I'm trying to think of what we haven't covered yet, other than my hatred for what Nintendo's

2574
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:20,800
doing with the 3DS.

2575
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:24,240
There was some new hackers, well not really hacker, but stuff that's going on with the

2576
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,680
whole George Hotch thing and being sued.

2577
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:35,160
Apparently there's some drama over the third party company that Sony, or I should say the

2578
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:39,760
law office, the court has going through his hard drives.

2579
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:44,840
Apparently Sony's trying to get a copy of the hard drive for themselves, even though

2580
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:49,720
third party's supposed to be the only ones looking at the hard drive basically, but Sony

2581
02:19:49,720 --> 02:19:53,720
wants to know what's on there and possibly the steal information it sounds like, or maybe

2582
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:55,920
manipulating the system a little bit.

2583
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,000
So people are kind of up in arms about that.

2584
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I don't know.

2585
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,400
This is kind of interesting also.

2586
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:09,880
The NGP, I guess the games of course, they're coming on kind of a cartridge or memory card

2587
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:11,120
type device.

2588
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:18,880
They're going to be coming on 2 and 4 gigabyte cards with room for game saves and patches

2589
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:23,560
because the actual system will not have any on board storage, or at least that's what

2590
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:24,800
the thought is.

2591
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,680
Is that kind of one of the ways they're trying to get around all the hacking?

2592
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:32,440
I don't think it's going to work because the way I'm thinking it now, what are you going

2593
02:20:32,440 --> 02:20:35,300
to save your downloaded games to then?

2594
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:40,200
Because obviously they're going to have some sort of online market or something like that,

2595
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,120
and I know it has a second memory card slot for stuff like that.

2596
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:54,000
So it might be a way to get around it, but it didn't work for the Nintendo DS.

2597
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,580
Are they trying to do it maybe because it's a non-standard format or something?

2598
02:20:58,580 --> 02:21:05,120
Maybe just to make it easy, but I'm sure it's got to be some sort of...

2599
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:09,280
It's partly probably anti-piracy.

2600
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,280
And then...

2601
02:21:10,280 --> 02:21:15,860
Again, the phone number 1877-GAMELR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2602
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:18,740
If you want to get through tonight, I would advise calling now because the way these things

2603
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:22,840
go is I say the number like 20 times and nobody ever calls, and then suddenly, just at the

2604
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:25,240
last minute, everybody calls at once.

2605
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:29,000
And then I say, well, we've taken enough calls, so I'm just saying.

2606
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,120
Get in early.

2607
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:38,980
Microsoft has gone the route of Spore, where you can basically take your avatars now.

2608
02:21:38,980 --> 02:21:44,920
You can create poses or whatever with them, and then you can get jumbo wall prints of

2609
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:45,920
your avatar.

2610
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:51,020
If you want to put yourself up on the wall, you can get a 16 gigabyte zoom with your avatar

2611
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:56,200
on it etched in, or a $60 figurine of your avatar.

2612
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:00,960
And of course, the wall print's gonna cost you $150, so that better be damn big, and

2613
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:04,360
the zoom will cost you $170 with the figurine, $60.

2614
02:22:04,360 --> 02:22:09,520
So that'd be kind of neat to have at my desk.

2615
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:10,520
Not the wall print.

2616
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:11,520
That's retarded.

2617
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,520
That's gonna cost you a bit of money, though, isn't it?

2618
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:15,360
Yeah, I'd probably wait.

2619
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:19,000
But I'd want to see what these things look like in the size, because I'm not gonna pay

2620
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,400
$60 for, like, a three inch, you know, statue.

2621
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:23,400
Better be something pretty significant.

2622
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,400
Alright, we got calls coming in, so let's go to it.

2623
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:26,400
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2624
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:27,400
Who's this?

2625
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:28,400
Hi, this is Bazzinator.

2626
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:29,400
Hey, Spazzinator.

2627
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:30,400
What's on your mind, buddy?

2628
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:37,680
Uh, yeah, I'm just calling in about the whole home thing that you were mentioning earlier.

2629
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:42,080
Yeah, about the whole upgrades in home, where they're gonna have more built-in stuff.

2630
02:22:42,080 --> 02:22:43,080
What do you think of all that?

2631
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:53,120
Well, I'm probably in the minority here in this, but my whole opinion kind of goes along

2632
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:54,960
the lines of, who cares?

2633
02:22:54,960 --> 02:23:02,080
I mean, you know, you kind of sort of touched on it a little bit to a degree, but when you

2634
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:06,760
said, you know, when are they gonna do anything with the club houses?

2635
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:07,760
Yeah.

2636
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:14,720
I mean, you know, there's so much they could be doing with home to make it a little bit

2637
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:15,720
more interesting.

2638
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:22,920
Like, if you look right and well, it's kind of hard to, you know, talk about something

2639
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:27,520
unless you're really looking at it, but you know how the one wall behind the stage is

2640
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:32,160
supposed to be, like, a video screen in the clubhouse?

2641
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:33,160
Yeah.

2642
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:39,960
Like, they could be doing something with the video screen, like, you guys could be showing

2643
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:45,360
off some of the videos that you guys have made for Orange Lounge.

2644
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:49,400
I will tell you this much, the minute that Sony allows us to put some type of video on

2645
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:55,320
that monitor, I'll do something exclusive video content-wise that won't even be on YouTube.

2646
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:57,880
We will only put it in Sony Home.

2647
02:23:57,880 --> 02:23:59,480
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

2648
02:23:59,480 --> 02:24:03,280
My camera is still in a box, because I don't see that happening.

2649
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:10,400
Yeah, you could, you know, there's always that, and also, you know, with our own private

2650
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:17,280
spaces, you know, whether it be the log cabin space or the default one, whatever you happen

2651
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:25,520
to have, you know, they could sell, like, virtual jukeboxes and virtual TVs.

2652
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:33,240
They'll allow you to stream all the MP3s that you got on your PS3's hard drive, or the video

2653
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:39,080
content that you had filed through the video servers, or what have you.

2654
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:43,320
Although I'm with you to a point here, Spaznator, I gotta ask this question, I gotta play Devil's

2655
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:45,520
Advocate and ask this question.

2656
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:51,860
Since the PlayStation 3 is a gaming system, why not have enhancements to the gaming mechanisms

2657
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:55,600
within Home and making the gaming within Home better?

2658
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,120
Well, there's that too.

2659
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:09,080
I can certainly see your point, but, you know, perhaps Bobby Blackwood likes and loves to

2660
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:18,800
point out from time to time, I'm really heavily into the whole PlayStation 3, more so than

2661
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:19,800
my 360.

2662
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:20,800
No!

2663
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:27,160
Your 360 handle, I'm not gonna give away your 360 handle, but it has PSN in it, and that

2664
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:30,720
always cracks me up that PSN is in your 360 handle.

2665
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:36,360
Yeah, well, my point being, you know, you would think, you know, with that being said,

2666
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:43,560
you know, I would be all over Home, like, here on the gorilla, but the thing is, I really

2667
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:47,000
haven't touched Home in, God knows how long.

2668
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:54,080
And the last time I even bothered with Home the last time is because someone in the All

2669
02:25:54,080 --> 02:26:01,140
Games community said the invite to join them in Home, and that was about that.

2670
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:04,080
There's nothing to do in there but dance with furries right now.

2671
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:08,740
But hopefully Sodium 2 will bring people back, if not at least for a day, while everybody's

2672
02:26:08,740 --> 02:26:11,520
curious and checks it out, right?

2673
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:17,160
Yeah, but, you know, if they implemented some of the ideas that I'd just thrown out, you

2674
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:20,640
know, I would be using Home left and right, you know.

2675
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:26,280
But, you know, until then, you know, the only reason I would even consider using it is I

2676
02:26:26,280 --> 02:26:31,840
would have to be bored out of my mind, like borderline comatose bored, you know?

2677
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:35,120
Well, maybe you need to go to Game Developers Conference and tell them your ideas, I don't

2678
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,120
know.

2679
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,120
All right.

2680
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,120
Well, as far as they are, I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so

2681
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,120
much for the call, buddy.

2682
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,120
Take care.

2683
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:41,120
Yeah, sure, have a good one.

2684
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:42,120
All right.

2685
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:44,800
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2686
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:48,560
By the way, screen filled up with phone calls while Spaz was on the line.

2687
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,560
What did I tell you?

2688
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:50,920
What did I tell you?

2689
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:53,680
The minute one person tries to call, then everybody's gonna try to call.

2690
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:54,680
So there you go.

2691
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:55,680
It is open now.

2692
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:56,680
We'll see if somebody gets through.

2693
02:26:56,680 --> 02:27:00,040
One eight seven seven game O-L-R or a username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2694
02:27:00,040 --> 02:27:01,720
Any other last minute stories that we have?

2695
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:04,760
Logie's looking for stuff for after the show, so I don't know.

2696
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:05,760
I guess, is that it?

2697
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:06,760
You done?

2698
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:07,760
No, I've got stuff.

2699
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,760
Oh, okay.

2700
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:15,160
O-L-A is becoming a game that's gonna be downloadable on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

2701
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:20,200
Being developed by Konami, so, you know, I guess that's needed.

2702
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,200
I don't know.

2703
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,280
It's a movie game.

2704
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:23,280
So what do you expect?

2705
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:24,280
Hopefully that'll be coming out soon.

2706
02:27:24,280 --> 02:27:25,280
Oh, next month.

2707
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,280
Yeah.

2708
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:32,080
It's right in time for the movie, I guess, considering it comes out like in a week.

2709
02:27:32,080 --> 02:27:35,880
It is being developed by the people that did Time Shift, Saber Interactive.

2710
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:38,200
Yay, we got more calls coming in.

2711
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:39,200
Yay.

2712
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,200
Let's go to the phones.

2713
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:41,200
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2714
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:42,200
Who's this?

2715
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:43,200
Hey, it's Ron.

2716
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,200
How are you guys doing tonight?

2717
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:48,320
Of course, because when I say, you know, get through now, you know how to get through the

2718
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:49,920
system and beat everybody else.

2719
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,760
It's, it's, I don't know, you've got some type of psychic prowess.

2720
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:54,120
I don't know what it is.

2721
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:56,560
It's a blessing and a curse.

2722
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:58,560
It's a blessing for you, a curse for us.

2723
02:27:58,560 --> 02:27:59,560
No, I'm kidding.

2724
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:00,560
Funny.

2725
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:01,560
All right.

2726
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:04,120
First thing, I just wanna say, Logie, welcome back.

2727
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:05,840
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

2728
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:06,840
Thank you.

2729
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:07,840
You got it.

2730
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:08,840
Thank you.

2731
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:13,080
But don't ever talk like that in the opening of the show ever again, am I right?

2732
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,080
Maybe.

2733
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:15,080
Just kidding.

2734
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,080
Yeah.

2735
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:22,200
In regards to what Logie said about the re-release of Mario All-Stars for the Wii, this is not

2736
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:25,720
the first time Nintendo has pulled something like this.

2737
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:26,720
Yeah.

2738
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:27,720
Oh, yeah.

2739
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:34,000
I'm just reminded of when DDO Mario Mix came out and everyone went nuts and bought it and

2740
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,480
then you found out, oh, we're no longer making copies of this game, and I remember my friends

2741
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:48,040
going on eBay, spending up to 80 to 100 bucks for the game, the special dance pad, and both.

2742
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:54,680
I do remember that, oh yeah, those were selling for crazy money for a while, and then, what

2743
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,680
happened?

2744
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,680
Reprint.

2745
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:59,240
Hey, even more recent than that, the Wii system.

2746
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:06,600
Everyone was like, oh, hey, we can't make enough of these, they're just so hard to put

2747
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:11,000
together, such advanced technology that's been around since the GameCube, how do we

2748
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:12,000
do it?

2749
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Yeah.

2750
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,440
Yeah, like I'm supposed to believe there was a shortage on those that wasn't on purpose.

2751
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:22,320
Sure, whatever you say, Nintendo, I'll believe you.

2752
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:26,560
Oh, God.

2753
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:30,040
So what do you think about the 3DS?

2754
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:36,520
I really want one, but to be perfectly honest, I think I'm going to do what SSJ100Matt said.

2755
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,760
Wait a while.

2756
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:38,760
Just see.

2757
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:39,760
Yeah.

2758
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:40,760
That's good advice.

2759
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:42,800
You know, you asking about all this Nintendo stuff, though, reminded me.

2760
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:47,000
I had a big question I was going to ask Loki in part A when we were doing all the 3DS stories.

2761
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:51,400
He was so ranty, I got completely sidetracked, so I'm going to ask it now with you on the

2762
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,400
line, Robin.

2763
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:54,040
He's just making it for last week, so yeah.

2764
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:55,040
I know, I know.

2765
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:56,040
He's got to do double duty this week.

2766
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:58,080
No, I want to ask this question, because this is a serious question.

2767
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:03,440
This is one I was talking the other day with some people about is, what's the Wii going

2768
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:05,120
to give us this year?

2769
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:12,000
Like, Nintendo at E3 this year, we know they're going to announce a Mario game for 3DS, duh.

2770
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,680
We know they'll be talking about the other 3DS titles throughout Christmas.

2771
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:17,560
What have they got going on the Wii right now?

2772
02:30:17,560 --> 02:30:19,280
Skyward Sword, that's about it.

2773
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:22,840
And they're dragging that shit out as long as possible.

2774
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:28,920
Is it possible, not to sound fanboy-esque here, but is it possible that Zelda was pushed

2775
02:30:28,920 --> 02:30:32,560
back because this is the year they're going to announce a Wii HD?

2776
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,560
No.

2777
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,760
And not a Wii 2, but a Wii HD.

2778
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:41,520
No, this is exactly what happened to the last Metroid Other M. You know, they announced

2779
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:45,120
it way too damn early, it gets delayed forever.

2780
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,640
It's just like the Metroid Prime trilogy.

2781
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:54,440
They're just pushing shit back longer and longer, and they keep announcing stuff well

2782
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:59,960
and too much in advance, just so they have something to fill up their E3 press conference

2783
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:00,960
with.

2784
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:04,320
Because, I mean seriously, if they cut out all the stuff that's supposed to be coming

2785
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:10,520
out this year, I mean, well they announced Skyward Sword, and that was a big part of

2786
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:11,520
their thing.

2787
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:15,320
And I bet you right now it's going to be a big part of their press conference, you know,

2788
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:16,320
coming soon.

2789
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:19,600
Either there'll be a Just Dance 3, that they can always, you know, have.

2790
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,600
Exactly.

2791
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:26,240
I mean, that's just a no-brainer, but from Nintendo themselves, I would assume a new

2792
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:33,880
Pikmin game, which is great for people that like it, but honestly, I could, I don't care.

2793
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:34,880
It's not a game I'm interested in.

2794
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:36,880
It's different to play a whole lot of Pikmin.

2795
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:39,080
I think so.

2796
02:31:39,080 --> 02:31:42,980
I don't know, there's a part of me that feels like now is the time for Nintendo to come

2797
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:48,400
out and say, and maybe, it's gotta be next year, if not this year, it's got to be next

2798
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:49,400
year.

2799
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:50,800
Because the 3DS will be standard by then.

2800
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:53,920
And they've gotta come out and say, okay, here's the next Wii.

2801
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:58,600
But I don't think it would be the Wii 2, so much as it would be comparing the DS to the

2802
02:31:58,600 --> 02:31:59,600
DS Lite.

2803
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,280
If it's the Wii 2, is it the Wii Wii?

2804
02:32:02,280 --> 02:32:03,520
Shut up.

2805
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:11,560
I would think if they're going to release an HD system like that, then what they're

2806
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:16,920
going to have to do is do something more along the lines of the DS and the DSi, where it

2807
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:21,840
plays the old Wii games, it plays the GameCube games, but it also plays these new HD Wii

2808
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:22,840
games.

2809
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:23,840
And why wouldn't it?

2810
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:28,760
I mean, because one thing that Nintendo has done pretty well is the whole, I guess really

2811
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:33,960
it's only been on the one series of games, backwards compatibility, with the Wii, every

2812
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:35,680
GameCube game is playable on the Wii.

2813
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:38,400
Well, I mean, for the portable systems, it's been pretty good.

2814
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:39,400
That's true.

2815
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:43,680
It's had the Game Boy Advance and stuff like that, and Game Boy Advance had the Game Boy.

2816
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,360
When you were doing cartridge formats, you kind of couldn't, so I get that.

2817
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:51,480
But you know, you get the sense that if there is going to be a Wii HD or whatever, a Wii

2818
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:56,440
D, I like that, there's going to be a Wii, then it's got to be backwards compatible with

2819
02:32:56,440 --> 02:32:59,200
everything else from GameCube on up.

2820
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:02,400
But I mean, it's an interesting idea as that sounds.

2821
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,800
I don't think they're going to do it.

2822
02:33:03,800 --> 02:33:04,800
Why?

2823
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:08,120
Because they feel that graphics aren't really an issue for people.

2824
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:13,840
It's all about gameplay, and that's why they're not going to embrace that type of mentality.

2825
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:18,080
Because why should they put out a new console that has better graphics on it?

2826
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,080
People don't care.

2827
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:23,480
According to them, people don't care, and really, they're just going to be releasing

2828
02:33:23,480 --> 02:33:24,840
quality games.

2829
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:27,720
Same reason with the whole online argument.

2830
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:28,720
They don't care.

2831
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:30,060
People don't care about online.

2832
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:32,960
They just want to play family games and party games.

2833
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:34,200
That's what the Wii's for.

2834
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:36,320
It's for families and stuff like that.

2835
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:41,480
Well, once again, the Wii was supposed to be something that was, hey, we're going to

2836
02:33:41,480 --> 02:33:46,240
break the mold and make it so that the system isn't just for kids and stuff, it's for everybody,

2837
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,240
but they didn't.

2838
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:49,440
Sorry, I'm laughing about this in our chat room.

2839
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:52,760
Spazinator says, Wii 2 would be Wii-Nii in Japanese.

2840
02:33:52,760 --> 02:33:53,760
Haha, Wii-Nii.

2841
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:54,760
Get it?

2842
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:57,720
That name will never get old.

2843
02:33:57,720 --> 02:33:59,160
Alright, fine.

2844
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:00,160
You make a good point.

2845
02:34:00,160 --> 02:34:02,640
Maybe this will be the year we finally fucking get F-Zero on the Wii.

2846
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:03,640
How about that?

2847
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:04,640
No, not going to happen.

2848
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:05,640
Why not?

2849
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:06,640
You're ruining everything.

2850
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:10,080
No, you have to understand, what you're going to get is you're going to get New Super Mario

2851
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:11,080
Brothers 2.

2852
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:12,080
No!

2853
02:34:12,080 --> 02:34:13,080
It's just going to have some different levels and stuff.

2854
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:14,080
What goddamn F-Zero game?

2855
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:19,400
Wait, I can go for New Super Mario Brothers 2, but if Nintendo re-releases Super Mario

2856
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:23,480
Brothers 64 for the 3DS, I will nerd rage.

2857
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:30,280
I'm telling you, look, despite all the hatred, all the vicious, vile hatred that Loki's been

2858
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:35,080
throwing out of Nintendo this entire show, I am telling you, if Reggie comes out at E3

2859
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:41,440
and announces the Wii HD with F-Zero as a launch title, I will jump on stage and do

2860
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:42,440
something very naughty.

2861
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:43,440
I would not buy it.

2862
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:44,440
He's going to snog him.

2863
02:34:44,440 --> 02:34:45,440
No, I'm sorry.

2864
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:46,440
I would not buy it.

2865
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,440
He's still kissing one of the lips.

2866
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:52,560
I have a Wii that's gathering dust because I don't play it, and there's nothing I want

2867
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:53,560
to play on it.

2868
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:54,560
We loaned our Wii out.

2869
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:59,200
I mean, I could play New Super Mario Brothers on it, or Mario Galaxy 2 or something like

2870
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,600
that, but I haven't even finished Galaxy, so I don't know why I'd want to play Mario

2871
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:04,600
Galaxy 2.

2872
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:05,600
It doesn't interest me.

2873
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,100
The only thing that interests me, and this is going back to, once again, what they could

2874
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:12,960
have done right with Mario Kart, is the modded tracks for Mario Kart, because that sounds

2875
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:13,960
interesting.

2876
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:14,960
Ooh, new tracks for Mario Kart.

2877
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,680
I can go play that game again.

2878
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,800
Hell, what's to stop them?

2879
02:35:18,800 --> 02:35:21,720
Seriously, what is to stop them, other than the fact that they probably didn't program

2880
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:26,960
DLC into Mario Kart, but let's just imagine a world where they are forward thinking and

2881
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:28,340
actually did that.

2882
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:30,000
What's to stop them from saying, hey, you know what?

2883
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,640
Instead of putting out a new Mario Kart game, we're just going to have this $10 expansion

2884
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:36,620
that's going to add 16 new tracks to the game.

2885
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:38,040
People would be damn excited about that.

2886
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:39,040
That would be awesome.

2887
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,040
But they're not going to do that.

2888
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:47,080
This is such a forward thinking company that they're like, oh, patches to games, we don't

2889
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,080
need that.

2890
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:49,080
Games are perfect when they come out.

2891
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:50,960
There's never going to be glitches that we'll need to fix.

2892
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:54,720
No, let's not even bother putting a system in there for that.

2893
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:58,920
Did you hear that David Jaffa, completely random tangent, did you hear that David Jaffa

2894
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:03,540
was out there at a game developers conference, and I was reading some article about he said

2895
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:09,720
that companies should be limited to only three patches in a calendar year and they should

2896
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:13,760
not be allowed to patch a game until at least six weeks after release.

2897
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:17,480
No, because you know what all that's going to do is that's just going to leave a broken

2898
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:18,480
game for longer.

2899
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:19,480
I know what he's thinking.

2900
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:24,120
He's thinking, oh, if we limit them to this, then they have to make sure the game is working

2901
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,360
and spend extra time.

2902
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:26,520
No, they don't give a shit.

2903
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:29,120
They'll just wait longer for it to be fixed.

2904
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:30,120
That's all that's going to create.

2905
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:33,960
And he should shut the hell up and just make his Twisted Metal and God of Wars and be done

2906
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:38,200
with it because his crappy Calling All Cars game was terrible.

2907
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:40,960
And he talks too much, and he's seriously annoying.

2908
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:43,840
Damn, Loki, why don't you switch to decaf?

2909
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:44,840
He complained.

2910
02:36:44,840 --> 02:36:45,840
He's like, I made God of War!

2911
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:46,840
I know everything!

2912
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,600
Oh, I made Twisted Metal!

2913
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:50,680
You know, he's a dumbass.

2914
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:55,080
He's just like Cliffy B and fucking, you know, or actually it wasn't even him, it was Mark

2915
02:36:55,080 --> 02:37:00,160
Rain with Epic Games, you know, said, oh, you know, he was saying, like, the Wii's terrible.

2916
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:02,800
And all of a sudden, oh, hey, you know, maybe we should develop games for the Wii because

2917
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:03,800
it's popular!

2918
02:37:03,800 --> 02:37:07,280
I mean, so wishy-washy.

2919
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:12,040
But no, seriously, that's a dumb idea with limiting people to patches and stuff like

2920
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:13,040
that.

2921
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:18,560
I think even some companies, I want to say, it's either Microsoft or Sony charges companies

2922
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:21,600
for putting out patches or title updates for their games.

2923
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:24,040
I want to say, probably Microsoft that does that.

2924
02:37:24,040 --> 02:37:26,800
They'd like them to put out.

2925
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:31,800
So I don't know, I just don't think it's a good idea.

2926
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:37,040
What they should do, though, is if games are buggy, they should have some sort of, I don't

2927
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:41,180
know, penalize the developer somehow for putting out buggy games.

2928
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:44,080
They have to figure out a system to do that.

2929
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:46,160
Make it more expensive to patch?

2930
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,780
No, because once again, it just leaves broken games.

2931
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:51,840
Because look at Activision, like, you know, Black Ops and stuff like that.

2932
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:55,960
There's a lot of stuff that's just broken with that game, and it took them forever to

2933
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:58,400
patch that stuff.

2934
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,400
It's just...

2935
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:02,320
A lot of times you just don't care.

2936
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:06,360
They don't care because their game's selling like crazy, and so what if it's buggy or you

2937
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:07,360
bought the game?

2938
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:08,840
They already have the money from you.

2939
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:13,860
And in all sense, actually, they already had the money from you before you even bought

2940
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:17,340
the game because somebody's got to buy the game to put the game in the store.

2941
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:21,760
So unless you're buying it directly from them, they have your money already.

2942
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:23,240
They have the game store's money.

2943
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:27,040
Well, Rama, thanks for sitting on the line while Loki bitches.

2944
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:28,040
Appreciate it.

2945
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:32,360
I'm glad to do my dutiful duty as a proud member of the O.L. Army.

2946
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,840
There's going to be so much Nintendo fanboy hate mail this week.

2947
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:35,840
I can't wait.

2948
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:36,840
All right.

2949
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:40,040
Well, Rama, thank you, as always, for your call.

2950
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:42,040
Have a good one, buddy.

2951
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:43,040
Later.

2952
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,040
Too bad Loki took up all your time.

2953
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:46,040
All right.

2954
02:38:46,040 --> 02:38:47,040
I'm kidding.

2955
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,200
You know what?

2956
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:51,540
I've had friends tell me the best part of the show is when Loki gets mad at something.

2957
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:52,880
Well, no.

2958
02:38:52,880 --> 02:38:53,880
It's just annoying.

2959
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:56,240
It's just honesty.

2960
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:59,720
It's just how it is.

2961
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:02,560
Game companies now, they know that they don't have to put out a perfect game.

2962
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:04,200
They can just release it buggy.

2963
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:08,480
They get a few more sales out there because they don't have to wait for development.

2964
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:13,560
Then they patch it later on when they let people basically test it out.

2965
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:18,360
Why should they hire beta testers when they can go ahead and have the public test it out

2966
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:21,120
and they figure out what all the bugs are, read their forms or whatever.

2967
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:26,280
Go fix those bugs and then let it percolate a little bit more and see if there's any other

2968
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:28,240
bugs.

2969
02:39:28,240 --> 02:39:30,280
It will save them a little bit of money on the back end.

2970
02:39:30,280 --> 02:39:37,200
Maybe they, for example, the developers or whatever of these games, have deadlines with

2971
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:41,840
their publishers and publishers will pay them bonuses if they hit their deadlines.

2972
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:45,320
Why would they wait extra time to polish a game when they can just release it?

2973
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:48,840
It still sells a lot and they get their extra bonus.

2974
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:50,680
That's how the game industry works.

2975
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:57,880
Fortunately since now these games can be patched on the fly, there's less focus on putting

2976
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:01,640
out a game that's not buggy from the beginning.

2977
02:40:01,640 --> 02:40:03,520
Alright well that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

2978
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:05,200
Thanks to those of you guys that got through.

2979
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,440
To those who didn't get through, call sooner next time.

2980
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:10,360
Probably could have fit in another call or two if we had some sooner.

2981
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:12,440
Alright but for now we're going to go ahead and close the Skypline.

2982
02:40:12,440 --> 02:40:15,720
If you do want to elaborate on some thoughts though or you want to respond to Loki, mailbag

2983
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:18,920
at orangehonestreader.com is a great place to do it or on our Twitter at twitter.com

2984
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:19,920
slash o-l-r.

2985
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:23,360
But for now it's going to be about 9 o'clock Pacific, midnight on the East Coast.

2986
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:26,720
It's probably about time we start to wrap up the show with some final thoughts.

2987
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:27,840
Let me check in real quick.

2988
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:34,280
Any other last minute stories we want to throw in before we wrap up the show?

2989
02:40:34,280 --> 02:40:35,280
Let's see here.

2990
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:36,960
I don't think so.

2991
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:40,720
We'll have a lot of fun stuff coming from PAX East and I expect those of you guys that

2992
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:43,880
are at PAX East next week, I want phone calls.

2993
02:40:43,880 --> 02:40:44,880
This is kind of neat I guess.

2994
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:48,760
Infamous 2 is going to let you create your own missions.

2995
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:51,680
There's something, you know, it doesn't even have to be a Mario Kart type game.

2996
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:56,080
You can just have a game where you just create your own levels and stuff and people eat that

2997
02:40:56,080 --> 02:40:57,920
shit up now.

2998
02:40:57,920 --> 02:40:59,960
That's what the trend is nowadays.

2999
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:00,960
That play, share, create.

3000
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:01,960
Sony gets it.

3001
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:02,960
Somewhat.

3002
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:03,960
Home sucks.

3003
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:07,600
But you can't be right all the time.

3004
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:08,760
Alright.

3005
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:10,440
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3006
02:41:10,440 --> 02:41:11,440
I'm getting worried.

3007
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:13,360
Loki might need to get some eyeball here pretty soon.

3008
02:41:13,360 --> 02:41:15,680
No, I'm just giving you a hard time.

3009
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:16,680
Just menstruating.

3010
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:18,680
Alright, he's menstruating all over the place.

3011
02:41:18,680 --> 02:41:19,680
I'm just...

3012
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:20,680
Copyright.

3013
02:41:20,680 --> 02:41:21,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

3014
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:22,680
One more last thing.

3015
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:23,680
Oh please!

3016
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:24,680
By all means.

3017
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:25,680
And this is just a rumor I guess.

3018
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:27,880
It's a rumor that Strider and Frank West are coming as download content.

3019
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:29,520
Those will be $5 each too!

3020
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:30,520
Thank you Capcom.

3021
02:41:30,520 --> 02:41:33,240
I will pay $5 for Strider Hear You.

3022
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:34,240
I know, I was like...

3023
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:35,240
Is this with Dan and the other room?

3024
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:39,880
I was like, the minute that word Strider left your mouth, I'm like, oh, Jamie and Dan will

3025
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:40,880
get it.

3026
02:41:40,880 --> 02:41:41,880
No questions.

3027
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,200
I really want to play the old Strider NES game.

3028
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:47,120
I know you guys don't like it as much as the Genesis one, but I fondly remember...

3029
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:48,520
The Genesis one's authentic.

3030
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:50,840
I fondly remember the NES one from my childhood.

3031
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:51,840
I really want to play that again.

3032
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:52,840
It's been a long time.

3033
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:55,680
You should come over some time and play through Strider 2 with us.

3034
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:56,680
On the Genesis?

3035
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,680
No, no, no, no.

3036
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:58,680
The PS...

3037
02:41:58,680 --> 02:41:59,680
Oh!

3038
02:41:59,680 --> 02:42:00,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3039
02:42:00,680 --> 02:42:01,680
Oh god.

3040
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,680
It's such a fun game.

3041
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:03,880
It's super easy, but it's lots of fun.

3042
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:04,880
Fun is what's important.

3043
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:05,880
Alright, Loki.

3044
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:06,880
Anything else?

3045
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:07,880
That's it.

3046
02:42:07,880 --> 02:42:08,880
You sure?

3047
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:09,880
I'm done.

3048
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:10,880
Alright.

3049
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:11,880
Do you need some, you know, Allways or something?

3050
02:42:11,880 --> 02:42:12,880
Alright.

3051
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:13,880
Anyhow.

3052
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:17,880
Let's go ahead and wrap up the show tonight by going around in Garibay's final thoughts.

3053
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:18,880
Dark Sakura.

3054
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:23,800
I'm sure glad Loki's back after a C-section.

3055
02:42:23,800 --> 02:42:26,120
My final thought tonight is...

3056
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:27,120
Ow.

3057
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3058
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Uh...

3059
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,960
I don't know.

3060
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:35,720
I thought with a week being off I'd be able to get more done with the Grand Theft Auto

3061
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:39,520
stuff, but some things just take time, I guess, when it comes to modding this stuff.

3062
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:43,320
And also, I will still be angry at Nintendo because they just continue to disappoint.

3063
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:44,320
I can't help it.

3064
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:48,960
If you make stupid decisions, I'm just gonna call you out on it.

3065
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:49,960
Alright.

3066
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:52,360
We'll have plenty more next week on the show.

3067
02:42:52,360 --> 02:42:54,800
Dark Sakura, sadly not joining us next week.

3068
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:55,800
I won't be sad, though.

3069
02:42:55,800 --> 02:42:59,240
But we, I know you won't, but we will be back with another edition of Orange Launch Radio.

3070
02:42:59,240 --> 02:43:00,240
I don't know if we'll have a...

3071
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,240
I'll call in from the road.

3072
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:03,520
I don't know if we'll have a temp co-host or what we'll do.

3073
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:04,520
You have to call me.

3074
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:05,520
Uh...

3075
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:06,520
What's that?

3076
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:07,520
You have to call me.

3077
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:08,520
We can.

3078
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:09,520
Yeah.

3079
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:10,520
So...

3080
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:11,520
On the road.

3081
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:12,520
Yep.

3082
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:13,520
That's it.

3083
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:16,840
We'll do this all again next week, but in the meantime, that's another week of Orange

3084
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,840
Launch Radio.

3085
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:20,800
Remember, of course, if you like what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, we are

3086
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:24,240
not a gigantic website with millions of hits.

3087
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:28,000
We don't have a magazine that backs us or a gaming company that backs us.

3088
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,640
We don't throw a bunch of commercials in your face.

3089
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:34,640
So all we ask, if you enjoy Orange Launch Radio, tell some friends about the show.

3090
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:38,160
The example at the start of the show where a friend was playing it at his LAN party,

3091
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:41,240
perfect example, is an awesome A-plus move.

3092
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:42,920
So just tell people about the show.

3093
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:44,880
Help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio.

3094
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:48,760
Get us some more voices to bring to the table here at the show.

3095
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:51,360
Don't send DarkSakura a dollar.

3096
02:43:51,360 --> 02:43:54,600
But come back next week for more of Orange Launch Radio.

3097
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:58,560
You've been listening to Orange Launch Radio.

3098
02:43:58,560 --> 02:44:02,280
Orange Launch Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

3099
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:10,920
To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific time.

3100
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:16,280
The views and opinions expressed on Orange Launch Radio do not necessarily reflect those

3101
02:44:16,280 --> 02:44:22,240
of the entire staff of Orange Launch Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right

3102
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:23,240
anyway.

3103
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:41,920
See you next week!
