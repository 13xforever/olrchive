00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
Tonight, March 27, 2011, Duke Nukem gets delayed again, details emerge on Forza 4, and have

00:20.720 --> 00:31.440
some 3DS titles already been cancelled?

00:31.440 --> 00:34.860
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:34.860 --> 00:38.680
Lounge Radio, it's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.160
It is episode number 407 for this March the 27th of 2011.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.620
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:46.620 --> 00:49.680
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.680 --> 00:50.680
Woo!

00:50.680 --> 00:51.680
How are you doing, Jamie Summers?

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
Woo!

00:52.680 --> 00:55.680
Alright, glad you're not Diana Prince these days, right?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
Ugh!

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
Yeah.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.680
I'm sorry, the outfit looks like bad cosplay and boob smooshage.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.680
Smooshage.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.520
It looks like boob smash.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.440
You think maybe we'll get a video game out of this new series if it does well?

01:09.440 --> 01:10.440
Probably.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.440
It'd do well if they...

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Okay.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.220
Of course there's DC Universe, that is kind of a Wonder Woman game.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.480
There was this one outfit that they had her in that was sort of this Xena looking loin

01:17.480 --> 01:20.200
cloth-y thing that looked cool.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
Why didn't they stick with that?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.200
I don't know.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.720
It was leathery and hardcore and cool.

01:24.720 --> 01:27.400
Actually the hell with this Wonder Woman stuff, let's get Xena back on TV.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.560
No, but AKA Jessica Jones is going to be awesome.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
Alright.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.560
Anyhow, we gotta get to video games here in a minute.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.120
But of course we can't do a show without Tech Master Loki!

01:38.120 --> 01:42.760
See, the reason they cancelled Xena is because they found out she had a penis.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Did she?

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
No.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.520
She very well could have.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.040
No, because then the stuff with Gabrielle wouldn't have been as awesome.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.040
I don't know.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.560
I can't explain it.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.560
So how you doing, Loki?

01:53.560 --> 01:54.560
What's new with you?

01:54.560 --> 01:55.560
Oh, no.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.560
You're right, you're right.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.560
I'm confusing her with China.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.560
My mistake.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
That...

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
I should never do that.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.560
That's because China did enough steroids.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.560
Not the country, but the wrestler.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.560
No, the wrestler.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
Yes.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.560
Yes.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.560
I should never...

02:06.560 --> 02:07.560
I apologize, Lucy Lawless.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.560
Lucy Lawless is gorgeous.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
Lucy Lawless could play China.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.560
She's awesome.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.560
No, she's awesome.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
In like a lifetime movie.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.560
China is a man beast, okay?

02:15.560 --> 02:16.560
So...

02:16.560 --> 02:17.560
No.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.560
Well, it's...

02:18.560 --> 02:20.200
It's because of steroids.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.040
I understand it's because of steroids, but...

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
Yes.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.040
Oh, man.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.040
I...

02:26.040 --> 02:27.040
Do I feel bad?

02:27.040 --> 02:30.500
Joining us as well in studio, he sometimes does grace us with his presence here on Orange

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
Lawn Radio.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.500
Say hello to Salacious Pop.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.500
What up?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.500
How you doing?

02:34.500 --> 02:35.500
Doing good.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.500
Yeah?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.840
You looking forward to the Wonder Woman TV show?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.080
Do you watch any TV at all?

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
No.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.940
I haven't had access to like just TV to my room in years.

02:44.940 --> 02:47.680
There's no like Hulu that you watch.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.520
Hulu, Netflix, or Torrance, really.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.520
You watch Archer.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.520
You got me hooked on that show.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
That show's funny.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.120
I like that show on FX.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
Really?

02:55.120 --> 02:56.120
You think it's funny?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
Yeah.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
I thought...

02:58.120 --> 03:01.960
I tried watching a few episodes of that to see it, because it looked really funny, and

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
it was terrible.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
Really?

03:03.960 --> 03:04.960
It was just terrible.

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
No, I love Archer.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
It's funny.

03:06.960 --> 03:10.040
I mean, I got to go back and watch it, but like the first few episodes just annoyed me

03:10.040 --> 03:12.100
because it wasn't funny enough.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.100
Maybe you just saw the wrong episodes.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.100
I don't know.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.100
Maybe.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.100
I don't know.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.100
But I don't know.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.100
Every episode I've seen, I've laughed pretty good.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.100
It's very dark.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.360
The secretary that wants to bang everybody, and then when she...

03:22.360 --> 03:25.800
Because it happens during the commercial breaks, and when you see her, she's got the bruise

03:25.800 --> 03:28.160
marks on her neck because she likes to get choked out.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.960
Just like really like, wow.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Yeah.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.360
A lot of awesome stuff.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
All right.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.840
Anyhow, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.560
We always start off the show with How Was Your Gaming Week?

03:37.560 --> 03:39.500
But I need to introduce, of course, the chat room.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.660
We do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

03:42.660 --> 03:46.480
after the Bobby Black Wolf show at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.920
And if you want to join us live in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, where you

03:50.920 --> 03:55.160
can join us in the live chat room where we do interact with the audience.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.640
For example, Defective Candy in our chat room says, why is the State Theater near my house

03:59.640 --> 04:03.960
doing a salute to Charlie Sheen this week, WTF?

04:03.960 --> 04:07.040
People are going crazy about all this Charlie Sheen stuff, and I'm kind of like, I'm so

04:07.040 --> 04:09.040
over it.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Just like Rebecca Black.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.880
You know, like Rebecca Black was cool like a week ago and now, now I think I'm finally

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
getting over it.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.560
Like now, now it's become a parody of itself in a way.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.660
And Charlie Sheen, like this whole, is he doing like a live tour or something?

04:21.660 --> 04:22.660
No thanks.

04:22.660 --> 04:25.460
I'll go watch Hot Shots again.

04:25.460 --> 04:30.160
I never actually watched the interview or heard anything.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.120
I haven't even watched the Friday video all the way through.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.360
Oh wait, are we talking Charlie Sheen or Rebecca Black?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.360
Either of them.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.360
Either of them.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
Oh, sorry.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.040
I've watched Gang Fight more than I've seen.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.200
What is that video you posted on my wall that's like the Friday lip sync or something?

04:45.200 --> 04:46.200
That was, yeah.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.200
That was Alan.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.200
What was that you posted on my walls?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
I got it.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.280
There's a group called, uh, I don't want to get their name wrong.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.280
Bad Lip Sync?

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
Bad, Bad Lip Reading?

04:53.280 --> 04:54.440
Yeah, that was it.

04:54.440 --> 04:59.480
So they, you know, watch the video on mute and they write down what they think she's

04:59.480 --> 05:01.520
saying by how she's enunciating with her mouth.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.280
And then they came up with a song called Gang Fight based off of Friday because of how,

05:06.280 --> 05:10.440
and then if you look at her, look at her sing it and you read the subtitles, that's what

05:10.440 --> 05:12.040
it looks like she's saying.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.200
And it's pretty awesome.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.200
As you're queuing up the video.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.700
I would try to play some of it here, but I don't, it's YouTube's, YouTube's acting ignorant

05:21.700 --> 05:22.700
right now.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.800
It's terrible.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.000
It's very ignorant right now.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.280
I can't believe this, such ignorance.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.840
There it goes.

05:29.840 --> 05:52.320
Let's see if I can play some of this here.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.720
That should be the theme song to River City Ransom part two, which we were talking about

05:55.720 --> 05:58.880
last week.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.280
We got party hats, Barney, Barney.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.040
I'll link that in our chat room for those folks that want to see that.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.080
It's actually much, I could listen to that.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.680
I would buy that on iTunes.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.460
It's an even better or worse, depending on your view, ear worm than the original is.

06:14.460 --> 06:15.460
Cause I'll be in the shower.

06:15.460 --> 06:16.460
Gang, fight, gang.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.460
It's like, stop it.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.240
I don't know if that's something you should be yelling at yourself in the shower.

06:20.240 --> 06:23.440
All right, let's talk about actual video games.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.320
I can't believe we actually let Charlie Sheen, Rebecca Blackchat take up like two minutes

06:27.320 --> 06:28.320
of our show.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
Thank you so much.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.320
Let's talk about actual video games.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.720
And how was your gaming week?

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
Ladies first, Dark Soccer.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.440
How was your gaming week?

06:34.440 --> 06:37.680
My gaming week was, um, epic.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.780
Well, in the terms of RPGs, cause Dan and I are playing, well, more like Dan's playing

06:42.780 --> 06:47.840
through it and I'm watching him while I crochet, um, playing through Final Fantasy and we're

06:47.840 --> 06:51.640
halfway through the first game and when we're done with that, we're going to go to two.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.640
And then since we don't have a home version of three, you know, that's like, that we can

06:55.640 --> 06:59.520
play on the TV, we're going to skip onto four and then we're going to do five, which we've

06:59.520 --> 07:10.640
got a couple of versions of now, um, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 10 to 11 was crap

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
and not really a game.

07:11.640 --> 07:16.360
I was going to say 11 is going to take you a while cause of that whole, you know, I don't

07:16.360 --> 07:19.640
know, 12 years and never got to level cap.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.640
I know.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.400
Well, like it's not going to be, well, you know, I'm just saying.

07:25.400 --> 07:31.400
And then we're going to play 12 and I guess I'll get your 13 back from you again.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.200
Cause I should, I should probably give that to you today.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.640
What about 12, two, uh, 12, two was on the DS, but then there's, well, and it wasn't

07:39.640 --> 07:40.640
really 12, two.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.640
It was like a side story.

07:42.640 --> 07:48.080
There's a 12, two that we saw the, um, 13, two, 13, two that was too damn many games.

07:48.080 --> 07:53.040
Now are you going to be playing, um, the, uh, was it the Final Fantasy four?

07:53.040 --> 07:58.080
Was it the after years or whatever we, it may be out by the time we get to it, we just

07:58.080 --> 07:59.680
might hook up the SNES.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
I don't know.

08:00.680 --> 08:07.000
Well, you can put it on the Wii cause it's, uh, we loaned out our Wii, our Wii's on loan.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.160
If you have a PSP with the video, you'll probably be able to do four with the video.

08:11.160 --> 08:16.280
I don't know, but we've got like anthology versions and I have one if you need to borrow

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
one.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.440
Well, we've, we've got anthology versions, we've got the super Nintendo versions.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.600
I mean, really we've got, I think three different versions of that game that we could play.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
And let me back up a little bit.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.080
Why are you doing this?

08:27.080 --> 08:30.280
Because this is romantic.

08:30.280 --> 08:36.320
Well, back in the day, like I say that like it was like so long ago, but Dan and Dan will

08:36.320 --> 08:40.480
play it through, um, Resident Evil two and I would be his navigator.

08:40.480 --> 08:45.160
It's a little bit harder to navigate on an RPG that he remembers better than I do because

08:45.160 --> 08:47.480
it's been a long time since I've played the first one.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.280
And when I last played it, I played it in Japanese.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.600
I'm a wondrous one.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.480
So are you doing like purist?

08:53.480 --> 08:57.800
Are you doing the NES version or are you playing like the remade one on PlayStation one or

08:57.800 --> 08:58.800
something?

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
This is the remade PlayStation one.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.800
The, was it origins or?

09:00.800 --> 09:01.800
Yeah.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
Yeah.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.080
And, um, which is really just like the wondrous one one in terms of the graphics.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.320
But with the souped up music.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.320
Yeah.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.320
It's not, it's nice.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.320
It's very super Nintendo-y.

09:11.320 --> 09:24.560
And, um, our party is, uh, the warrior, the monk or black belt of the thief and red mage.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.040
So we have, we're offensive.

09:27.040 --> 09:33.440
We know they go out and tell bad jokes and then, you know, get experience for it, I guess.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.880
But Dan likes to name, um, the party after people that he knows.

09:36.880 --> 09:43.920
So the warrior is Dan and I'm the red mage because hi, I'm versatile and can cast fire

09:43.920 --> 09:44.920
three.

09:44.920 --> 09:52.400
Um, then, uh, our friend Becky, he's named, uh, our, uh, monk because Becky kicks ass

09:52.400 --> 09:58.280
and then, uh, mystique is the thief because it's mystique and the thief is always asleep

09:58.280 --> 09:59.280
or dead.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.960
So, which is actually, you know, we kind of made a joke that that's what mystique is like

10:03.960 --> 10:08.040
whenever we have work to do, um, and she's been on the show.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.040
People have heard her.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.920
Um, so it's pretty fun.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.240
And like I was yelling at the husband the other day, I'm playing a little bit of final

10:14.240 --> 10:20.280
fantasy three, mostly at school, like before class when I get a chance to and, uh, playing

10:20.280 --> 10:21.280
well.

10:21.280 --> 10:30.360
And, um, I made a new character, Rebecca black, just because I thought it would be funny.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.400
And I like, now you're stuck with it.

10:32.400 --> 10:37.200
I, well, I like going, running through stormwind occasion and having people stop and go, really?

10:37.200 --> 10:41.920
And I'm like, yeah, just because it's fun.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.240
It's my own version of trolling.

10:43.240 --> 10:49.080
No, it's fun, fun, fun, fun.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.440
I brought this chicken for us to eat.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.600
Anything else for your gaming week?

10:53.600 --> 10:59.140
Uh, pinball, I actually played some pinball.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.140
Good times.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.940
I played some world cup soccer, had a crappy game, and then I had a great game where I

11:04.940 --> 11:08.360
apparently was kicking more ass than I should have kicked.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.760
And then I like drained them on my last two balls.

11:10.760 --> 11:17.720
It was sort of like, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.520
That was what my game was like.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.520
And Dan's my witness.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.320
He can vouch for me.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.800
That was, that's my gaming week.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.800
Awesome.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
And I crocheted.

11:25.800 --> 11:31.640
How about you and your gaming week?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.640
Motorstorm apocalypse.

11:32.640 --> 11:40.560
I finished the rookie story mode thing, which is funny because I didn't know it was rookie.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.000
It's really hard as it is.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.440
So now I'm in pro, which is featuring this one guy who they did like this cheesy, actually

11:47.440 --> 11:51.440
kind of an Archer type intro for.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.400
So I'm interested to see where that goes.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.800
And then what else did I play?

11:56.800 --> 12:00.920
I played more Ridge Racer because it's fun.

12:00.920 --> 12:05.600
I'm glad to actually be able to play Ridge Racer in English now.

12:05.600 --> 12:13.680
I got my, you know, my US 3DS now and I've already put the Japanese one on eBay, so it

12:13.680 --> 12:16.080
should be sold this week.

12:16.080 --> 12:20.320
And got some pilot wings in Super Street Fighter IV.

12:20.320 --> 12:26.680
So those are kind of the, kind of the games to get I guess.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.200
That's really what I'm getting for a while.

12:28.200 --> 12:34.200
I mean the only other game that kind of looked interesting was that Dream Trigger, but beyond

12:34.200 --> 12:37.440
that, I don't see anything until like the fourth quarter.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.980
So I don't know.

12:39.980 --> 12:45.840
And just from my experience today, it is not difficult to find a 3DS, at least in the first

12:45.840 --> 12:46.840
few days.

12:46.840 --> 12:52.200
When I talked to somebody at Gamestop, they had a couple left and they said they were

12:52.200 --> 12:53.560
getting more on Friday.

12:53.560 --> 13:00.840
And then there was a Toys R Us, they had at least seven left, you know, quite a few.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.960
And no one was even interested, there was no one there.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.200
So maybe just because no one thinks of Toys R Us anymore for games.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.920
I still kind of sort of want one.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.200
There's not a lot of games for it that are worth really picking up.

13:12.200 --> 13:18.840
A lot of them are just crap, but there's like two or three that are probably pretty good.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.920
Beyond that, might as well wait.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.760
I mean seriously, it's not a Wii situation right now.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.640
And it looks like they were able to cover anybody that wanted one so far.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.400
And if you haven't found it yet, you'll probably be able to get one pretty soon.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.100
You know I was thinking earlier today about this whole early release date and why Nintendo

13:38.100 --> 13:40.320
really seemed hell bent on getting this thing out in March.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.600
And do you think part of it is to try and sell as many of these as they can before we

13:44.600 --> 13:46.720
really start ramping up for the holiday season?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.140
Like part of me kind of thought if they waited until the holiday season when maybe they had

13:50.140 --> 13:53.440
the Kid Icarus and some of these other games, maybe they wouldn't be able to get as many

13:53.440 --> 13:54.840
third parties on board.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.960
Because I think part of what they really want to sell with this system is like the movies,

13:58.960 --> 14:01.680
the entertainment package and everything.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.360
If they get this out there early, like now, so that way it kind of ramps up through the

14:06.360 --> 14:09.440
summer, kids graduation presents and things like that.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.760
You know, let's say they sell a million of these if not more by summertime, then there's

14:13.760 --> 14:18.280
already that install base so that now they can go to movie companies and say, so hey,

14:18.280 --> 14:25.180
how about putting out that, you know, Tangled or that Tron Legacy out on 3D?

14:25.180 --> 14:27.520
I'm sure that would help, but I don't think that's why they did it.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.560
I think they did it because they're trying to bump up their numbers for this fiscal year.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.000
And by putting it out just before, you know, the fiscal year's up, they figured that they're

14:36.000 --> 14:41.320
gonna sell all their, you know, first batch of systems probably within the first week.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.480
And so that will really boost their numbers for this year and make it look good for their

14:45.480 --> 14:46.480
investors.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.600
That's all I really think the reason why that they did it.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.600
Because if you think about it, look, they've got the system out here, actually it's out

14:52.600 --> 14:56.820
in all regions now, yet not everything's done yet.

14:56.820 --> 14:58.600
Like they don't have the internet browser yet.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.080
They don't have like the store up yet.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.360
That's coming in May.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.460
Because it's not done yet!

15:04.460 --> 15:08.600
So they just put it out to get it out there for people, and it'll be like saying, hey,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.160
that's an awesome car that you bought.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.160
Tires!

15:11.160 --> 15:12.880
Those are coming in May!

15:12.880 --> 15:13.880
It's awesome!

15:13.880 --> 15:19.120
I mean, you could drive around in it now, it sparks a lot, but man, once those tires

15:19.120 --> 15:23.840
hit in, that's gonna be awesome.

15:23.840 --> 15:29.120
That's, you know, part one of the hatred of some of their decisions.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.040
But yet you still bought one like a lamb to the slaughter.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.080
You were in line.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.600
I don't care about their crappy web browser.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
Or their store!

15:37.600 --> 15:39.960
Because I'm not really interested in buying stuff.

15:39.960 --> 15:45.920
Although I do have the, on the Japanese system, I do have that little 3D video that they had.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.440
And they had a little screenshot of Mario, because it's them playing Mario music.

15:50.440 --> 15:57.440
But it's totally what I expected that, I have a feeling that's exactly what their 3D remakes

15:57.440 --> 15:59.880
of these classic games are gonna look like.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.760
It's basically taking the sprite layers and just kind of offsetting them a little bit.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.480
So when you have a background layer 4 or whatever, it's back further.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.320
So they're just gonna build an emulator.

16:09.320 --> 16:13.760
One of the games that I played at E3 last year I think was Xevious, the old school 8-bit

16:13.760 --> 16:17.240
game, which I think was an arcade shooter from Namco back in the day.

16:17.240 --> 16:21.160
All it really was was that all the sprites were on the front layer, and then the background

16:21.160 --> 16:22.160
was on the back layer.

16:22.160 --> 16:27.760
I mean, but I'm not gonna lie, it was a neat 3D effect, but was it a truckload of programming

16:27.760 --> 16:28.760
to get done?

16:28.760 --> 16:29.760
Probably not.

16:29.760 --> 16:35.600
You build an emulator and it runs ROMs, and that's it, you're done.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.760
Question from Tigerclaw in our chatroom, I wonder what sort of 3D implementation they

16:38.760 --> 16:41.480
are gonna do on the 3DS browser.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.580
You think any at all?

16:43.580 --> 16:45.760
Probably not, if anything it'll be- Maybe something in Flash?

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
I don't know.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
Um...

16:47.760 --> 16:51.980
Because one place that, you know, if Nintendo wants to kind of poke Apple a little bit,

16:51.980 --> 16:55.440
they could support Flash, because Apple doesn't support Flash.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.640
They supported Flash- No, they didn't support Flash- I can't remember what they supported.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.480
They supported something with it.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.480
It was very basic.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.760
It was just like the PSP was, where it supported- It used basic.

17:07.760 --> 17:13.560
It supports Flash, but very little Flash, because of the kits that they had.

17:13.560 --> 17:19.340
But I think, if anything, what would be kind of cool is to support the image format that

17:19.340 --> 17:20.800
those 3D pictures are in.

17:20.800 --> 17:25.760
So, like, say if I post that on my, you know, wall or something like that, you know, somewhere

17:25.760 --> 17:28.240
in a webpage, it would be in 3D on yours.

17:28.240 --> 17:32.120
Of course, if they supported Flash, then I could go to one of those websites that's playing

17:32.120 --> 17:38.080
Nintendo games in Flash, on the NES emulator that's in Flash, and I could play those games

17:38.080 --> 17:40.280
on my 3D- It would be very meta.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.900
No, you couldn't.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.800
And the reason why you couldn't is because, just, it doesn't have the processing power

17:45.800 --> 17:49.000
to handle that, something like that, and you don't have the inputs to do something like

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
that either.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.800
So, you know, it's just like down on the PSP, you'd never be able to build something like

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
that.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.800
I'm going to our pal Bobby Blackwell from the chatroom.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.200
The US 3DS has an OK Go music video once you update the system.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
I did hear about that.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.720
Yeah, that looks- That's interesting.

18:03.720 --> 18:07.800
It's probably more exciting than the Japanese, you know-

18:07.800 --> 18:09.360
It's more of a show-off thing, right?

18:09.360 --> 18:12.280
It's like, it's not meant to do anything but say, ooh, 3D, ooh!

18:12.280 --> 18:16.240
Yeah, and it's something that they're saying, we can remove this in a future update.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.900
Okay.

18:17.900 --> 18:18.900
Go ahead.

18:18.900 --> 18:23.080
For the record, OK Go is a good band.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.040
No, they're cool, and they make really good music videos.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.200
Like, you know, everybody remembers the frickin' Treadmill video, and I think that song's in

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
Rock Band.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.160
All their videos since then have been amazing.

18:32.160 --> 18:37.480
Oh yeah, and that one, there was like the dominoes all in one take, that was an amazing

18:37.480 --> 18:38.480
video.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.480
Well, there's the one with the dogs, one with them in the park, with the stop motion.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.400
The one with the dogs is the one that they have on there, yeah.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
Okay.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.560
So, it's like, they're on the cutting edge of music videos.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.520
It's like them and Lady Gaga, right there.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.520
Yeah.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.520
Alright.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.520
They should collaborate.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.640
I saw them play a doubleheader with Snow Patrol a couple years ago.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
Really?

18:55.640 --> 18:56.640
Good show.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
Oh, good times.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.640
Another good band.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.960
Alright, so is that it for your gaming week, Loki?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.160
Some 3DS rants and so forth?

19:03.160 --> 19:09.480
Um, yeah, that, I mean, this isn't really gaming, but I went and saw Sucker Punch yesterday,

19:09.480 --> 19:15.080
which, I don't know why all the hate, really, everyone's like, this is the worst movie ever,

19:15.080 --> 19:17.360
this is totally what's wrong with Hollywood.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.360
It was entertaining.

19:18.360 --> 19:22.400
Oh, damn, Hollywood, why would you make entertaining movies?

19:22.400 --> 19:23.400
I don't understand.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.440
See, Salacious Pop wants me to go see that, and I'm kind of like, okay, really, it's what

19:28.440 --> 19:29.440
you want to see.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.440
It's alright.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
Let me put it this way.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.040
It's kind of funny because it's, a lot of it looks like it's completely ripped off of

19:35.040 --> 19:36.040
different games.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.680
Like, they have this one scene that you probably see in there where they're in a mech and stuff

19:40.680 --> 19:46.200
and fighting these, like, they're reanimated Germans, but they look like Helghast from

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
Killzone.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.720
It's, it's pretty much that.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.200
It looks so much like it.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.200
It's ridiculous.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.200
Are there lots of boobs?

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
Because I'll go see it if there's boobs.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
It's PG-13.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.200
Oh, come on!

19:57.200 --> 20:03.360
No, but it's got, it's got a scene, though, at the very end where they're on a train,

20:03.360 --> 20:07.760
and it's seriously out of the intro of Final Fantasy 13 where they're, like, fighting soldiers

20:07.760 --> 20:12.040
and stuff and doing all the crazy zero-G stuff.

20:12.040 --> 20:16.040
It's badass, but, uh, and it's, like, seriously, I'm like, why couldn't this be a game?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.400
This would be really awesome as a game.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.560
Not so much as a movie, but it'd be really awesome as a game.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.480
I feel like Salacious Pop's dying to say something here.

20:24.480 --> 20:28.960
I'd just like to support Zack Snyder, even though he's sort of on a decline.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.080
He directed it, because Dawn of the Dead remake, awesome.

20:32.080 --> 20:35.280
The 300, problematic, but awesome.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.600
Then Watchmen, I love the novel, but eh, now, now this, so.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.280
So Superman's gonna be great.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.080
It was cool, but, like, I see people's complaints, they're like, well, the first part of the

20:47.080 --> 20:49.240
movie didn't even have any dialogue in it.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.420
So what?

20:50.420 --> 20:51.920
So it didn't have dialogue in it.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.440
Neither did Wall-E, so that argument's null and void, because Wall-E's one of the greatest

20:55.440 --> 20:56.440
movies of the past ten years.

20:56.440 --> 21:01.680
So did the first 20, 25 minutes of the Kubrick classic, 2001, so.

21:01.680 --> 21:07.600
But, like, um, and, you know, it is a little confusing with why she sees this mental institution

21:07.600 --> 21:12.080
as, like, a brothel, you know, burlesque thing or something like that.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.400
And whatever, who cares?

21:13.400 --> 21:18.440
It doesn't matter, because if it was just, like, oh, you know, we're in a mental institution

21:18.440 --> 21:20.720
and stuff.

21:20.720 --> 21:26.640
It's basically her coping with whatever is going on, because apparently, you know, there's

21:26.640 --> 21:32.080
stuff that's going on, that's why she's seeing it as, like, a, you know, a burlesque type

21:32.080 --> 21:33.080
place.

21:33.080 --> 21:38.660
Um, the way she copes with it is kind of goes into this imaginary world thing, where she's

21:38.660 --> 21:40.760
solving how she's gonna escape.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.720
And you see how she's gonna figure that out right in the very beginning.

21:43.720 --> 21:48.920
She figured it all out, but this is just all, like, very quick, like, uh, kind of like Inception

21:48.920 --> 21:52.400
where, you know, there's a lot stuff taking place in a very short period of time.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.960
Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just want porn on the 3DS.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.040
Boobies in 3D.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.560
Is there any porn in 3D?

21:58.560 --> 22:01.880
Well, people can take pictures of the camera and then they can upload it to a website and

22:01.880 --> 22:03.160
you can download it to your flashcard.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.560
It'll be a matter of time before that's up and running.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.880
It would not be difficult to do that.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.200
I would say otherwise, your biggest hope would be, uh, Netflix when it comes out, if they

22:12.200 --> 22:17.040
start doing the 3D movies, uh, and then, like, Piranha 3D is gonna be, like, your boobies

22:17.040 --> 22:19.120
in 3D or whatever else.

22:19.120 --> 22:24.560
Well, once they have it where you can, say, take video with your 3DS and stuff, they'll

22:24.560 --> 22:31.160
find a way to convert video to a 3DS format and, ta-da, you know, they'll be done.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.880
But then again, I don't know, it'd be hard to do 3D.

22:33.880 --> 22:39.840
There's not a lot of 3D video being shot nowadays and 3D monitors aren't really standard yet,

22:39.840 --> 22:42.220
so, I don't know, it might be a while.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.220
But boobies in 3D.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.320
I mean, that's a great use of 3D.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.440
But once again, though, that's just to get people in the seats for, like, Piranha 3D.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.880
I mean, a terrible movie, but, you know, it's... it is interesting.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.160
Like, you know, I would see it for that and the fact that it's just really cheesy and

22:57.160 --> 22:58.440
it's got a lot of gore in it.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.120
I mean, that sounds awesome.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Alright, whatever.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.680
But it's a terrible movie.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.640
You're part of the problem!

23:04.640 --> 23:09.360
No, no, okay, there is something, I can't remember, I'm trying to think if we're actually

23:09.360 --> 23:15.200
going to get into it tonight, um, God, I had a Nintendo thing.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.600
I'll look it up, but there was a rant scheduled about something.

23:19.600 --> 23:22.000
Alright, you will come back to that after the gaming week.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.800
I have to refresh my memory why I was pissed off.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.840
Let me go over to Salacious Pop and check in with him.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.280
How was your gaming week, Salacious Pop?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.920
It was pretty good.

23:28.920 --> 23:34.960
I started one of my biannual playthroughs of Half-Life 2, because I have to revisit

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
that game every couple months.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.960
My favorite thing to do for a Half-Life 2 replay is, you know, the very beginning when

23:40.960 --> 23:46.640
you're on the train, play, marathon it all the way through your arrival at Ravenholm,

23:46.640 --> 23:51.680
which is the very scary, gory, Resident Evil inspired, and I think the developers of Valve

23:51.680 --> 23:54.400
said that this very Resident Evil influenced that zone.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.000
I will marathon it from the beginning to that point and then I'll take a break.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
That's where I'm at right now.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.600
I played some Warcraft 3, the RTS from 2003.

24:03.600 --> 24:09.440
I'm starting to use cheat codes now, just so I can see the story.

24:09.440 --> 24:14.800
And uh, wow, World of Warcraft.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
That's about it.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Alright.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.800
When do you think Half-Life 3 will become a reality?

24:19.800 --> 24:24.840
Yet, Valve said they were going to have some kind of, not necessarily an event, but some

24:24.840 --> 24:28.880
sort of an announcement in April after Portal 2.

24:28.880 --> 24:32.880
If it's not Half-Life related in some way, I will just shed on the floor.

24:32.880 --> 24:37.080
You might want to get a diaper, just in case.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.080
Alright.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.000
I know Loki's dying to get to his ramp, but I'm going to make him wait through my gaming

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
week.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
That's fine.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It's not a bad big deal.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Let me talk about my gaming week real quick.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.920
Um, I played a lot of repeats.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.160
I played You Don't Know Jack, which was fun.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.600
Speaking of diapers, we got the best dissertat ever.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.640
It was, what was it?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.800
It was, uh, boy band or adult diaper?

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
Something like that?

24:56.800 --> 24:58.120
I don't remember what it was.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.960
No, it was inspirational poster.

24:59.960 --> 25:00.960
Yeah.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.920
It was inspirational poster or adult diaper brand.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
I don't know.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.520
I want to ruin the game for you guys.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
It was great.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.520
Laughed.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.840
It's a good, it's just a fun party game.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.720
Got one of our friends into it who hadn't played, uh, You Don't Know Jack.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.960
It called me an idiot to my face.

25:12.960 --> 25:13.960
Yeah, that's right.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.960
The game called you an idiot.

25:14.960 --> 25:15.960
I forgot about that.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
It was, uh, what was the question?

25:16.960 --> 25:21.920
Something about what one of these pop culture references has to do with kissing the Barney

25:21.920 --> 25:22.960
Stone.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.400
And it was like, uh, the correct answer was the kiss from Spiderman because you're supposed

25:26.400 --> 25:28.440
to kiss the Barney Stone upside down.

25:28.440 --> 25:33.920
But Alan buzzed in with Lady and the Tramp and the game goes, Cookie, the wonderful announcer

25:33.920 --> 25:40.400
goes, yeah, you're supposed to slurp spaghetti with the Barney Stone, idiot.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.080
He ended up winning the round anyway, but I took it home at the end.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.640
We couldn't hear any follow up because, uh, Grandpa Warcraft we were playing with and

25:47.640 --> 25:49.080
I were laughing so loud.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.040
We couldn't hear over whatever the announcer was saying that the game had called Alan an

25:52.040 --> 25:53.040
idiot.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.040
Great.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.080
Um, otherwise Torchlight on Xbox Live Arcade.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.400
And every time Alan walks in and I'm playing that, he's like, why aren't you playing this

26:00.400 --> 26:01.400
on PC?

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
But I don't know.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.400
I, I want the achievements.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.400
Don't judge me.

26:04.400 --> 26:10.600
Um, and I went to a Roseville Golf Land this week and rest in peace arcade.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.880
I once knew, you know, we've had a bunch of sad news about, you know, we had the Chinatown

26:14.880 --> 26:19.140
arcade in New York City closed, arcade infinity closed as far as I'm concerned, Roseville

26:19.140 --> 26:20.140
Golf Land closed too.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.440
That place is dead to me.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.240
I mean, if you're not a racing game fan, whichever way, something like Dan's probably all happy

26:25.240 --> 26:29.240
that it's all racing games, but there's nothing there for me now.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.040
He's going to hear me fuss.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.200
There's, there's no Beatmania anymore.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.720
There's no DJ Max Technica.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.880
They even got rid of Supernova 2 or whatever it was.

26:37.880 --> 26:44.680
All they have is DDR Disney, yeah, Disney and Max 2 and then the drum freaks are, I'm

26:44.680 --> 26:45.680
not even into that.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.320
They have guitar freaks and drum freaks that like beat the hell up, but they're there at

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
least.

26:50.320 --> 26:54.840
But I'm just, you know, I'm kind of over it and there's just not a lot of, I mean, I would

26:54.840 --> 27:00.320
be cool if there were some fun fighting games, no Capcom SNK to be found, no Soul Calibur,

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
nothing.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.720
It's, they have an original Soul Calibur 2.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
Where the hell was that?

27:05.720 --> 27:06.720
It was hidden somewhere.

27:06.720 --> 27:11.520
And they also have an SNK, it's like, um, three different King of Fighters and then

27:11.520 --> 27:14.200
a Metal Slug, one of those four in one boxes.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.880
When I played that a couple of months ago and I was laughing last there, I was on the

27:17.880 --> 27:22.200
right side, player two side, and the forward or left on the joystick didn't work.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.880
Yeah, it's just sad.

27:23.880 --> 27:28.120
The only game I played when I was there, I played Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 3, because

27:28.120 --> 27:30.160
like, that is one racing game I do really like.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.160
I'll play that.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.800
They had Initial D5, which, you know, there's a lot of people really into that series, I'm

27:34.800 --> 27:35.800
sure we're playing that.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.760
There's only one game there that I think is still in E real good and that's that Tank,

27:38.760 --> 27:39.760
Tank, Tank.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.920
They do have Tank, Tank, Tank still, but I'm just, I'm over it.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.640
Like, it's so far out there for me to drive to and now with no beat mania, I'm just kind

27:45.640 --> 27:47.240
of like, you're dead to me, bye.

27:47.240 --> 27:51.000
They have a big, um, aside from all the racers, they have the big shooter games with like

27:51.000 --> 27:57.040
the giant plastic gun that, you know, like the, the Sega Rambo, Rambo game.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.960
So this game is kind of fun.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.240
So dad swiped his card for his little girl.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.360
She couldn't have been older than six or seven and she's got this big plastic hollow gun

28:05.360 --> 28:07.240
as big as she is playing Rambo.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
She wasn't doing that.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.840
Well, I was like, that is awesome.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.080
You kill all those mercenaries.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.200
You just, yeah, you go ahead girl.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.200
Go ahead.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.400
I'm going to our chat room at chat dot orange lounge radio.com GOVDA has a warning about

28:19.400 --> 28:20.520
the Blarney stone.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.640
Don't kiss the stone.

28:21.640 --> 28:25.520
All the local boys pee on it to laugh at the tourists.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.200
That's probably some good advice.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
You know what?

28:28.200 --> 28:34.320
I doubt that because the thing is way, way up high in the top of the castle and I've

28:34.320 --> 28:36.280
got video of my uncle doing it.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
Oh really?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
Yeah.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.360
No, not pee.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.920
Your uncle kiss pee.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.440
He went for his honeymoon.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.440
Okay.

28:44.440 --> 28:48.680
But like lady in the tramp, I don't think, I don't really don't think that there's any

28:48.680 --> 28:53.880
way the local boys could get up there and pee on it past security.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
You know what?

28:54.880 --> 28:56.220
That's what boys like to do is pee on things.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.360
So where there's a will, there's a pee.

28:58.360 --> 29:01.120
Uh, anyway, uh, what else did I play this week?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
Otherwise?

29:02.120 --> 29:04.560
Um, that was pretty, I feel like there's something I'm forgetting.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.840
Oh, final fantasy three on the iPhone came out this week.

29:07.840 --> 29:12.040
Um, it's a remake of the DS version of final fantasy three port.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.040
Yeah.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.040
Or a port, whatever.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.360
Uh, well they, I don't know if you'd say, cause they really did soup it up.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.520
It's for retina display and the graphics are like noticeably like, wow.

29:20.520 --> 29:24.080
I mean, I, that was one of the first things I noticed is it looks great on the iPhone.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.800
I mean, granted it's kind of small.

29:25.800 --> 29:29.740
I'm usually not a big fan of games on the iPhone, but you know, because they tailor

29:29.740 --> 29:33.380
made this for the iPhone, the analog stick kind of works.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.260
The faux analog stick they do.

29:35.260 --> 29:40.440
One thing I love about it that I wish more iPhone developers would do, it's not a always

29:40.440 --> 29:46.280
in the same place analog stick, wherever you touch on the screen becomes an analog stick.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.800
So like, you know, in some games you want to be able to see the bottom left corner or

29:49.800 --> 29:51.320
the analog stick sometimes is.

29:51.320 --> 29:54.560
So if that ends up being the case of fantasy three, you can just move your thumb to the

29:54.560 --> 29:56.360
upper right and have your analog stick be there.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.320
And it's, it's very small little improvement that I really like.

29:59.320 --> 30:03.040
Um, the only tricky touchy prices is the price.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.640
Uh, 1599 if you want to buy this game on the iPhone.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.360
So it's a little high, but then you gotta, you know.

30:10.360 --> 30:15.560
What a game is worth is really up in the air right now, and this is where a lot of controversy

30:15.560 --> 30:19.720
comes in, which you've heard about, you know, at Game Developers Conference where Nintendo

30:19.720 --> 30:24.760
was kind of poo-pooing iPhone developers and this whole 99 cents for a game and you know,

30:24.760 --> 30:25.760
all this.

30:25.760 --> 30:31.240
So I mean 1599, yeah it's a lot to ask for an iPhone game, but at the same time the quality

30:31.240 --> 30:35.600
is pretty great and you're getting a port or a remake, whatever you want to call it,

30:35.600 --> 30:38.880
of a $35 DS game.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.200
I mean I actually don't think $16 is too much to ask for this at all.

30:42.200 --> 30:46.880
I mean it is a classic game and you know you're going to get hours of playability out of this

30:46.880 --> 30:48.400
if you're a Final Fantasy fan.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.360
I mean you already know if this game is for you or not.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.760
Either you like Final Fantasy games, old school, or you don't.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.400
But it looks beautiful and the only bummer is that there's no demo, so that you couldn't

30:57.400 --> 30:59.000
really like see for yourself.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.240
But um, I, the very exciting thing about this is that that means they'll probably put out

31:03.240 --> 31:09.240
the 4 remake as well, but at the same time with that PSP one on the horizon, I can't

31:09.240 --> 31:13.280
justify getting 4 on the iPhone when we're going to have that beautiful PSP remake with

31:13.280 --> 31:14.660
the after years.

31:14.660 --> 31:19.600
So it'll be interesting to see if maybe 5 comes out later.

31:19.600 --> 31:24.080
On the phone, that would be tempting, but I'd probably already have the PSP one by then.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.820
And I'm, even though you might have tricked me into buying Final Fantasy 3DS like 5 years

31:27.820 --> 31:34.100
ago, and this, I'll be a little more choosier with 4, so I'm probably not going to get that

31:34.100 --> 31:35.480
on the iPhone.

31:35.480 --> 31:40.060
Something else to keep in mind, they do cut the prices of games quite regularly.

31:40.060 --> 31:43.800
If I had more patience, I probably could have picked this game up for like 10 bucks whenever

31:43.800 --> 31:47.160
the next Square Enix game comes out, but it's going to be a little while.

31:47.160 --> 31:51.360
So anyhow, that's really it for my gaming week.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.360
So Loki wanted to go back to something he was talking about.

31:54.360 --> 31:57.880
Actually, it was just what you were talking about, how Nintendo was poo-pooing on the

31:57.880 --> 32:02.000
developers and stuff like that, the indie developers and the whole Apple marketplace.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.040
They were quoted saying that they don't want garage developers on their system, is their

32:10.040 --> 32:11.040
quote.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.480
You know, people that, they want serious indie developers, but they don't want garage developers,

32:15.480 --> 32:18.760
just people that make games, I guess.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.120
Because they don't want crappy games coming out in their system.

32:22.120 --> 32:26.480
Excuse me!

32:26.480 --> 32:28.560
Crappy games coming out in your system.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.640
The Wii has a ton of shovelware games.

32:31.640 --> 32:38.640
There's a ton of shovelware games coming out every single month from legitimate developers

32:38.640 --> 32:41.560
and legitimate publishers.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.020
I'm sorry, you know, the fact that there's not garage developers out there, somebody

32:46.020 --> 32:50.680
that I don't know might add some innovation to something instead of say, licensing Jelly

32:50.680 --> 32:53.800
Belly or licensing Smiley Face.

32:53.800 --> 32:59.120
The icon of the 60s, 70s, whoo, that's current.

32:59.120 --> 33:04.080
You know, seriously, I just have a problem with them.

33:04.080 --> 33:09.760
I don't think, see once again, this kind of goes back to, they don't understand the whole

33:09.760 --> 33:10.760
online business.

33:10.760 --> 33:15.400
They understand making consoles and making some innovative stuff, but when it comes to

33:15.400 --> 33:17.240
the online thing, they're just lost.

33:17.240 --> 33:22.080
It's like they just don't know what they're doing.

33:22.080 --> 33:26.720
It's getting better, but once again, they need to realize, yes, I understand that a

33:26.720 --> 33:31.040
lot of games come out for 99 cents on the iOS, but you know what?

33:31.040 --> 33:37.280
You might make a lot of money by putting out something simple like that for 99 cents.

33:37.280 --> 33:44.040
I mean, had they not put virtual console stuff out there for four, five, six, seven dollars

33:44.040 --> 33:48.360
and put it all out for 99 cents, I bet you'd be people buying stuff left and right, just

33:48.360 --> 33:50.160
crazy amounts of games.

33:50.160 --> 33:57.400
Well, the other thing too is don't the developers for iOS have to pay, first of all, some sort

33:57.400 --> 33:59.920
of licensing fee and development costs for the systems?

33:59.920 --> 34:02.080
They have to buy the SDK, right?

34:02.080 --> 34:03.080
I think so.

34:03.080 --> 34:06.000
Well, actually, no, I'm not sure if they do have to buy the software development kit,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.520
because I think you can just download that stuff.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.520
Yes.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
There is a license.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.520
There is.

34:11.520 --> 34:16.360
So Apple right there is making their money from developers, regardless if the developers

34:16.360 --> 34:19.840
are making the money or not, the only thing they have to worry about is if anything is

34:19.840 --> 34:25.080
going to basically screw with their branding and screw with their imaging of their system.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.840
I mean, not just the imaging of the system, but all of their little rules that they have

34:28.840 --> 34:30.380
set up.

34:30.380 --> 34:37.220
So really, it's nothing Apple needs to worry about, nothing the developers need to worry

34:37.220 --> 34:38.220
about.

34:38.220 --> 34:41.360
Actually, the only ones who need to worry anything about it are the developers.

34:41.360 --> 34:45.080
Is this a labor of love, or is this something that they want to do for fun, or is this something

34:45.080 --> 34:46.480
they're going to do to make money?

34:46.480 --> 34:53.560
It's a very different model than what Nintendo has to work with, because Nintendo doesn't

34:53.560 --> 34:55.480
have to deal with the same clientele.

34:55.480 --> 35:00.120
Here's the problem with Nintendo and what they're worried about is the fact that they're

35:00.120 --> 35:02.480
a first-party developer as well.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.200
I mean, they put out their own games.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.760
Apple doesn't put out their own games.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.240
They don't care.

35:07.240 --> 35:11.560
Also, if you think about it, there's garage developers, as they would.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.920
They could put out tons of games, and not necessarily all good, but no one's really

35:15.920 --> 35:20.840
saying, oh, God, the Apple marketplace is just crap.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.600
There's so much garbage on there.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.720
Yeah, there's a lot of garbage.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.960
There's a lot of good stuff too, but there's also a good review process where you can see

35:26.960 --> 35:31.960
what's garbage and what's not garbage.

35:31.960 --> 35:36.000
They've got to find some sort of middle ground, both them and the PlayStation Network, because

35:36.000 --> 35:42.720
if they just open it up, they could actually compete with Apple pretty well, I think.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.280
They're not willing to embrace that.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.320
It's tricky to say too where you draw the line, because I look at something like Super

35:47.320 --> 35:51.040
Meat Boy, and that was kind of a... I don't know if you want to say it was a garage developer,

35:51.040 --> 35:52.280
but it was definitely in that middle ground.

35:52.280 --> 35:56.940
It was basically two guys that made that whole game, despite maybe they had somebody else

35:56.940 --> 35:57.940
do the music and so forth.

35:57.940 --> 36:01.080
But the core of the game was two guys, and it's probably one of the best arcade games

36:01.080 --> 36:02.600
to have come out in the past year.

36:02.600 --> 36:08.040
Yeah, but you know what their difference between garage developer and indie developer is?

36:08.040 --> 36:12.120
Well, they don't want fart apps on the Wii is what it boils down to.

36:12.120 --> 36:13.680
And I don't have a problem with that.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.520
What if people want to buy fart apps?

36:15.520 --> 36:16.520
That's fine.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.520
You know what?

36:17.520 --> 36:19.520
No one's going to say, oh, Nintendo sucks because they have fart apps on there.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.520
No, you don't buy it.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.520
Okay?

36:21.520 --> 36:22.520
That's not a big deal.

36:22.520 --> 36:26.000
Well, and the whole point too, I mean, with the little novelty apps like that, they only

36:26.000 --> 36:29.760
really work on something like a phone, something you're going to care about.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.120
Like at breakfast this morning when I broke out the sad trombone.

36:33.120 --> 36:36.720
Does that have, would you ever need to break out sad trombone while you're playing on the

36:36.720 --> 36:37.720
Wii?

36:37.720 --> 36:38.720
No?

36:38.720 --> 36:41.920
Unless someone just made a really stupid joke while they were playing, and then you bring

36:41.920 --> 36:42.920
out your phone into it.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.120
Well, you wait someone to fail really badly on the Wii game that they're playing, and

36:46.120 --> 36:48.680
then you bring out your phone and you play that for them.

36:48.680 --> 36:49.680
Yeah.

36:49.680 --> 36:55.360
But I think to Nintendo, the only difference between indie developer and garage developer

36:55.360 --> 36:58.080
is do people like their games?

36:58.080 --> 36:59.720
Because that's really the only difference for them.

36:59.720 --> 37:00.720
Oh!

37:00.720 --> 37:04.800
Two people developing out of a garage made a popular game, oh well they're an indie developer.

37:04.800 --> 37:09.280
You know, large company makes fart app, oh well they're a garage developer.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.440
That's really, I think, the only, that's their only excuse.

37:13.440 --> 37:18.720
Really, it just comes down to that they're, they're just not embracing what they need

37:18.720 --> 37:21.040
to be embracing, the business model that's going to make them money.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.400
Some interesting comments, sorry, some interesting comments from chatroom, BlackWolf says XNA

37:25.400 --> 37:28.720
indie games sold so well too, or wait.

37:28.720 --> 37:34.040
I would say though, somewhat, I don't think indie games turned out the way that Microsoft

37:34.040 --> 37:35.800
really advertised it at first.

37:35.800 --> 37:39.840
Like, whatever happened to the really good indie games are going to cross over into the

37:39.840 --> 37:40.840
real arcade.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
Like, wasn't that...

37:41.840 --> 37:42.840
They do that.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Like, do they?

37:43.840 --> 37:45.960
They do that, but they have, that, it's, it's so rare though.

37:45.960 --> 37:46.960
It's basically...

37:46.960 --> 37:50.000
Because I know that dishwasher game was supposed to be their big thing, but...

37:50.000 --> 37:55.500
It's a competition that they hold each year, and the, like, top few games actually do get

37:55.500 --> 38:00.180
published as Xbox Live Arcade games, but that's once a year, and we're talking, like, two

38:00.180 --> 38:03.720
to four games, maybe, that get published.

38:03.720 --> 38:08.500
And yeah, there is a lot of junk out there, but once again, there's a problem because

38:08.500 --> 38:12.800
it wasn't until well after that came out that they actually got a peer rating system for

38:12.800 --> 38:17.260
that, and even now, I don't really know if that's that prevalent on there.

38:17.260 --> 38:21.720
People can't make comments, for example, like you can on the Apple App Store, where you

38:21.720 --> 38:26.040
can say, okay, well the reason I don't like this game, it's not because, oh, it's just

38:26.040 --> 38:27.800
crap, you know, I rated it one star.

38:27.800 --> 38:32.120
It's, okay, this game is glitchy, and it doesn't load, or this game is broken, or whatever.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.540
The dashboard, too, is just kind of clunky.

38:34.540 --> 38:38.700
It's a clunky way to find good games, and it really screws over those developers who

38:38.700 --> 38:40.200
don't land in the top spots.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.480
Like, it's just kind of hard to find the things I think you would like.

38:43.480 --> 38:46.760
Like, that's, that's my only thing with XNA is, is like, there's so many games on there,

38:46.760 --> 38:51.200
I don't know where to begin, and a lot of the top stuff is poop, and if I go, and a

38:51.200 --> 38:55.600
lot of people probably look at that and go, really, if this is the top stuff on XNA?

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
Not all of it.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.440
There's some good stuff that gets in there, but, I don't know, I just, I feel like there's,

39:00.440 --> 39:04.600
I feel like Microsoft's got a good idea there, but there's just one thing they're doing wrong,

39:04.600 --> 39:06.360
and it's just the presentation of it all.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.000
And I'm not saying they have to put it front and center.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.080
I get why they put it where they do, but there's ways they could feature it better than they

39:12.080 --> 39:13.080
do.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.080
You know what I mean?

39:14.080 --> 39:17.160
But I want to follow it up with this, because GameGuru in the chat says then, I think Sony

39:17.160 --> 39:22.160
is going to try with PlayStation Suite, and that is something that's on the horizon.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.480
PlayStation Suite, of course, is trying to lure those middle ground developers.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.480
For PC, though.

39:26.480 --> 39:31.560
I mean, it's, I don't know if that's really going to make a big difference, and it's going

39:31.560 --> 39:36.200
to be a little late, because, I mean, we're talking like five years into the console cycle,

39:36.200 --> 39:40.760
and they still haven't had something like that.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.120
I say right now that probably Microsoft's the closest thing that, you know, leased to

39:44.120 --> 39:49.320
Apple as far as at least they're letting independent developers, you know, get the tools to make

39:49.320 --> 39:50.320
games.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.720
And yeah, a lot of them do suck, but there's developers realize that they can make something

39:53.720 --> 39:58.680
niche and something that people like, oh, hey, that's funny, I'm going to download that.

39:58.680 --> 39:59.880
But that's fine.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.740
You don't have to download that.

40:01.740 --> 40:02.740
And that's the thing.

40:02.740 --> 40:04.920
Nintendo has to understand.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.920
Even the stuff that they have people paying, I mean, like, oh, seriously, they have the

40:08.920 --> 40:10.960
Major League Eating game.

40:10.960 --> 40:11.960
I mean, come on.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.000
I mean, come on.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.680
Is that really Nintendo quality?

40:15.680 --> 40:20.520
I mean, is that something that you're really going to say, hey, look, we got Major League

40:20.520 --> 40:22.080
Eating on our system.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.940
Or like the beer pong game or something like that.

40:24.940 --> 40:26.200
There's a lot of crap on there.

40:26.200 --> 40:29.880
And the fact that they're just like coming out saying, oh, well, you know, we don't want

40:29.880 --> 40:31.920
these garage developers ruining our system.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.300
I'm sorry, but all the other developers that you have making crappy games on your system

40:36.300 --> 40:40.240
are the ones, quote, you know, ruining your system.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.040
All right.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.360
Well, we are, what, 40 minutes into the show and have yet to get to the news.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.360
But that's okay.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.360
We're talking about games.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.360
That's how we roll.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
No, we haven't got the video.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.360
Or the news.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.840
We want to get to more of the news.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
But that's okay.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.760
Quickly, some housekeeping before we do so.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.360
Of course, you can always add us on Facebook.

40:56.360 --> 40:57.360

40:57.360 --> 41:01.800
And of course, follow us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash O-L-R. That's how you can keep tabs

41:01.800 --> 41:02.800

41:02.800 --> 41:06.120
Or visit our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.540
Otherwise, nothing really coming up for the schedule of the future.

41:10.540 --> 41:13.400
Just keep it on rolling like we always do here.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.240
Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.680
Let's get into some video game news for the week.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.680
Loki, start us off.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.680
Yummy, yummy, yummy news.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.000
Now, this is kind of funny.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.760
I kind of laughed a little bit.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.000
But it's not that big a deal.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.280
And I know it's just the fact that the reputation of this game.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.160
Duke Nukem Forever delayed.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.360
It's only delayed a month.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.600
And that's not a big deal.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.620
And really, I kind of explained this a little bit on Twitter.

41:42.620 --> 41:45.200
It was coming out in May.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.040
Right now in May, there's a ton of crap coming out.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.540
Literally like a week after Duke Nukem Forever comes out, we have L.A. Noire.

41:52.540 --> 41:53.800
Then there's Brink.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.000
And then Fear 3.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.460
And Hunted, The Demon's Forge.

41:58.460 --> 42:00.000
Dungeon Siege 3.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.020
MX vs ATV Alive.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.440
I mean, just a ton of AAA games coming out during that time.

42:05.440 --> 42:12.000
Lego, I mean, it's not really direct competition, but Lego Pirates of the Caribbean.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.480
So I mean.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.580
School's letting out, right?

42:14.580 --> 42:16.800
So it's like, school's letting out, here's all this shit for you to play.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.080
But it's not typical that May's a busy month.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.720
Usually June is a little bit busier.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.200
May's kind of eh.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.140
And then April's is dead.

42:25.140 --> 42:26.320
Which April is still dead.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.280
But like last year, they had a lot of good games coming out in May and it kind of worked

42:29.280 --> 42:30.280
out for them.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.300
So they're kind of doing that again.

42:33.300 --> 42:37.840
But it's a good thing that I think it's moving to June, for them at least, because June right

42:37.840 --> 42:39.360
now doesn't have much coming out.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.280
It has a few AAA games and that's it.

42:41.280 --> 42:46.080
I mean, there's stuff that's not announced yet, but very few games compared to May coming

42:46.080 --> 42:47.080
out.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
So, whatever.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.080
It's a month.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.780
It's not like ten years.

42:51.780 --> 42:56.960
Now if it's late again and again and again and again, then, well, you know, there's not

42:56.960 --> 42:59.400
really anything we can say about that.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.400
Did you watch the little video?

43:00.400 --> 43:01.400
I just watched the video.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
The video was funny.

43:02.400 --> 43:09.240
Like, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, we know, here, you know, it was, it was pretty, pretty

43:09.240 --> 43:10.240
fun.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.520
Well, they had to know they were going to take a lot of shit for delaying the game again.

43:12.520 --> 43:17.040
But you know, see, here's the thing, I agree it's not as big of a deal as I think some

43:17.040 --> 43:21.120
people would make this out to be because, let's face it, this game has truly been in

43:21.120 --> 43:24.920
development only as long as Gearbox has had it.

43:24.920 --> 43:29.880
Because I don't fault them for the time that 3D Realms had the game, because, in my opinion,

43:29.880 --> 43:35.440
they started over, maybe with the assets and so forth, but you know Gearbox basically started

43:35.440 --> 43:36.800
from quote-unquote scratch.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.660
I mean, maybe there were some scraps here and there that they recycled, but Gearbox

43:39.660 --> 43:41.400
probably had to build this game from the ground up.

43:41.400 --> 43:44.840
So I don't fault them for the ten year delay this game took.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.460
I don't think it was really their fault.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.460
So one month, whatever.

43:47.460 --> 43:50.240
And besides, you have to thank them for actually putting the damn game out.

43:50.240 --> 43:53.760
I mean, they could have, it could have just like, no one could have bought it.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.960
They just said, ah, forget it, you know, Duke Nukem's ten years ago, who cares?

43:57.960 --> 43:58.960
Right.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.680
Or they could have changed the title, you know, or something.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.680
Oh, hell no.

44:02.680 --> 44:03.680
That wouldn't work.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.680
Yeah, I know.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
It's just one of those things where it's like, nah, at this point you just have to put it

44:05.680 --> 44:06.680
out.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.680
Yes, I have an idea.

44:07.680 --> 44:11.800
Let's change the title to Eat Lead, and then, you know, max that.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.400
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says, it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever if it wasn't delayed

44:15.400 --> 44:16.560
at least one more time.

44:16.560 --> 44:20.480
And it wouldn't be Duke Nukem Forever also if they weren't offending somebody.

44:20.480 --> 44:26.800
And of course, you know, they have their multiplayer modes that have been announced, Duke Match,

44:26.800 --> 44:27.980
Team Duke Match.

44:27.980 --> 44:34.920
But the one that is kind of pissing people off is Capture the Babe.

44:34.920 --> 44:38.320
And apparently it's like Capture the Flag, obviously.

44:38.320 --> 44:44.680
But the babe will sporadically freak out, and you have to, I guess, slap her to get

44:44.680 --> 44:45.680
her back in line.

44:45.680 --> 44:46.680
Oh, great.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.680
On the rump.

44:47.680 --> 44:52.080
A little playful spank to keep her in line, because that's a good message.

44:52.080 --> 44:55.200
They said it in the face, but, well, something.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.200
No.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.200
Slap.

44:57.200 --> 44:58.200
Slap his ass.

44:58.200 --> 45:01.440
Is that how I can keep Dark Sakura in line when she yells at me on the show?

45:01.440 --> 45:05.840
Bitch, please.

45:05.840 --> 45:12.920
I don't want to be a widower at 33.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.520
But yeah, I mean, it's Duke Nukem.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.520
Come on.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.080
I heard Fox News did a thing on it.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.080
Come on.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.080
Fox News.

45:20.080 --> 45:21.080
Fox News is stupid.

45:21.080 --> 45:25.480
The media is going to just take this opportunity to say, look at the games you're buying your

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
kids.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.480
Look at the games.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.480
Look like this.

45:28.480 --> 45:30.320
Every single video game is slapping women on the ass.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.040
And they will turn you gay.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.740
All of them will turn you gay.

45:34.740 --> 45:36.400
That's Fox News for you.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.440
Rob, was Duke Nukem 3D responsible?

45:39.440 --> 45:44.160
Come to think of it, I was playing Duke Nukem 3D that year that everything changed.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.160
I don't know.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.160
Perhaps.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.600
No, it has nothing to do with it, obviously.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.920
Come on, people.

45:51.920 --> 45:52.920
I don't know.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.140
Duke Nukem made me very happy.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.840
I thought Duke Nukem 3D was a great game.

45:55.840 --> 45:59.960
I'm looking forward to this new one, even though I know I'm going to be so disappointed.

45:59.960 --> 46:04.600
I'm going to be so, so very disappointed that I sort of don't care.

46:04.600 --> 46:09.720
It's like, I don't know, it would be like Death Race 3000.

46:09.720 --> 46:14.040
I mean, you know, they're never going to live up to the awesomeness that was Death Race

46:14.040 --> 46:15.040
2000.

46:15.040 --> 46:19.960
Hell, the remake didn't live up to the awesome Roger Corman classic, but you still kind of

46:19.960 --> 46:24.760
want to watch it anyways because it's got more killing in it and it's got cheesy stuff.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.200
We'll have Jason Statham.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.200
And no hand grenade.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.200
I mean, come on.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.200
That was awesome.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.200
Aw.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.200
All right.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.640
Well, moving on to something a little more artful, maybe you're familiar with a company

46:35.640 --> 46:37.800
called The Weinstein Company.

46:37.800 --> 46:41.680
This was, of course, the company that was started by the brothers Weinstein getting

46:41.680 --> 46:45.240
into films when they left Miramax, they went their separate ways, right?

46:45.240 --> 46:50.160
And they actually put out, or they distributed, they don't, you know, make the movies, but

46:50.160 --> 46:51.160
they're a distributor.

46:51.160 --> 46:53.640
They distributed The King's Speech, which of course won the Oscar this year.

46:53.640 --> 46:57.280
Well, The Weinstein Company is getting into games.

46:57.280 --> 47:03.160
They formed this week a strategic consultancy, whatever that means, with Beefy Media.

47:03.160 --> 47:04.720
I love that.

47:04.720 --> 47:09.240
The Weinstein Company, arthouse maker, films up with, teams up with Beefy Media.

47:09.240 --> 47:13.960
Anyhow, they're supposedly going to be capitalizing on Weinstein properties.

47:13.960 --> 47:19.680
Now, The Weinstein Company also owns Dimension Films, which is responsible for a lot of the

47:19.680 --> 47:22.000
horror movies you see out there right now.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.600
So this would include things like Scream, which, you know, is getting a new movie after,

47:25.600 --> 47:32.200
what, 10 years, very soon, Halloween, Hellraiser, Children of the Corn, Scary Movie, Spy Kids.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.880
All of these would now fall under this possible TWC games table.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.880
Because Spy Kids is frightening.

47:36.880 --> 47:40.320
Well, I mean, there could be a kids game in there.

47:40.320 --> 47:44.240
I mean, you know, like, I don't know, I haven't even seen the Spy Kids movies, but I understand

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
they're what?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.240
James Bond for kids, right?

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
Pretty much?

47:47.240 --> 47:49.280
It's like Robert Rodriguez doing his community service project.

47:49.280 --> 47:53.600
There was Spy Kids and then along that sort of franchise there eventually became Lava

47:53.600 --> 47:54.600
Girl and Sharkboy.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.400
And that's how we got Taylor Lautner.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.400
He was Sharkboy.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.520
Oh, really?

48:00.520 --> 48:02.200
You know a lot about Taylor Lautner.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.520
That kind of frightens me.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.520
And that's, it was the origin of Machete.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
Oh, okay.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.080
Well, that's okay.

48:08.080 --> 48:12.000
So does Weinstein Company own Kill Bill or does that fall under your box?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.240
They put out pretty much all of the Quentin Tarantino stuff.

48:14.240 --> 48:15.720
Pulp Fiction was Miramax.

48:15.720 --> 48:18.000
I want to say Jackie Brown, yeah.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.300
So where's my Kill Bill video game?

48:20.300 --> 48:21.440
Maybe that could be a part of this.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.440
I don't know.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.640
It very well could be.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
Very well could be.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.840
Especially if they do a sequel, which they weren't talking about doing.

48:27.840 --> 48:28.840
So that's it.

48:28.840 --> 48:32.980
You know, obviously no game announcements right now, but they are exploring these brands

48:32.980 --> 48:34.480
in the video game universe.

48:34.480 --> 48:37.200
I would say especially some of these scary games I could see happening.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.240
Like a Halloween video game makes a lot of sense.

48:39.240 --> 48:43.280
And yes, I do remember there was one on the Atari 2600 years ago.

48:43.280 --> 48:48.880
And you may remember, I mean it's not unlike, you know, movie studios to get into the game

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
business.

48:49.880 --> 48:52.160
Warner Games putting out Mortal Kombat next month.

48:52.160 --> 48:58.480
I mean, Fox is in games, but they don't really do a whole lot, they don't do anything console-wise

48:58.480 --> 48:59.480
right now.

48:59.480 --> 49:03.520
They like some online downloadable games.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.120
But Warner Games is a big one, for sure.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
And Disney.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
Disney Interactive.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
All right.

49:09.120 --> 49:14.720
Well, we'll see what comes of this in the future, but right now, nothing but an announcement.

49:14.720 --> 49:18.520
And who knows, maybe a Scream tie-in game just in time for Scream 5.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.520
Or 6.

49:19.520 --> 49:20.520
Or 21.

49:20.520 --> 49:21.520
Whatever.

49:21.520 --> 49:25.840
Hey, I gotta admit, I want to see the new Scream movie just because I love the old one.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.640
Which is, I know is completely weird because I talk about how much I hate horror movies

49:29.640 --> 49:35.520
like Saw and all that stuff, but to me, Scream is like, I don't know, like, Scream is okay.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.960
I mean, yeah, it's a little gory, but it's not like Saw sick.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.960
I didn't mind the Scream movie, actually.

49:39.960 --> 49:40.960
Yeah, Scream's cute.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.360
I was just like, what's your favorite Scream movie?

49:42.360 --> 49:43.360
Showgirls.

49:43.360 --> 49:47.160
Yeah, Scream's very, like, tongue-in-cheek, and, like, I like those movies.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.160
I'll see those.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.160
Yeah.

49:49.160 --> 49:53.680
I just hope that Hayden Panterre is the before-the-credits killing.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.720
No spoilers in chat.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
I will destroy you.

49:55.720 --> 49:56.720
All right.

49:56.720 --> 49:57.720
Dark Saga.

49:57.720 --> 49:58.720
Well.

49:58.720 --> 50:03.000
Well, speaking of kids' movies and scary, Pokemons!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Yay!

50:04.000 --> 50:10.520
Well, it looks like that Pokemon Black and White has sold two million units in the first

50:10.520 --> 50:17.120
two weeks in the U.S., and five million plus copies in Japan, so, uh, yeah, they've made

50:17.120 --> 50:19.520
their money.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.920
Seven million people playing the game.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.520
Or at least buying it and reselling it on eBay.

50:24.520 --> 50:30.280
Well, we were at, um, at Dimple, which is a local resell place, and they're saying that

50:30.280 --> 50:34.160
basically if they get any of the Pokemon games in, it's gone the same day.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.160
Oh, I'm sure.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.160
Yeah, so.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.160
I can-

50:37.160 --> 50:38.160
Kids eat this shit up.

50:38.160 --> 50:41.440
Hell, adults eat this stuff up, too, like, you know, Miek LaTov, who's been on this show

50:41.440 --> 50:42.440
in the past.

50:42.440 --> 50:44.560
And he was playing Black and White, but he imported them.

50:44.560 --> 50:46.700
He imported it and he got the regular ones.

50:46.700 --> 50:47.700
But you know what?

50:47.700 --> 50:53.400
Pokemon's cute, it's just, I don't know, when I played, what did I play on the Advance?

50:53.400 --> 50:55.800
Ruby or one of, I don't know, I'm so lost.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.960
Ruby and Emerald was the Advance generation.

50:57.960 --> 51:03.080
The character I played on the Advance felt like the same damn game I played on the old

51:03.080 --> 51:04.880
school Black and White Game Boy.

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
You know what I mean?

51:05.880 --> 51:10.480
Like, I feel like the series hasn't really evolved in a long time.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.840
Maybe Black and White does something different that I haven't seen yet.

51:12.840 --> 51:14.840
I have to admit, I'm kind of curious.

51:14.840 --> 51:15.840
I do kind of want to play it.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.840
Oh, Black and White, you can collect poop.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.840
Oh, yay.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.080
And their poop does special things.

51:21.080 --> 51:23.360
Oh, hooray.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.360
So yeah.

51:25.360 --> 51:30.880
Anyhow, so yeah, I'll probably check that out eventually, but you know there's going

51:30.880 --> 51:32.420
to be a Pokemon 3D at some point.

51:32.420 --> 51:33.420
You know what?

51:33.420 --> 51:34.420
Pokemon...

51:34.420 --> 51:35.420
You know what?

51:35.420 --> 51:36.760
I'm done with Pokemon.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.920
I'm really done.

51:38.920 --> 51:42.680
I would never say never, because what if there was a Pokemon Snap on the 3DS?

51:42.680 --> 51:46.400
Okay, that's different, but I'm done with the conventional Pokemon games.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.840
Pokemon MMO has to happen someday.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.520
I will live to see a Pokemon MMO, damn it.

51:51.520 --> 51:54.640
There is sort of one that someone made called PokeFarm, like a website.

51:54.640 --> 52:00.360
I mean, official Reggie Fils-Aime coming out and saying, Pokemon the MMO, you bitches have

52:00.360 --> 52:02.360
been asking for it for years, here you go, thwack.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.360
You know Nintendo wouldn't do an MMO.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.200
I have it tied to my harem of women down here.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.360
You know Nintendo really wouldn't do an MMO.

52:08.360 --> 52:09.680
Too much that they couldn't.

52:09.680 --> 52:13.180
If Nintendo wants to prove they've really changed, which I don't know why they would

52:13.180 --> 52:17.040
want to prove that, but whatever, they could do a Pokemon MMO.

52:17.040 --> 52:19.300
It'd be something like Animal Crossing.

52:19.300 --> 52:23.080
I think too, a Pokemon MMO would probably feel like one of those Disney MMOs, because

52:23.080 --> 52:28.360
Pokemon is so much for kids, like, you know, it would be an MMO with pre-determined phrases

52:28.360 --> 52:32.740
that you can say, and you know, it'd be more modeled like a Disney MMO, but that would

52:32.740 --> 52:39.280
be better than nothing, but that's just me, so.

52:39.280 --> 52:45.760
The fact that you'd be able to chat online would be a step ahead for Nintendo.

52:45.760 --> 52:52.280
I read a list a couple days ago, it was top 10 or top 15 most disturbing Pokedex entries

52:52.280 --> 52:55.280
that are inappropriate for kids that you didn't know were in the game, and it's like, this

52:55.280 --> 52:59.040
Pokemon wears the skull of its dead mother and it cries all the time.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.040
Cubone!

53:00.040 --> 53:01.040
Yeah.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.040
It was Cubone.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.040
Yeah.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.040
What?

53:04.040 --> 53:05.040
Really?

53:05.040 --> 53:07.400
This one is the soul of the dead child who comes back and eats other souls.

53:07.400 --> 53:11.520
I had heard something about this new game is set in a New York City environment and

53:11.520 --> 53:15.600
there's actually a place called Ground Zero that looks all destroyed, and it's supposed

53:15.600 --> 53:18.280
to be like an alien thing, but it's still like, dude!

53:18.280 --> 53:19.560
Not cool!

53:19.560 --> 53:22.400
You know?

53:22.400 --> 53:26.800
This might be, why didn't you just think there's a million things you could have called that.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.680
Maybe that hits a little close to home, especially for kids.

53:29.680 --> 53:32.440
Anyhow, let's move on.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.120
More gaming news, Loki.

53:34.120 --> 53:40.040
Yeah, so there's some rumored features that are going to be coming to Forza 4.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.760
This is coming from a special survey that they had.

53:42.760 --> 53:48.680
Of course, a survey that was not supposed to be leaked out, but I don't know what was.

53:48.680 --> 53:53.000
So, some of the information that people have gathered are speculating coming from there.

53:53.000 --> 53:58.920
Of course, one of the things they mentioned about Forza and the Kinect is you'll be able

53:58.920 --> 54:02.000
to use the Kinect to drive, I guess.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.600
So they're going to have some controller-free racing.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.480
I guess you're going to be holding your hands like you're holding a steering wheel.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.480
Like the U-Force?

54:10.480 --> 54:16.120
Like the U-Force or like Joyride.

54:16.120 --> 54:22.160
They're saying it's going to support over 500 cars from 80 different manufacturers.

54:22.160 --> 54:29.880
They're saying that there's also a no-assist expert mode, a new career mode involving an

54:29.880 --> 54:32.280
automotive world tour.

54:32.280 --> 54:37.320
They're going to increase the variety in challenges and events that you participate in.

54:37.320 --> 54:43.880
The game's going to look better with 10 times more graphic fidelity and new lighting and

54:43.880 --> 54:46.400
shading models.

54:46.400 --> 54:50.600
Also I guess they're saying that...

54:50.600 --> 54:52.040
This is kind of cool.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.360
They're going to be doing...

54:53.360 --> 54:58.120
And once again, this is all you need to do in your damn games.

54:58.120 --> 55:03.800
Just make it better with Kinect by introducing head tracking.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.640
Awesome.

55:05.640 --> 55:11.740
And I guess they're going to also have voice control for menus and air faces.

55:11.740 --> 55:12.740
That is awesome.

55:12.740 --> 55:14.640
But hey, head tracking.

55:14.640 --> 55:15.640
It's not that difficult.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.800
Add it to every single goddamn first person shooter that you have.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.800
Done.

55:19.800 --> 55:20.800
I mean you don't need to have...

55:20.800 --> 55:22.360
You're still using a controller.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.600
It's just tracking your head to make it slightly more realistic.

55:24.600 --> 55:26.200
I have to admit that would be kind of cool.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.440
Why is that so difficult?

55:27.440 --> 55:29.440
I mean it...

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
Nintendo could be...

55:30.440 --> 55:33.920
As much as I am not a fan of the 3D metroids, it's the first thing that comes to mind with

55:33.920 --> 55:37.840
like a Nintendo backed first person shooter that would be really cool with the head tracking.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.800
Could you imagine a time crisis with head tracking?

55:40.800 --> 55:44.280
Where you peek over or around a corner?

55:44.280 --> 55:45.280
That would be cool.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.760
Police 9-1-1?

55:47.760 --> 55:50.200
Which was also one of the few machines they had at Roseville Golf Land.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.200
So police 9-1-1-2.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.760
One of the few machines they had that was working.

55:53.760 --> 55:54.760
I know, right?

55:54.760 --> 55:57.280
They should have, what was it, rescue 9-1-1.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.600
Sir William Shatner.

55:58.600 --> 55:59.600
No.

55:59.600 --> 56:00.600
Well.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.400
Quick comment from our chat room at chat.orchestlandtrader.com.

56:02.400 --> 56:05.400
They're behind a little bit because of the delay, so it goes back to the Pokemon story.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.500
Act F wanted to correct something saying it's not...

56:07.500 --> 56:10.120
It's actually not called ground zero though.

56:10.120 --> 56:11.280
It's called Relic Castle.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.400
Maybe it was something to do with the translations.

56:13.400 --> 56:15.000
One of my friends is saying something.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.240
But of course, you know how rumors go.

56:17.240 --> 56:18.240
So alright, fine.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.240
There you go.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.480
A little correction issue there.

56:21.480 --> 56:25.640
Alright, so if that's all Loki has to say about Forza.

56:25.640 --> 56:28.240
Yeah, that's all I have to say about Forza.

56:28.240 --> 56:30.520
I don't know.

56:30.520 --> 56:31.520
Head tracking.

56:31.520 --> 56:35.840
I'm very interested to see that implemented in more games.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.920
I really think it's a good idea and it's simple.

56:37.920 --> 56:41.440
If you don't want to use the Kinect stuff because you're worried people are going to

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
be like, oh casual.

56:42.440 --> 56:43.440
Head tracking.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.440
That's all you got to do.

56:44.440 --> 56:45.440
And you can even say, hey look.

56:45.440 --> 56:46.440
It puts you in the game.

56:46.440 --> 56:47.440
And guess what?

56:47.440 --> 56:49.600
You don't have to use the stupid, you know, Kinect stuff if you don't want to.

56:49.600 --> 56:50.600
That's awesome.

56:50.600 --> 56:54.100
Well, now, I don't know if you guys remember when Nintendo did this.

56:54.100 --> 56:56.300
This was way before the 3DS.

56:56.300 --> 56:57.840
Way before the Game Boy.

56:57.840 --> 56:58.840
Even the NES.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.800
They used to do these little LCD Game and Watch games.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.200
That's where Mr. Game and Watch comes from.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.200
I've got a couple.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.200
Yeah, I know.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.200
The old school stuff.

57:06.200 --> 57:08.080
The old Mario Brothers one and some other ones.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.560
I had the Cenet Mixer one.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.560
Oh, good times.

57:10.560 --> 57:11.560
Yeah.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.920
So yeah, these Game and Watch games are really old school.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.320
They even have like a Donkey Kong Jr. one and so forth.

57:16.320 --> 57:20.640
Well, there's this new website that came out this week and, or at least caught wind on

57:20.640 --> 57:24.640
the game blogs this week called Pikapeak.com.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.200
No that's not a Pikachu thing.

57:26.200 --> 57:27.400
It's maybe Pikapik.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.400
I don't know.

57:28.400 --> 57:32.160
P-I-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to check this out.

57:32.160 --> 57:37.360
You can actually play a variety of the Game and Watch LCD games, at least until this website

57:37.360 --> 57:38.360
gets shut down.

57:38.360 --> 57:43.160
But really, Nintendo's gonna really try to shut this down over old LCD Game and Watch

57:43.160 --> 57:44.160
games.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.160
I don't know.

57:45.160 --> 57:46.160
So yeah, I'm on it right now.

57:46.160 --> 57:48.780
I'm trying to find a fun LCD game old school to play here.

57:48.780 --> 57:49.780
Let's see.

57:49.780 --> 57:52.320
What did I find here?

57:52.320 --> 57:53.320
Otto Slalom.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.320
That doesn't look like fun.

57:55.320 --> 57:58.240
I want to play Mario Brothers or something.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.240
Mary Cook.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.440
Oh, I remember this one.

58:01.440 --> 58:02.440
Good times.

58:02.440 --> 58:03.440
Oh, you can even move back and forth.

58:03.440 --> 58:04.440
That's done very well.

58:04.440 --> 58:08.320
Yeah, and you can like move back and forth with S and K. Not the game company, but S

58:08.320 --> 58:10.920
and K. So let's see if we can start.

58:10.920 --> 58:12.440
Here we go.

58:12.440 --> 58:15.320
Good times.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.280
Listen to the sounds of LCD games.

58:17.280 --> 58:18.280
That's right.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.120
This is the stuff that Jamie, Matt, and I grew up on.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.120
Ooh, it looks like it's Russian.

58:22.120 --> 58:26.440
Yeah, the machine's probably copied from like a Russian machine or something.

58:26.440 --> 58:29.320
Anyhow, good times.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.320
So check that out.

58:30.320 --> 58:35.280
T-C-A dash P-I-C dot com if you want to see some real old school gaming that'll entertain

58:35.280 --> 58:37.960
you for like five minutes.

58:37.960 --> 58:43.640
Well let's move on to something just a little bit more serious than the old school games.

58:43.640 --> 58:50.860
There was a particular person on Bioware's forums that was complaining about the inclusiveness

58:50.860 --> 58:55.920
of the romance in Dragon Age 2.

58:55.920 --> 59:00.960
And he basically was saying that he represents the straight male gamer.

59:00.960 --> 59:05.880
And that he didn't like that...

59:05.880 --> 59:08.200
Basically his whole little thing was very generalizing.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.880
He's like, we are your demographic.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.160
You need to cater to us.

59:13.160 --> 59:16.120
Basically saying, oh, and women don't play these games.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.120
We play the Sims.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.120
Yeah.

59:18.120 --> 59:22.240
And he's like, the last thing is there should have been much more focus on making sure us

59:22.240 --> 59:23.760
male gamers were happy.

59:23.760 --> 59:28.040
And he said, now immediately I'm sure that some male gamers are going to be like, you

59:28.040 --> 59:29.040
don't speak for me.

59:29.040 --> 59:30.040
I love Dragon Age 2.

59:30.040 --> 59:35.160
But you have to understand the straight male gamer cannot just lumped into a single category.

59:35.160 --> 59:40.160
He also uses commas very poorly.

59:40.160 --> 59:47.560
So a long letter was put out by Dave Guider of Bioware.

59:47.560 --> 59:53.840
Basically saying, first of all, because you say you represent the straight male gamer,

59:53.840 --> 59:55.840
we know you don't.

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.080
I don't recall an election being held where you are the representative of all straight

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.160
male gamers out there.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.920
And basically saying, you know, I'll read a few lines here and there.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.720
It says, the romances in the game are not for the straight male gamer.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.900
They're for everyone.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:14.480
We have a lot of fans, many of whom are neither straight nor male, and they deserve no less

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.560
attention.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.040
We have good numbers, after all, on the number of people who actually use similar sorts of

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:24.440
content in DAO, and thus don't need to resort to anecdotal evidence to support our idea

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.240
that the numbers are not insignificant.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:34.800
And basically going on, you know, it's basically saying, yeah, we don't care, you need to get

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.000
your head out of your ass and realize that you're not the only person in the world.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.800
And there's one paragraph, if you don't mind me reading it, that is like the most awesome

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.800
thing.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.800
It's about lies to the world in general, and I think everyone needs to take this to heart.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.600
And if there is any doubt why such an opinion might be met with hostility, it has to do

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.760
with privilege.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.540
You can write it off as political correctness if you wish, but the truth is that privilege

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.640
always lies with the majority.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.040
They're so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.440
They don't see anything wrong with having things set up to suit them.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.760
What's everyone's fuss all about?

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.080
That's the way it should be.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.560
Anybody else should get used to not getting what they want.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.600
It's basically saying, well, yeah, everyone else might have catered to you, but hi, this

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.760
is the real world and the universe doesn't revolve around you.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.120
And the part of the argument I don't get is that the game doesn't force you to do any

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.640
particular path.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:37.000
Like, it's cool that it's so open-ended that you truly get to mold the story.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.320
And I can't tell you how many women fan their panties over Dragon Age.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.440
This is an insanely popular series with women.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440
Tiara is a big fan.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
Oh, yeah.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.000
I see it all over my Facebook with women who don't even normally play a lot of games.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.160
And I went and watched one of the sex scenes in Dragon Age 2.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.960
I watched the lesbian stuff because it was cute.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960
They were so cute.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.960
They were so adorable.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:00.640
How could anybody be upset about that?

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:06.300
And on top of that, it gave you options that you could not go through with the romance.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.800
You could say the quote, wrong thing to make the romance not happen.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.120
It was totally like, it was, it was actually pretty realistic how it was set up.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.120
And what I also don't understand where this dude is coming from is it's like, well, have

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.800
you ever watched an episode of Will and Grace?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.560
Like did it make you gay to watch a gay storyline play out or something?

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.640
You know what I mean?

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.060
It's kind of like, what's the big, even if, even if there really wasn't an option, a good

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:32.360
game is still a good game.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.840
A good story is a good story.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.200
It's kind of like, what's your big...

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.360
And you know what my big thing is that the biggest people that get their panties in a

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:51.680
bunch over, you know, anything that's remotely, I would say, homocentric is there's gotta

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:57.400
be some insecurity on his part if, you know, he's like, oh, well this makes me uncomfortable

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.440
and it's gotta be personal insecurity, I think.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.360
My understanding is that even if you have a male main character and you want to play

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.920
him as, with a hetero pairing, which means you're hitting on all the women NPCs, the

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:16.280
male NPCs that you could do a same sex pairing with, they still flirt with you a little bit

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.880
so that it's, you know, the way that the game is set up is to where you can tell, okay,

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.660
well, if I want to do it with this male character, the flirtation path is there.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:33.480
I think a lot of these, you know, bro gamers don't like that accessibility even if it's

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.460
not something that they would RP into the game themselves.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:40.800
Like they basically, if there is a same sex option, they want it buried so deep that you

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.940
have to go to Game Facts and look up how to do it.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:48.820
They don't want male computer characters hitting on them in a video game because they don't

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.820
like it.

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.860
And you know what, this is what I say to them and pardon me for saying so, tough shit.

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.500
It doesn't matter.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.880
You're going to have to get used to, you know, things are going to happen in life that you're

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.920
not comfortable with.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.060
Things are going to happen that are not fitting in with your worldview.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.060
Get used to it.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.060
It's called reality.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.500
Let me also kind of phrase it this way.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.780
I'm sure this guy doesn't listen to the show, but let me like just kind of give you a dose

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.700
of reality.

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.580
Flip the tables, dude.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:23.840
I am a homosexual gamer and have been forever and I have to play through all these games

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.940
that have straight storylines.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:30.620
Does that make me dislike the games even more because I'm not allowed to be gay in these

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.620
games?

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.160
No, because they're stories.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.060
And like for instance, Final Fantasy X, you know, hetero love between Titus and Yuna plays

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.260
a big theme in that whole game, but I love it.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:46.280
Like I get verklempt at that game because I think it is so amazing, at least at the

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.940
time, you know, especially graphically and the storytelling in that game for the time

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.000
was so, you know, emotionally moving.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.620
Did I, was I not able to get into it because Titus wasn't hitting on Wakka?

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:02.260
No, that's like, it does, a good story is a good story.

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.260
You know what I mean?

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:08.740
Well, I sort of put it also into the mindset of a tabletop gamer.

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:14.140
You think about this, when you are in game, you're supposed to be in character.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:19.700
And if it's in your character's nature to, you know, flirt with a girl, then you stay

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.040
within your character's nature.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:25.080
If your character's nature is to flirt with a dude, it's in your character's nature.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:31.740
If they are completely, you know, say you're playing like the most uptight paladin, they're

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.380
supposed to get uncomfortable whenever and anyone flirts with them.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.740
You know, that's the type of thing.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:38.940
You are in the mindset of the character that you're playing it if it's immersive enough

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.480
of a game.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.620
And maybe that's where the discomfort comes from, that he was in the mindset of the character.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:45.620
I don't know.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:51.940
I mean, but the whole point of you, the whole thing is that you are in game as your character.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:57.300
Unless it's saying you are you in the game, but no, you're playing this person that's

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.740
living in this life at this time.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:04.540
And yeah, I mean, do they get mad when the dudes in Fable, you know, show a little bit

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.540
of interest?

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.540
Hmm?

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540
It's just ridiculous.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.300
Bro dude needs to get over it.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.780
And it's not even the, I mean, A, it's an option.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.520
B if you go down, if you take your character down that path anyway, it's not like you're

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.380
forced to watch anal sex.

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:19.380
Okay.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.380
I mean, let's be real.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.380
It's a fade.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.300
It's artful and you know, whatever.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.600
It's not like, I would understand maybe if like a game like forced you to watch sex encounters

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.320
you're not comfortable with, but let's face it, there's no game that's tacky like that

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320
at all.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.860
Except maybe the guy game.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.000
How many years ago was that?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's just the point.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.020
I mean, and if you're that insecure, then you know what, go find yourself a good therapist

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:51.060
and deal with your insecurities instead of taking them out on developer of the game who

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.220
is catering to their audience.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.540
Essex in our chat room says, I'm a big old queen, but I love Lulu in Final Fantasy X

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.540
just for that outfit.

01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.540
Right?

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.540
I know.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.540
She was beautiful and vicious.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.980
I was pissed that she wasn't really a central character in 10 too.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.120
I was a little upset though that she didn't look pregnant.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.120
That's true.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.260
Canyon in our chat room says my character's nature is to flirt with everybody.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.780
There you go.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:19.780
In a Final Fantasy X too, they made Lulu a stay at home mom.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:20.780
Totally destroyed her form.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.780
10 too.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.780
Oh, 10 too.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.780
That's right.

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.780
All right.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.540
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates, some games coming

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:32.340
out soon to a Target and Walmart and GameStop near you.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.340
Yes.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.540
Um, there's some decent stuff coming out this week.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:39.580
Um, you know, not to mention, I'm not going to mention all the 3DS stuff that's coming

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:42.540
out today because, well, it's today and not next week.

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.660
Um, some other cool stuff though that will be coming our way.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:51.780
WWE All-Stars on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii and the PSP.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:57.220
Um, if you're looking for like an arcade style WWE game, kind of, uh, reminds me of like

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:02.060
stuff that they had way back on, like the Super Nintendo NES, that kind of stuff.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:08.660
Um, Dynasty Warriors 7 on PS3 and 360, of course a tie-in with the new movie, Hop on

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:17.460
Nintendo DS, um, let's see, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 12 coming quite early this year on PlayStation

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:30.780
3, Xbox 360, and on the Wii, um, Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky, the limited edition

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:38.780
that's, uh, coming out on PSP as well, um, Shift 2 Unleashed on PC, PlayStation 3 and

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:49.180
Xbox 360, uh, NASCAR 11 on, uh, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Country Dance, um, taking

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.820
the Just Dance series and putting some country music with it, of course it's not actually

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:58.840
by Ubisoft, it's kind of a knock-off, but, you know, same type of thing.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.820
And that'll be on the Wii, uh, Pinkalicious, based off of like some children's book, that's

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:09.720
on Nintendo DS, Zuzu Puppies, yes, it's not hamsters anymore, it's just, you know, animals,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:17.420
so now that's coming out on Nintendo DS, and, um, and that would be it.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.620
Again, the chat's delayed a little bit, but I have to read this comment from chat, because

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:25.500
I love it so much, before I get to the Japanese release dates, Bochikawa in our chatroom

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.980
says, if it's a choice, it's a choice in a game, you've got another choice, don't play

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:31.980
the game.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:32.980
Well said, my friend.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:36.660
Alright, on to Japanese release dates, what's coming out in Japan very soon.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:41.020
On the 7th of April, Bullet Soul comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360, as well as a game

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:46.660
called Nailed, no, that is not a sexual connotation, it actually looks like an ATV racing game,

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:54.580
I don't know where Nailed has to do with that, but yeah, Top Spin 4, the, uh, did you see

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.020
that very controversial Serena Williams commercial, I don't think it made our show world tonight,

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.500
did you see that, uh, Top Spin 4 commercial?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.500
It was dumb.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:12.500
It was not even that, that controversial at all, so, alright, um, also moving on to, uh,

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:17.680
releases on the Playstation 3, Nailed is coming out of there as well, as well as Top Spin

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:24.460
4 there as well, um, moving on to the Nintendo Wii, nothing, cause things have dried up there

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:25.460
a little bit.

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:31.580
Um, on the 3DS, March 31st, uh, you have to look forward to Blaze Blue Continuum Shift

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:38.500
2, Naruto Shippuden, Nierate Imakai Sakyo Ninkai Kessen comes out as well, and then,

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.220
uh, a whole, like, Super Street Fighter 4 themed stuff.

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.980
You want a cleaning cloth in Chun-Li?

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.980
You got it.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.980
So forth.

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.980
Yeah, I'm kind of mixing up my weeks here, cause sadly there's, like, nothing really

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:54.060
coming out on the 360 or the PS3, but granted, with all that's going on in Japan right now,

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:57.340
I'm sure some things kind of got moved around, so, you know.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:02.100
Uh, lastly on the PSP, BlazBlue, BlazeBlue, whatever you want to call it, Continuum Shift

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:09.220
2 is out there as well, and, and, and, Oni Chambara Special, yeah, March 31st.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:10.860
Let's move on to Europe!

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:17.340
Well, not a whole bunch, it's a short list, um, on the 30th we have Islands of Wakku,

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:27.100
and Strania the Stella Machina, I guess, Machina, um, that makes me think of your cat.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.100
The Stella Machina?

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.100
The Stella Machina.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.100
She is not a robot as far as I'm aware.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.100
No.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.500
She is a pain in the ass a lot of times, though.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.140
So I've seen.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:42.260
And Castlevania, Lords of Shadow Reverie, and Motorstorm Apocalypse, which, as Loki

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.220
would have us believe, is awesome.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.540
It is very awesome.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.660
Is it like, ah, awesome?

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.660
Yes it is.

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.660
It's O-Face, apparently.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.660
It is that awesome.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:57.160
Alright, let's move on with some more news, we're just a little ways away from the classic

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.900
game of the week, real good one this week too, one that I think a lot of you have played,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.540
but we'll get there after a couple more news stories.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:13.740
Ah, yes, um, so, this is always fun, um, Sony, and I don't really know if this is a big deal,

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:20.620
but I guess they're transferring the online service operations, um, to a new division

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:23.820
of their company, I guess.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:28.980
The Sony Network Entertainment Inc. instead of Sony Computer Entertainment of America

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.460
and that kind of stuff.

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.460
I don't know.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.820
Everybody's like, oh my god, you know, it's another part of their company.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:42.180
It's not like they're giving your money away or something to like, I don't know, the people

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:47.060
that run Ragnarok online or something like that, although that would be quite funny.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:48.660
I love Ragnarok.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:53.140
But um, yeah, okay, so, I don't know, a lot of people are covering this and yeah, it's

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:59.140
coming, the change is going on April 1st and basically you're being asked to enter into

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:04.820
a new terms of service, blah blah blah, I mean, so what?

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:10.100
So they're changing the name of that division.

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:12.260
It's more of like a consolidation thing.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.420
It really doesn't seem like a big deal.

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.420
I would think people that, like if you use the PC store, which I don't know if a lot

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.540
of our listeners do, I would say if anyone does, it's probably Spazinator who always

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:24.060
gives us the PSN updates and all that.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.980
It's consolidating with the one on the Playstation 3 and it sounds like a good thing.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:34.060
It's probably all moving towards something more unified for the NGP or whatever they

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.780
ultimately call that thing.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:40.500
And honestly, if Microsoft does it, with the Zune points or whatever, I guess the Zune

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.340
isn't around anymore, but you know what I mean, like the points for Microsoft on the

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:50.100
360 are the same you can use to buy stuff on the Zune or on your PC through Windows

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.440
Media, it's just competitive or whatever.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.160
It's no big deal, really.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:02.780
But if it is something you'd like to know, at least they're changing their name.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.460
I'm sure people are like, oh my god, it's something to do with hacking.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460
No, it's not.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.460
It's just, whatever.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:08.460
They're changing something.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.860
They're not going to lock it down all of a sudden differently.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:17.140
They're not going to make you retina scan yourself before you can log into your account

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.140
or...

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.140
I don't know.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.260
I'd be glad though, it is Sony Network Entertainment and not Zynga.

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.180
That's all that matters.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:30.180
Alright, a couple updates for you on what's going on in the gaming community for Japan

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.640
Relief and the tragedy that's happened over there.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.260
Some really cool stuff happening at Sega.

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:38.020
Sega is auctioning off some very rare collectibles.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.780
There is a Valkyria Chronicles poster that's going to be auctioned off.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:45.660
A Dreamcast hoodie as well that is being auctioned off.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:47.140
Lots and lots of cool stuff over at Sega.

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:51.660
If you want to see more information on that, go to their blogs, blogs.sega.com.

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:54.220
A Yakuza track jacket.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.220
There's a lot of...

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:56.220
A Dreamcast bag.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:01.100
There's like, I'm sure, tons of stuff in here where DarkSocko would be like, what?

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.020
She's like, I have four of those already.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.860
Well, she wouldn't have a signed copy of Valkyria Chronicles for the PS3, I know she doesn't

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860
have that.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:12.260
Or Virtua Tennis Sweatbands, I don't think I've seen those before.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:17.020
But how about an Outrun art signed by Yu Suzuki, I bet Dan would be all over that.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:20.340
I have a photo of Dan shaking the man's hand.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:21.660
Alright.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.020
But still, it's for Japan Relief, so it is a good cause.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.020
It's a good cause.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.020
It's a great cause.

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:31.720
Alright, also going on in the gaming world, Gamers Heart Japan.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.620
It's something that's on Facebook right now, and you can check out their website, gamersheartjapan.com.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.620
What is it?

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.780
It's supposed to be a special collaboration between developers and journalists.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.380
It's gonna be discussing, it's like a TV special you could say, but I don't think it's supposed

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.060
to be on TV.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:51.900
But it's gonna feature folks throughout the gaming industry, Tim Schafer, Peter Molyneux,

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:56.780
all these folks talking about how the Japanese have impacted the gaming industry for us and

01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:59.460
how the Japanese will continue to shape it in the future.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:04.220
And you know, folks from G4 and Destructoid are gonna take part in this as well.

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:09.260
So you can check out more information on that, gamersheartjapan.com.

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.340
And that's a whole special thing they're gonna put together that's just, you know, I think

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.540
it's kind of similar to what the music industry did.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:17.220
You saw a lot of like music industry, Heart Japan.

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:20.900
I wouldn't even say I saw somewhere on the internet like voice actors for anime, Heart

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.900
Japan.

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.660
I don't remember what they called it, but there's a lot of this like Heart Japan stuff

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:28.060
going on right now, and you know, all for a great cause.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:33.700
So as much as we give the television stuff crap sometimes, this actually sounds pretty

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:34.700
good.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:39.060
Like even if there wasn't the whole tragedy and fundraising going on behind this, it actually

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.100
sounds like an interesting special.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:45.680
And just the fact that it is for such an important and good cause makes it even better.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.740
So very cool.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:51.500
I kind of, it almost sounds to me like the closest thing you can kind of do in the gaming

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.900
industry to like a telethon type thing.

01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:00.260
Like you remember when another big tragedy happened, Katrina and George Clooney put together

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:04.020
all the celebrities to kind of do that telethon for Katrina relief.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:09.540
This kind of seems like the gamer equivalent of that for a, you know, different type of

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.540
tragedy.

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.540
So kind of neat.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.180
Definitely thinking outside the box for raising funds.

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.180
I think it's a good idea.

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.220
I think it's a great idea.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.740
So I'll be checking that out myself.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.020
All right, for now though, let's move on into the classic game of the week.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:26.620
You know, every week here on the show, we like to take a trip down memory lane and look

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:31.580
at a game that helped us become who we are today.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.460
And this is a game that is near and dear to all of our hearts here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:36.460
It's not a music game.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:37.460
It's something else that's pretty awesome.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.500
It is dark soccer's classic game of the week.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.940
She's going to jump in the vault right now and pull that game for us.

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.940
Dark soccer.

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.940
What is the classic game of the week?

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:51.220
Classic game of the week is dark stalkers, which in Japan was known as vampire and in

01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.780
Europe as vampire hunter.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:18:03.860
There was a trilogy of these fantastic, super fun and one of my favorite games ever.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.020
I'm sure I've brought up the game room I worked in at my college before where we had the World

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.780
Cup soccer and Killer Instinct.

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:15.340
Well, this was another game that we had and there's this one guy who was super epically

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.220
awesome at this game and I tried so hard to beat him and finally did and I felt so accomplished.

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.260
But yeah, there were three different games in the series.

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:27.060
There was a vampire slash dark soccer's.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:32.100
There was vampire hunter slash night warriors, which is the second one and vampire savior.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.980
And then there was a vampire hunter two and a vampire savior two.

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:40.180
There were sort of upgraded versions and then the rereleases which came out later.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:47.860
So basically the theme of the game is that you've got kind of different monsters in this

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:52.500
particular universe and hunters, but you've got, you know, your vampires.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:57.440
You have your ghost, your demon possessions, your zombies.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.440
The characters of the game.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.580
There was Dimitri Maximoff, who was the vampire, John Talbien, who was the werewolf, Victor

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:10.100
von Gerdenheim, who was a Frankenstein's monster, Lord Raptor, the zombie, Morrigan, who was

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:17.140
the succubus, Anna Kars, who's a mummy, Felicia, the cat woman, Bishamon, who was this possessed

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.980
samurai armor.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:27.500
You had Riku, who was the fish man and Sasquatch, who was a Sasquatch, what a shock.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:34.260
And then you had your boss characters, who was Huitzil, who was like a Mexican robot,

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:39.260
like an ancient Aztec robot and Pyron, who is this flame guy.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.220
And it was a pretty cool game, lots of fun, very street fightery.

01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:47.860
You could air block and crouch walk and had chain combos and different things.

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.260
You had a super combo, so you could do a special attack.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:57.580
And it actually would, though, drain as you played if you didn't keep doing stuff to refill

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.580
it.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:03.460
It came out on PlayStation in 96 and had a new opening theme, which was really cool.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:08.100
But it was the theme for the American Dogstalkers animated series, which was kind of crap.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.860
And then we had Vampire Hunter, or Night Warriors, as it came out over here.

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.260
So we got Donovan and Sienko in there.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:20.940
And you could also play as Huitzil and Pyron, still the bosses.

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:26.540
And you had a normal mode, and then you had an easy mode that was an auto block mode and

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.540
different chain combos.

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.340
And it came out on the Saturn, which I've got this version.

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:32.720
Super, super awesome game.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.860
It was probably one of the best fighting games that I think came out in the US.

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:40.260
And of course, the Japanese version was the same, because the Saturn had more memory for

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.260
it.

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:47.580
So then Vampire Savior came out, which was the one that brought in Jetta, who was totally

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:55.980
my character for a while, and Lilith, who was like the missing piece of Morgan's soul.

01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:00.380
And QB, who was always fun, and baby Bonnie Hood, which she actually had a better name

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.380
in Japan.

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.740
It was Bulleta.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.580
She was super fun to use.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:09.820
And I love her ending, because it's like this monster family watching TV.

01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:13.500
There's been this massacre, and everyone will watch out for a human person.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.940
They're like, oh, these humans are so scary.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.940
Keep us safe, daddy.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:18.500
I'll protect you, son.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.180
And then you see her walking along the path to the werewolf's home, and all scary and

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.180
everything.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.180
But anyway.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.980
Yeah, I haven't played this game 50,000 times.

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:34.420
And the Saturn version was really sweet for this, and it used the Capcom 4-meg RAM cartridge.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.020
Got this one, too.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.340
And so it was fully arcade perfect.

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:42.140
It was fantastic.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:46.580
And you could play as...

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.980
It was all kinds of different bonus characters in it.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:56.140
You had Shadow, but you didn't get Marionette, who was another hidden.

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:59.060
Shadow basically was...

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:05.380
You could assume the identity of the defeated character in there, and then...

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:09.460
So if you beat Morrigan, your next fight you play as Morrigan, that type of game.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.660
It was really cool.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:15.100
And of course, like I said, there was also the upgraded ones.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:22.420
There's Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2 that were the upgraded versions.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.540
Different tweaks.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.260
You also had slightly different...

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:34.140
I think that they redid some of the sprites for it, too, if I'm correct.

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:39.260
And you also had Bishamon and Shadow as the secret characters, and you had Marionette

01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:42.140
that were basically mirror matches.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.980
And then there were the re-releases.

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:49.940
There's Vampire Chronicle, which was the one that came out on Dreamcast.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.660
It was a Dreamcast direct mail order.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.100
And I believe I have that one, too.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:56.340
Pretty sure I do.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:59.380
And it came out over here as Dark Sulkish Chronicle, the Chaos Tower.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:03.000
There's a PSP version.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.900
There's also Dark Sulkers Collection that came out on PS2 in 2005.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:12.460
And then there was an animated series that was kind of crap.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.340
And then the OAV series, which is actually kind of cool, called Vampire Hunter the Animation

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.360
Series put out by Viz.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.900
There were manga, different comics that came out.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:30.500
And then there was Dark Sulkers graphic file that was a bunch of screenshots and storyboards

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.500
and concept art.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.500
But that was put out by Udon.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.540
Udon is fantastic in their Capcom related art.

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.060
I follow a few of their people on DeviantArt.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.300
They are amazing artists.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:45.460
Their attention to detail, the way they capture the style, they're fantastic.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:56.780
And then in Love Hina, actually, there were the main female characters were the costumes

01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:03.380
of Boletta, Sienko, Felicia for Halloween in chapter 86 of the manga.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:07.540
And then in Marvel vs. Capcom 3, you can play as Morgan, Felicia and Sienko.

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:14.660
So this is probably one of the absolute best rated games ever.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:23.740
UGO ranked it as number 19 and there's also a rumor that there's going to be another Dark

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740
Sulkers coming out.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:25.740
That'll be awesome.

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:29.380
I don't know how founded that is, but.

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.380
Well here's a comment from Mr. J100 Matt in chat that might lend some credit to this.

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:37.940
I remember the MVC 3 panel at New York Comic Con someone asked the devs if they would consider

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.540
making a Dark Sulkers sequel or remake.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:45.460
Ryota Nitsuma said that Capcom might consider it if people wrote a ton of letters requesting

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.460
it.

01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.460
Get on it.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:53.380
Well, you know what, imagine, okay look how well Street Fighter 4 did.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.820
Look how Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is doing.

01:24:55.820 --> 01:25:00.660
It sort of would be the next logical step for them to release a Dark Sulkers game.

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:05.460
Bring out all the old characters, make them all playable, and then throw in some new ones.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.500
You've got all kinds of supernatural mythos out there.

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:12.340
There's that Street Fighter cross Tekken game though still on the way that I think has gone

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.300
to the back of a lot of our minds, but it's coming.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.900
Capcom has multiple development houses, they can do it.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.740
That's the classic game.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:25.660
Alright, your classic game of the week, an arcade classic, Dark Sulkers, what's that?

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:28.460
Another hidden character, Dee.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:34.860
Which was the fully, you know Donovan was half Dark Sulkers, well there was the version

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:37.820
of him that was all evil and vampirey.

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.100
And his final, his ending, he just shows up fighting Anita, the little girl that was following

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.460
around with him, only she's older, but it fades out and that's his ending.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.460
Alright.

01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:50.980
Well there it is, your classic game of the week, Dark Sulkers from the arcade by Capcom

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:54.740
and lots of those characters still showing up today in other Capcom games, so Dark Sulkers

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:55.740
is definitely not forgotten.

01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:58.760
Alright, we're going to take a break guys, but don't go anywhere, we'll be right back

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.660
with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio, including your tweets, so get those in at twitter.com

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:03.780
slash o-l-r.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.020
Some rapid fire news tonight involving music games and virtual console news, then we'll

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.740
get into some other news in the back half of our show, including the results of The

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:16.100
Great Kong Off, some Resident Evil news, and a list list tonight.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.780
We'll tell you the topic when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:26.980
this.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.340
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:35.580
We are live on this Sunday evening, March the 27th of 2011 with our 407th episode of

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.020
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:41.260
Welcome back, we had a fun first half talking a little bit about the 3DS launch and talking

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:44.060
about BioWare and Forza and some other stuff too.

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.420
We're going to get into plenty more gaming news and your twitter topics in just a minute

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:53.380
here, but first we want to do some rapid fire news right after we do some plugs for our

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:57.100
spinoff shows, or side projects if you will.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.420
Dark Soccer, I believe your side project had a pretty big show this week, right?

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:04.340
Yes, we had a fantastic show.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:11.880
The show that I do is called Comic Insanity, and it's basically comics, I do this with

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.500
Tiara, who you've heard on the show, she's hosted before, Mar and Marvel, and also with

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:22.820
Dan Shadow, and we basically discussed comics, but we had a special guest for our recording

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:29.940
today, which you can hear on Tuesday, downloaded from Infamous.net, N-F-A-M-O-U-S.net.

01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:38.580
We had Todd Stashwick on the show, and he is doing, actually writing an online comic.

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:46.380
It's called Devil Inside, it's on his website, ToddStashwick.com, but he's also known in the

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:54.300
TV sci-fi fan community as kind of a monster and bad guy, you know, he's taken those kinds

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.300
of roles.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:59.300
He's been on Buffy, he's been on Angel, he's on Supernatural, one of my favorite episodes

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.300
too.

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.260
He played Dracula, that was cool.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.660
Like a black and white Dracula was really cool.

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:08.340
He could have been a character in Dark Stalkers.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:14.980
But he's such a great guy, really fun to talk to, and geeked it up with us this morning,

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:15.980
so it was really cool.

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:16.980
Awesome.

01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:20.820
But read Devil Inside, seriously, it's good.

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:23.580
Like anyone could get into this, it's so good.

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:27.860
Well, the side project I had, we didn't have anyone from Hollywood on our show this week,

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.200
we did have a pretty exciting guest.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.100
If you like the World of Warcraft, check out Horde House, we're the best little Horde House

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:34.100
in Azeroth.

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:37.520
Now with a website, HordeHouse.com, finally, we have an official website for the show.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.140
So if you like World of Warcraft, myself and Extfer talking about it.

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:43.420
And this week, we did have a celebrity of sorts, a podcast celebrity, the lovely Michelle

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:48.060
Madison from Video Game Outsiders, and Warcraft Outsiders, also here on the All Games Network,

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.060
joined us.

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.540
And Warcraft Outsiders has been on hiatus for a couple months, so I think it was good.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.400
Michelle got to kind of get her Warcraft fix on with Extfer and I, and I was really worried

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.740
that Extfer was gonna make one too many dick jokes, but Michelle had a good time, she really

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.040
played along with it.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:03.340
And Michelle had a book come out, and congrats to her.

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.940
You may not know this, but she does the whole, her and her sister are behind the Damn You

01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:07.980
autocorrect.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:08.980
That is them.

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:11.600
And they've had a lot of success with that and just had a book come out.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.980
So please support Michelle and buy that book.

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.980
I think that's great.

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.980
And other great podcasts on the All Games Network.

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:22.180
Again, HordeHouse.com, even if you don't like WoW, apparently, I had my buddy Brad from

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.300
Pod Culture said, I don't even really, you know, I haven't gotten into WoW, but your

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.300
show was, you know, still pretty good.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.580
And it got me to get a trial account.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.580
Sucker.

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.580
Addict.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.580
No.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:38.020
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some rapid fire news.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.220
Loki, what else is going on in the news this week?

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:50.060
You know, actually, I was reading GameStop was, I think, handing out free trial discs

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.060
for a while.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.660
That's kind of neat.

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.180
Anyways, so actual rapid fire news, though.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.940
Some pretty cool stuff.

01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:01.940
Starting off with, we talked about all the delays for Motorstar Apocalypse.

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:07.020
Well, at least one of those delays is coming to an end, and that would be in the UK, where

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:11.460
it's gotten a release date, March 31st, so you won't have to wait very long, actually,

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:15.020
to play the game.

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:19.420
And you know, if you really die in the play of the game, and you're not in the UK, it

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:23.540
is region free, so import away.

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.820
But let me really just give it a couple more weeks, it'll be out.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:31.140
But it is really awesome, so you should really pick it up.

01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:35.780
Some annoying game is expanding, and that annoying game would be Farmville.

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:39.940
They're having an English countryside expansion.

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:46.700
I guess it's for players level 20 and above, I guess if you log into the game, you will

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:54.780
be greeted, I guess, by a crash landing zeppelin, and it'll begin the game's, they're calling

01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:02.660
it the British Invasion, and you have to help the stranded Englishman repair his ship, and

01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:09.260
he invites the players back to his homeland, where you can, you know, create farms there.

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.900
Wait, wait, do you hear that?

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:11.900
Wait, do you hear it?

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:17.180
Oh, yep, that would be the sound of no one caring.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:20.660
Farmville news, Loki, what did you expect me to say?

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:23.060
My mother cares.

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:31.660
And finally, after a short hiatus, Final Fantasy XI and XIV have their servers back online.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:38.740
Unfortunately, during the downtime, XIV has still not been fixed, so it is still in beta.

01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:43.220
It might as well, you might as well have left it offline, because it would have been doing

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:47.060
people more of a favor than actually them playing the game.

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:49.820
You're terrible, but accurate.

01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:56.220
So apparently, this is to keep power use down, because they were, you know, taking them offline

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.020
to conserve power in Japan.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:09.380
They have decided to shut down their air conditioning, which is 8% of their power usage, and also

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:19.500
by reducing lighting in their offices to achieve an overall 10% in energy usage reductions.

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:24.380
Square Enix is cooking in the dark for the benefit of you all to bring the servers back

01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.380
online.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.820
Well, I think it's a little chilly over there right now.

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:27.820
No, I know.

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.700
But with all the server computers, it's got to be a little warm where they're at.

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.460
It might be a little warm.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.460
Crack a window.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.180
All right, moving on to other MMOs.

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.180
This is a free one online that's pretty popular.

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:44.740
Dungeon Fighter Online was announced that it is coming out for Xbox Live Arcade later

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.740
this year.

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:51.060
I've never checked out Dungeon Fighter Online, it's a free-to-play 2D action PC MMO, and

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:55.780
it kind of looks to me like, I don't know, looks like an old school SNES type of little

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:56.780
game.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:57.780
So obviously, it's graphic style.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:03.580
I've really drawn in a lot of users, 2.2 million concurrent users, meaning at the same time.

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:04.580
So that's pretty awesome.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.620
It is coming out for Xbox Live later in the year.

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:09.460
It will be published by Microsoft Game Studios.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.140
Now, it's a free-to-play MMO online.

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:15.980
They sell items and other little enhancements for premium fees.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:16.980
Here's the deal.

01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:20.460
The Xbox Live Arcade one, it won't be free-to-play.

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.420
It's actually going to cost money.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:25.220
And this is the other weird thing.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:29.180
It might not really be an MMO either, because they came out and said, and this is from a

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:34.940
Microsoft representative, it's not a freemium MMORPG.

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:38.620
It's with online multiplayer features.

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.020
So I don't know.

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:42.980
Set the expectation bar a little low, but I don't know.

01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.420
It could translate pretty decently to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.420
We'll see.

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:49.980
If you've been following the Back to the Future games from Telltale, you'll probably be looking

01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.980
forward to the third episode of the series.

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:56.140
And you can look forward to one of the voice actresses they've confirmed for it.

01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.680
Claudia Wells will be reprising her role as Jennifer.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.140
So pretty cool.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:07.100
Now, she was the original actress, I believe, in the sequels Elizabeth Shue took over the

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.100
role.

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:13.500
And the original Jennifer is back for the Back to the Future games.

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500
That's pretty cool.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.540
They've gotten a lot of the original voice actors.

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.100
And one more story for you guys.

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:20.180
The NPD put out a press release this week.

01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:24.460
Do you know what the highest grossing game was of this generation?

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.460
Imagine Babies.

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:29.180
No, it was not Imagine Babies, but I'm sure people think, oh, maybe it was Wii Play or

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:30.720
maybe it was Call of Duty.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.460
Those games sell like crazy.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:36.620
Actually, apparently the best gross revenue game.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:41.660
We're not talking games that like sold the most number of units, but we're talking about

01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:44.800
what actually made the most money.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:51.260
Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock was the most money making game of the past generation.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.260
And they're canceling the series?

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.800
Kind of ironic in that regard, but let's face it, three was the peak.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:59.060
It went really downhill fast from there.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:03.780
So you know, that was three came out concurrently with Rock Band, which by the way, was number

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.300
five on the list.

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:11.300
Isn't three the Guitar Hero that had like a million different skews of different combinations

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.860
of guitars and not guitar and I don't know.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:18.380
Yeah, but it got worse with the fourth one when we threw in the drums and the vocals.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:19.380
That's when it got really bad.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.380
No, that one.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:21.380
The band hero.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.280
The three was just guitar, not guitar.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.900
It wasn't, it was just as like any of the other Guitar Hero games, well, prior to that,

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.220
any of the other Guitar Hero games.

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:35.700
That's when they got to, you know, well, actually even the world tour wasn't too bad because

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.860
it was just, you know, like Rock Band.

01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:42.580
It was game, guitar game, band.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.100
Guitar Hero 3 is the one that the arcade is based off of too.

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.220
I noticed that when I was playing the machine.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:50.820
I had to give it at least one go when I was at Roseville Golf Line this week, so.

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:51.820
Probably not worth it.

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:54.620
No, it really wasn't because I failed the song, which pissed me off because the guitar

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.300
was broken and one of the buttons didn't work right.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.100
Uh, that's, that's terrible.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.100
What a surprise!

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:02.860
Hey, it's not Roseville Golf Land if it's not broken.

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.860
Alright.

01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.340
Less bitching about local arcades and more gaming news.

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.740
Dark Sakura.

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:13.340
Well, we have some virtual console information that should make a lot of people happy.

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.780
Chrono Trigger is actually going to be coming out on the virtual console in Japan.

01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:22.340
That will have a 900 point price tag.

01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.260
It's one of my favorite RPGs.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.500
I've actually gotten original of this too.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:32.580
Something about when the European or American version is going to come out though, but it

01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:35.220
is coming out in Japan, so we should see it soon.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.300
And hopefully where Japan goes, we will follow.

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.420
Precisely.

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.260
And then there's more download content for Rock Band 3.

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:47.700
There is the Days of Peace pack, which actually I think I would get.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:51.300
It's got Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love, which is one of my favorite songs.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.300
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, Spinning Wheel, and Santana.

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:56.500
Don't you want somebody to love?

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:59.820
And Santana's Black Magic Woman.

01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:03.780
Imagine playing some Santana in the guitar mode.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:04.780
Imagine that in pro.

01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:07.140
Wouldn't that be crazy?

01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:14.100
And then Dragon Force through the Fire and the Flames, and Operation Ground and Pound.

01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:17.020
So for anyone who wants to get their speed metal on, there you go.

01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.420
Kind of ironic, we just had a story about Guitar Hero, because that was one of the most

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:21.820
memorable songs from that series.

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:22.820
But Rock Band is awesome.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:23.820
And from 3, I think.

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:24.820
Wasn't it?

01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:27.540
I think so.

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:36.700
At any rate, we are looking at 200 Wii points for the standard Rock packs, 160 points.

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:43.260
And the Days of Peace pack will actually be 550 Wii points, or 440 Microsoft points.

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:47.660
And then through the Fire and the Flames and Black Magic Woman both do have pro guitar

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:49.680
and pro bass mode.

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.060
And those are going to be an extra 100 Wii points, or 80 Microsoft points.

01:37:54.060 --> 01:38:03.700
And last but never least, we have Evil Ryu for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition.

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:06.740
And he's on fire.

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:11.740
He's burning up, and he's got some bad red eye problems, so he's going to need some Visine.

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.980
He's burning for you.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:19.980
And the profile is actually up on the official Japanese website.

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:29.300
So definitely, it's Evil Ryu and Oni who are the unlockable characters, but now they're

01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:30.540
officially there.

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.220
And the profile is there.

01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.220
And I will post that into the chatroom.

01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:35.700
So what exactly is Evil Ryu do that...

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:36.700
Well, technically...

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:37.700
Evil things?

01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:38.700
Technically...

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.700
He kicks puppies.

01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:43.740
He's Satsui no Hadou Ryu.

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:47.300
Because I guess Akuma is always like, give in to your fighting spirit.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:48.300
Okay.

01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:49.300
Join the dark side.

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.300
That's what Evil Ryu is.

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:54.460
If you look at his art, he actually looks just like Goku.

01:38:54.460 --> 01:39:00.740
I mean, he's wearing the black gi with the kanji on the back, and it's all torn, and

01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.100
he's got the same face and the red spiky hair.

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.100
Who's Oni?

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.620
Is that like Evil Evil Goku?

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:08.380
I think that would be, yeah, like Uber Goku.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380
It's Eviler!

01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:13.660
Give in to your Evil Evil.

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.540
There's voice samples on there too.

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.020
Dude, his voice sounds pretty sick.

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:20.020
Alright.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.940
I'm gonna post this in the chatroom.

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.660
Fun little soundboard to play with there.

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.260
Let's go to the Twitter!

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:29.820
Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, and every week we like to read your tweets.

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.820
Tweet tweet.

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.580
Twitter dot com slash o-l-r, let's look at some tweets.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:39.380
Some interesting tweets from 13X Forever sent us a link to some YouTubes, which apparently

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:44.460
are YouTubes of the game Warcraft Adventures Lord of the Clans.

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:48.020
Now before you go thinking this is a topic better suited for Horde House, apparently

01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:51.620
what this game was, it was in development by Blizzard Entertainment, it was a point

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:56.800
and click adventure computer game, it was supposed to be kind of a darker comedy game.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:01.980
It was supposed to be I think after Warcraft 2, it was gonna be fourth quarter 97, so that

01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:06.900
would have been a little bit before Starcraft, kind of in that era, so this was like an old

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.900
game.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.340
But randomly these YouTubes went up that we got linked to, so I'm just kind of taking

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.020
a quick peek at how this played out.

01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:15.700
So this would have been like the era when people were still playing King's Quest and

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.700
those types of games.

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.820
Oh the art in this looks pretty cool.

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:23.500
Looks more SCUMM engine, but yeah it's within the SCUMM engine, LucasArts, King's Quest

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.780
vein, that style of gameplay.

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:30.340
Actually the way it's animated kind of looks like the CDI to me, kind of that really like,

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.700
really like very jerky motion cell animation stuff.

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:39.220
It's very interesting how Blizzard develops a lot of these games that just gets freaking

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.620
cancelled, you know what I mean?

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:45.820
Oh there's a trailer here for this game actually, let me click on this and take a look at this

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:48.040
real quick if it'll load.

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:53.100
This is an old school trailer from like 97, let me just take a peek at this, what could

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.220
have been, but is not.

01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:58.260
Let's see, pass the logo, come on people.

01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:03.860
Three great wars between the human alliance and the orcish invaders have laid waste to

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:07.260
the once proud realms of Azeroth.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:32.860
See this looks kind of rad, but it's very different from Azeroth, this has been a whole

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:47.660
new era.

01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:54.260
I believe all of the lore that was going to be put out in that game was then split off

01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:58.460
into the novels, so if you're a lore nerd like I am, read the books and you'll get all

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.060
the story from that game.

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:06.100
Alright, Dark Tetsuya sends us a link, greetings true believers, I got your first Wondercon

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:08.740
scoop right here about a new Spiderman game in the works.

01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:12.500
Dark Tetsuya very excited because he's going to Wondercon and promises to bring back lots

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:16.400
of stories for OLR, but I guess there is a new Spiderman game that's supposed to be shown

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.620
at Wondercon, yeah that's what they're saying, Saturday April 2nd will be the Activision

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:26.340
Spiderman panel and I guess this is when they're going to announce what their new Spiderman

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:28.580
game is, check that out.

01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.100
Henderson Man tweets us at twitter.com slash OLR, how do you think the iPhone has hurt

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:34.460
sales of 3DS?

01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:38.940
I was the only one who made it Walmart at midnight last night and bought one.

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:43.660
The guy told me I was the only one who even asked, should Nintendo be worried?

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:49.900
I would say no, mostly because it's still early and there hasn't been a lot of like,

01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:55.300
there haven't been commercials, they went on Jimmy Fallon, but that doesn't really count.

01:42:55.300 --> 01:43:00.180
There's been a few commercials, but here's the thing though, unless you're really gung

01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:06.380
ho about getting stuff day one, there's not a lot of launch games that are really kind

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:09.780
of like, ooh I gotta have that.

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:14.160
There's a few, but a lot of them aren't very good and there's a lot of blogs covering all

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:19.760
that stuff and saying hey, you may be tempted to buy Nintendogs but don't.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:25.740
It's basically Nintendogs as it was before with a few gimmicks thrown on top and yes,

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:32.740
as a person that had the Japanese Nintendogs, I would not buy that again.

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:38.020
And one more tweet for us from Tigerclaw on twitter, 305, Tigerclaw305 says this tweet

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:41.740
about Mortal Kombat download characters, I guess those were announced just recently.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:45.700
I'm actually very excited, one of my favorite characters from the series who came out later

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:51.900
in the mythos is announced as one of the first download content, Kenshi, that was the blindfolded,

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:55.380
he's the blind ninja guy, is going to be one of the download characters, and a character

01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:57.380
called Scarlet.

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:03.740
Scarlet was more of a, this character didn't really exist, she's kind of in that Ermac

01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:09.940
thing where there really wasn't a character named Scarlet, but I guess what happened is

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:15.140
that sometimes the game would glitch out and create a red version of Katana or Mileena

01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:20.540
and she was referred to as Scarlet by the arcade going folk and so now they have actually

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:26.300
made Scarlet a character and she's going to be a downloadable character, so kind of funny

01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.300
that they're doing that.

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:31.300
I mean that's kind of where Jade comes from too, I mean Jade was a legitimate hidden character

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:35.300
but she was just a palette swap for green and had both Katana and Mileena's moves and

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:40.220
now she's a whole, they gave her a big bar thing that she used as a weapon, kind of made

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.500
her flesh her out as an actual character, so good stuff coming to the Mortal Kombat

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:46.820
game that is out next month.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:52.460
I'm waiting for the announcement of Mortal Kombat vs Sanrio, that's the license that

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.460
I'll play.

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.460
Kitty-ality.

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:55.460
Yeah.

01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:56.460
Bad Batsumaru.

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.460
I would think Cutality.

01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.460
Huh?

01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.460
Cutality.

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.460
Friendship?

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:01.460
Friendship?

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:05.740
Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news, sorry to make you put down the 3DS lowkey

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:06.740
but.

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:07.740
It's alright.

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:17.220
So this is kind of neat, Resident Evil 4, they're doing a HD remake of, well both Resident

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:23.260
Evil 4 and Code Veronica, and they're coming over here as some download content, well not

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:29.220
really, download games on PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:33.220
No word if they're going to add any additional content on top of just the, you know, souped

01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:39.840
up visuals, but people love their Resident Evil 4, and I know even the Wii version with

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:47.380
just the little extra controls with the Wii remote and stuff was pretty popular, so I

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:49.580
could see this doing pretty well.

01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:55.720
And you know, it's kind of the whole HD remake thing is really even popular lately, so not

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:00.180
surprised to see it happen.

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.180
Alright.

01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.860
Wasn't there something about another Resident Evil game?

01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:08.220
Yeah, there is a new one that's actually being, you know, talked about as well, they revealed

01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:16.780
it in the official Xbox Magazine, it's not really, they haven't really said where it's,

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.540
what's going to take place, they are saying that you can change the history of Resident

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:30.500
Evil, and I guess it's titled Operation Raccoon City.

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:38.820
So it's interesting, I guess it's being developed by Slant6, who used to do SOCOM.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.820
Hmm.

01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:50.780
I don't know, it sounds interesting, not really a series I follow too well, I don't know.

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:54.260
I'm sure E3 is going to bring lots more clarity to all of this.

01:46:54.260 --> 01:46:57.500
I'm definitely sure that it'll happen.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:03.020
Alright, well let's talk about what will not happen, and apparently if rumors are to be

01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:08.900
believed, Bonk and Bomberman, those ports on the 3DS, not happening, and a lot of that

01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:12.020
has to do with what's been going down at Hudson Entertainment, of course they closed a big

01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.180
office of theirs not that long ago after the whole Konami takeover.

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:18.500
Remember this way, I've played the Bonk game, it was terrible.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.500
On the 3DS?

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.260
No, on the 3DS, on the Xbox Live Arcade.

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:25.460
Oh yeah, well there was supposed to be one on the 3DS, and Bomberman, which would have

01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:29.540
been really cool, especially with the whole internet stuff, but apparently it is not going

01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:30.540
to happen.

01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:34.740
Now, take this with a grain of salt, because apparently some folks are saying, no no no,

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.980
that's not true, but those are the rumors going around right now.

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:43.540
Apparently Konami went out and told Wired that the announcement didn't come from us,

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.540
so it's not true.

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:48.460
We have not distributed any official list of Hudson products yet.

01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.540
Now the original report came from Famitsu, who is supposedly pretty reputable with all

01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:55.820
this stuff, I mean they are like the huge gaming thing in Japan, so there's a little

01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:57.260
bit of controversy going on.

01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:02.380
I would assume that maybe these games have been retooled or moved, new development house,

01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:04.940
either way, you're not seeing them anytime soon.

01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:09.060
I would assume if these licenses are being held onto, which I don't see why Bomberman

01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:13.780
wouldn't happen, Bonk, a little trickier, but Bomberman's got to happen at some point,

01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:16.060
it's probably just not going to happen as soon as you'd like.

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:17.060
We'll see though.

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:25.180
Well, in other news, and this has to do with Konami, there are, he said, let me start over,

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:31.860
Hideo Kojima said that there are going to be more than one game announced at E3.

01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:37.660
So the speculation is maybe Metal Gear Solid 5, maybe another Zone of the Enders, could

01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:38.660
be anything.

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:42.460
Would it be cool if there was another Snatcher?

01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:43.460
No.

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:45.740
Hey, you never know.

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.740
Never know.

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.340
So, anything could happen.

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.740
What would you like to see?

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.420
Everybody likes to start rumors around E3 time.

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.420
What would I like to see?

01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:56.980
I think a new Zone of the Enders would actually be pretty cool.

01:48:56.980 --> 01:48:59.060
From Kojima anyways?

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.060
Probably that.

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:03.860
The Zone of the Enders was pretty epic.

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:07.000
I would be down with maybe like a Metal, I don't know, I want to see something new come

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.360
out of the whole Metal Gear stuff that's maybe not necessarily Metal Gear Solid.

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.360
Or Acid.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.620
It's kind of something just out of that whole mythos.

01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:17.660
I think there's something new to be made there, especially with 3DS.

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:21.300
And I think, didn't we already know there's a Metal Gear game coming on 3DS?

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:22.380
I think that's inevitable.

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.760
You're going to see that at E3 this year, it's whatever.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:29.920
And that'll probably be the big push from Konami at their booth this year is probably

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.140
whatever Metal Gear game is in development.

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:35.740
We're almost starting to see, and you know there's a new Silent Hill game, you're kind

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.060
of starting to get a sense of what games you're seeing at E3 this year.

01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:40.060
But there'll be some surprises.

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:43.700
I wonder what Silent Hill would be like in Kojima's hands.

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.700
Alright.

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.660
Could you imagine that?

01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:52.420
I thought he was supposedly like ghost contributing to one of them or something was happening

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.420
there with that.

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:54.420
I don't remember.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:55.420
Alright.

01:49:55.420 --> 01:49:59.500
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:01.720
Ah yes.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.760
This is kind of neat.

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:08.700
I don't know why people put out this kind of stuff really.

01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:18.620
It's always like, you'll see these games based off of Columbine or really offensive stuff.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:25.580
Well they've, ModDB, it's a website hosting different mods for games like Half Life 2

01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:26.580
and whatnot.

01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:30.460
They removed a game called, or I should say a mod called School Shooter.

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:34.420
It's basically, yeah School Shooter, North American Tour, 2012.

01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.420
Oh my god.

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:36.740
Now who would find that offensive?

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:40.380
I don't understand, that doesn't make any sense to me.

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:45.120
But apparently I guess the mod allowed players to explore a school-like environment in first

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:51.980
person and had the option of attacking various unarmed NPCs.

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:52.980
Yeah.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:57.900
I can't imagine why they would remove something so harmless.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:50:59.500
I know, right?

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.140
Why would someone even make that?

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:04.620
Just knowing what, I mean, well I know why someone would make that.

01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:08.660
Someone made that to basically troll, because they could, right?

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.620
I mean that's why you make this.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:14.260
To say like, heh heh heh, look what I made, it's really controversial and I shouldn't

01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.500
be making a game like this but I did.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:22.660
Yes, apparently I guess they're saying, ModDB was, they posted a short statement about why

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:25.140
they pulled the code saying that although it feels that people should have the right

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:32.180
to be creative and share what they want on a community slash developer-run site, the

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.640
confusion and hate surrounding the project led to the removal.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:44.580
And apparently they do have a video of it posted on YouTube as well and it says, I guess

01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:53.380
they have the boring effect that someone took from that bullet storm duty calls viral game

01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.900
thing that they put in there.

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:59.140
I don't know, it's just, it's tacky.

01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.740
Really?

01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:04.060
That's all you need is for this to actually come out and then someone to do a school shooter.

01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:05.060
Only a matter of time.

01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:10.660
Then they'll be like, oh, oh, see, see, they're playing school shooter, oh my god.

01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:14.620
How long do you think before it shows up on Fox News and they report it as new video game

01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:16.900
school shooter by Valve.

01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:20.840
Yeah, not only do they get the mod ban but they also get Half Life 2 banned and that's

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:24.140
when I just, you know, the earrings are coming off and.

01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:25.740
And the game turned you gay.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:32.380
It turned you gay, so very gay.

01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:39.260
Alright enough about that, silly mods, although I have to admit I probably would play it once

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:44.500
just to be disgusted by it because I'm a glutton for punishment, alright.

01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:49.380
It's probably dumb, I mean, it's probably a terrible, terrible game.

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:53.700
There was a very interesting competition that took place recently, it was the Kong Off is

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:58.260
what this was called, some photos have gone up from the event which was just held recently,

01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:01.580
it was held in New Jersey at Richie Knuckles Arcade Games.

01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.140
What was so special about the Kong Off?

01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:07.820
Well, god, it's the story that won't go away about the high score for Donkey Kong.

01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:10.740
And you now have three people battling for it.

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:15.500
There's Steve Weeby and Billy Mitchell who are profiled in that movie, The King of Kong.

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:19.420
And then out of nowhere comes Hank Chien who, as we reported last week, is going to have

01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:21.460
his own movie now coming out.

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.460
All this stuff.

01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:26.620
All of them were in the same building at this Kong Off, so that's pretty cool.

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.300
So who ended up winning?

01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:31.220
Hank Chien ended up winning the Kong Off.

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.940
And second place, Steve Weeby.

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:38.700
Seventh place, Billy Mitchell, out of ten.

01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:41.500
I would have loved to see the look on his face.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:46.600
But you are talking about ten like godly Donkey Kong players and it's so funny how this game

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:49.820
is how old and it's still generating all this controversy.

01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.980
I wonder if the guy, I think he like, beat the top scorer of Missile Command and he plays

01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.980
with his feet.

01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.980
Mhm.

01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:56.980
Seriously.

01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:58.780
Is that Captain Awesome?

01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:02.420
They watched him and he was on there in King of Kong sitting on a stool playing with his

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:03.420
feet.

01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.420
That's awesome.

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:10.020
SX in our chatroom says Kong Off sounds like nasty slash fiction from DK Country.

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:12.400
No, no, it's nothing like that.

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.900
But there are some pictures on Flickr and you can just kind of see all these dudes playing

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.180
their Donkey Kong.

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:21.340
I like how one guy has headphones as he plays.

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:24.260
Stop it, Loki.

01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:25.260
Stop it.

01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:29.020
Actually, I do, you know, give credit to these guys.

01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.900
I mean, all these machines look like they are in impeccable condition.

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:35.820
They've made these like special flyers that say the Kong Off.

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:39.860
I mean, these dudes like love Donkey Kong.

01:54:39.860 --> 01:54:44.180
I mean, it's pretty amazing the amount of work that they've put into this.

01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.960
I have to give kudos for that.

01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:51.420
I mean, if you're going to go in, go all in, right, on this classic stuff.

01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:53.780
So there's, there's big love for Kong.

01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:54.780
All right.

01:54:54.780 --> 01:55:00.500
There's also big love for a segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio called List List.

01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:06.860
Now, we haven't done a list list in a little while, it's been a few months, so let me recap

01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:08.740
how list list works.

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:14.040
We are about to make the definitive list about a certain topic and it's a scientific process

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.180
and once we've made up the list, it's done.

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.180
There's no arguing.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.200
It is, it is done.

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.720
This is the list, okay?

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.740
And the way it works is that we're going to go around the room and Dark Sakura, myself,

01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:28.380
Loki and tonight's guest Salacious Pop, we're all going to pick three things that we think

01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:30.780
should go on the list around the topic.

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.860
Then we go to the elimination round and each take one item off the list.

01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:39.340
So that will leave us with a list of eight items that the chat room will then vote on.

01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:41.280
Their number two and their number one picks.

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.920
So if you want to vote and have a say in the definitive list, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:50.380
So I know you are dying to know the topic and I teased on Bobby's show it had to do

01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:53.220
with the 3DS launch, so here it is.

01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:59.360
The list list tonight, fictional 3DS launch title that would have made the system an instant

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.360
buy.

01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:04.860
I really have to credit Salacious Pop for coming up with this one, but it's great because,

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:08.140
you know, the 3DS launched today and one of the things people have been criticizing is

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:11.260
it's kind of lackluster launch title.

01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:12.340
Launch titles.

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:15.260
So folks are saying maybe there's some games you should wait for.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:19.260
Well tonight we're going to come up with a definitive list of what fictional 3DS launch

01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:22.940
titles would have made the system an instant buy.

01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.980
All right, here we go to list list.

01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:28.340
And now you guys in the chat room, you should go ahead and throw out your suggestions for

01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:32.700
the list because if one of us ends up with a duplicate answer or something, we usually

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:36.660
turn to chat to help us kind of round up, round out the list.

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:37.660
So who wants to start tonight?

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.660
I guess we'll go with Dark Sakura.

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.340
Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?

01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:44.180
What is the number three item on your list?

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.180
It's not a game.

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.180
It's an item.

01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:47.180
That's fine.

01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.180
It's a launch title.

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.180
Doesn't mean launch game.

01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:54.460
A lenticular photo printer.

01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:57.600
And what would be, what would the lenticular photo printer do?

01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:00.420
It would print up your images in 3D.

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.460
Well, with the illusion of three dimensions.

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:06.780
So like, kind of like the old school Game Boy printer, but now in 3D?

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:07.780
Yeah.

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:08.780
Okay.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.820
So it would print one layer, print a second layer.

01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:15.940
It'd be huge probably, but I'd still think it would be neat to have something like that.

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:23.060
I would need a lot of paper for the 3D pictures of my Wang that I would take.

01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:26.940
Slaces Pop, stop rolling your eyes and give us your number three answer.

01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.020
The launch title that would have made you buy a system right now.

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.420
Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster.

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:37.540
I'd buy that.

01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:42.340
And how exactly would Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster work?

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:49.300
Jubble physics in 3D and you shoot aliens and you get, you get, you get grease from

01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:52.740
your nose on the touch screen because you're getting all up in there.

01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:56.340
You can power up maybe by making that noise into the 3DS microphone.

01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:58.580
Brings a whole new meaning to screw attack.

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:00.440
All right.

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.580
I guess I'll go next.

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:06.300
The number three thing that launch title that would have made me get a 3DS right today,

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:09.580
first thing, um, how about F-Zero 3DS?

01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:12.060
I'm going to go a little serious here.

01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.180
Where's my fucking new F-Zero game?

01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:15.180
F-Zero 3DS.

01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:16.820
Loki, what's your number three answer?

01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:19.020
Well, this is a more of a serious route.

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:24.300
I swear that this is in development because I, I thought I saw some sort of screenshots

01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:31.660
or something like this, but, uh, Excite Truck 3DS would absolutely get me to buy the system.

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.660
Excite Truck is awesome, not that this is Excite Bots bullshit though, Excite Truck.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:37.660
Excite Truck.

01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:42.580
Hell, you don't even have to do anything different, put the same damn tracks in there, same trucks,

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:43.580
everything.

01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:49.260
Although I would like it if you did something, but you know, if you don't have to, then fine.

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:55.220
So far, Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS and

01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:56.580
Excite Truck 3DS.

01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.900
Dark Sakura, what's your number two?

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:01.100
Planet Harrier.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:05.380
I love this game, I have only gotten to play it a few times, there's been no home version

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.380
released.

01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.180
Don't you think it would be about time for it to, you know, something like that to come

01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:11.180
on 3DS?

01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:16.780
You know, it's, it's like Space Harrier, only you can play as a nurse with a giant syringe.

01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:20.420
I can see a lot of those, like, old school, like, Sega shooters and I think of 3D World

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:22.100
Runner, like, for the NES.

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:27.060
But those, this sort of first person, not kind of first person, but those, those perspective

01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:30.540
games would be perfect for that type of screen.

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:31.540
So, I'm with you.

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:33.100
My vote is Planet Harriers.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.100
All right.

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:38.260
Slasius Pop, your number two pick for launch title that would have made you buy a DS today.

01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:43.100
Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, Migraine and Vertigo Edition.

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:47.780
What exactly is Zelda 8-Bit 3DS, I'm with you to that point, but then Migraine and Vertigo

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.780
Edition?

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:53.860
Just the, you know, you stare at it too long, the way they do the, they do different frames

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:58.220
to make the 3D, they make it so that it just intentionally makes you nauseous and you have

01:59:58.220 --> 01:59:59.220
to lay down.

01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:03.660
Is it kind of like, it's not like the brown note, but it's kind of like the migraine image

02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:04.660
or something.

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.660
They have that already.

02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:08.340
It's called, um, Ridge Racer.

02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:09.740
All right.

02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:15.380
Uh, game I would most want to see on the 3DS that would get me to buy a 3DS today.

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:20.620
I'm going to say, Breasts 3D.

02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:26.060
All it would be, would be pictures of breasts in 3D.

02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:30.420
And I am completely secure in my homosexuality saying that, cause who doesn't love boobs,

02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:31.980
gay or straight or whatever you are.

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:35.460
Does the 3DS have a thing like the iPhone where if you tilt it, it has a little bead

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:38.140
that it can tell, so you can shake, you can shake it.

02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.220
It would be like that Android game where you just spank the ass over and over again is

02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:46.300
that you could just, you could, you know, you could motorboat the boobs if you want,

02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:48.900
but it's not, it's not just restricted to Samus Aran.

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:52.860
Like I'm with you on the Samus Aran motorboat and bikini blaster, but I want to see just,

02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:54.420
just boobs.

02:00:54.420 --> 02:01:01.540
Little boobs, big boobs, lopsided boobs, boobs, fake boobs, real boobs, more boobs.

02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:04.340
You can load up a picture and then when you're on the subway, you can kind of hold it up

02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:06.340
to a person.

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:07.340
Yeah.

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:11.340
That would be a perfect mode.

02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:15.620
It would actually use the whole like, uh, what is that, the, the, the camera on the

02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:18.620
backside for those like, uh, virtual reality type simulations.

02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:23.540
And like, if I, if I point the camera at Jamie just suddenly like random boobs will show

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:25.500
up.

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:26.500
She's frowning.

02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:27.500
She's making a frowny face.

02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.460
Anything in that game would not be as fabulous as the real thing, thank you.

02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:33.620
My boobs are epic.

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:36.860
All right, Loki, your number two pick launch title for the 3DS that would have made you

02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:37.860
buy one today.

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.700
Uh, just what you said made me forget.

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.780
Um, it is, oh yes, of course.

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:47.620
Earth Defense Force 2017 on the 3DS.

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.900
That would be so amazing.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:54.460
I can take Earth Defense Force with me since the PSP version is not yet announced.

02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:55.460
Come over here.

02:01:55.460 --> 02:01:56.460
All right.

02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:00.740
Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS going into the number ones.

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:05.980
We have lenticular photo printer, Samus Aran's motorboat and bikini blaster, F zero 3DS excite

02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:12.260
truck 3DS planet Harrier, Zelda eight bit 3DS migraine and vertigo edition breasts 3D

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:15.940
and Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS.

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:17.700
Let's get into the number one.

02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.820
This is, you just fucking need it.

02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:25.700
Dark Sakura, the new guardian legend, duh.

02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:27.540
It's my list.

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:33.960
The new guardian legend in 3D in 3D because we're going to be at guardic and he had guardia.

02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:38.560
So I guess the Japanese name of this would be shin guardia.

02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.980
I don't care what the fuck they call it.

02:02:39.980 --> 02:02:40.980
Just put it out already.

02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:41.980
I know, right?

02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:42.980
Damn it.

02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:43.980
Nintendo or compile.

02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:49.220
I realize compile needs to reform somehow, but just, just do it reform and put out.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:50.220
All right.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:51.220
Thank you.

02:02:51.220 --> 02:02:54.260
Please put out XOXO slashes, pop number one.

02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.260
You need it.

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:56.260
You need it now.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:57.260
I'm 3DS.

02:02:57.260 --> 02:03:04.520
Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer.

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.500
And how exactly would Rebecca Black's preteen convertible off-road racer work?

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:13.380
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:17.060
And it has a built-in calendar days of the week.

02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:20.820
Did I break Rob?

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.820
Is he upset?

02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:23.500
No, I'm just regretting some things.

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:24.500
All right.

02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:25.500
I'm kidding.

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:26.500
All right.

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.500
Let's move on.

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.220
Number one answer from me, the 3DS game we most need to see.

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:33.220
What did they call that?

02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:34.220
The, the virtual reality.

02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.220
I'm calling it wrong.

02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:39.140
What's it, what's it really supposed to be called the like the face blaster.

02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.140
What is that?

02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:41.140
The augmented reality.

02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:42.140
Thank you.

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.140
Augmented reality.

02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:44.460
It's an augmented reality game for you.

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:47.220
And I'm going to throw it back to an old school list list.

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:57.700
Augmented reality, Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.

02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:58.700
That's right.

02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:02.060
You can go to Golf Land and just, you know, then suddenly the little kids there celebrating

02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:08.100
their birthdays turn into cartoons that you shoot with tranquilizer darts.

02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:11.380
You know, it's Golf Land birthday party sniper 3DS.

02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:19.580
All right, Loki, number one game you most need to see on the 3DS, uh, an actual innovative

02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:28.580
game from Nintendo, you know, something that perhaps is not, you know, funny, I don't think

02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:32.820
this is actually a launch title, but just, just, just a description, an actual innovative

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:38.500
game from Nintendo, you know, like something that's maybe not a rehash of something that

02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.500
they put out.

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:45.020
You know, like for example, Animal Crossing, it's been the same for a while now and, you

02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:51.940
know, uh, even some of the other, like, you know, they're doing 64 Nintendo 64 games.

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:53.420
They're just, Oh, now they're in 3D.

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:56.780
I mean, come on innovation here.

02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.680
This might be too much of a tangent, but when was Nintendo's last truly original IP?

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:04.260
Like new, just because it's all the mascots that we...

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.260
Wii Music.

02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:06.260
No, Wii Fit.

02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.740
I would say Wii Fit.

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:08.740
But that's not...

02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:12.140
We have anything iconic though, like a Mario or a Kirby.

02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:13.140
Wii Sports.

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:17.100
What about WooHoo Island?

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:20.580
So basically we're getting Kirby's Crochet Carnival is what you're saying.

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:26.660
Actually, no, I do have a name for my innovative game, WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:29.940
You want to change your answer to WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch?

02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:30.940
Yes.

02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.940
All right.

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:36.060
So an actual innovative game from Nintendo is now WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:37.060
Yes.

02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:40.940
Wouldn't that just be Dead Island?

02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:44.380
It might be, but Dead Island was not announced for the Wii, so Nintendo has to fill that

02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:45.380
void.

02:05:45.380 --> 02:05:46.380
All right.

02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:47.380
WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:48.380
All right, here we go.

02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:49.740
Here's the list as it stands right now.

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:55.660
Lenticular Photo Printer, Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Trek

02:05:55.660 --> 02:06:02.580
3DS, Planet Harrier, Zelda 8-Bit 3DS Migraine and Vertigo Edition, Brest 3D, Earth Defense

02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:09.020
Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, Rebecca Black's Preteen Convertible Off-Road Racer,

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:14.620
Golf Land Birthday Party Sniper 3DS, and WooHoo Island Zombie Deathmatch.

02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:18.220
Pretty soon we're going to go around and see which of these is not worthy of the list.

02:06:18.220 --> 02:06:21.940
We're going to start with Dark Sakura, but for now let me read some of the suggestions

02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:23.860
you guys had in the chat room.

02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:31.020
Akdev suggested Furi vs. Cosplayers 3DS, SHA100Matt suggested IHOP Restaurant Fighter 3DS, Tiger

02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:36.980
Claw said DDR 3DS, IHOP Restaurant Fighter, now would that be the actual restaurants fighting

02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:38.340
because that could be very cool.

02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:44.220
No, actually in my mind it's Denny's, like go on YouTube and Google Denny's Fight Oakland,

02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:46.420
it's great.

02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:50.700
The one where they're all in the Halloween costumes, amazing.

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:58.820
SHA100Matt says Killer Instincts 3DS, Ray Deer in chat says Rob's Ass 3DS, hey, let's

02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:05.980
see, AkumaJP says 3D Cat Ball, you know I had President Cat 3DS as a replacement answer,

02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:13.420
SJ100Matt says Match Game 3DS, DJBlazekin says Space Channel 5 3D, SJ100Matt says Betty

02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:19.460
White Simulator 3DS, what, you'd just be badass the whole time, is that what that is?

02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:26.460
Akdev says Pokemon Snap 3DS with AR Technology, I am surprised, that sounds like an announcement

02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:27.460
to you Furi right there.

02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:31.980
And Dark Tetsuya said Gals Panic 3D, alright, those were the runners up but let's get back

02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:35.660
to the list, unfortunately it's just the way the game works, these are all amazing answers

02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:41.220
but unfortunately the way the game works, things have to go, it's part of the process.

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:45.140
So Dark Sakura we'll start with you, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:54.580
First of all you need an apostrophe in blacks, I would say the Zelda 8-bit DS Migrated Vertigo

02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:59.700
Edition because I have a Virtual Boy, and the game's pretty much already out as Ridge

02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:00.700
Racer.

02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:04.020
Alright, sorry Alan it has been stricken from the list.

02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:07.060
Salacious Pop your chance for revenge or you could go for something else, which of these

02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:11.980
items is not worthy of the list?

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.460
The Golf Land birthday party.

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:19.280
Oh you're killing me, why are you taking that off the list?

02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:22.820
Well there's serious answers and there's my smart ass answers and I can't take down one

02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:25.580
of mine so.

02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:30.580
Alright there you go, it is removed from the list much to the sadness of the chat room.

02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.020
My turn to strike one from the list, I'm sorry to do this but Loki, WooHoo Island Zombie

02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:41.500
Deathmatch was a better answer before you changed it, alright, alright so Loki, which

02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.340
of these is not worthy of the list?

02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:48.260
Lenticular Photo Printer, I mean having taken some of the photos are not that impressive

02:08:48.260 --> 02:08:50.300
and would not want to print them out.

02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:53.620
Alright so maybe, it's just too soon for the Lenticular Photo Printer.

02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:54.620
We have a balanced list.

02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:59.860
Yeah I was going to say everybody took some, everybody lost one so it's very rare that

02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.540
that happens, usually someone gets picked on.

02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:05.960
So here you go, here is what you guys in the chat can vote on, I'm going to read this list

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:07.100
one more time.

02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:12.020
You're going to private message me your number one and your number two answers, you gotta

02:09:12.020 --> 02:09:13.700
message me those.

02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:17.300
You need to mark them as number one or number two or I will assume that the one you name

02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:20.620
first is your number one and the one you name second is your number two.

02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.740
By the way you're getting boos in the chat room for taking off Golf Land first season.

02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:25.620
What's your handle in chat this week?

02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:26.620
It's Skye.

02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:27.620
Okay got it back.

02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:28.620
Alright yes I got it back.

02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.960
So send a private message to Skye with your number one and number two votes.

02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:33.540
Here is the list that you can vote on right now.

02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:41.300
Samus Aran's Motorboat and Bikini Blaster, F-Zero 3DS, Excite Truck 3DS, Planet Harrier,

02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:49.220
Brest 3D, Earth Defense Force 2017 3DS, The New Guardian Legend, and Rebecca Black's pre-teen

02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:50.660
convertible off-road racer.

02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:52.660
I can't believe that made it through.

02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:55.580
Alright I would play that.

02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:57.060
I would play as the girl in the braces.

02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:01.180
It probably would be, yeah I would play as the girl in the pink who plays the accordion.

02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:04.540
Alright so yeah that's going to do it.

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:08.100
Let's get those number one and number two votes in right now.

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:13.220
Place your votes and we will get to the results right before we get to the phone calls.

02:10:13.220 --> 02:10:17.440
For now though we've got some other things to get to and one of those is the mailbag.

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.500
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.260
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.820
Again that's Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:27.820
It was looking really thin this morning so I put a call out on Twitter.

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:28.820
Did it work?

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:29.820
Did we get some emails?

02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:30.820
We have two.

02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:31.820
That's better than zero.

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:32.820
Alright.

02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:33.820
But not better than F-Zero.

02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:34.820
F-Zero is awesome.

02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:40.900
This first one comes from RaBaba.

02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:46.220
I'm surprised the Twitter isn't a Twitter and the net a buzz about Kaspersky ads on

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:47.220
American TV.

02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:51.400
If you've ever seen them it starts with a pair of home users or a small business manager

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.140
talking about the things they use their PCs for.

02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.440
Then it goes into all the threats that are out there.

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.900
Both ads I've seen call all PC gamers something like wargaming druggie hacker losers.

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:07.180
It implies that if you play MMOs you're automatically a threat to PC security.

02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:11.080
I find this offensive not to the point of emotionally offended but the overly negative

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:14.340
stereotype that is also completely wrong.

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:15.980
New Zealand gets Jackie Chan ads.

02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:18.380
No fair RaBaba.

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:20.380
Agreed.

02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:22.380
And last email.

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:26.540
Oh no punctuation.

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:30.580
Yay your favorite.

02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:35.940
And also I think how it's funny that the person wrote Loki as L-O-W-K-E-Y.

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:38.140
That sounds like what auto correct would do.

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:39.140
I know.

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:44.940
Yesterday was great especially the second round of laser tag at Family Fun Center Omaha.

02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:48.700
It was the last 10 to 30 seconds I was on the high rise and these three little kids

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:54.220
just stopped in front of me and did nothing as I picked them off a one by one in 1.5 seconds

02:11:54.220 --> 02:11:57.300
enacting a triple kill.

02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:01.700
It was the last 10 seconds and I sniped four going down the ramp most of them being from

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:07.540
preschool to fourth grade fun times punctuate the sad parts of my experience was when I

02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:12.100
went down there was no BeatMania 2DX.

02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:18.220
I know what 2DX is person and Para Para second mix game would be and there was it was nowhere

02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:19.220
to be found.

02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:23.380
I saw that they sold it in their place was a theta screen Daytona USA in a four player

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:28.980
Mario Kart I shouted in my head WTF first keyboard mania then pop music now Para Para

02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:32.060
then guitar freaks now BeatMania fuck you.

02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:35.220
That's my translation of the all caps.

02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:40.460
This now leaves the once favorable place to go in Omaha for my Bimani fix into a desolate

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:46.140
wasteland of redemption games and not much left to play for the music game fans to play

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:53.260
except drum mania V3 DDR Max 2 6th mix oh 6th mix and dance dance revolution 5th mix

02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:54.980
and in the group too.

02:12:54.980 --> 02:13:00.320
If only they just updated the games to their newer versions and bring in some new ones

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:09.180
like DJ Max Technica and G beat and dare I say it gulp pump it up pro maybe then maybe

02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:15.980
they might be able to get back the title of one of the top music arcades in North America.

02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:20.720
Peace out DJ Blaze kid PS if only Omaha had an arcade like AI then I wouldn't be forced

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.820
to buy an import just to play all the good music games.

02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:27.820
There isn't an arcade like AI anymore I hate to say it.

02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:36.100
It was AI an AI RIP yeah all right if you want to send us an email mailbag at orange

02:13:36.100 --> 02:13:42.260
lounge radio dot com I put the last call out for listless votes so hopefully we're gonna

02:13:42.260 --> 02:14:02.660
tally those up but not before we do some angst grr argh angst time.

02:14:02.660 --> 02:14:14.220
FUs of the week time well you know I had one earlier and I think I just lost my momentum

02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:22.340
so I'm gonna say I feed a gluten and meat neither of them agree with me no matter how

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:31.920
tasty both bread and dead animal flesh is so I'm telling them goodbye for a while goodbye

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:38.640
I will sort of miss you but my stomach won't done Loki F you the people have turned too

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:42.980
damn slow in their cars there's some people that for some reason they need to slow down

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:48.160
the one mile per hour to make a turn into a driveway of a plaza it doesn't even have

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:53.540
a curb or anything it's just I don't understand it I mean I can make turns a lot faster than

02:14:53.540 --> 02:15:01.020
that and it just bogs my mind why they go so damn slow or when they're merging lanes

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:04.980
I love these people they're just like oh I'm gonna cut in and out lanes I have my turn

02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:09.700
right turn signal on but I'm just gonna assume that one turn signal on means I can go any

02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:18.780
way I want so fuck you the bad drivers um my fu the whoop not ready for that song yet

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:23.440
uh my fu of the week actually I've had a lot of exciting stuff going on lately I can't

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:28.300
complain too much but I will complain about the reroute canal I had on Thursday oh my

02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:34.380
god that was so terrible um yeah that was bad and my tooth still kind of hurts a little

02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:39.420
bit so fu to pain even though at least I would like to give props to myself for not putting

02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:47.180
it off anymore and actually getting it taken care of so I'm pretty great so fu to pain

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:55.540
place to pop it's not really that angsty I guess but just fu to having only two weeks

02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:59.340
to do something that you thought maybe you'd have four weeks to do but it's still a good

02:15:59.340 --> 02:16:06.940
thing so nothing like getting a fire lit under your booty to get you motivated all right

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.380
all right that does it for the fus of the week let's do a couple more news stories and

02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:15.260
then we will reveal tonight's list list definitive list and we will get to the skype line in

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:20.860
just a little bit but for now a couple quick stories loki yeah um as we've kind of mentioned

02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:26.580
before that the hd remix are kind of a uh a remix of different games are kind of popular

02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:32.740
nowadays and ubisoft is jumping on board that trend um they actually have a few games coming

02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:37.900
out uh the first course the splinter cell uh classic trilogy that's coming out june

02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:45.940
21st now and uh will feature three games in that series also the prince of persia hd trilogy

02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:51.100
so push back a little bit to april 19th and that would feature the uh my birthday the three

02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:59.500
games in the um sands of time series so um it's neat i guess um i think the i want to

02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:03.180
say that the uh games at least the prince of persia ones are already on the playstation

02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:09.380
network they're 15 a piece so if you buy them retail you're saving five bucks um apparently

02:17:09.380 --> 02:17:13.460
also the uh splinter cell games are going to be available on the playstation network

02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:18.420
as well i'm assuming for probably around the same price 15 bucks each 40 for the compilation

02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:24.980
of you wait and you should because really those games have been out already so yeah

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:31.540
save five bucks all right well would you like to be able to play more games on the mac well

02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:36.980
maybe you can get a thing called boxer uh this isn't like boxers versus briefs or anything

02:17:36.980 --> 02:17:42.900
this is actually a boxer it's a dos box for the mac that's right i did a little joke there

02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:48.260
this will allow you to play old pc games on the mac but you know what all joking aside

02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:53.300
this is pretty cool uh dos box of course was a old emulator that will make uh playing games

02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:58.780
from the 80s and 90s actually doable on the modern machines boxer is kind of this redone

02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:04.220
for apple computers uh the mac series of course and uh what i like about it is they've kind

02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:08.300
of ripped off the interface of iBooks a little bit like you can see xcom in there although

02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:12.660
it's just the demo but doom 2 is playable in this which is pretty cool so if you own

02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:17.660
a mac um i would be checking this out boxerapp.com is where you can go to check out the boxer

02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:22.060
emulator for your old school dos fix and this doesn't come with any games right you have

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:26.920
to install your own yeah i'm pretty sure it's just some shareware is packaged in like i

02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:32.420
see uh doom 2 it's probably the freeware one and then underworld the demo ultimate underworld

02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:37.600
probably just box with some of those you can though for the record play pc games on a mac

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:45.100
you install the emulator or dual boot right parallels i think it's called but i think

02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:49.820
what this specifically does is the whole slow down to play the old games too which is important

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:54.340
because some of the old dos games you try to play them on a pc now i'm just like crazy

02:18:54.340 --> 02:19:00.300
you can't do it because you know the first computer i ever had pc was a 16 megahertz

02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:04.740
computer and it was blazing fast and you know i used to play games like x-men on it and

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:08.620
like these old screen covert action and all these games and now like what did computers

02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:15.300
go now 1000 megahertz so it's just like crazy so there you go check that out all right we're

02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:20.940
gonna get to the skype line but first we've got to do tonight's list list and reveal the

02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:27.620
winner so here it is tonight's definitive list no arguing folks it's a done deal this

02:19:27.620 --> 02:19:34.620
is a very scientific process the launch title that would have made you get a 3ds number

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:42.340
three breasts 3d that's right the game with boobs boobs and more boobs i already have

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:47.740
that game almost as good as the real thing i already have that game all right uh your

02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:51.220
number two answer for the game you most want to have on the 3ds would have made you get

02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:57.740
one today samus arand's motorboat and bikini blaster woohoo i see a pattern it could be

02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:04.220
in another nintendo tecmo collaboration there you go absolutely but the number one thing

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:10.980
that would have made you buy a 3ds today f-zero 3ds going for a serious answer there it is

02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:16.500
f-zero 3ds is the winner i thought for sure that it would be the offered racing game uh

02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:21.720
rebecca black's pre-teen convertible off-road racer one vote away from being and it was

02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:26.700
just it was fourth place just shy of the list i'm kind of glad though it won't be etched

02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:30.620
permanently into the wiki as a top three answer because like seriously that joke will be old

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:36.260
next week all right uh we totally missed out on all the charlie sheen references we could

02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:42.340
use i know you could winning 3ds but no one cares anymore i'm kind of over it i didn't

02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:48.700
care to be yeah yay we're watching a man self-destruct live on tv it's great but it's different now

02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:55.340
because it's a man doing it it's been a while yeah maybe he'll show his kush on tv and people

02:20:55.340 --> 02:21:03.580
will care as he's getting out of a limo sure cobwebby all right skype line is open now

had fled to south america yes he went to south america that fucking story yeah i know it's

02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:44.560

you guys all right what games uh let's see the resident evil series uh-huh just the whole

02:22:45.340 --> 02:22:53.740
damn series all of them uh well like uh number five resident evil five is uh i've never played

02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:59.340
it but it looks pretty cool i think i might like it why do you think you'd like resident

02:22:59.340 --> 02:23:06.540
evil five well i've seen uh videos of it and just the uh i did the graphics look amazing

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:12.580
and the gameplay looks cool now and you're a partner is a girl so you can't beat that

02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:17.620
now resident evil 5 has been out for some time so what's uh what's stopping you from

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:24.180
just getting the damn game already well i don't have the system oh wow wow wow that

02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:31.420
happens so you you are not an owner of any uh 360 ps3 type consoles no we've got a nintendo

02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:37.100
gamecube and uh nintendo 64 that's all right that shit's expensive the new stuff so you

02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:42.380
you you are kicking it old school yes i am so what games what old school games do you

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:55.540
enjoy playing uh let's see i've got um the uh old uh rampage games and uh have uh perfect

02:23:55.540 --> 02:24:03.220
dark the one for the 64 classic i also have um fighting for 64

02:24:03.220 --> 02:24:13.500
uh golden i double o seven well these are all classic games so so is it just like you

02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:18.040
know i'm kind of surprised if you own a gamecube and a 64 you haven't yet taken the plunge

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:24.060
and gotten a wee is it just is it just a money thing well i'm still living at home and i

02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:28.500
haven't moved out and i don't uh think i want to spend my money on that even though i like

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:32.740
playing on wheeze i don't think i want to own one yeah you know it's like you know the

02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:39.340
rent or a wee the ramps probably a good idea i mean seriously i know i'm gonna so i'm with

02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:45.100
the uh gamecube uh i've got uh diehard vendetta i don't think i'm not sure if you've heard

02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:49.780
of that uh no probably not i wasn't really into the diehard movies although well i don't

02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:54.940
know yippee-ki-yay motherfucker maybe i don't know just do we do we get that in the game

02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:58.780
do we get a yippee-ki-yay motherfucker in the game i uh haven't played in such a long

02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:03.940
time i've forgotten okay that's all right i probably not because it's a nintendo based

02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:09.580
product so well it's an unrated game so you never know that's true okay here here's my

02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:12.740
thing though uh resident evil you brought up resident evil five now one of the greatest

02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:17.380
gamecube games they ever made was resident evil four so have you checked that out on

02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:23.960
gamecube i think i do want to buy that and they i think they made that game for the we

02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:28.600
as well but it's the same the graphics are still the same yeah pretty much i mean the

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:33.420
we's just two game cubes duct taped together with fancy motion control anyway so that's

02:25:33.420 --> 02:25:38.260
a pretty good description uh how's your pc because some folks in chat are kind of commenting

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.960
wow this guy unfortunately has a lot of old systems from three years ago maybe he should

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:48.000
game on the pc have you have you tried gaming on pc i don't have a pc i'm actually using

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.940
a mac laptop right now well that well we just talked about dos box on the mac you might

02:25:52.940 --> 02:25:59.140
that might be an option for you i don't know yeah i've actually had the original uh one

02:25:59.140 --> 02:26:05.600
version of the original doom for the 64. i see so well uh you might have to check out

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.380
steam for the mac or something i don't know uh it's an option for you all right we gotta

02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:14.660
take some more calls any other uh last minute thoughts before we uh let you go uh no just

02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:18.580
that you guys do a really good job and uh keep doing what you're doing we will thank

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:24.660
you very much thank you thanks so much take care everybody bye you know not everybody

02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:28.540
can not everybody can take the plunge you're talking about 200 for a nintendo we because

02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:31.780
the folks in the chat room are like is that call from like three years ago what's going

02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:35.300
on but it's like you know that's also the reality of this economy is that not everybody

02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:39.060
gets to just take the plunge i should have asked how old he was because he did say he

02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:41.780
lived at home and you know granted a lot of adults live at home but he might have also

02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:46.700
been 16 which could have answered a lot of that i don't know all right one eight seven

02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:50.740
seven game olr our username on skype is orange lounge radio let's uh move on to some more

02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:54.980
calls hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey what's up guys this is kai judo

02:26:54.980 --> 02:27:00.260
kai judo what's on your mind buddy but i just wanted to call real quick about uh pokemon

02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:06.660
uh black and white pokemon before i say that yeah yeah i have it i have both actually but

02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:11.860
um before i go on tonight i just want to say uh that previous caller uh die hard vandetta

02:27:11.860 --> 02:27:16.540
he called it uh it does have a lot of cursing in it awesome it's actually uh a big deal

02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:20.340
they were trying to go after nintendo because of all the foul language there's so many f

02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:26.420
bombs in that game nice you wouldn't believe it i'm glad but um anyway so yeah the pokemans

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:32.100
show us your pokemans yeah i definitely recommend it i mean i think um if you haven't played

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:36.020
pokemon in a while i think you should definitely pick this one up i mean they always add something

02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:41.220
new to the pokemon games and uh what they added new to this one is uh there's a lot of um

02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:47.940
uh uh wi-fi connectability to the game like um they have the whole uh you know the big thing

02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:53.300
that's like street pass they have that where if you have your uh your ds on and you walk by

02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:58.340
someone and they have a pokemon you exchange information they have the uh you can battle

02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:06.740
people online um what else do they have they have mudkip 2.0 huh mudkip 2.0

02:28:07.940 --> 02:28:10.420
i don't even know what that is i'm just trolling don't listen to me

02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:17.220
but anyway yeah they have this thing called uh g gear where it's like um you have three different

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:21.940
types of ways that you can connect with people uh there's the uh infrared where it's like it's

02:28:21.940 --> 02:28:26.660
like a face-to-face type of connection that you do then there's the uh like i've mentioned before

02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:31.460
you know like the street pass type thing and then there's the uh internet wi-fi and i mean there's

02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:38.020
just a lot to it i mean it's a really big game i mean i can go i i can go on forever about um how

02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:42.180
much they added to the game it's really a great game so my ignorance earlier in the show should

02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:46.660
not have said that the pokemon games haven't really changed in a while well i mean it's your

02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:51.620
opinion but actually they have changed the one that you mentioned uh the ruby what was it ruby

02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:58.740
silver yeah now ruby what they yeah i mean i'm not i'm not the biggest uh pokemon historian but um

02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:02.980
what i think is what they added to that one was the day and night phases which they didn't have

02:29:02.980 --> 02:29:08.260
in the uh the original which was i think well was it red and blue or some shit okay but to be fair

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:13.140
i mean how much does that really change the core mechanic of the game i mean maybe a little bit

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:17.380
because i mean certain certain pokemon you couldn't catch you know you have to catch them at certain

02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:22.100
days of the week you have to catch them at certain uh you know either day or night i mean you know

02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:26.420
i mean they they really do innovative stuff with it i mean you know it may not be something that's

02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:31.540
gonna like uh change how you think about pokemon but i mean they always uh consider the fans and

02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:36.500
they you know they kind of like cater to what uh the fans want like whatever the fans are asking

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:41.620
for it you can almost guarantee it'll be in the next pokemon game let me ask one of the fanboy

02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:45.540
questions of the year and i don't know how many times we brought this up on the show but why do

02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:50.020
you think nintendo hasn't taken the plunge and done a pokemon mmo everybody i would even fucking

02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:55.380
play a pokemon mmo well you you mentioned earlier um like i said i'm not the biggest uh pokemon

02:29:55.380 --> 02:30:02.420
historian but they do have this uh website thing that's coming out on uh march 30th which is kind

02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:06.580
of gonna is i guess you could say it's kind of like a minimum uh mmo you're gonna have like some

02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:12.580
kind of pokey farm and you can you can raise your pokemon slaves there and you know make them fight

02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:16.100
you know you know all that type of stuff so i mean they do have some type of uh

02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:21.220
nmo thing going on i don't think you'll be walking around a ton of people and interacting with them

02:30:21.220 --> 02:30:25.940
like in a while but um you'll be able to link up with maybe i don't know maybe 10 people in a room

02:30:26.580 --> 02:30:32.260
and you can all like uh chat and this you can tie razorblades to their feet and all that shit

02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:36.180
this sounds like you're turning cock fighting into a video game but you've just replaced

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:40.420
that with pikachu that's pretty much what pokemon is when you you know when you get down to it

02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:44.580
you're basically catching you'd be a very dirty yes yeah it's cock fighting pretty much but i

02:30:44.580 --> 02:30:50.500
mean it's great you know i mean i i don't mind it get your pikachu out of my cock fighting game

02:30:51.780 --> 02:30:55.620
sorry we're having too much fun yes better than getting the real roosters and having them beat the

02:30:55.620 --> 02:30:59.540
crap out of each other you could do it virtually all right and that and that's pretty much what

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:04.260
the main story is about in this game there's actually uh a guy who wants uh to free all the

02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:07.620
pokemon because he's like oh you know we're enslaving them and we're doing all this crazy

02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:17.380
shit so he's basically pita yeah yeah all right would that be people for the ethical treatment

02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:24.500

02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:54.100
black and white well you have more stuff to do with pokemon uh you have to uh watch out for

02:32:54.100 --> 02:33:01.780
stats like special attack and defense you also have to raise some certain pokemon to to obtain

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:09.140
them you have to work that pokemon you have to train them can you can you whip your pokemon

02:33:09.140 --> 02:33:17.460
like the derby owners club if you're a competitive player pretty much you have to do that no okay

02:33:17.460 --> 02:33:28.180
all right and also uh about nintendo not doing the pokemon mmo pretty much nintendo i think has said

02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:36.180
that they don't want to do it because it's uh it's a very very big project and i think they

02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:42.100
said that that it couldn't work well fuck them give me what i want is that too much to ask

02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:49.300
everyone would play it i know i i don't play mmos i don't like them but i know i would play a

02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:54.420
pokemon mmo i want i dare somebody to call in and say they wouldn't play the pokemon mmo anyone in

02:33:54.420 --> 02:33:59.380

02:33:59.380 --> 02:34:04.260

02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:10.900
shoot pokemon no because i don't like it i think the stupid series that certain people over age

02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:15.700
hold on hold on i just i have to know haven't you bought every single animal crossing game they've

02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:24.180

02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:36.420
to play pokemon mmo i bought nintendo dogs and i hate it and i'm getting rid of it so you know what

02:34:37.700 --> 02:34:43.620
it doesn't matter i want to play nintendo buy it oh you want to play the new nintendo dogs

02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:52.100
boot up the old nintendo and get drunk it'll be in 3d there i don't know i just want someone to

02:34:52.100 --> 02:34:59.700
convince my husband to get me my 3ds uh look what you started act f we're all fighting it's all in

02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:03.300
the fighting tonight i know olr is going to break up tonight and it's all because of your call i

02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:07.620
just want you to know that i'm kidding i'm sorry about that sorry i'm kidding all right well

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:15.700
basically nintendo said uh the most principle thing they that uh what's the word they don't

02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:23.220
want to do it because it's a big infrastructure and it's uh like i said a very big project for

02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:28.580
for them to handle and they don't want to do it i see they're the number one selling console in

02:35:28.580 --> 02:35:33.620
the motherfucking world yet they can't afford the infrastructure to put out a pokemon mmo

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:39.860
little old microsoft i have no idea how they're doing it and sony she's boy they're sure suckers

02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:46.180
well to uh to uh you know their defense that microsoft doesn't have an mmo

02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:53.940
but they have an online infrastructure which is more than nintendo has debatable to i mean

02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:57.700
they did have final fantasy 11 you know i'm always going to whip out that card and fantasy star

02:35:57.700 --> 02:36:01.860
universe that's true has all right fine then they already have more than intended us it's a

02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:07.540
microsoft just is opposed to mmos for some reason there's some weird thing going on like i don't

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:12.580
know if they were just burned by final fantasy 11 or what but i don't know or maybe it has something

02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:17.620
to do with their next system maybe the next system is all going to be about mmos who knows i'm making

02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:24.100
shit up now all right act f before i let you go since we've completely um you know derailed your

02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:29.300
phone calls many times uh anything else you want to share with our folks tonight well just one

02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:39.060
question one last question of course would you pay around 525 for a 3ds hell no i wouldn't not

02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:42.340
right now not until more games come out let me guess that's how much you're having to pay in

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:51.220
mexico huh yep don't you live not far from the border luckily but for those who doesn't or who

02:36:51.220 --> 02:36:56.340
don't you need to just drive to san diego or find a friend here who can help you out for a lot

02:36:56.340 --> 02:37:02.340
cheaper that's crazy talk 500 bucks i can find a friend i have i live pretty much across the border

02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:10.660
so i can find a friend and k can bring me one but those who live on the south those are pretty much

02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:17.860
screwed they're paying six hundred six thousand pesos which is around 525 dollars for only a 3ds

02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:24.500
unbelievable all right well act after we hope uh it gets to a more reasonable level in mexico soon

02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:30.020
but it is launch day i mean give it a few weeks to stabilize you know if the sales are not so hot

02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:33.540
or at least not maybe as hot as some people thought maybe the price will drop pretty quickly

02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:40.100
we'll see no doubt it but well let's see we'll see all right take care buddy take care you too

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:44.180
boy sometimes we forget how spoiled we are in america that at least these game companies put

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:50.100
out the consoles here you know what i mean it's weird that nintendo doesn't do more with mexico

02:37:50.100 --> 02:37:55.060
because you know they have the the manuals all in spanish and french so that they can launch

02:37:55.060 --> 02:38:00.900
in multiple regions simultaneously i don't know let's go to one or two more calls hi you're on

02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:05.220
orange launch radio who's this hey it's ron how's everyone doing tonight hey good rama i just want

02:38:05.220 --> 02:38:10.020
to say real quick to this our phones are like packed tonight it's weird like it's just constantly

02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:14.260
lit up the whole screen so if you don't get through tonight don't get sand in your vagina

02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:17.780
just send us an email mailbag at orange launch radio.com because millions of people will call

02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:21.220
but yet no one will email us i don't understand all right barama you got through what's on your

02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:27.780
mind tonight a few things um number one i know the music is out on the podcast but when you were

02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:35.060
playing music from um space channel five i had mentioned that about years ago i was in a skit

02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:39.540
where it was dance dance revolution versus space channel five i had to have been at least 10 years

02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:47.140
ago when ddr was popular i'm just kidding i bet it was close to seven what was uh what was what

02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:53.780
was this ddr versus space channel five sketch it was pretty much a dance off between which was

02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:59.140
better on the characters from space channel five or ddr but what had happened was way to see it

02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:04.340
let's go after the dance off uh the main villain from space channel five part two comes out tries

02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:10.580
to take over the convention both sides join forces and do another dance off to destroy him but we

02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:15.380
cut it in half because we couldn't get everything together now which character did you play and

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:23.540
please don't say space michael rage rage nice you wear pants no i did not have the hair i didn't

02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:30.420
have time to throw that together you didn't go as pantsless rage no it's an old school a large

02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:38.580
old school old school good you wore pants yes indeed so who ultimately ended up being victorious

02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:46.180
the ddr people or the space channel five people i really don't know because it just ended up like

02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:50.180
a tie per se but we still ended up winning an award which was pretty cool it was open to

02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:56.340
interpretation that's what it was yes whatever you wanted to happen you as the viewer so what

02:39:56.340 --> 02:40:02.340
cons are coming up rama any cons you're going to soon you're the con king uh anime boston but you

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:06.180
know that's them but i do have a couple more things i want to cover that i'm gonna be on my

02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:13.860
merry little way all right number one loki you mentioned about what's the point of having

02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:18.740
projectors with video games and stuff like that something tells me you've never seen gaming

02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:24.660
tournaments i missed like half of what you just said there yeah you you bought uh you botched up

02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:28.580
a little bit i don't know the connection but let me just repeat a little bit um rama is basically

02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:31.380
a couple weeks ago on the show i don't even remember when you said it but you talked about

02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:35.940
projectors for consoles and who needs projectors on consoles but rama is saying well what about

02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:40.500
gaming tournaments or anime cons or you know he does conventions and probably sees like ddr on

02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:46.500
projectors all the time at the atari party they had um games on projector yeah that's cool that

02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:50.660
you can do that but you can do that with pretty much any console i don't think it needs to be

02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:59.300
necessarily built into a console and that being its you know its uh primary source of you know

02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:06.020
putting out the images it's just it's impractical for a lot of people i mean for maybe a convention

02:41:06.020 --> 02:41:11.540
or something like that where you don't want to bring a tv um that may work but the majority of

02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:17.140
people out there don't use projectors a projector is basically a tv you know and so you use it for

02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:24.180
certain scenarios so i guess that's where loki's coming from eh i'm just saying you know if you if

02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:28.340
it's like if they come out with like some sort of 3d holographic system or something like that that

02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:35.300
requires some special display that's not out there holodeck in a box you know then you know you want

02:41:35.300 --> 02:41:40.900
one but like if it's just like oh look it's this console with a projector like a pico projector

02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:51.540
built in it's kind of i don't know it's neat i guess but it's impractical unless of course it

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:55.140
runs on batteries and that might be pretty cool because then you can at least take it places and

02:41:55.140 --> 02:42:02.660
play stuff but um you know i don't know all right rama anything else i had something else but i'll

02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:07.140
save that for another time all right fair enough or you can email hint hint we need more emails all

02:42:07.140 --> 02:42:15.140
right we'll do rama take care buddy no problem bye have fun at anime boston be good times all

02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:20.820
right uh let's go ahead and get to some more calls 1877 game olr username on skype is orange

02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:35.220
see what's lighting up now it's not well it takes about a minute in about a minute it's going to

02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:39.300

it's a series that's on the uh ios system real racing um they've got real racing 2 hd that's

02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:56.340
going to be getting a ipad 2 update that's actually going to turn the ipad 2 into almost

02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:02.740
like a console it's uh 1080p visuals which make it look almost like a gran turismo type quality

02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:08.740
game and use the actual um ipad as the steering wheel with the gas and brake on there and it has

02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:14.580
a like a map display on the actual ipad but the actual games on the tv let me go to the phones

02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:19.620
because we like clockwork like almost exactly a certain number of seconds after i said we're done

02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:23.940
the buffer caught up we got another lit up board this is going to be the last call though guys um

02:43:23.940 --> 02:43:27.940
so if you didn't get through again please email sorry all right uh hi caller you're on the air

02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:33.380
who's this hey this is excellent hey what's on your mind buddy hey never much um first off i'm

02:43:33.380 --> 02:43:38.500
very proud of my stepdaughter she's loving and she already been in less than about a month and

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:42.820
a half been through the first two games of the professor latent series and only needed help like

02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:47.060
once or twice with one or two of the puzzles that is really amazing that's really good that's a very

02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:52.340
cerebral game so awesome for her yeah she's very smart and she loves this type of puzzle game so

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:56.500
i'm looking forward to getting her the third one you got a kid genius on your hand mensa test

02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:01.940
yeah really no joke um i bought pokemon black the day it came out and i really loved it and

02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:07.300
i haven't played pokemon for quite a while i really pissed off the original and the only

02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:12.580
reason why i got it was because a lot of my friends i knew had was getting either getting

02:44:12.580 --> 02:44:18.340
the black or getting white so i decided well why not so you know and um try it out i'm really

02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:23.300
enjoying it i'm enjoying the way the graphics has updated some of the move sets have changed around

02:44:23.300 --> 02:44:29.540
and the different ways they're doing the wi-fi connection now so i can trade with friends even

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:34.900
from across states if i wanted to which was really cool which i tried that out so it was though the

02:44:34.900 --> 02:44:40.020
microphone when it came on kind of threw for a loop but um it was very it's very cool though i

02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:44.340
mean the the features and the functionality to put into it unfortunately it's kind of sad that

02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:49.860
the global link where you could put your pokemon and do dream and put them in like a dream world

02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:55.300
was kind of like a um web browser game type thing unfortunately won't be coming anytime soon because

02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:59.860
of the fact that over japan with the earthquake they had to shut down the servers for it and they

02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:05.620
came out with a release saying though it was supposed to come on on the 30th um for uh north

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:13.060
america and europe there's an infinite delay as to when it's going to actually go up so that was the

02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:16.420
one that previous call was talking about that was supposed to go up on the 30th unfortunately there

02:45:16.420 --> 02:45:22.100
has been a delay and they have really statements about that so let me ask you the same fanboy

02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:26.100
question i haven't asked everybody else about the whole pokemon mmo would you would you leave

02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:33.540
warcraft for a pokemon mmo no no why is that i think that would be more towards your like

02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:39.300
smaller kids and stuff kind of like the free realm is for like sony um i really don't see it

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:46.500
mean more towards adults i wouldn't mind playing it just for you know lols or if it's you know for

02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:51.220
a good price but i just don't really see me playing a pokemon mmo when i just can go online

02:45:51.220 --> 02:45:55.300
and just do the same things to the regular pokemon and just challenge somebody over wi-fi

02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:59.940
gotcha unless they're gonna offer like a bunch more stuff to it so

02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:06.340
i don't know i'm just i'm just type you know i just thought i couldn't really see myself doing

02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:10.900
that but if they didn't want to do it it'll be a good cash cow go for it it'll probably give

02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:15.140
wild probably run for our money if they if they can pull if they can play it off and do it right

02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:21.780
that is and um also coming into the straight mail too for the bio well the bioware sorry really

02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:28.340
quickly i don't get offended when i would play games say like dragon age uh dragon age 2 mass

02:46:28.340 --> 02:46:34.340
effect and had a chill quote gay uh sex scene would happen i'm not gonna be like oh my god i

02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:38.260
can't believe i'm seeing this i mean i couldn't believe somebody actually wrote about that and

02:46:38.260 --> 02:46:42.900
said for all the street mail sorry not everybody's like that and not everybody will be like that so

02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:50.340
and if i don't like something i just don't play it that's as simple as that so right so uh yeah um

02:46:51.380 --> 02:46:56.740
it was a weird story and it's it's kind of cool though the bioware like came out and just totally

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:01.300
like defended it and i'm glad that like if they're gonna go all in like that they really go like all

02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:06.740
in and stand by it and you know the artistic stuff behind it precisely and i don't see any reason as

02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:12.260
to why it didn't cause an outcry people knew about this way before i mean as soon as the game hits

02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:16.500
people knew about this they warned people and they were like oh we're putting all this stuff in we're

02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:20.900
showing you some of the scenes and they're letting people know and it's like it was your choice

02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:26.500
either you do you can either a buy it knowing what was in it or b don't buy it don't worry about it

02:47:26.500 --> 02:47:31.780
at all and just don't get all up you know don't make those decisions like like like it was said

02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:37.540
before you have to go through so many decisions before that would even happen and you would know

02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:43.060
because of by the reaction of the people and what they say i mean it's kind of obvious all right

02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:48.580
well we'll leave it on that for now excellent thanks so much for the call anytime enjoy your

02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:54.020

02:49:28.500 --> 02:49:33.620
didn't get through but remember we do have an email mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com all

02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:39.700
right any other last minute stories we didn't get to loki no um but i did want to mention one thing

02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:45.860
though and just after watching the updated you know system update thing for uh the okay go video

02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:50.180
if they don't use this song in some sort of promotion for nintendo dogs they are really like

02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:56.180
really just missing the boat here because it's with friends which because all the games are

02:49:56.180 --> 02:50:02.020
nintendo dogs and cats you know with friends um and it's got fucking dogs in the damn video and

02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:11.780
it's in 3d come on nintendo it's like here you go great ad campaign don't have to do anything you

02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:18.180
you just go go with it okay go no seriously though i'm surprised they should have if they wanted to

02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:21.620
be kind of hip and cool about it they could have done like a cool intro video like they did with

02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:25.540
little big planet where it was with live actors and stuff like that that i'm pretty awesome

02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:30.500
but then again the game is just a rehash of the last game or they just need to get oprah to

02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:39.460
give away 3ds is on our last show and you get a 3ds and you get a 3ds it's by nintendo she already

02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:43.940
had her last favorite things episode though and the audience completely just lost their minds of

02:50:43.940 --> 02:50:49.620
course they did awesome you would too if you've been in that audience hold me i would have been

02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.140
you if you got to go to the britney concert she totally told them too because she never says that

02:50:53.140 --> 02:50:57.780
it's a giveaway episode so it's like oh we're going to talk about to cancer patients and it's

02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:02.180
very sad then all of a sudden all the big balloons fall out of the sky and everyone you know celebrate

02:51:02.180 --> 02:51:08.020

02:51:45.620 --> 02:51:51.620
there's an infrared camera on the 3ds infrared camera plus motion controls what does that equal

02:51:51.620 --> 02:52:00.580
we integration yay dance party dance party all you need people is playing some wii game and they

02:52:00.580 --> 02:52:07.380
just fling their 3ds out of their hand it's just gone is the 3ds condom all right my final thought

02:52:07.380 --> 02:52:14.500
for the night is care packages from japan rock especially sugary foods nom dark soccer you have
