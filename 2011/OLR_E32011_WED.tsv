9292	23033	DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Tonight, June 8th, 2011 We bring you further impressions and opinions on E3 Live with special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov on the show floor
31078	39808	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to night number two of E3 live coverage here at Orange Lounge Radio.
40549	51721	In conjunction with Ustream, our little temporary home for the shows, and, of course, the one and only Bobby Blackwolf, who does his own show on Sunday nights and is also syndicating the show to his feed as well as our feed, so it's just...
52922	54003	All out there for everybody.
54043	55645	So I'm glad you guys are enjoying it.
56065	56906	My name is Rob Roberts.
56946	62991	I'll be joining you over the next hour, hour and a half, however long we go tonight with my co-hosts here in the studio.
63291	65053	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura.
65373	65733	Carrot.
66254	68756	So you've gone from meat last night to carrot tonight.
69036	70316	Yes, because I want something crunchy.
89742	92164	We are live, of course, live on Ustream.
92244	96627	If this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream, this is not where we're usually at.
96827	99790	We do a Sunday night live show every week at All Games Radio.
99830	105475	More information about our podcast and all that good stuff, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
105515	110739	And you can listen to last night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U. Wii U, Wii U.
111680	114963	and Xbox and Kinect and the Vita.
114983	117285	We're going to actually get more into the Vita tonight.
118365	119386	It is live, of course.
119426	127753	You can join us in our chat room at chat.orangeloungerated.com if you have any live comments you want to give us as we're broadcasting here live.
128995	133799	Speaking of live, sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to mix things up a little bit tonight.
134319	135660	We're not going to start with Bobby tonight.
135680	136701	Bobby's caught in traffic.
136761	137202	He's still...
137982	139363	in LA downtown.
139403	142363	I guess the last text I got is that a Transformer blew out somewhere.
142724	143804	So sorry, Bobby fans.
143824	146105	We're going to have to go to him a little later.
146605	149106	But we're going to go right into today's coverage of E3.
149306	154187	And from what I understand, our correspondents out on the floor got some more hands-on impressions today.
154307	163550	As you know, yesterday, Bobby waited for quite a while in that Wii U, Wii U, Wii U line to about, what, like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U and gave us his impressions yesterday.
164511	164591	Uh...
165991	166272	PS Vita
180097	180557	Very sad, in my soul
204932	206193	But of course, it's just his opinion.
206213	207313	It's just one opinion.
208174	208594	So we'll see.
208634	209754	Maybe Bobby got to play it today.
209774	210975	We'll see if he thought the same thing.
213716	214037	Hello?
214117	215037	Hey, is this Miklatov?
216098	216298	Yes.
216438	219059	Hey, it's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio, of course.
219079	219559	You should know that.
219599	220280	I just texted you.
220400	220740	I know.
221520	223221	It's so surprising.
223281	223521	I know.
224142	227483	Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit and bringing you on first tonight.
227523	228924	Bobby's caught in traffic.
228964	229584	Where are you?
229724	230485	Are you back at your hotel?
231653	232914	Yes, I made it back.
233234	233734	It's fine.
233794	235515	After 50 minutes of commuting.
235635	236856	How was E3 for you today?
261047	270880	It was, well, I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about three hours, if that, because today was my stand in line day.
277208	282493	It took about 4 hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10.30 so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it
305054	306394	if you can consider it that.
306595	308915	I did play with it for about 20 minutes.
309255	311156	So I got some good hands-on time with it.
311476	311936	Not bad.
312396	313597	And what are your thoughts?
315578	316238	I really like it.
316398	320919	It's definitely a great successor to the PSP.
321379	325641	For the design part of the system, the screen is beautiful.
325781	327021	It's really big.
327101	328082	It's really vibrant.
328922	331223	You really don't see any pixels whatsoever.
332123	334604	It's playing a nice high-def screen.
336385	343311	The back part with the touchpad, I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too much of the back.
344172	351958	So you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you use the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up.
352779	356082	But that's just a minor complaint.
356102	359185	I'm sure if I held it the right way because there's grips it would be a little bit better.
359656	361197	I wonder if you could just turn that crap off.
361317	364378	Do you think you could just turn off that back touchpad altogether?
364398	365639	Because I didn't even think about that.
365659	371142	But yeah, if you have a tendency to tap on the back of your device or something, it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff, right?
372683	373623	Yeah, it will.
373923	376285	I assume that some games will have that.
376585	378486	I don't think it will be a system setting.
380487	388711	The one thing that I actually do not like about the system is that the face buttons are way too small.
389358	398661	I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit the X button, but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the X button should be.
398821	402702	Instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with.
402722	404643	I did not ask and they did not say.
404663	404843	I assume...
416860	422707	because of how close to, I mean, really, if you think about if it's supposed to be this holiday, it's only a few months out.
423388	426672	So I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design.
427307	427747	Thanks for watching!
450593	451914	Anyhow.
452014	454076	Okay, so this isn't about the DS, though.
454096	455036	It's about the PS Vita.
455697	457718	So tell us about some of the games that you played and what they were like.
458939	462982	Okay, they had a station set up for us to go to, and we got five minutes on each.
463782	464463	Or was it four?
464503	464963	I don't remember.
464983	467084	I can't remember the amount of stations, but I'll list them off.
467865	471828	The first one we went to was the LittleBigPlanet station.
472128	477792	So you got to play, or you got your choice of a couple different options in LittleBigPlanet.
477872	479313	You could play a stage, or you could play a game.
479918	485481	or you could play a two-player game using just the touchscreen and you would play with the demo guy.
485862	491265	I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would really work in the practical play.
492186	493586	And I was really impressed.
493927	505373	It used everything from the touchpad to tilting the system, or not touchpad, sorry, the touchscreen to tilting the system and it played like LittleBigPlanet and it looked like LittleBigPlanet on the PS3.
505433	507575	So I was really impressed.
508275	509516	One of the puzzles that it had me do was
510029	518902	There was a keyboard in the background and I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it would open the door.
519162	520124	I thought that was really cool.
520643	525744	I would say it felt more like a separate experience because the Vita special features really made it feel that way.
550410	558474	So there was a part where I had to hold on to one of the little spinning wheels, and it wasn't spinning yet.
558514	571040	So while I was holding it with the R trigger, or whatever it's called, the R button, I had to use my left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up to the top.
571060	572101	I was like, that doesn't...
572694	573414	You know, this is cool.
573734	574435	Not something I would expect.
574455	575375	No, no, these are really small.
575395	576316	Like, my hands are not big at all, and
593018	595880	These, I swear, were like the size of mini M&Ms.
597141	598662	Something people might know.
598942	599983	Okay, there you go.
600043	601024	That's a good comparison.
602705	603445	Okay, so what else?
603485	614233	LittleBigPlanet and... Okay, after that, they sent us over to Virtua Tennis, which, so far, these two games, I was told, are launch titles for the system.
615514	617775	So, Virtua Tennis, really nice-looking...
619315	622957	They had you play it first with just touch screen.
622997	625979	So you would press the spot on the court to move your guy.
626019	627660	You'd hold your finger down and your guy would move.
627980	632923	And then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin.
633343	634864	And it actually worked really well.
635864	637665	Then I was introduced to control.
637725	638846	Wait, wait, wait.
639086	642368	How is that touch screen stuff different from like playing an iPhone game?
642408	643629	Or is that really what it felt like?
643649	644709	Like, oh, I'm playing an iPhone game.
644729	645730	That's really what it felt like.
645790	646470	With nice graphics?
646490	647090	It was nicer.
647791	647931	Okay.
647971	648071	Okay.
648863	649923	and it was on a bigger screen.
650664	652925	Oh, okay.
653445	660688	So then he told me to do all my hits with the touchscreen and I could move with the analog stick.
661028	663969	I was like, okay, I kind of like the way that one played.
664469	667430	And then it was like, oh, just play normally.
667810	672372	It wasn't super impressive, but it was still really fun because retro test games are pretty fun.
674593	676714	So after my time was up there,
677838	681961	I went to the, what's that super game called?
682782	683562	Little Deviants.
684543	690647	That game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up Nintendo with.
691688	695090	It seems to be a collection of mini-games, for the most part.
696391	697812	There were three that we got to play.
697872	705798	The first one was an AR game, just like Face Raiders, to a T, with the exception of putting somebody's face in it.
706652	716335	You just look around with your screen all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters.
718656	723878	The next one was a whack-a-mole style game that used both the touchscreen and the touchpad on the back.
724438	733961	So windows would open up and if they were facing you, you had to touch the touchscreen on them and if they were back turned to you, you had to press from behind underneath.
735062	738225	and watch out for the humans because you lost points for that.
738965	741928	These all definitely sound like little gimmicky demos.
742848	748132	To be fair, it's probably the same stuff they're demoing the Wii U with right now.
749654	750314	Exactly.
751475	763424	The last one was the one that probably everybody's seen where you have the touchpad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball, the BBM ball guy around into the whirlpool.
763845	764245	That one
764693	777358	was probably what really frustrated me most with the touchpad on the back just because, I mean, it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the pad the way they don't want you to do it.
778538	783060	And there was no clear definition on the back where the touchpad started and where it ended.
783880	785781	So that one was really hard for me.
786081	789563	So Little Deviants, though, it sounds like it's just a minigame collection.
789763	790103	I don't know.
790143	791443	To me, it kind of sounds like a pass.
791463	792164	I've seen it before.
792204	792784	What did you think?
794558	797220	It's not a purchase for me at all.
797981	799642	It was bundled in with the system.
799662	803886	I'm not going to delete it, but I'm not going to purchase it.
806088	810291	The next one I went to was Sound... What did I call it?
810371	812353	Sound... Something or other.
812373	814474	Sound... Sound something.
815175	816196	Was it a music game?
817457	818517	Yes, it kind of was.
818998	819098	Um...
819656	823419	Man, now I feel bad because I was talking about how much I love that game.
823479	824260	Sound Shapes.
824620	825821	I'm looking at your text from earlier.
825861	826441	Sound Shapes.
827742	828823	Yes, thank you.
828863	829384	Sound Shapes.
829744	833187	Which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at the press conference.
833207	835128	And when you texted me that, I'm like, what the hell is that?
835188	837770	That must be a game they didn't say anything about otherwise.
839071	840432	It's been talked about before.
840652	841173	I know that.
841613	843955	It's made by the guy that did...
844693	848596	I want to say either PixelJunk or Everyday Shooter.
848656	849257	I don't remember.
849297	850118	It's one of those two.
851659	853541	But in it, it's got two modes.
853561	856983	It's got a platforming mode, which is very simplistic shapes.
858465	862949	You're this little blue spiky ball looking thing.
863569	867332	But the object is to get through the level and to hit these blue orbs.
867412	870475	And every time you hit a blue orb in that screen, it creates
871078	875182	Like the drums for the music, or it creates the guitar, or the keyboard.
875623	877104	So you keep going through it.
877224	877945	But, uh, yeah, so...
895686	900588	You go through different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music.
900648	907571	It was very much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away.
909032	916115	I was told, again, launch title, and that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play.
918296	921378	And that's the other part of the demo.
921658	924399	He was showing me how to create my own stage and placing...
924972	929634	Music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps and it was really cool.
929774	930594	I liked it a lot.
930914	931334	Interesting.
931775	949081	As a music game fan, this is kind of a must-have for you because I'm looking at this going, this does not look at all like other music games, but I'm glad because I think it's, you know, I don't always need to see falling notes that you hit whatever device to, you know, so this is kind of nice.
950430	958037	Yeah, I think it's not only a game for music fans, but also for possibly platforming fans.
958057	959839	People who like to get high and play video games.
961521	962041	What was that?
962281	964063	People who like to get high and play video games.
965304	971170	No, because they'll probably try to eat their PSV or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster.
971910	974813	We need new cracks since Mojibribbin's already out.
974833	975474	Yeah.
977585	982409	That's kind of like, it's simplistic like that, like Vibra and stuff.
982849	984151	So I think it was great.
984871	989936	Definitely going to be the first game I buy because it was the one that impressed me the most.
990296	993519	Which makes me sad because the next demo I went to was Uncharted.
994079	1000565	And that was the game that at first announcement had sold me on the Vita before it was called that and before I had played it.
1001986	1003548	And it didn't disappoint me per se.
1004732	1007954	I think it looked beautiful and played like Uncharted.
1008474	1015057	My problem with it is those tiny little M&M buttons that they just got in my way.
1015777	1017938	I couldn't perform moves as well.
1019619	1026082	I definitely got shot and killed twice during our demo because I couldn't get the button properly.
1027542	1030043	Did you try any of the touchscreen controls?
1031264	1031604	Was that?
1032367	1034508	I absolutely thought it was stupid.
1034528	1040152	Because I have to, instead of like, you know, position myself with the camera and my body for the next enemy...
1061869	1069993	After I'm done punching this guy to death, it takes one hand off of that and I have to focus on tapping the little fist icon, which was stupid.
1071253	1076915	I thought you would like that because when I was seeing that in the trailer, I was like, that looks like Elite Beat Agents and that's like Milita's favorite game.
1078336	1080057	No, no, it's nothing like that at all.
1080177	1083178	It was frustrating and kind of annoying.
1083538	1087280	But I'm sure that that will not be the only way to play.
1088518	1099042	I think I probably used the little M&M buttons to hit too, but the demo, I didn't get a chance to try that because like, oh, use the touchscreen only for combat.
1099062	1102784	I was like, okay, thanks for getting me killed.
1105725	1109726	But yeah, that ended the PS Vita experience.
1109966	1111247	So it was worth the four-hour wait?
1112687	1113628	Yes, I think so.
1113648	1117269	Because I think I have waited in long lines at E3 before.
1117856	1120818	and not come away as satisfied as I did with the Vita.
1121339	1126503	Yeah, I don't think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because I think a lot of that has to do with
1144986	1153552	My hands being more accustomed to holding a PSP, so my fingers gravitate to where I think it's going to be at.
1154432	1156594	Let's be honest, it looks just like a PSP.
1156614	1162257	It's a little bit longer, a little bit wider, and a lot lighter actually.
1162337	1164859	It's like nothing in your hands whatsoever.
1166522	1167383	PSP, BackTouch, FrontTouch, Power
1188428	1191735	I wouldn't say slightly more power, I'd say a lot more power Yes
1201357	1211884	It doesn't like, when you see the screen in person, that's what got my attention first.
1212185	1218469	And then the weight in my hands got it second, and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once.
1219298	1223959	Now, I kind of asked Bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the Wii U most of the day.
1224079	1226120	You waited in line for the PS Vita most of the day.
1226420	1229080	Did you catch any kind of like buzz from people around you?
1229140	1234361	Now, see, the funny thing was Bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak English yesterday, so there was like no one for him to listen to.
1234721	1237282	But did you kind of catch what was the buzz?
1237322	1238922	What were other people saying about the Vita?
1239242	1241703	Were people complaining about the controller like you were or –
1243191	1243391	It was a
1273207	1286388	So it wasn't like some random person, but they were talking to one of the Naughty Dog people that were over there, and they said that Skyrim is going to have about 30 hours of main quests and 300 hours of side quests.
1286958	1287038	Yeah.
1287579	1287799	Yeah.
1311954	1316235	Alright, so the PS Vita took up most of your day, but you were happy with it at the end of the day.
1316575	1318016	What else were you able to get your hands on today?
1319316	1326158	I got to play Child of Eden, which was definitely not totally what I was expecting, but I still really liked it.
1328178	1337441	The control scheme's a little weird, and it was a guy, the guy that was explaining to me, A, wasn't from Ubisoft, B, was from Walmart, and C...
1338826	1342768	Look at me again and realize the amount of knowledge you probably had about the game.
1344670	1347051	He didn't really tell me how to play properly, I don't think.
1347912	1352935	So it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing.
1353395	1354796	But it felt a lot like Rez.
1354876	1355656	It looked like Rez.
1355736	1356997	It sounded like Rez.
1358818	1362220	But the two firing mechanisms are different.
1362280	1368404	Like your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on these pinkish enemies.
1369109	1381514	and your right hand is your lock-on gun and I couldn't tell if I was supposed to lock on fully and then fling my hand forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot.
1381794	1388557	I think I had to fling my hand forward but I definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die so it didn't matter.
1389617	1390918	And the music was really good, I imagine?
1392458	1396220	What little I could hear, yeah, because this one was outside underneath the tent
1397101	1403986	which is of course the optimal playing environment for a music game and a Kinect game.
1404166	1411030	They must have been at that booth where I think Rock of the Dead was shown last year and it was not a great location.
1411470	1413331	You know where that booth was?
1413431	1418795	That booth was where a long time ago I think you were there for the T3 where they had the Bald's tent set up.
1420716	1422297	I don't even think I remember that, but that's alright.
1424164	1437473	That's like not even on convention grounds, it's across the street Oh jeez, oh god, okay, you weren't even in the convention center at that point Yeah, that's when I was walking there this morning and they were like, hey, do you want to come play some games?
1437493	1448260	We've got Brink, and I was like, no, and they're like, and Trials of Eden, and I was like, yep, let's go over there Because I still haven't found it on the show floor, and I've been looking It's probably not there because it's out, like what, next week?
1448360	1452363	So I don't think there's a lot more to say about it Alright, well, what else did you get your hands on?
1453929	1461711	I didn't get my hands on it, but I did get to sit through the presentation for Saints Row the Third, and that was pretty funny.
1462051	1475055	I've never liked open world games, and I don't like GTA or anything like that, so I just kind of went in with an open mind, and that game looks freaking hilarious, and they didn't censor the dildo bat thing that they hit people with.
1475295	1476215	That was really funny.
1476815	1479696	And they also said that you can make your character naked in play.
1479716	1480056	I was like,
1480862	1483124	I was just going to get an M rating at that point.
1484945	1487107	Unless they're like built like a Barbie doll.
1488188	1490369	Naked to them might mean like booty shorts.
1490449	1493612	You know, it might be like just nothing but, you know.
1494813	1498495	So my male character I'd make would have booty shorts.
1499396	1500097	I guess that's true.
1500217	1501718	I don't know if you just heard Dan, but L.A.
1501778	1503039	Noire, I don't know if you've played that.
1503139	1505581	That got an M rating and that's got full on beaver.
1505781	1506081	Totally.
1506341	1506742	Totally.
1507386	1511168	I don't know, I haven't, I've got it, I haven't finished it yet, or even come close.
1511448	1511969	Spoiler!
1512389	1536322	Well, I guess, yeah, I guess if it's not, like, in an actual fashion, it won't get anything bad, but, um, that was really funny, uh, I liked what I saw, they showed off some open world stuff, which was just humorous, and then, um, like, you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them out, and everybody loves you, because, uh, your game, the things are, like, like,
1536872	1542853	Celebrity, so no matter what you do, they like you, so you put them in a can and you shoot them out at things and they die.
1543379	1545421	People are all excited because they're meeting you.
1547122	1552786	This is going to be a totally obscure reference, but this reminds me of one of the movies that stars Divine.
1552846	1556429	If you know who Divine is, I think it's Female Trouble or something.
1556449	1561813	She's very filthy and over-the-top and stuff, and there's a scene where she's like, Who wants to die for art?
1561933	1563334	And everybody's like, Me, me, me.
1563374	1564555	And so she shoots one of them.
1564575	1567417	I don't know why, but what you're describing sounds to me like that.
1567517	1571200	But that's the over-the-top craziness is what they're going for in this game.
1571240	1572181	So they've succeeded?
1572201	1572281	Yeah.
1573413	1574413	Yeah, definitely.
1574614	1583858	And then they showed a mission, which they were robbing a bank, and it turned out to be some rival gang's bank or whatever, so fighting ensued.
1584458	1594382	And at one point during the gunfight, which was really gory, too, just some random person in a hoodie came up and asked for your autograph, and you get extra points if you sign it.
1595002	1596143	I was like, that's hilarious.
1597728	1598608	Awesome.
1598848	1603749	So is this, even though you don't play the GTA-style games, it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one?
1604810	1605730	Yeah, I might try this one.
1605850	1607270	This one looks really funny.
1607430	1617732	So, I mean, that's one thing about Grand Theft Auto is it takes itself pretty seriously, and I don't know, this just seems like, like, it kind of reminds me of, like, Smoke and Aces, that movie.
1618192	1618313	Mm-hmm.
1620193	1621373	Or was it Lucky Number 7?
1621433	1621873	I don't know.
1621913	1623694	No, no, Smoke and Aces, yeah, not Lucky Number 7.
1623814	1623974	Okay.
1626121	1628081	But that's really all I got to play today, I think.
1628361	1636523	Like, I'm racking my brain, but the Vita took up so much time that I don't think there was much else for today.
1637083	1641184	Alright, so anything you're going to try to look at tomorrow?
1641404	1644405	I mean, I know we're not doing a show tomorrow, but anything you might want to look at?
1645505	1653347	I was debating on doing the Wii U or not, and I think my final decision is I'm not going to go to it because I don't think it's worth the time.
1655620	1682226	so I think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like I'm going to go try to do Uncharted 3 because you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing Uncharted 3 I'm going to go back through the 3DS lines because you get pins when you play the games and I want more pins because of swag and Rhythm Heaven is there for the Wii and I haven't got to play it yet and I really want to do that because I like Rhythm Heaven so I might just hang out in the Wii and Sony tomorrow and just completely avoid the other hall because
1683007	1687768	I mean, most of the cool stuff is either behind closed doors or just in video form.
1688849	1698791	So you're kind of finding the usual E3 thing that seems to be more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind closed doors and there's very little out there on the floor for the rest of you?
1699992	1700832	Yeah, yeah.
1701052	1701512	That's too bad.
1701532	1707074	And I don't understand the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look like it really changed anything.
1707614	1710955	I felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean
1712068	1715590	more stuff on the floor, but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor.
1716171	1719913	2K and Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors.
1719973	1722274	I think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed doors.
1722734	1725676	EA has all their good stuff behind closed doors.
1727457	1731919	Wow, I guess they just don't want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now.
1731939	1740844	Well, Konami needs to take that advice and hide Silent Hill, the new one, because it's awful.
1741758	1748124	I tried it again today, that's right, and it was still bad, so that whole day did not make a difference Where is that?
1748164	1752749	I would have, or else, I haven't seen it I think it's at Microsoft's booth somewhere, unless it's buying closed doors like everything else, I don't know
1767781	1769802	Oh, that means I have to go to that hall again.
1770222	1770742	Ask Bobby.
1770762	1771303	He's in chat.
1771343	1772163	Oh, wait, you're not in chat.
1772203	1772883	I was going to say, ask Bobby.
1772903	1773644	Bobby's in the chat room.
1773684	1774564	He might be able to tell you.
1775585	1780687	Well, maybe you can relay the message to me right now since we're live and you can read the chat room.
1781087	1783548	You will just have to do some research.
1784328	1784628	All right.
1785349	1790931	All right, well, Miklatov, thank you very much for joining us the past couple days and giving us your thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor.
1791271	1792692	Anything else you want to get out before we let you go?
1794060	1797642	I ran into Akira Yamaoka twice today.
1798022	1799382	Why are you stalking him?
1799903	1802804	Yeah, this is another time that I did not text you about.
1803524	1805965	Because at that point, is it really worth it?
1806385	1808666	It's like a daily occurrence now.
1808786	1810627	Are you asking for his picture every time?
1810727	1814028	Are you making eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows?
1814048	1815269	Did you give him a hug?
1816787	1820151	I've already given him a side hug before.
1820431	1824015	No, no, full on, manly, pat on the back hug.
1824175	1824755	Go for it.
1825897	1826697	And close your eyes.
1826757	1827538	He loves that.
1828419	1830661	Miklatoff only does Christian side hugs.
1832684	1832904	What?
1832924	1833765	I missed that last part?
1834926	1835747	What did you say?
1835847	1837769	I said you only give Christian side hugs.
1839022	1840762	Yeah, okay, that's probably true.
1841443	1852665	I said, every time I've gone up to him, I keep realizing how bad his English is, and he had like a translator chick with him today, so it kind of helped, but yeah, it's kind of hard to talk to him.
1853705	1860887	And I don't think that me running up and trying to give him a hug would help, you know, break down that language barrier or anything.
1862487	1866048	Yamaoka-sama daisuki!
1866128	1866528	Fail.
1868311	1874133	Yeah, see, I was, you know, saying Daisuke really elongated because he would be running away.
1876194	1877335	Why you no hug?
1877355	1879856	I was thinking of the little meme thing.
1879896	1880816	So-and-so, why you know this?
1890785	1891065	All right.
1891566	1892486	We're going to let you go.
1893066	1895067	I've got to get Bobby on here, too.
1895588	1897648	Tiger Call said he'd be like security.
1898249	1898809	Exactly.
1899309	1906213	The last time I saw him was not even near the convention center, so he has no security to call.
1906673	1908794	If you are going to get thrown out of E3, though, do it on the last day.
1908814	1908914	Yes.
1908934	1909174	So what?
1909194	1909814	Try to make out with him?
1915979	1917099	Is that what you're telling me?
1917119	1918760	I'm supposedly going to an old Konami employee meetup.
1919220	1920720	And that's not really a party.
1920780	1923020	It's a complaint about our lives.
1923080	1923300	Oh, yeah.
1946105	1946845	Alright, goodbye
1972409	1981392	Yeah, I'm worried about this whole... You're lame and very... Oh, I meant... And I don't know if you missed it, but he called those buttons M&M minis.
1981872	1985813	And I'm like, that does not sound... I would not want to play a system with M&M minis for buttons.
1986013	1987534	I would like to eat some M&M minis.
1987754	1990875	I do have Fred Flintstone thumbs, and that's going to be a problem.
1991135	1991995	Dan's got bigger thumbs.
1992535	1993996	Dan's got big, wide thumbs.
1994356	1995516	One, two, three, four.
1995636	1996416	I declare a thumb war.
1996436	1997697	Dan's pretty vicious at thumb war.
2000956	2001196	All right.
2001436	2004739	Well, I think we're going to go ahead and give Bobby a call.
2004900	2005600	I think he's back.
2005620	2007282	Well, I know he's back because he's in the chat room.
2007983	2009444	And he should be standing by.
2009985	2011266	So I just got to punch in his digits.
2011526	2013068	I have to look up his digits so I can do that.
2013729	2014209	Live radio.
2014229	2014529	It's great.
2014549	2022157	If you want to join us in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com as we are broadcasting live on Ustream tonight.
2022538	2023338	Not our normal home.
2024059	2025400	But our special home just for the night.
2025460	2027301	This is our box out in front of the building.
2027321	2030343	There might also be some video things coming in the future.
2031104	2031624	I promise.
2031664	2033125	Keep the YouStream thing bookmarked.
2035046	2036167	And we're going to go to Bobby right now.
2038268	2039329	You know whenever he picks up the phone.
2040010	2040490	Hey, is it Bobby?
2040650	2041030	Hello.
2041290	2041971	Hey, how you doing?
2043172	2043872	I'm doing good.
2043892	2044953	You're better now.
2045153	2046594	You're better now that you're not in traffic.
2047816	2051620	I'm not near the Transformer that blew up or whatever Sweet Incidentally, you have to walk to Anaheim to meet us
2064264	2064424	Mm-hmm
2085084	2087825	I think we're just going to come down to LA live.
2088165	2088946	I'll text you tomorrow.
2089346	2090666	We can talk about that offline.
2090867	2091887	We will make it work.
2092967	2094028	LA will be our bitch.
2095909	2097409	Have you made LA your bitch, Bobby?
2097869	2098670	Fuck LA!
2101631	2102551	LA bows to me.
2103832	2106273	I heard you had a lot of Bethesda beer last night.
2108445	2110966	Yeah, I don't remember how much.
2111726	2112546	That's a good sign.
2112586	2114146	I fell off the ground at about five.
2114166	2115367	I saw there were Heinekens.
2117127	2118907	No, there were Newcastles.
2118987	2119928	That's what I meant, Newcastles.
2119948	2120728	Why did I say Heineken?
2120748	2121368	Oh, yeah.
2121588	2122948	Newcastle's the best ever.
2124048	2125909	How was the Bethesda party?
2126049	2126789	Did you ride the bull?
2128209	2129549	No, I didn't ride the bull.
2130290	2132010	I mainly felt like it was so packed.
2132698	2134819	Everybody was there, but it was so packed.
2134919	2140020	I tried to go out and mingle, and it was just like, I'm going back to my table with Electric Sisterhood, and I'm just going to sit here.
2140660	2146522	When they did karaoke, we changed the lyrics to every single song to Friday, except for the Journey song.
2146582	2148462	That was the only one we didn't turn into Friday.
2148502	2156224	But everything else somehow became talking about Friday and front seats and back seats, and which one do I take?
2156364	2159225	Because that's what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer.
2160475	2160896	That's right.
2161176	2161817	Beer Thesda.
2162057	2163298	And we looked.
2163399	2165401	It was not a karaoke song or I would have sung it.
2166963	2168705	Did Ninja Assistant get on the bull?
2170087	2170367	No.
2170707	2171108	No, no.
2171568	2173210	One of the people from their crew did.
2173691	2174712	And he sang as well.
2175133	2175493	Ah, okay.
2175513	2175673	But...
2176841	2178082	Neither of the Fistas did
2207146	2210669	Um, it crashed on us, which was great.
2211290	2211850	Um, it crashed.
2211870	2214953	They're like, hmm, we need to do, we need to switch something out.
2214973	2222619	And so, like, the Skyrim logo came up and he, like, did some stuff and flashed some things and then, you know, okay, now we're continuing again.
2222959	2225841	Out of curiosity, did they tell you to shut off your video cameras?
2225961	2228123	Did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo?
2229364	2230185	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2230265	2231646	No photos, no video cameras.
2232186	2236350	Um, that one you could record audio, like I could have recorded it in
2237353	2241615	No video cameras or anything in Bethesda's anything
2263004	2268187	I was going to say, though, you remember when we got into Bethesda, when we got the appointment with Bethesda the first year?
2268928	2271309	And they just like, go ahead and film Star Trek.
2271450	2271970	That's cool.
2271990	2274652	I think Star Trek was coming out soon.
2274732	2276353	I was filming Call of Cthulhu, too.
2276573	2276813	All right.
2276993	2279255	They're just like, please, please, film anything.
2279275	2280315	Just get it out there.
2280335	2280615	All right.
2280916	2285319	No, now with the rise of camera phones, yeah, leaks are, you know, they're instant.
2285359	2286900	You know, you're, oh, record it.
2287020	2287860	Oh, it's on YouTube.
2287960	2289561	And they just don't want to take that chance.
2289581	2290042	I understand.
2290142	2290582	I understand.
2290882	2291923	Sorry for the tangent, Bobby.
2292063	2293004	And they were watching.
2293144	2296747	They were watching for people if they happened to be holding up a phone or something.
2296827	2299910	And they had bats.
2301391	2302593	Now, here was one thing.
2302793	2312962	I heard a lot of people bitch about another RPG that came out a couple years ago that I played the sequel to today, Final Fantasy XIII.
2313985	2316146	and why am I bringing that up in reference to Skyrim?
2316426	2321589	Because that whole Chrysanthemum, whatever it's called, that's your skill system in Skyrim.
2322809	2323690	Interesting.
2324850	2325151	Huh.
2326591	2339197	The way that you, basically you unlock these constellations in the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where as you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and stuff like that.
2340058	2340358	That's
2340734	2343516	I mean, it's like, I looked at it and I'm like, that's Final Fantasy XIII right there.
2343916	2349561	And it's like, people hated it in Final Fantasy XIII, but they're probably going to love it in Skyrim.
2351422	2354044	That's right.
2354064	2358127	Yeah, see, I got it, because I didn't bring this up last night.
2358167	2359288	The public is an idiot.
2359736	2360116	I think.
2361237	2366859	Because I have heard so much snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community about everything.
2369180	2380885	Sitting in the chat room during the press conferences, you'd think that Microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage and gave you Smell-O-Vision so you could smell it at home because they just hated everything.
2380905	2383646	They're like, why do all this stuff have Kinect?
2384073	2385293	Oh, Modern Warfare 3.
2385333	2386554	I don't want to see Modern Warfare 3.
2386974	2388575	Oh, it's another Halo.
2389035	2389935	Oh, wah, wah.
2390175	2393436	And, you know, and then like Nintendo's like, hey, this is like something you've never seen before.
2393996	2394737	I don't want that.
2395457	2396617	I don't want another Mario.
2397237	2397898	Y'all suck.
2398118	2405320	You know, and it's like, I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are like, dude, if you don't, you know, gaming may have moved on past you.
2405940	2410942	And you may need to just stop gaming if there's nothing that has been shown that you like.
2411502	2413663	You're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer, I think.
2414498	2415623	and I've been seeing that a lot.
2415703	2419641	It's not here at the show floor, like there's not that much hate here, it's all the people at home.
2420720	2424362	I like that in the absence of Loki tonight, we get Bobby doing the ranting.
2424382	2425463	That is not what I expected.
2425503	2427845	I thought it would be Dan, but we get Bobby doing the ranting.
2427885	2431207	But Bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral.
2432187	2435790	I'm trying to let Bobby rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out.
2436390	2438552	I think he's right on.
2438712	2439192	Oh, exactly.
2439212	2441393	All I can say is agree, like times 10.
2441954	2442894	Likes this post.
2442914	2444015	Yeah, exactly.
2444315	2444655	Like.
2445576	2446457	People are idiots.
2446917	2448298	They just can't handle it.
2449826	2453670	Reggie hit it on the head, you know, and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it.
2453710	2458253	He's like, look, you guys want things that are different, but you want something that you're comfortable with.
2458593	2459834	Fine, we'll fucking do that.
2459854	2460755	We're Nintendo.
2461196	2462076	It's what we do.
2462817	2463758	Sony's just like...
2464338	2468481	Whatever, here's a better PSP in Uncharted Microsoft's like, connect!
2468541	2471863	And everybody's just like, oh my god Why can't there be something mind-blowing?
2471943	2493018	It's because the people are spoiled They got used to these blockbuster E3 announcements every year And now the blockbusters aren't good enough Because the gaming companies got practically nothing left Or they're just not willing to show it off yet Do you think the Microsoft thing might have come off a lot different If it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime?
2493439	2493719	Yes
2495114	2499556	Halo 4 would have been much, much more important had everybody not known what was going on.
2499576	2503557	I think gamer underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been spoiled.
2503577	2505258	Honestly, they should have led with Halo 4.
2506399	2506799	You think?
2507259	2507779	Exactly.
2509240	2509460	All right.
2509520	2511341	Anyway, I don't want to recap the press conferences.
2511421	2512281	I got to move forward here.
2512341	2519364	But Bobby Skyrim, was it as beautiful as it seems to look when I'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online?
2521033	2523494	Yes, and now they probably souped it up a little bit.
2523534	2527655	It was running on a big movie screen, but it looked and sounded beautiful.
2529356	2534118	You know, and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff like that.
2534318	2535078	Does it look like... Go ahead.
2535138	2535498	Yeah?
2535538	2535778	Go ahead.
2537359	2538259	Go ahead, Matt.
2538279	2543061	I was going to say, does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into Skyrim as you did with Oblivion?
2543081	2547223	Because Oblivion, you could easily sink triple-digit hours into that game.
2547263	2547983	It was disgusting.
2549673	2560777	Yes, absolutely, because they even showed, like, they walked us through a town, and like, here's all the stuff that you can do in the town, and you could just go over here and chop wood, you can do jobs like at Fable, and you know, all that stuff.
2560837	2566980	So there's, you know, lots of other side quests, other than the main story that they're packing in here.
2567680	2571161	And, you know, the dragons are awesome.
2572122	2575283	Just, you know, watching, you know, how they fly around, and it's quick, and
2576299	2581421	All the stuff they're doing, and it's not like a patterned boss fight is what they said.
2581782	2584803	They said they've got AI, so no two dragon fights will be the same.
2585723	2590445	And even our guy got hit around a couple times you probably didn't expect.
2592846	2595387	They showed a couple different, like two dragon fights.
2595627	2601510	They showed a dragon fight where we ran away from, and then we met up with that dragon again, and then a bigger dragon showed up.
2602729	2605911	and it was just, you know, here, let me show you how you can do these spells.
2606531	2617736	And, you know, I can do this and I can shout this at him and I'll use this fireball on him and, you know, injure him so he hits the ground and, you know, runs up to a castle to see if other people will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people.
2618516	2618996	It was awesome.
2619777	2622138	Do you think it'll make the release date of 11-11-11?
2624239	2625319	I believe they will.
2626480	2627380	It was, I mean, it was
2627951	2636357	They showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and I think that they're in the polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing.
2638698	2639399	I think they will.
2639459	2640559	I think they'll make that.
2641720	2643281	I think people will be pleased with it.
2643801	2649485	Bethesda obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and games that crash and stuff.
2650085	2652047	I would not be surprised if that's the case here.
2653167	2653788	But, you know,
2654560	2662082	They've done that and all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things more exciting and seamless and stuff.
2663203	2664563	They've simplified the combat.
2664583	2666864	The right trigger's your right hand and your left trigger's your left hand.
2666904	2668965	Whatever's in it, that's what goes.
2668985	2672346	There's your shield and your sword and stuff like that.
2672766	2674467	Do the monsters still level up with you?
2677233	2678274	They did not talk about that.
2678514	2679075	Interesting.
2679435	2683538	But I would assume that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that.
2687061	2687461	All right.
2688062	2691645	Well, so was that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else?
2692946	2697129	I went to see their Prey 2 demonstration.
2697470	2697790	Okay.
2699091	2703575	And, you know, where it's alien noir is what they were calling it and stuff.
2703655	2705136	And, you know, running around...
2706624	2722144	and basically in this game you play as a US Marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so you start off there and then you actually fast forward six months later to when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs.
2722406	2723267	Yeah.
2723347	2723507	Yeah.
2746058	2753120	Yeah, so basically, and you do meet up with the character, they did say, spoiler alert, you do meet up with the character from Prey 1, eventually.
2753520	2754420	Interesting, okay.
2754901	2760562	But basically, you are a mercenary for hire, because you used to be a U.S.
2760602	2764503	Marshal, so that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in Prey 1.
2765663	2771225	So he basically took those skills, and now he's a mercenary, a human mercenary, on the homeworld of the aliens.
2772226	2774068	and he's actually taking jobs for the aliens.
2774108	2784616	He can go through and help people or hurt people and he can corral people in and thugs will attack you as you go through this big open world thing on their alien planet.
2785877	2789640	So that was kind of interesting and I watched that until that crashed.
2790200	2791622	Uh oh.
2793283	2800949	Because he was like, I need to go up to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going through the wall and then it just freezes.
2801914	2804696	So it sounds like... Go ahead.
2806237	2809779	And so that was like, and I'm like, you know, I've seen this.
2809859	2810320	It's cool.
2811060	2811521	I'm sold.
2812261	2813782	I'm going to go check out something else.
2814102	2820106	Because, you know, that was 15 minutes into the demo, and I didn't know how long it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot.
2821007	2822528	So that's all I saw.
2822568	2828452	And then since I don't like shooters, I still went over to Rage and The Racing.
2829671	2856908	so I could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and I did the little three lap race and stuff but it's those enemies are a little cheap because it's I couldn't figure out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so anytime I would get into third out of four anytime I got into third place I would immediately like blow up and there's nothing I could do about it they're like incoming I'm like okay what do I do okay I'll go around this corner oh it's a homing missile damn I'm blown up again
2858439	2860200	At least you gave it the good old college try.
2861420	2861780	I did.
2864301	2865742	That's what I did in the Bethesda booth.
2867743	2873845	I'm trying to think of what else I looked at and played today.
2873905	2876246	I went in and my other appointment was with CCP Games.
2877767	2885290	It was a PowerPoint presentation with some videos embedded in about how they're going to be working Dust 5.4 into EVE Online and
2885740	2915338	essentially they were talking about their vision and the technology and it's really neat and I've learned the reason they're PS3 exclusive is because Sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't do on PSN and Microsoft wouldn't do that Dust 514 is a multiplayer only first person shooter and it is running on the exact same servers of EVE Online as in you're going to be in the same corporation
2916033	2917254	as EVE Online players.
2917994	2922376	You can transfer money and items between EVE Online and Dust 514.
2922436	2926959	Basically, Dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet, and EVE Online is the only way you can be in space.
2927979	2928340	Wow.
2928700	2935863	And so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension of the wars in Dust 514.
2937364	2938985	And they will be fighting on the planet.
2939625	2944368	And yes, because you see this in the trailer, and they're like, yes, this is exactly how it works.
2944932	2953515	The people playing Dust 514 can call up to the people playing EVE Online in orbit around the planet and say, I need an orbital strike, I need a laser strike.
2954015	2960517	And the people playing EVE can then call down this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something.
2961651	2963293	Dust514 is tailored for first person shooter fans who
2983015	2983175	Wow.
3007516	3009957	and also Dust514.
3010137	3014018	It's going to be a PSN title, downloadable, $20 or $30.
3014078	3016819	They didn't really say the price, but somewhere around there.
3017419	3020000	So it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play.
3020040	3020980	There's no monthly fee.
3022181	3026642	And that money, they call it a cover charge, is what they call buying the title.
3027202	3031103	And that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency.
3031564	3036205	So you start off with money already in your account, which is
3036638	3039960	basically the market value of what you just paid for that cover charge.
3040340	3042101	Isn't that kind of how EVE Online works too?
3043002	3050726	I think you can buy, like they support real money trade because they endorse it, or they monitor it, they provide it.
3052367	3064434	Yeah, well, there's a monthly subscription for EVE Online, but if you're good enough, you can actually buy, they're called PLECs, Pilot License Extension Cards, in the game that give you 30 more days.
3064896	3066577	Oh, right, okay, okay.
3067337	3075641	And you can, you know, trade them in-game and stuff, like people, and that's how, you know, some corporations will actually pay people to play the game for them by giving them Plex.
3075981	3076241	Wow.
3076902	3090868	And you can do that, so, you know, yeah, so it's an amazing economy, and they were even talking about, you know, some of the wars and stuff that have gone on, and they even, like, actually referenced one of these player corporations in their trailer video, where it was...
3091897	3121228	I can't remember, it might have been like the Netherlands or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a Russian corporation in this one sector of space and you know the Russians were outpowering them and outmaneuvering them and stuff but the Dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations, CCP had nothing to do with this espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the Americans were funding the Dutch because they didn't want to fight the Russians directly
3122883	3127587	So they cut off the trade route, wiped out that Dust Corporation, and that was the end of it.
3128047	3138835	So it's stuff like that, because they say games like World of Warcraft and EverQuest, those are theme parks, where there are quests given to you, and it's the same thing every time and stuff like that.
3139356	3140637	EVE Online, it's the sandbox.
3141618	3146601	They give you the stand, the bucket, the area, and you make the story.
3147122	3151285	And that's what they're saying that Dust 5.4 is going to do, it's the same type of thing.
3151915	3180256	and the reason it's geographically like that is because of time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that that's going to be the same way and they did say that for latency if you're worried about lag since it's a first person shooter EVE Online can handle latency the first person shooters they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll be connecting to that instead because their main EVE Online server cluster is in London
3181199	3184881	So currently when you play EVE Online, their supercomputer is in London.
3185421	3188183	And it's like, they said it weighs more than a ton.
3189363	3206492	They said how many machines it was, but they didn't, I can't remember the number, but they're going to have battle servers in geographic locations so you have a low ping when you're playing Dust 514 because most console games are peer-to-peer where one of the other
3207461	3208922	and PS3s is the server.
3209343	3214287	In this, the server is EVE Online and Sony was the only one that allowed them to do that.
3214787	3215247	Interesting.
3215307	3224515	And they also said that, because I asked, you know, you're infuriating a lot of PC players and stuff and they're like, EVE Online's been around for over eight years.
3226076	3227477	You can read between the lines on that.
3228956	3229216	KaiJudo asks,
3251569	3279547	when can I get my hands on some dust they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in the sense of it's going to go to the high end EVE online players and you know handpicked people but sometime next year but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside EVE for the last three years with their expansions like you know planetary building planetary formations and stuff like you could build refineries on planets that started two years ago that was in preparation for dust and that
3280109	3280489	and so on.
3310414	3318978	Dave just said, we're talking about our philosophy in creating games, and here's what we're trying to do, and here's what we've already done, and we're awesome.
3319258	3323999	And that's okay, because you've got so much information about it that you're still a little hyped for the game.
3324040	3328421	I mean, at the end of the day, it'll really be about, well, how does it pull off?
3328461	3333543	Because although it sounds awesome in theory, like, what if this breaks EVE Online?
3333583	3333803	But these...
3335864	3338106	Again, like you said, EVE Online's been around for eight years.
3339186	3345130	It may not be a quote-unquote competitor to WoW, but it's always been a great alternative to WoW.
3345670	3351053	I think of a game like Star Trek Online, which I played just a little bit during the beta, but Jamie, you were really into.
3351374	3357097	And the thing with Star Trek Online for me is that I loved the away team stuff, but I did not like the space combat at all.
3357417	3359579	But what if that was two separate games?
3360199	3362380	I could just play a game that's nothing but away team stuff.
3362400	3363261	I would have been all over that.
3363962	3367803	See, it actually kind of got turned around for me that I liked the space stuff.
3367843	3371763	See, you could play Eve, I could play Dust, and we could still kind of be in that same universe.
3371783	3372303	But that's cool.
3372523	3382045	That's always something I kind of wanted, you know, that you had your, I mean, yeah, it's a little different with Star Trek, but I think that I get the thing.
3382105	3383145	It would be really cool.
3385086	3385286	Wow.
3385606	3386546	So, interesting.
3386846	3387346	Fascinating.
3388206	3390127	You don't get off the ship, you're stuck there.
3390147	3392047	That was like the most fascinating part of my day.
3392387	3392547	Wow.
3393405	3399710	Alright, well, I don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit.
3401051	3402031	Okay, well, no, I can.
3402091	3408096	And actually, I got an interview with this guy because, you know, I was kind of walking around and I passed by Nyko's booth.
3408856	3411959	You know, they make all those, you know, the extra peripherals or whatever.
3412359	3415421	And I'm like, usually I'm like, eh, it's Nyko.
3415441	3417102	This time I actually stopped and looked.
3418924	3419064	And...
3420183	3426910	What they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people, motion gaming.
3427911	3428832	It's called the Zoom.
3429853	3444467	And what this does, it's for the Kinect, and it basically, because Kinect fires out all these infrared lasers, and that's how it determines the positioning, it actually modifies where the lasers go, and it gives it a wide-angle lens, so now you don't have to stand as far away from your TV.
3445805	3446386	Nice.
3446806	3454312	So it basically... Instead of being six to eight feet away, you can now be four to six feet away.
3455133	3456594	And in true Nyko fashion, it'll kind of work.
3456614	3464320	Two players of Connect Adventures can be, you know, stand kind of where one player would stand before.
3466082	3468944	And it worked pretty well from what I was seeing on there.
3468984	3473668	So I have an interview with a guy talking about that and, you know, how much it's going to cost.
3474318	3475979	which is not that expensive.
3476039	3478521	It's only $30 and it's coming out in August.
3479021	3485845	That could be great for those of us that live in apartments and things where we're a little more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do.
3486285	3486946	That sounds great.
3486966	3489567	Or not want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play Kinect.
3489607	3493129	I think that sounds like it could be an awesome peripheral if it works.
3493290	3499173	But it seems like if you were watching people play it at E3 that were normal people playing it, right?
3499253	3500574	Not all their people?
3501815	3504237	Right, I could have walked up and played it.
3505498	3505718	Nice.
3505978	3507359	You just didn't want anyone to get that on video.
3509380	3511502	Yeah.
3512602	3517326	But let's see, what else did I... I did play Final Fantasy XIII too.
3517986	3518466	How was that?
3520128	3521689	I don't know if Shane talked about that or not.
3522469	3528313	It is Final Fantasy XIII plus Shenmue.
3529434	3530935	With the quick time events and stuff.
3532499	3541086	and it built some other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open-ended and stuff.
3541107	3549694	Because Final Fantasy XIII, it gave you that sense of urgency of the linearity of it and then when you weren't as urgent, then you could roam around.
3549754	3553438	Well, that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in XIII too.
3553718	3553918	Go ahead.
3553938	3554058	Yeah.
3556738	3559459	Yep, and one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my party.
3559500	3560880	So I had a monster in my party.
3561060	3562281	I had my two humans and then like
3586638	3588199	This monster suddenly was in my party.
3588239	3588779	I don't know why.
3588799	3592082	I couldn't hear anything, so I didn't know if it was to explain in dialogue.
3592682	3597085	But depending on what paradigm you were in, that monster changed.
3597105	3602569	He was a little fire plant in commando mode, but when you turn him to Ravager, he turned into this big Cerberus thing.
3603669	3606091	So that was kind of cool.
3606511	3614797	And they introduced this, and I didn't really understand it all that much, once again, because I was on the show floor, but you've got a little Mog with you.
3615840	3626446	and when enemies appear a little countdown timer appears and however quick you hit the enemies that determines if you get the first hit or if they hit you first or whatever.
3627386	3639012	So that was kind of interesting and they did some of these cinematic events and live events and stuff while you're just walking around and you can still walk around and the camera will change to show something happening.
3640333	3642274	So it was kind of cool.
3642734	3643454	I'm sold on it.
3645814	3648235	But you also like XIII, right?
3649035	3649215	What?
3649436	3651196	You also like XIII.
3651797	3652957	You also like XIII, though, right?
3652977	3653777	And a lot of people didn't.
3655178	3656418	Yes, I like XIII.
3657619	3662981	So, you know, keep that in mind when I say that, that I, you know, since I like XIII, you know, I like XIII, too.
3663001	3664062	I like what they added to it.
3664522	3670244	But it is, you know, the core gameplay of the paradigm shifting and all that stuff, that's still there, XIII.
3670284	3671905	It didn't change, at least not what I saw.
3673259	3677202	Do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit?
3679444	3679724	Oh, no.
3679764	3680384	Haters are going to hate.
3681485	3682305	All right.
3682786	3683486	Sounds familiar.
3683726	3685608	GamersHateEverything.com, right?
3685868	3686348	That's right.
3686568	3686788	All right.
3687549	3689450	Exactly.
3690551	3691131	So let's see.
3691171	3694594	I'm trying to think of what else I kind of walked by and got to see.
3695875	3698236	I was running around and stuff.
3699137	3700898	I did go into Atlas's booth a little bit.
3701727	3705028	in their little meeting room area that was open so I could get into it.
3706008	3716852	And they were showing Rock of Ages, which is the only one that they... Rock of Ages, and they were showing Catherine, and they were talking about other things, but those were kind of the only ones they were showing.
3717532	3728196	And I played Rock of Ages, and it's kind of hard... The thing about E3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times they dump you in the middle of things, and there's not always a tutorial.
3728755	3732777	and there's not always a guy standing there telling you, okay, here's what's going on.
3733437	3734797	So I had no clue what I was doing.
3734857	3745822	It's like a tower defense game and then it's Katamari Damacy but not really because it's not tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was kind of interesting.
3745842	3752565	I'm sure that I'd like it more if I played it, you know, knowing what I was doing but that one was kind of cool.
3752605	3756966	I didn't, you know, there was too many people for Catherine and the place was getting cramped so I didn't get to go in there.
3758187	3758267	Um,
3760003	3763446	So, trying to think of what else.
3765488	3768010	Do you remember seeing anything on my Twitter that I'm missing?
3769271	3772253	No, I mostly wanted to hear about Skyrim, though.
3772314	3774295	But you were getting some feedback on Twitter today.
3774435	3778058	Any good questions you were able to get answered for people on Twitter?
3778359	3780060	At Twitter.com slash BobbyBlackWolf?
3781782	3782162	I did.
3782222	3785705	I started answering questions, and then Loki actually answered them better than I did.
3786784	3792247	because they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like, oh no, that's coming out on February 12th.
3792427	3801831	One thing, I didn't get to play this yet, but a good colleague of mine, Shadow Next Gen, he's actually sitting right across from me right now.
3802051	3802752	Howdy.
3803732	3807654	He was able to get in to see the demo of Fable the Journey.
3808654	3808834	Oh, okay.
3808854	3811135	And we learned something that not many people are talking about.
3811256	3811696	What's that?
3812976	3814157	The game is not on rails.
3815605	3817326	Oh, it sure looked like it was on rails.
3817426	3818246	Okay, okay.
3818406	3827969	It sure looked like it, but according to Mr. Molyneux, who apparently gave that particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do, he said it's not on rails.
3828649	3831550	And you know you can believe everything that Molyneux says.
3832290	3833730	It's always dead on accurate.
3834151	3835271	Not overhyped at all.
3837606	3838126	Yeah Yeah
3867648	3872732	Now, the game I did play today, and this is the reason I forgot about this because it was the first one I did this morning.
3873532	3874953	I went to Disneyland already.
3875333	3877255	I've already been to Disneyland.
3877355	3879236	You went to play Disneyland Adventures, huh?
3880617	3880957	I did.
3881017	3882999	I played Connected Adventures with Disney characters.
3883679	3894707	And that one, the way that you move in that, and it's kind of interesting and funny, like in the overworld, the Disneyland area, they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tables, like the little yellow circles around things.
3895390	3895470	Yes.
3895490	3895690	It's that.
3895710	3896952	It's that with Alice in Wonderland characters.
3921881	3927125	Um, so, it basically, you know, when you guys are saying it's connected ventures with Disney, that's pretty much what it is.
3927645	3935950	Also, I guess to me, like, I didn't get to do the Peter Pan one, but it's been a while since I've been there, but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride.
3935990	3942755	At least I hope the Alice in Wonderland ride is not you in a golf ball with Alice hitting you
3943473	3948318	and sending you down and all these cards are trying to get in your way and you have to jump over them.
3949079	3950620	I can guarantee you the ride is not like that.
3950640	3951981	Bobby, you will not have to worry.
3952021	3960870	If we do end up going on that ride on Friday, we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full experience because we are going for research purposes.
3961250	3962732	That's only on It's a Small World.
3962772	3964534	At least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it.
3965205	3968307	When a small world breaks down, the puppets start pelting things at you.
3968347	3971429	Oh, I've been in there during Christmas.
3972330	3976392	All those people are actually people who were trapped inside of the ride when it broke down.
3977093	3978814	And they were turned into little mannequins.
3979094	3981015	And then you sing forever.
3982757	3987880	So was it enough to make you go, gosh, I might actually kind of want to get this game?
3987920	3990682	Or were you like, nah, this is just the same crap with a new label?
3992576	3995538	I said, gosh, I might want to put this game on my Gamefly queue.
3996699	3998480	Okay, kind of in the middle, alright.
3999701	4002062	Get it from Gamefly, get my achievements, then get out, right?
4002082	4002162	Yeah.
4004024	4004464	Fair enough.
4005024	4006465	Yeah.
4006505	4006625	Nice.
4007606	4013630	So, other than that, I'm really, I mean, I talked to the PlayStation Home developers a little bit.
4014290	4014410	Oh?
4015030	4017232	And I'm probably going to be doing an interview with them, because Blender...
4018585	4038462	asked me about, you know, because they're in this big freezing bug, and they, you know, I was talking to some people that actually work on, I think, content creation and stuff, but they were like, yeah, we addressed that finally, like, you know, yesterday, and, you know, blah, blah, blah, and they have, like, things that they want people to do if they encounter, like, we want this far and wide, and I'm like, so are you willing to go on the air about that?
4038522	4043907	And they're like, ooh, I'd love to, but I've got to talk to PR, so I may have this huge PS Home interview
4044741	4045101	Tomorrow.
4045161	4047063	I'm soliciting questions on Twitter tonight.
4047144	4048685	Some people have sent me some real good ones.
4049426	4049746	Wow.
4049806	4051969	But I may be able to record an interview there.
4052429	4054732	I bet there's a lot of questions people have about PlayStation Home.
4054792	4055993	Like, when's it getting out of beta?
4059196	4060157	Is it a Google product?
4062219	4062620	Yeah.
4063260	4064902	So, I think it's out of beta.
4065082	4066404	Didn't they take the word beta out of home?
4067368	4072872	No, when I launched it earlier today, or last night, you know how I went into PlayStation Home and it was completely on accident?
4072952	4081817	I meant to go in the store, and I accidentally, because my thumbs are fat like Fred Flintstone, I went up and I went into PlayStation Home instead.
4082178	4085400	And I was like, well, shit, now that I launched this, I might as well just kind of look around.
4085740	4087881	I clearly noticed the beta tag still on it.
4088161	4091323	And I was like, hasn't this been around for like two years now?
4091343	4093345	At least.
4093405	4093845	At least.
4096357	4112585	And then I did kind of walk through the IndieCade booth, which is all the independent games, where they had NerdTwister as an actual twister with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot, on what color.
4113906	4118188	But the way that they did it, I think they called it Twister Annapolis 5000.
4118268	4118668	It's a race.
4122034	4148432	everybody starts at the end and I posted a picture of this on Twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody starts at one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first without losing one of their you know without raising one of your other hands they're declared the winner so that that was
4149432	4151373	Now, that was not the craziest thing that I saw in the indicator.
4177364	4178145	Oh dear, okay.
4178425	4185629	And I wanted to get a picture of this, but by the time I thought about getting the picture of it, they were not playing it anymore.
4186550	4188131	It is called a kiss controller.
4189311	4189692	A what?
4190352	4192533	Where a kiss controller.
4192593	4192953	Okay.
4194154	4196596	As in... I thought he said a tits controller.
4196616	4203360	You kiss this little device, you kiss this little device, and that actually like, they were showing like it does a bowling game.
4204320	4206782	And the better kissers you are, the better...
4210267	4215749	I didn't want to approach it because I didn't want you to do it myself.
4215809	4217669	I wanted to get a picture of somebody else doing it.
4219450	4220570	Interesting.
4221531	4223531	Wow, they were putting those booth babes to work, weren't they?
4226612	4230814	I was like, and there was this other game that had like a gas mask, and I didn't know what that was.
4230834	4231854	I don't know what that was.
4232174	4234695	But the guy was wearing like a full-on gas mask and playing, you know,
4235256	4235576	and DarkSakura.
4267213	4294496	well now Bobby I know you've got one more day left at E3 and I know as part of your day tomorrow you're going to continue your Twitter adventures where you let the listeners of your show and the OLR listeners who jump in there and want to follow you and direct you around too look at whatever but what else haven't you seen yet that you're like I've got to get this tomorrow before this stuff's done okay well I want to see what everybody's talking about with Saints Row the 3rd
4296161	4324507	I want to see Child of Eden if I can find it you just need to talk to Miklatov because that's exactly what he talked to us about today were those two games yeah so I this is not for the show for this show but no I mean I want to see both of those because also like even like Loki was twittering me have you seen go see Saints Row go see Saints Row and I'm like okay I will I promise I just wasn't in that hall I've been in the for two days now I've pretty much been in the hall that like Sony and Nintendo was in so I think I'm done there
4325191	4330853	and I'm going to go try to spend as much as I can in the main hall.
4331273	4338015	I'm considering trying to get in the line for the Vita, but if it's really longer than the Wii U line, I think I'm going to skip on that.
4338255	4342836	Yeah, Miklatov waited four hours today, so take it or leave it, I guess.
4342856	4343936	But he said it was worth it.
4345577	4351699	But of course, then he continued to say, I'm not waiting in that Wii U line, so... I don't know.
4351799	4351879	Yeah.
4351919	4352379	Yeah, so...
4353911	4354331	I don't know.
4354511	4355571	I may or may not do that.
4355631	4356372	I don't think so.
4356612	4358272	I really need to catch up on some stuff.
4358332	4373135	I want to see if I can get into the Fable Room to see that and really just kind of go around and see the stuff that's in that hall because that's where they've got a video game museum has a booth here.
4373175	4382977	I want to kind of stop by and see that and see if there's other Tensha Hall type companies in that area that I haven't gone in and seen
4384075	4385396	I haven't seen Dead Island yet.
4386437	4389900	I saw where it was in Square Enix's booth, but I haven't actually seen it yet.
4390860	4399807	If you're going to go see Dead Island, you've got to run up to Aubrey and talk to her like she sends out her emails to everybody.
4400167	4400848	OMG!
4402229	4404010	She is not on the floor.
4404070	4408253	She's up in the meeting room suites, and I was unsuccessful in getting an appointment up there.
4408794	4409294	Ah, bummer.
4410600	4411441	I've even tweeted her.
4411501	4414604	I'm like, look, I just want to say hi.
4414925	4415746	How does this happen?
4415806	4419409	I don't have an appointment, but I'd like to make an appointment to say hi for 30 seconds.
4419430	4420110	How does this happen?
4420310	4421111	And I got no response.
4421231	4423414	She's probably like, ew, a creepy stalker, ew.
4425236	4425816	I'm just kidding.
4425836	4427158	She's a creepy stalker.
4429797	4430157	All right.
4432499	4444206	Well, Bobby, I know some of the stuff you're going to see tomorrow at the show you will give more impressions on on your own show, which, of course, Sunday night at All Games Radio or more information available at BobbyBlackwolf.com, right?
4445367	4445907	That's right.
4446367	4446648	All right.
4446808	4447048	8 p.m.
4447108	4447788	Eastern, 5 p.m.
4447808	4448249	Pacific.
4448269	4449369	I'll talk about that stuff.
4449449	4454573	And like I said, I'll actually talk about the Wii U games because we didn't really talk about the games.
4454593	4456133	We just talked about the controller itself.
4456414	4456594	Right.
4456634	4458435	I'll talk about some of the conceptual demos.
4460188	4461969	and more of that stuff.
4462769	4468190	Hey, we might have a very famous person's bumper premiere this Sunday.
4468250	4469530	Ooh, exciting.
4470190	4471471	That'll be very, very cool.
4473871	4476692	Unfortunately, we won't be here to hear it because we'll be on our way back from L.A.
4476752	4478772	So, Bobby, if you want, you can go along.
4481033	4481453	I could.
4482731	4483572	You'll hear it tomorrow.
4483592	4484612	You'll hear the bumper tomorrow.
4484813	4485313	Oh, okay, okay.
4485473	4485633	Good.
4485653	4485973	I'm excited.
4486153	4487154	Ooh, I get a sneak peek.
4487474	4487974	All right, awesome.
4487994	4488415	Yay, us.
4488455	4488935	That's right.
4489155	4489555	Awesome.
4489575	4490696	Exciting early preview.
4490716	4493237	But Bobby's going to make me sign an NDA, so sorry, guys.
4493277	4494178	I won't be able to tell you what it is.
4494198	4494978	You'll have to tune in Sunday.
4496319	4497800	NDA or I get thrown off the Matterhorn.
4498240	4498520	All right.
4499581	4505324	Well, Bobby, thank you so much, not only for contributing to our show, but making it your show as well.
4505384	4506485	We really appreciate that.
4507525	4519115	You've supported us forever, and we appreciate you sharing your E3 with us and being so dedicated and missing Bethesda beer for a little bit last night to talk to us and whatever you might be doing tonight.
4519476	4520757	So I really appreciate it.
4520777	4521157	We all do.
4522458	4525020	And one last kind of off-topic thing.
4525100	4530405	As we were leaving E3, I'm walking along, and there's a guy walking toward me.
4531546	4532807	I recognize him somewhat.
4533462	4538003	He's not looking up, so he almost runs into me because I start trying to get his attention by getting in his face.
4539023	4543124	And DJ Tyrant almost ran right through me.
4544704	4546324	I didn't think he was going to the show floor today.
4546344	4547044	I wonder what he did.
4547104	4547624	All right, well.
4548045	4549385	No, no, no.
4549425	4557206	He's going to a party tonight, and since his girlfriend has never been to E3, he basically took her over there just so they could see what was in the lobby and stuff.
4557226	4557846	Oh, I got you.
4563109	4567016	but they're going to some party, one of the E3 parties we got an invite to tonight.
4567457	4567797	Cool.
4567817	4568779	So that's why they were there.
4568979	4575070	He was going as the place was closing and we were leaving and I recognized him so I got him, you know, and so he almost pulled me over.
4575424	4576104	How funny.
4576284	4577625	It's a small world.
4577705	4579386	I met up with DJ Tyrant today.
4579606	4579906	Nice.
4580227	4580487	Nice.
4580587	4580947	All right.
4581307	4583068	Well, we'll be meeting up with you tomorrow, Bobby.
4583208	4591333	Of course, sadly, those antics are not going to be broadcast, but we're looking forward to the post E3 party in the Magic Kingdom at Electronica Friday night.
4592333	4595435	We hopefully will get maybe a little bit of video at Flynn's.
4595595	4595895	I don't know.
4595915	4600417	If DarkSakura wears something pretty and she's willing to be on camera, maybe we can get something at Flynn's.
4600437	4600778	That would be fun.
4600798	4601298	Perhaps.
4601478	4601838	Perhaps.
4601958	4602178	All right.
4603519	4606462	And I cannot wait for that gift shop to take all my money.
4606702	4607023	I know.
4607143	4609265	I wish they could take all my money.
4609465	4614030	It's going to be like some of the reaction I saw to the Wii U. Just take my money, Nintendo.
4614190	4614731	Just take it.
4615491	4615892	Here you go.
4616753	4616993	All right.
4617554	4617774	All right.
4617814	4618374	Take care, buddy.
4619055	4621117	Be safe tomorrow and tonight.
4621177	4622579	Whatever you end up doing, we'll see you tomorrow.
4624060	4624361	All right.
4624381	4625001	Take care.
4625161	4625622	Take care, Bobby.
4626716	4648247	The one and only Bobby Blackwolf Of course doing the show before us at All Games Radio Sunday nights He starts at 5 Pacific We start at 6 Pacific on Sunday nights We will not be live this coming Sunday But he will and it sounds like he's going to have a hell of a show He's going to have a celebrity bumper More impressions on the Wii U So he could just take the whole four hours for all I care
4651377	4659719	Well, that's it for our guests, but I'm going to go ahead and open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4659779	4663040	I notice we don't have nearly the turnout tonight live that we did last night.
4663060	4672083	I think a lot of that is that most of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences, so maybe it's kind of out of your system at this point.
4672423	4672963	But I don't know.
4673383	4676104	If it's open, if anyone does want to call us, give us a call.
4676364	4680445	Again, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4681825	4684086	Well, we just actually had a Facebook post by Naoki.
4685026	4686867	Oh, what did Naoki say on Facebook?
4687047	4687707	Hot news.
4687927	4692229	The guy who's behind, he's a producer of DDR recently, right?
4692269	4695089	The 2011's new DDR has been announced for Wii.
4695209	4696490	Its name is Dance Dance Revolution 2.
4697710	4699551	Its title concept is Back to Basic.
4700231	4703192	The originality of DDR is the part where you play with your feet.
4703272	4709153	We have concentrated on that part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional DDR.
4709273	4709653	P.S.
4710034	4716555	Not only for the casual fans, but we consider this title will be something that can be enjoyed by core DDR fans for a long period of time as well.
4716615	4719216	We are aiming for the release of the title for this fall.
4719616	4723137	We will do our best to respond to your expectations, so please look forward for it.
4723635	4724516	Very interesting.
4724576	4727637	So Naoki's saying the DDR2 on the Wii is going back to basics.
4727837	4733280	Basically, without saying it, none of this balance board and flinging the Wii mode around gimmicky shit.
4733361	4734841	He's saying it is back to feet.
4735842	4738043	Because that's what makes DDR fun?
4738623	4738864	Sure.
4739984	4740304	Forget it.
4741165	4743686	Is it a new feature?
4745007	4745888	Where's my sad trombone?
4748049	4749750	I don't have the soundboard right now.
4749890	4750850	Dude, you guys harmonized.
4750870	4751411	That was awesome.
4754141	4755441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4779870	4783714	After the Wii U was revealed And my question to you guys Do you think that's a big deal?
4783874	4796885	It was right after the keynote It went down to 16,970 yen That's roughly 212 dollars But that is down 5% A low that the company has not seen Since before the launch of the original Wii
4798931	4827187	is this damning for them or is this eh whatever I think it's people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but if I'm not mistaken most of the gamers I'm seeing posting on Twitter I mean no offense guys but I don't think it's the same people that are following the Japanese stock exchange or having a lot of impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on I won't go that far I'm sure people have investments and things it's a knee jerk reaction you know the stockholders
4827987	4829148	I wasn't like that, but I'll buy one
4849016	4849597	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4866676	4867697	And more fictional amounts.
4867757	4876987	Well, you know, one thing that I did read about price is that even though Nintendo has not said anything, I guess there's been hints from things like, you know, conversations with executives indirect.
4877367	4878448	It will not be out for $250.
4878608	4879930	Oh, no.
4880530	4886196	So we're looking at least probably $299 for this thing, if not maybe even jumping up $349 or something.
4886436	4889760	Well, with all the competition, you know, out there at...
4891195	4891355	What?
4891715	4893236	Is it sub $200 now for a 360?
4893296	4895377	Oh yeah.
4895537	4900099	And $200 for the top end 360 or PS3.
4900919	4908602	You gotta wonder how far Nintendo can push that without seeing the competition get some bump from it.
4909501	4936321	Now, speaking of stock, and I wanted to mention this, but I'll let the chatter say it, because they said it too, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, Zappy says, stocks fluctuate, not a big deal, Apple went down too after Worldwide Developer Conference, and that's the first thing that came to my mind, is that, well, don't these things usually dip after Apple press conferences, and especially when all the stuff happened with the antenna, you know, and their little apology press conference they did with that, I'm sure stock dips for them a lot too, but they...
4936841	4940322	They're Apple, and they're still doing just fine all these years later.
4940562	4942083	Yeah, they're making a couple bucks.
4942543	4943243	Just a couple bucks.
4943263	4943924	Not doing too bad.
4944164	4950566	Now, several people in chat have mentioned this, and BlackWolf's now saying, he's in chat now, kind of cooling off with the listeners there, talking to them.
4951166	4954267	Did you guys cover that Nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes?
4954768	4956468	I had not heard that until I walked into the studio.
4956508	4961290	Somebody posted it in chat earlier, but apparently Nintendo will be ditching friend codes for the Wii U.
4961550	4961830	Good.
4962050	4963031	Finally!
4963111	4965233	Seems like a solid idea.
4965253	4966154	Good job.
4966514	4968676	That is one way to get the hardcore gamer base back.
4968816	4970077	That's smart.
4970597	4972419	I wonder if they've said much more about online.
4972439	4972919	Let me look.
4973520	4978104	Tiger Claws giving us a little link here so we can take a peek.
4980666	4981366	Let's see.
4983508	4990414	I'm going right now to the story at MTV multiplayer blog.
4990779	4993622	because MTV is all about the video games.
5008094	5020940	On hand at E3, Ubisoft producer Adrian Blunt According to him, the day of friend codes are gone Demonstrating Ghost Recon Online for the Wii U I asked him, equivalent to a gamer tag on Xbox Live?
5021240	5032666	Yeah, exactly, he said There's a few things on that The first is the ability for individuals to make accounts Rather than a machine having an account, each individual user has an account
5033767	5036109	He continued saying, You know what that sounds like to me?
5036149	5040112	Remember a couple weeks ago on the show, we were speculating that the system tied into Facebook somehow?
5055766	5083207	I don't think it's like exactly Facebook but I bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be some type of maybe that's where the Nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the Nintendo stream is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing Super Mario Wii and so and so just got caught in catch me I see Dan laughing over there you think I'm full of it or oh no no I was laughing about the fact that Nintendo has products called the Wii and the stream
5084068	5085509	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5104764	5106505	But I'm just having fun with the what-ifs.
5106925	5117190	But I still think the Facebook concept of Nintendo Book... For the record, I got mildly curious, and there are already a full page of search results for Wii U fan pages.
5118530	5124433	Tiger Claw in our chat says, I bet the gamer tag thing Nintendo has coming is tied to your Club Nintendo account.
5124733	5125213	DarkSakura.com
5145219	5145739	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5161209	5176202	so and so filled out a survey and said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no I do that too but it's just frustrating that bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if Nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that a little better might be interesting
5177228	5177568	and DarkSakura.
5198724	5201706	is apparently using 360 and PlayStation 3 footage.
5202147	5204968	And a lot of people are going, fail Nintendo.
5205529	5209432	Oh, Nintendo, why didn't you tell people this is 360 PS3?
5209472	5210853	You're lying, Nintendo.
5211733	5214535	And I'm kind of thinking, is this really a big deal?
5214555	5215796	Why?
5216917	5224142	I kind of figured it was PC or 360 footage because, I don't know, the system's a year away.
5224679	5225299	I know, right?
5225499	5226960	But they've got the licenses for it.
5227921	5233043	And keep in mind, for all the third-party stuff, it's probably what they've been provided by the developers.
5234244	5235124	Absolutely right.
5235324	5235765	Absolutely right.
5235785	5240907	And I bet a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month, two months ago.
5240947	5242388	Very short time.
5242548	5243989	These games are concepts still.
5244529	5245930	And I can tell you this.
5246750	5248331	And this is from a designer.
5249560	5255542	When you're working for a client and you say, okay, well, you want me to advertise this product for you, I need some of your images.
5256023	5258403	They will send you what they have of the item.
5258484	5260224	They don't care how big it is.
5260704	5262365	They don't care what it originally was on.
5262765	5267207	They're just sending you pictures of the item, what their PR has approved.
5268147	5271189	So you get what they give you.
5272830	5275051	Whatever, you're Nintendo, how stupid can you be?
5277192	5280554	Seriously, I know exactly what you're saying.
5280594	5289679	I remember back in the Genesis days and the Atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you know it was the screenshot of the best looking version.
5290099	5292561	But Nintendo's out there to make a statement.
5292881	5296423	Nintendo's out there to say, this is our system and this is what it could do.
5296603	5298504	Okay, fine, do what you gotta do.
5299244	5305431	Put the code on your PC mock-up of the Wii U and play the game and hope that it runs.
5305552	5306613	And if it runs, great.
5307073	5307834	Put it on your video.
5308235	5314462	Don't throw these pictures out into the world and be like, this is what our system will do.
5314582	5319548	And then like a day later be like, oh, by the way, yeah, that's the competition system.
5320302	5320842	No.
5321322	5321783	No.
5322163	5323263	At least don't admit it.
5323724	5324944	Lie.
5324964	5325924	You've lied before.
5326305	5329966	Dungeon Buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of what it could do.
5330086	5330907	Right, exactly.
5330927	5331627	And I understand that.
5331647	5332807	I have no problem with that.
5333087	5334368	I have a problem with that.
5334468	5335569	You have a problem with everything.
5335889	5336449	No, I don't.
5336489	5337309	I'm not mad.
5337389	5338210	I have a problem with you.
5339250	5340291	Yes, of course you do.
5341131	5354881	It wasn't, I mean, the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like conceptual video based on existing game footage or something just to cover their ass.
5354901	5356342	Whatever, but they didn't do that.
5356602	5357662	They put those pictures out there.
5357682	5362886	They put the pictures, especially, you know, the one game in there that really got a pop was when Ninja Gaiden showed up.
5363046	5363246	Right.
5363386	5366128	And everybody was like, oh, fuck, it's Ninja Gaiden.
5366408	5368890	And it's on the Wii U and it looks really, really cool.
5369530	5373031	Yeah, you should have known that was the PS3 version or the 360 version, kids.
5373091	5386174	The one that kind of left me like, okay, maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the Ghost Recon where they were showing the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little Wii U controller as the scope.
5386954	5390775	That's what it looked like to me, but it was often the 360 version or the PS3 version.
5391355	5399124	But if it's true about the guts of this machine, it's gonna be basically a 360 with some extra little frills.
5399204	5403489	Maybe a boost in the RAM, a boost in the shading, graphical components of it, and so forth.
5403870	5409276	I mean, Nintendo's going all in that their system has to be at least as good as the 360 or the PS3.
5411158	5413159	Systems that have existed for five years now.
5413219	5417762	So I think it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that.
5417922	5418423	Absolutely.
5418463	5421985	It's going to at least be this level of graphics, this generation.
5422245	5433932	And that is why they did show that little, for what it's worth, that little random ass Asian flower flying in the bird into the pool and everybody went, shit, that looks...
5436154	5439516	That was the Wii U. That doesn't exist anywhere else.
5439636	5441517	Well, that was the Wii U's development system.
5441678	5441878	Right.
5442498	5445000	Which, you know, is a high-spec PC.
5445400	5449803	So, and if I see, okay, well, that's capable, then I'm sure they can pull off the 360 PS3 stuff.
5449823	5457148	It's like, you remember back in the day when the PlayStation demo disc was out and it had all the ducks in, you know, all over the water?
5457589	5458349	And that T-Rex?
5458449	5459230	And the T-Rex.
5459330	5461331	And everyone was like, oh, wow, that's neat.
5461351	5464314	And how many games did we get that really looked like that until the end of the PlayStation's life?
5465554	5465794	True.
5465854	5466214	Well, right.
5466274	5468055	It's just that kind of thing.
5469675	5470576	It's so early.
5470796	5474997	People are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system that's a year and a half away.
5475137	5476037	And will change.
5476397	5478278	And will not be the same when it comes out.
5478318	5478878	It'll be better.
5479398	5481259	It'll be better than the stuff that's out there now.
5481839	5484140	It can't not be because you cannot buy...
5485080	5498210	Graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the PS3 and the 360 now It doesn't exist They're going to be better They're not going to be next generation better They're going to be peak of this generation better
5499798	5500338	What was that?
5520166	5522387	from the chat room, Colibri for Wii U. Yeah, that was me.
5522507	5523528	That was Jamie.
5525048	5528870	I kind of, though, one of the fears that I have is that it's going to pull a Dreamcast.
5530070	5543016	That since it's coming out well before other systems of this nature, do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot?
5543590	5546732	No, because it's Nintendo and Sega only ever really had Sonic.
5547732	5553034	You know, I mean, I'm saying like as far as like catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth.
5553094	5557056	I mean, if Nintendo's launching with a Smash Brothers game, they got nothing to worry about.
5557076	5558977	Nintendo's not launching with a Smash Brothers game.
5560078	5563659	It won't be out until that system's first holiday season.
5564160	5564560	Interesting.
5565880	5566821	Which will be the season that comes out?
5566841	5571123	I think the only system that ever launched with a Smash Brothers game, at least close to launched, was the Cube, right?
5572389	5578072	Which, by the way, we found out today, you won't be playing that on the Wii U. Because the Wii U has taken out the GameCube compatibility.
5578092	5578972	That's right.
5579492	5579833	You know what?
5579853	5580593	We've got a GameCube.
5580613	5580893	Don't care.
5581073	5581273	I know.
5581493	5582034	I'm kind of like that.
5582074	5583414	I'm not too surprised about that.
5583434	5586676	Because Nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back.
5587036	5591958	It's kind of like your DS3DS or whatever won't play Game Boy Advance games.
5591978	5594980	You know, they took that out way back in the DSi, right?
5595920	5596120	Yeah.
5596461	5597261	So, I mean, that...
5597950	5612539	However, our PS3 will play PS1 games You couldn't play Game Boy games on your DS even though the slot was the same size Your PS3 will play Atari 2600 games It's not even the same company It's amazing
5613484	5613784	All right.
5614144	5615985	Well, I guess everybody's being shy tonight.
5616005	5616906	We're not getting any calls.
5616946	5617386	That's okay.
5617426	5618627	What's up with that, people?
5618707	5619307	Fuck you, people.
5619327	5620608	I mean, hi.
5621108	5622049	I've closed the Skype line.
5622069	5622829	It's your chance to call.
5622849	5624210	See, now you guys can't call and talk to me.
5624230	5624630	That's right.
5624730	5626451	I've decided not to do it.
5626471	5627172	Let's go get Pinkberry.
5627492	5628753	I already had Pinkberry today.
5629313	5630133	And it sucked.
5630153	5631254	You're trying to make me fat.
5632129	5636853	We are going to wrap up our E3 coverage, however, and call it a night.
5637013	5640655	I know we didn't go as long as last night, but let's face it, all the news, most of it was yesterday.
5640956	5644438	But I want to thank again Bobby Blackwolf and Miklatov for their on-the-floor impressions.
5644578	5645639	I learned a lot from that.
5645719	5648681	I learned a lot more from that than I did from some of these press conferences.
5648961	5650783	So big thanks to them as well.
5651163	5654586	And thanks to you guys for tuning in and listening to us over the past couple days.
5654946	5656387	Just programming notes coming up.
5656487	5657328	We will not be doing this.
5657348	5659109	Rhonda said he was going to call, but he was in the bathroom.
5660012	5660753	Loser!
5661133	5662814	Alright, fine, I'll open it up again.
5662894	5663275	Hold on.
5663595	5664696	I just called him a loser.
5664816	5667478	We had the freaking line open for like ten minutes.
5667498	5669219	That must have been the biggest poop in the world.
5670140	5672322	Some people are lactose intolerant, Rob.
5672982	5673763	Hold on, I'm logging in.
5673783	5675324	Yeah, fuck lactose!
5677566	5677946	Hold on.

5684419	5684920	I know, right?
5685080	5686500	We don't care about your shit.
5687020	5688761	We just care about your call, not your poop.

5718423	5719664	I guarantee you it's on.
5719784	5721205	He says he's on, so get bent.
5723956	5725517	Did you just tell someone to get bent?
5725638	5726999	I told Ranma to.
5727059	5727659	Jamie, shut up.
5727679	5728060	All right.
5728940	5733324	June the 19th, we will be back live at All Games Radio.
5733504	5735927	For more information, visit our website at Orange Lounge Radio.
5735947	5737208	Yeah, Missy is a cheese farm.
5737228	5738889	They grow cheese on vines.
5740070	5741131	Not letting us go all night.
5741151	5741511	You know what?
5741531	5742512	I'll just try calling him.
5743013	5743293	Do it.
5744346	5744766	Fuck this.
5745627	5746909	Oh, I don't see him online either.
5747529	5748390	This is a problem.
5749291	5750232	Skype fail.
5750252	5751414	This is a Skype emergency.
5751494	5751974	There we go.
5753055	5754197	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5754237	5755078	Whoever could this be?
5755999	5758601	You guys are just so loving, you know?
5758621	5759462	Four weeks later.
5759502	5760263	Just so loving.
5760463	5761464	Yeah, yeah, what do you want?
5762225	5765649	Well, I just have one thing to say, pretty much.
5765989	5766210	Yes.
5767751	5769894	I can't take it anymore.
5770675	5771536	I'm sick of it.
5772117	5774740	And I'm finally going to file divorce.
5775781	5776102	From?
5777003	5777603	Nintendo.
5778925	5780046	Oh my gosh.
5780166	5781748	Somebody call Judge Mabel.
5781768	5783250	But who are you cosplay?
5783430	5785253	Why do you make Nintendo hit you, Ranma?
5785273	5785293	I...
5786704	5804919	After that presentation and my friends going nuts on Twitter about their presser, we kind of came to agreement that Nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you always take back, just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around.
5805860	5809302	There is genuine concern in the chatroom what will happen to Black Luigi.
5809943	5812305	He will be replaced by Shadow the Hedgehog.
5812325	5812545	Yeah.
5814068	5817452	Oh my god, that's trading down really, really, really far.
5820134	5821376	And I'm a Sega fan.
5823057	5823718	A Shadow?
5823938	5824279	Really?
5825199	5826341	Or at least be Knuckles.
5827390	5827931	and DarkSakura.
5850548	5877234	I gotta talk more about why this Nintendo hatred I have to admit I loved it when Reggie came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever you guys are confusing but here I don't know what gamers he's listening to but I didn't ask for a 6 inch Android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side
5879167	5880189	I didn't ask for that.
5881871	5883193	I just want one of those as a system.
5883213	5885157	You don't want to put it on your table and play Othello?
5886639	5887039	No.
5887060	5889023	That would be awesome for Gauntlet.
5889043	5890725	It looks like they hired Ben Heck to make it.
5891843	5895445	What about, though, the fact, though, Ranma, that we are still a year away?
5895825	5899447	I mean, the reason why I'm still kind of like, it was all right.
5899487	5900828	Their presentation was fine.
5901168	5902969	I'm not, like, super excited about it.
5903069	5906090	I'm going to buy one anyway because I'm a consumer whore and I buy them all.
5906671	5910953	But I'm like, we're not really going to see this system for another year.
5912114	5914415	Maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together.
5915355	5920098	So are you basically giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out?
5920902	5939439	I suppose so, but it's okay, because I will be marrying its younger sister, the 3DS Ah, so the 3DS, you were a fan of all the stuff you saw there Okay, yes, Mario Kart, yes, I am a Mario Kart whore like nobody else's business
5940482	5941183	That's a given.
5941583	5949633	And I missed Super Mario, but I went back and watched a trailer for it, and I said, this is the Mario game I've been looking for.
5950373	5953016	A 3D platformer that plays like 2D, but it's 3.
5953056	5954418	This is what I wanted.
5955079	5956220	I will sit here and play that.
5956701	5957361	I'm not too fond.
5957421	5959464	It's called Super Mario, but hey.
5961573	5961893	Whatever.
5961933	5964195	I think it might still be a working title.
5964615	5971739	So it seems to me that you've got this relationship with the big sister, but really you just want to sleep with the little sister.
5972960	5974481	Well, yeah, that's why I have a DS.
5975222	5975502	Okay.
5976921	5977321	Wow.
5978402	5978762	All right.
5979042	5981923	Well, Rob, any other closing thoughts on E3 before we let you go?
5984023	5985164	Let's see.
5985524	5986904	Microsoft was a bit of a snore.
5987584	5990025	Sony had me with the Vita.
5990185	5991346	And I'll say this right now.
5991746	5995907	Yes, the Vita with 3G powered by AT&T is going to be $299.
5996407	6000028	But I'm telling you, when it comes out, you'll be able to get it for $99.99 with a two-year contract.
6003689	6005190	Mark my words!
6005210	6006791	That's not how they sell iPads, though.
6007212	6008532	That's how they sell iPhones.
6009473	6011995	iPads, iPhones, netbooks for 3G.
6012255	6014016	Hell, it worked for the taco, didn't it?
6014517	6015537	Well, kinda.
6015617	6016978	Yeah, but we got ours for free.
6017379	6020541	I think this is a relevant question, Ranma, since you are Black Luigi.
6020561	6027766	And we call you that, just so people know, we call you that because whenever you cosplay and you're black and you dress up as Luigi...
6028186	6040522	You make your way on camera no matter who's there And we always see you on TV Oh, it's Black Luigi, there he is That's why you have that name And so, Tigerclaw in chat says Ranma, what do you think of Luigi's Mansion 2?
6040962	6044166	Since, you know, it's a game starring Luigi Nintendo finally showing some Luigi love
6045097	6050463	I'm all for it because, you know, I've always said this.
6050743	6054567	I've always said that Peach is nothing more than a whore.
6054687	6057270	Because Mario's always chasing after her to save her.
6057550	6061094	She doesn't freak out when Bowser kidnaps her.
6061475	6063397	Because it happens three times a month.
6063837	6069061	I know, and look, they're Koopa Kids, we all know who the mother is, you know, we already know.
6069321	6078028	I feel like you have designed this really weird, sick Mario RP world while really, really fucking high.
6079129	6088517	Actually, I was sober at the time, it was many years ago, and I said this to a friend of mine, and it broke him, and all my other friends were like, holy shit, that actually makes sense.
6091109	6093411	Bowser, you are the father.
6093551	6094051	Alright, anyway.
6095052	6100335	Luigi has a nice mansion, a nice car, his girl is in check, he's got the good life.
6100436	6101036	I mean, really.
6104598	6107440	But really, Luigi's Mansion, a 10-year-old game coming back.
6107961	6108581	You're all for it.
6109582	6112824	Yeah, believe it or not, I actually liked the first Luigi's Mansion.
6112864	6113845	I thought it was a fun game.
6115726	6116607	I think it's neat.
6116867	6118648	Hey Ranma, Princess Daisy don't want no scrub.
6119449	6119529	Pfft.
6120789	6122270	She has an eyeball in the back of her head.
6123290	6124170	Ranma, we're going to let you go.
6124190	6124550	It's true.
6124570	6126111	She has an eyeball in the back of her head.
6126331	6128192	She stays in the castle, okay?
6128552	6131653	Hey, she also plays mean, rounded tennis.
6132493	6135054	Why do you think Luigi got on one knee and proposed?
6136034	6138415	Ranma, I'm ending this conversation right now.
6138495	6139035	Have a good one.
6139436	6139976	Stay black.
6140636	6140896	All right.
6140916	6141216	Bye.
6141636	6143617	You know that Daisy does have an eyeball in the back of her head.
6144088	6145529	Oh, it was a graphic glitch.
6146229	6148151	But that was awesome still.
6148351	6153274	I like that someone in Mugen actually programmed an attack with the weird eye in the back of her head.
6153434	6155395	It's because people in Mugen have too much free time.
6155515	6156456	I know, it's great.
6156896	6162780	Okay, you're sitting on the internet doing a podcast about E3 and you're telling the Mugen people they have too much free time.
6162860	6164061	Way too much free time.
6164662	6165082	It's true.
6165622	6166463	All right, that's it.
6166563	6167744	We're ending the show.
6167985	6172989	Thank you guys for tuning into our E3 coverage, especially those of you that are tuned in, be it live or through the podcast feed.
6173009	6174050	We really appreciate it.
6174351	6179095	So we're going to take a little break, you know, because it's going to be dead next week with E3 being done.
6180536	6181598	Thanks for watching!
6196235	6197775	Thank you guys very much for tuning in again.
6197996	6205017	And if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, remember, we don't get paid for this and we don't have big money advertisements for this.
6205337	6208718	So just tell a friend or two or five about the show.
6208878	6210519	Word of mouth is so, so important.
6210559	6221962	And if you listened to this show for the first time because of the Ustream presence, because it was a new place for us, come join us at our normal place, OrangeLoungeRadio.com, Sunday nights at All Games Radio, and tune in and hear us there.
6222262	6222782	So that's it.
6223162	6224083	We're closing up shop.
6224863	6226143	Final thoughts, real quick though.
6226183	6228184	DarkSakura, your final E3 thought.
6228464	6228884	Pinkberry.
6229685	6231746	Because that has so much to do with E3.
6232846	6238068	My final E3 thought is boobies in Saints Row.
6240329	6243250	Dan, the man, thank you for being here, by the way, and filling in.
6243270	6243750	Appreciate it.
6243930	6244370	I live here.
6244530	6245110	I know.
6245151	6245731	Your final thought.
6246071	6247271	Peace, love, recycle.
6247451	6248792	Oh, and quit fucking bitching.
6249807	6252227	Goodnight everybody, we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
