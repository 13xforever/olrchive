60400	65280	with my co-hosts here in the studio say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura.
65280	69920	Carrot. So you've gone from meat last night to carrot tonight. Yes because I want something
69920	75440	crunchy. All right and also joining us tonight say hello to Dan the man is here in studio. Hello
75440	80320	hello. How you doing? I'm doing good. Good you're on Loki's night so or excuse me Loki's mic so
80320	86000	you're not as loud as you were last night. I get to sit in my own desk. The guest mic is so
86000	91520	freaky in here but oh well nobody cares about that. I blame you. We are live of course live on
91520	96240	Ustream if this is your first time listening to us here on Ustream this is not where we're usually
96240	101120	at we do a Sunday night live show every week at All Games Radio. More information about our
101120	106560	podcast and all that good stuff www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can listen to last
106560	115360	night's two and a half hour opus of the Wii U and Xbox and Kinect and and the Vita. We're gonna
115360	120400	actually get more into the Vita tonight. It is live of course you can join us in our chat room
120400	126560	at chat.orangelaungeradio.com if you have any live comments you want to give us as we're
126560	132480	broadcasting here live. Speaking of live sometimes interesting things happen and we actually have to
132480	136080	mix things up a little bit tonight. We're not gonna start with Bobby tonight. Bobby's caught
136080	141760	in traffic. He's still in LA downtown. I guess the last text I got is that a transformer blew
141760	146960	out somewhere. So sorry Bobby fans we're gonna have to go to him a little later but we're gonna
146960	151920	go right into today's coverage of E3 and from what I understand our correspondents out on the floor
151920	157040	got some more hands-on impressions today. As you know yesterday Bobby waited for quite a while in
157040	161920	that Wii U Wii U Wii U line to about what like four hours to finally get his hands on the Wii U
161920	168960	and gave us his impressions yesterday. Tonight we're gonna go straight over to Miek Letov who
168960	176000	was on the show floor and I think he was waiting for like three or four hours today to play the PS
176000	180800	Vita. So it's kind of interesting that both of them have very long lines waiting to play them.
180800	187440	So we're gonna go to Miek Letov right now through the magic of the internet we're gonna call his
187440	192160	little cell phone and see what else he played today because I know the show hours are usually
192160	197280	longest on this second day so hopefully got to play a lot more today. I don't know if he got to
197280	202160	go play more Konami stuff like Silent Hill which he said it wasn't that great which made Jamie sad.
202800	208720	Very sad in my soul. But of course it's just his opinion it's just one opinion so we'll see maybe
208720	214960	Bobby got to play it today we'll see if he thought the same thing. Hello? Hey is this Miek Letov?
215920	220240	Yes. Hey it's Rob from Orange Launch Radio of course you should know that I just texted you
220240	226000	thanks for letting us. I know it's so surprising. Thanks for letting us mix things up a little bit
226000	230000	and bringing you on first tonight. Bobby's caught in traffic where are you are you are you back at
230000	237280	your hotel? Yes I made it back. It's fine after 50 minutes of commuting. Do you how do you get now
237280	243920	yeah for those who have never been to E3 and have heard about LA traffic it really is a nightmare
243920	247840	that's why I'm not looking forward to being in it tomorrow when we go to pick Bobby up at the
247840	253040	convention center but uh it'll be all right. At least we'll have each other right Dark Sakura?
253600	259040	Yes. Right Dan? Of course. All right anyway so Miek Letov how was E3 for you today?
259040	266720	It was well I would say I only really participated in E3 today for about
266720	272400	three hours if that because today was my stand-in-line day. Today was your stand-in-line
272400	278400	day so I already mentioned that I know you stood in line for the PS Vita right? Yep. Good I'm glad
278400	281840	we get to talk about because yesterday was a little bit Nintendo heavy with all the Wii U
281840	285920	talks so I'm glad we get to talk a little bit about the PS Vita today so tell us about your
285920	291120	experiences everything from standing in line how long to when you finally got your hands on the
291120	299840	goods? It took about four hours for me to get through that line and I got there at about 10 30
299840	306560	so it was a bit ridiculous for the line but to make up for it if you can consider it that I
306560	312800	did play with it for about 20 minutes so I got some good hands-on time with it. Not bad yeah
312800	319680	what are your thoughts? I really like it it's definitely a great successor to the PSP
320400	328080	for the design part of the system the screen is beautiful it's really big it's really vibrant
328080	334480	you really don't see any pixels whatsoever definitely a nice high-desk screen
335280	342400	the the back part with the touchpad I don't like that so much because the touchpad takes up too
342400	349120	much of the back so you're constantly accidentally tapping it and in the game that you know you use
349120	356160	the touchpad on the back can kind of screw you up but that's just a minor uh minor complaint I'm
356160	359760	sure if I held it the right way because it's grips it would be a little bit better. I wonder
359760	363840	if you can just turn that crap off do you think do you think you just turn off that back touchpad
363840	367360	altogether because I didn't even think about that but yeah if you have a tendency like tap on the
367360	372560	back of your device or something it's going to totally mess with that back touch stuff right?
372560	378320	Yeah it will um I assume that some games will have that I don't think it will be a system setting
380160	386160	but so yeah there's that part and the one thing that I actually do not like about the system is
386160	391840	that the face buttons are way too small like I was playing Uncharted and I kept trying to hit
391840	397760	the x button but instead I'd hit an analog stick because that's where my fingers felt like the x
397760	402560	button should be instead of these really tiny little buttons that they give you to play with.
403440	406640	So it sounds like maybe there's some design things that need to be worked out or is this
406640	410320	is this pretty much like the final thing that you guys are seeing did they say anything about
410320	417600	prototype or how far along it is? Um I did not ask and they did not say I assume because of how
417600	422080	close to I mean really if you think about if it's supposed to be this this holiday it's only a few
422080	429200	months out so I'm pretty sure that this is probably the final design. I thought the ds was shown
429200	433360	and it went through a lot of changes I mean this is many years ago it was shown at e3 and it went
433360	438240	through many changes before it was released uh but maybe not because I think that might have come out
438240	444000	the ds came out what March or April I guess so thinking of the ds as being many years ago is sad
444000	452400	I know that was my first e3 I think all of ours was the year the ds was yeah anyhow uh so okay so
452400	456400	this isn't about the ps or the ds though it's about the ps vita um so tell us about some of
456400	461440	the games that you play and what they were like okay they had a station set up for us to go to
461440	466080	about five minutes on each or was it four I don't remember I can't remember the amount of stations
466080	472960	but I'll whisk them off um the first one we went to was the little big planet station so we got
472960	478400	to play um or you got your choice of a couple different um options in little big planet you
478400	484240	could play a stage or you could play um a two player game using just a touch screen and you
484240	488880	would play with the demo guy I opted to do just the stage because I wanted to see how it would
488880	495280	really work in the practical play um and I was really impressed uh I used everything from the
495280	502000	the touchpad to tilting the system or not touchpad sorry the touch screen to tilting the system and
502000	506720	it played like little big planet and it looked like little big planet on the ps3 so like I was
506720	512080	really impressed um one of the puzzles that had me do was there was a keyboard in the background
512080	518560	and I had to play or I had to push the keys for the musical note and then LBP and it opened the
518560	524320	door and I thought that was really cool uh and so you say it looked just like little big planet on
524320	530720	the ps3 so did it feel like it was just kind of a port of the ps3 you know original with maybe some
530720	535840	uh frills that incorporate the vita stuff like the the back touching or whatever did it feel
535840	541840	like like just a whole separate experience like it's not you know just a port I would say it felt
541840	549200	more like a separate experience because the vita special features really made it feel that way um
550240	556560	so like there was a part where I had to hold on to a one of the little uh spinning wheels
556560	562720	and it wasn't spinning yet so while I was holding it with the uh r trigger um or whatever it's called
562720	569920	the r button um I had to use my uh left hand to actually spin the wheel around so he would go up
569920	574960	to the top I was like that's awesome you know this is cool well I would expect talking about
574960	579200	the design of the system again in your hands and the way that whole works uh kaijuto is in our chat
579200	584320	room at chat.orangelandreay.com saying this guy must have fred flinstone thumbs do you just have
584320	593040	abnormal hands no no these are really small like I my hands are not big at all and these I swear
593040	599680	were like the size of mini m&ms something people might know okay there you go that's a good
599680	607440	comparison okay so what else little big planet and okay after that they sent us over to virtual
607440	615280	tennis which um so far these two games I was told are launch titles for the system um so virtual
615280	623120	tennis really nice looking um they had you play it first with the just touch screen so you would
623120	627120	press the spot on the court to move your guy you hold your finger down your guy would move
627120	633200	and then you could flick up to do a top spin and then flick down to do a back spin and it actually
633200	640240	and it actually worked really well um then I was introduced to control how is that touch screen
640240	643920	stuff different from like playing an iphone game or is that really what it felt like like oh I'm
643920	649520	playing an iphone that's really what it felt like with nice graphics okay and it was on a bigger
649520	659360	screen okay and um yeah so then uh he told me to do all my um hits uh with the touch screen and
659360	664240	I could move with the analog stick like okay this actually I kind of like the way that one played
664240	668480	um and then it's like oh just play normally and you know I could play normally it wasn't like
668480	672240	super impressive but it was still really fun because virtual tennis games are pretty fun
674480	681840	so after my time was up there um I went to the what's that super game called
681840	688720	little deviants that game is pretty much what I feel like they're trying to one-up
688720	696000	nintendo with um it seems to be a collection of mini games for the most part um there were three
696000	703280	that we got to play the first one was an ar game just like face rater to a t like with the
703280	708720	exception of putting somebody's face in it uh you just look around with your screen all over
708720	712320	all over the actual environment for these little spaceships you had to
712320	720320	destroy before they destroyed your little deviant characters um the next one was a whack-a-mole
720320	725600	style game that used both the touch screen and the touch pad on the back so windows would open
725600	730640	up and if they were facing you you had to touch the touch screen on them um and if they were
730640	736960	back turned to you you had to press from behind underneath um and watch out for the humans because
736960	742640	you lost points for that these all definitely sound like little like gimmicky demos that
742640	748000	to be fair is probably the same stuff the same stuff they're demoing the wii u with right now so
749600	756880	exactly um the last one was uh this uh it's the one that probably everybody's seen where you have
756880	762400	the touch pad on the back and you make the hills and you roll the ball the bvm ball guy around
762400	768880	into the whirlpool that one was probably what really frustrated me most with the the touch pad
768880	775520	on the back just because i mean it feels inevitable that you will rest your fingers on the back of the
775520	781200	pads the way they don't want you to do it um and there was no clear definition on the back where
781200	787120	the touchpad started where it ended so that one was really hard for me so little deviance though
787120	791360	it sounds like it's just a mini game collection i don't know to me it kind of sounds like a pass
791360	798400	i've seen it before what did you think uh i'm it's not a not a purchase for me at all um it was like
798400	805440	bundled in with the system i'm not gonna delete it but i'm not gonna purchase it okay all right
805440	814000	um the next one i went to uh was sound what did i call it sound something or other sound sound
814000	821680	something was it a music game um yes it kind of was um man now i feel bad because i was talking
821680	826400	about how much i love that game sound shapes i'm looking at your text from earlier sound shapes
827600	832320	yes so thank you sound shapes which is interesting because this was not even something that we saw at
832320	836080	the press conference so when you texted me that i'm like what the hell is that that must be like a
836080	842320	game they didn't say anything about otherwise it's been talked about before i know that um it's made
842320	849120	by the guy that did i want to say like either pixel junk or everyday shooter i don't remember
849120	855600	it's one of those two um but in it it's got two modes it's got a platforming mode which is very
855600	864720	simplistic shapes um you're just like little blue spiky ball looking thing but the object is to get
864720	869760	through the level and to hit these blue orbs and every time you hit a blue orb in that screen
869760	876240	it creates like the drums for the music or it creates the guitar or the keyboard so you keep
876240	879600	going looking at the audio you guys are hearing in the background i'm looking at a video of this
879600	885840	because i want to see more about what he's talking about here oh the guy's talking through it
887360	896000	yeah we can't have two people talking i'll i'll just look at the video then but uh yeah so you go
896000	901120	through uh different screens trying to collect all the blue orbs to create the music it was very
902000	911680	much a music-y platformer that caught my attention right away um i was told again launch title and
911680	916240	that people would be able to create their own stages and upload them for other people to play
916240	922560	oh cool that's really cool and that's the other part of the um demo it was he was showing me how
922560	928800	to create my own stage and placing music at certain points and placing the orbs and traps
928800	935280	and it was really cool i liked it a lot interesting as a music game fan uh this is kind of a must-have
935280	939520	for you because i'm looking at this going this does not look at all like other music games but
939520	945600	i'm i'm glad because i think it's you know i don't always need to see falling notes that you hit
945600	952320	whatever device too you know so this is kind of nice yeah i i think it's it's not only a game for
952320	958560	music fans but also for um possibly platforming fans because people who like to get high and play
958560	965280	video games what was that people who like to get high and play video games no because they'll
965280	971520	probably like try to eat their psv or drop it thinking it's some crazy monster okay we need
971520	980000	we need we need new crack since moja ribbons already out that's kind of like it's simplistic
980000	987760	like that like like the brib and stuff so i think it was great um definitely gonna be the first game
987760	992080	i buy because it was the one that impressed me the most which makes me sad because the next demo
992080	997600	playing too was uncharted and that was the game that at first announcement had pulled me on the
997600	1005120	vita before it was called that and before i played it um and it didn't disappoint me per se uh i think
1005120	1012080	it looked beautiful and played like uncharted my problem with it is those tiny little m&m buttons
1012080	1021120	that um like they just got in my way i couldn't perform moves as well uh i definitely got shot
1021120	1028000	and killed twice during our demo because i couldn't get the button properly um that wasn't
1028000	1034080	any of the top screen controls of what was that did you try any of the touch screen controls
1034080	1039600	stealth takedowns jumping stuff like that see that that's what i'm about to i was about to say
1039600	1046000	is that like i like the what they called painting where you move your finger across like ledges and
1046000	1051920	he would move there that was cool but once you used it for hand-to-hand combat i hated it i
1051920	1058000	absolutely thought it was stupid because i have to instead of like you know position myself with
1058000	1064560	the camera and my body for the next enemy after i'm done punching this guy to death it takes one
1064560	1071360	hand off of that and i have to focus on tapping the little fist icon which was stupid i thought
1071360	1074160	you would like that because when i was seeing that in the trailer i was like that looks like
1074160	1079600	elite beat agents and that's like belita's favorite game no no it's nothing like that
1079600	1086560	at all it was frustrating and kind of annoying but um i'm sure that that will not be the only
1086560	1095200	way to play um i don't even could probably use the little m&m buttons to hit too but uh the demo
1095200	1099280	i didn't get a chance to try that because like oh use the touch screen only for combat it's like
1099280	1109520	okay thanks for getting me killed but um yeah that ended the ps vita experience so it was
1109520	1116960	worth the four hour wait yes i think so because i think i have waited in long lines at e3 to four
1116960	1123200	and not come away as satisfied as i did with the vita okay all right so now what's interesting
1123200	1126720	though is that you even though you enjoyed the vita and you're like okay i definitely want this
1126720	1130960	sound shapes game and there's a couple other things i played that i want i really need them
1130960	1137360	to fix some of these design issues even though there might not be any time now yeah i i don't
1137360	1143040	think the little buttons will hold me back from purchasing one because i think a lot of that has
1143040	1149520	to do with my hands being more accustomed to holding like a psp so it like my my fingers
1149520	1155360	gravitate to where um i think it's going to be at because i mean let's be honest it looks just like
1155360	1162640	a psp it's a little bit like longer um a little bit wider and a lot lighter actually it's like
1162640	1167840	nothing in your hands whatsoever um let me ask this question real quick because you know you
1167840	1171440	said that you definitely want to get the ps vita and i walked away from the sony press conference
1171440	1176560	saying i'm not really sure i understand why i need a vita still and and my whole thing was that
1176560	1184000	okay it just looks like it's a uh you know psp with a back touch thing a front touch thing and
1184000	1191280	slightly more power so what once it's slightly more power a lot more power a lot more but we'll
1191280	1196160	see i think the psp as it is still holds up and looks really really good there's a lot of really
1196160	1201520	good looking games on there so the psv is even better yes interesting i guess maybe the
1201520	1205840	screenshots online is such just don't do it justice so i'm looking forward it doesn't like
1206640	1212240	when you see the screen in person that that's what got my attention first and then the weight
1212240	1218640	in my hands got it second and then it's just a really nicely designed system for once now i kind
1218640	1223040	of asked bobby about this yesterday because he waited in line for the wii u uh most of the day
1223040	1227440	you waited in line for the ps vita most of the day did you catch any kind of like buzz from people
1227440	1231440	around you now see the funny thing was bobby was standing around a bunch of people who didn't speak
1231440	1235520	english yesterday so there was like no one for him to listen to but did you did you kind of catch
1235520	1239360	what was the buzz what were other people saying about the vita were people complaining about the
1239360	1246000	controller like you were or i didn't hear any complaints about the vita except for the long
1246000	1251600	wait time like i had people behind me leave a couple times because they were tired of waiting
1251600	1257920	clearly this must have been their first c3 because you know you have to wait forever for stuff yes
1257920	1263120	um i didn't hear any buzz about vita i did over here i'm not sure if this is considered i'm sure
1263120	1270400	it probably has but i heard something about skyrim randomly um from a dev saying that the uh it was
1270400	1276320	a bethesda dev so it wasn't like some random person but they were talking to um one of the
1276320	1282480	naughty dog people that were over there and they said that um skyrim is going to have about 30
1282480	1289120	hours of main quest and 300 hours of side quest nice uh i know bobby got some i i don't know if
1289120	1293520	he got no he didn't get hands-on he got like a 30-minute demo with skyrim today so he was
1293520	1298320	he got a little special bethesda show so uh we'll talk to him more about the details there later
1298320	1303120	i do like over maybe i'm just nosy but i like one of my favorite things at e3 is to just like over
1303120	1308160	here people because people do talk about rather loudly so i can hear them about um interesting
1308160	1313520	stuff kind of like what you're just saying yeah so all right so the ps vita took up most of your day
1313520	1316880	but you were you were happy with it at the end of the day what else were you able to get your hands
1316880	1324320	on today um i got to play child of eden um which was definitely not totally what i was expecting
1324320	1331280	but i still really liked it um the control scheme's a little weird and it was a guy the guy that was
1331280	1339840	explained to me a wasn't from ubisoft b was from walmart and c you look at b again and realize the
1339840	1345360	amount of knowledge you probably had about the game um he didn't really tell me how to play
1345360	1353600	properly i don't think so it was hard to just jump in randomly and start playing but it felt a lot
1353600	1361760	like rez it looked like rez it sounded like rez um but the two firing mechanisms are different like
1361760	1369360	your left hand is like a rapid fire gun that only works on like these pinkish um enemies and your
1369360	1376400	right hand is your lock on gun gun and i couldn't tell if i was supposed to like lock on fully and
1376400	1381760	then like swing my hands forward to shoot or if it was just automatically shot i think i had to
1381760	1387280	point my hand forward but i definitely was getting hit a whole lot in that game but it was on no die
1387280	1393200	so it didn't matter and the music was really good i imagine uh what little i could hear yeah because
1393200	1399760	if this one was outside underneath the tent oh lord which is of course the optimal playing uh
1399760	1405360	you know environment for a music game and a connect game they must have been at that booth
1405360	1410960	where i think rock of the dead was shown last year and it was not a great location there's amongst
1410960	1415440	all you know you want what that booth was that booth was where a long time ago i think you were
1415440	1421120	there for the c3 where they have the balls tent set up i don't even think i remember that but
1421120	1425920	that's all right it's been a long time that's like not even on convention grounds it's across the
1425920	1431200	street oh geez oh oh god okay you were like you weren't even in the convention center at that
1431200	1435840	point yeah that's when i was walking there this morning and then they're like hey do you want to
1435840	1439760	come play some games we got brinks i was like no no i can't try out the theater it's like yep let's
1439760	1445200	go over there because i i still haven't found it on the show floor and i've been looking it's
1445200	1449040	probably not there because it's out like what next week so i don't think there's a lot more to
1449040	1454880	say about it so all right well what else did you use hands on um i didn't get my hands on it but i
1454880	1461520	did get to sit through the presentation for saint throw the third um and that was pretty funny i've
1461520	1467120	never liked open world games and i don't like gta or anything like that so i just kind of went in
1467120	1472560	with an open mind and that game looks freaking hilarious and they didn't censor the the dildo
1472560	1477520	bat thing that they hit people with that was really funny and they also said that you can make
1477520	1482400	your character naked in play i was like how is this going to get an m rating at that point
1484160	1489680	unless they're like built like a barbie doll naked naked to them might mean like booty shorts
1489680	1496720	you know it might be like just nothing but you know well so my male character i'd make would
1496720	1501440	have beauty shorts i guess that's your i i don't know if you just heard damn but la noir i don't
1501440	1507120	know if you play that that got an m rating and that's got full-on beaver so totally oh yeah
1507120	1512160	i don't know i haven't i i've got it i haven't finished it yet or even some clothes spoiler
1512160	1518880	well i guess yeah i guess if it's not like an actual fashion it won't get anything bad but
1518880	1524160	um that was really funny uh i liked what i saw they showed up off some open world stuff which
1524160	1530560	was just humorous and then um like you can put people in a cannon that's on a car and shoot them
1530560	1537760	out and everybody loves you because uh you're you're getting the things are like like celebrities so
1537760	1542080	no matter what you do they like you so you put them in a cannon you shoot them out at things and
1542080	1547520	you know they die and people are all excited because they're meeting you um this is gonna be
1547520	1553200	a totally obscure reference but this reminds me of um one of the movies that stars divine if you uh
1553200	1557280	know who divine is i think it's female trouble or something and you know it's always she's very
1557280	1561760	filthy and over the top and stuff and there's a scene where she's like who wants to die for art
1561760	1565520	and everybody's like me me me and so she shoots one of them and i don't know why but what you're
1565520	1570560	describing sounds to me like that but that's the over the top craziness is what they're going for
1570560	1576240	in this game so they've succeeded yeah definitely um and then they showed a mission which they were
1576240	1582720	uh robbing a bank and it turned out to be like you know some rival gangs bank or whatever so
1582720	1589120	fighting ensued and at one point during the gunfight which was really gory too um just
1589120	1593200	some random person in the hood he came up and asked for your autograph and you get like extra
1593200	1600480	points if you sign it i was like that's hilarious awesome um so is this even though you don't play
1600480	1605280	the gta style games it sounds like you might be interested in getting this one yeah i might try
1605280	1610000	this one this one looks really funny so i mean that's one thing about grandpa does it takes
1610000	1617040	itself pretty seriously and i don't know this just seems like like kind of like smoking aces
1617040	1623120	that would be or was it lucky number seven i don't know no that's broken aces yeah i'm not
1623120	1629520	looking over seven um but that's really all i got to play today i think like i'm racking my
1629520	1637120	my brain but the vita took up so much time that i don't think there was much else for today all
1637120	1642320	right so uh uh anything you're gonna try to look at tomorrow i mean i know we're not doing a show
1642320	1648240	tomorrow but anything you might want to look at i was debating on doing the wee or not and i think
1648240	1654320	my final decision is i'm not gonna go to it because i don't think it's worth the time um
1655440	1660240	so i think tomorrow is going to be catch up day like i'm gonna go try to do uncharted 3 because
1660240	1665280	you get like a t-shirt and some stuff for doing uncharted 3 i'm gonna go back through the 3ds
1665280	1670480	lines because you get pins um when you play the games and i want more pins because it's swag
1670480	1674880	and i and risen heaven is there for the we and i haven't got to play it yet and i really want
1674880	1679920	to do that because i like rhythm heaven so i might just hang out in the we and sony tomorrow and
1679920	1685200	just completely avoid the other hall because i mean most of the cool stuff is either behind
1685200	1691920	closed doors or just in video form so you're kind of finding the uh usual e3 thing that seems to be
1691920	1695600	more and more popular the last five years to be true where all the really good stuff is behind
1695600	1700880	closed doors and there's very little out there on the on the floor for the rest of you yeah yeah
1700880	1704800	that's too bad i don't understand the the media restrictions this year because it doesn't look
1704800	1711360	like it really changed anything i felt like if they did the restrictions it would probably mean
1711360	1717040	like more stuff on the floor but it feels like there's less stuff on the floor like 2k and
1717040	1721920	Activision all have their stuff behind closed doors i think Bethesda has all their stuff behind closed
1721920	1728240	doors ea has all all their good stuff behind closed doors huh wow i guess they just don't
1728240	1735520	want the general public forming opinions on games like we're doing right now so so and well cannot
1735520	1740800	be needs to take that advice and you know hide like silent hill when they want because it's awful
1740800	1746720	i tried it again today that's right and it was still bad so that whole day did not make a difference
1746720	1750720	how funny i was just asked it's because dark soccer is very sad to hear that silent hill
1750720	1755200	isn't very good i'm sad to hear it too but uh you need to try the alan wait game that's supposedly
1755200	1763120	xbox where is that i would have or else i haven't seen it uh i think it's a microsoft boost somewhere
1763120	1768160	unless it's uh behind closed doors like everything else i don't know oh let me just have to hear that
1768160	1772400	hall again ask bobby he's in chat oh wait you're not in chat i was just asked bob bobby's in the
1772400	1777440	chat room he might be able to tell you well maybe you can relay the message to me right now since
1777440	1784640	we're live and you can read a chat room you will just have to do some research all right all right
1784640	1788160	well uh me glitov thank you very much for uh joining us past couple days and giving us your
1788160	1791440	thoughts and impressions on what you saw on the show floor anything else you want to get out before
1791440	1799680	we let you go no i ran to kira yeah kiriyama okra twice today why are you stalking him yeah i did
1799680	1805280	another time i did not text you about because i was like at that point is it really worth it like
1805280	1810560	it's like a daily occurrence now are you asking for his picture every time are you are you making
1810560	1817120	eye contact with him and giving him flirty eyebrows did you give him a hug he loves i've already given
1817120	1824720	i've already given him like a side hug before no full-on manly pat on the back hug go for it
1825760	1830560	and close your eyes you don't know what to do because christian side is really bad
1832320	1837760	he what i missed that last part what did you say i said you only give christian side hugs
1838960	1844720	yeah okay that's probably true oh i said uh every time i've gone up to him i keep you know
1844720	1849280	realizing how bad his english is and he had like a translator chick with him today so it kind of
1849280	1855520	helped but yeah it's kind of hard to talk to him and i don't think that me running up and trying
1855520	1866400	to give him a hug would help you know break down that language barrier or anything fail
1866400	1873920	yeah see you know saying dice he really long elongated because he would be running away
1876080	1877120	why you no hug
1880000	1886320	speaking broken english that's like i was thinking of the the little men
1886320	1893200	main thing the so-and-so why you know this all right mijot we're gonna let you go uh i gotta

2073440	2078320	place i had picked i believe was that place where the sony press conference was held so after you
2078320	2084960	said it took me 55 minutes in traffic to get there i'm like maybe that's not such a good idea so i
2084960	2088880	think we're just gonna yeah i think we're just gonna come down to la live i'll text you tomorrow

2095680	2098480	have you made la your bitch bobby fuck la
2098480	2106240	la l.a bows to me i heard you uh had a lot of Bethesda beer last night
2107600	2114480	uh yeah i don't remember how much that's a good sign i lost count at about five and so
2114480	2119840	there were heinekens no there were there were new castles and that's when i met new castles
2119840	2125840	why did i say heineken yeah new castle is the best ever how was it how was the Bethesda party
2125840	2133040	did you ride the bull no i didn't ride the bull i mainly felt like it was so packed like everybody
2133040	2137040	was there but i mean it was so packed like i tried to go out and mingle and it was just like i'm
2137040	2141040	going back to my table with electric sisterhood and i'm just gonna sit here and when they did
2141040	2146160	karaoke we changed the lyrics to every single song to friday because that's for the journey
2146160	2151280	song that was the only one we didn't turn into friday but everything else somehow became talking
2151280	2156800	about friday and front seats and back seats and you know which which one do i take because that's
2156800	2162240	what's funny when you're drinking a bunch of Bethesda beer that's right beer thesda and we
2162240	2168320	look if we look it was not a karaoke song or i would have sung it did ninja sister get on the
2168320	2174880	bull no no no they didn't somebody one of the people from their crew did and he sang as well
2174880	2181520	ah okay but uh neither of the sisters did all right all right well anyhow let's let's talk about
2181520	2186800	your day at e3 today you got to actually get a little more of the games today because yesterday
2186800	2191920	obviously your day was like all we you well not all but mostly right today you got to get a little
2191920	2196000	more into some of the other games so what tell us about some of the stuff you got hands on with
2196000	2200800	today i know i know skyrim was a big demo you got right you didn't you didn't get hands on but yeah
2200800	2206160	right yeah it's a it was a demo and and some of the things i mean it it looks really nice
2206720	2214400	um it crashed on us which is great um it crashed they're like hmm we need to do we need to switch
2214400	2219760	something out until like the skyrim logo came up and he like did some stuff and flashed some
2219760	2224880	things and then you know okay now we're continuing again out of curiosity did they tell you to shut
2224880	2229840	off your video cameras did they tell you to shut off your video cameras in that demo oh yeah yeah
2229840	2236320	no no photos no video cameras um that one you could record audio like i could have recorded him
2236880	2242800	speaking uh but yeah no video cameras or anything in defense of anything you know and um but it was
2243840	2247440	sorry to answer something that came up when miklotov was on the show earlier that's why a
2247440	2251840	lot of stuff is behind closed doors so they can take away cameras and things like that and not
2251840	2255680	let you use them because of what just happened when when bobby was seeing skyrim is that when
2255680	2259360	the game crashes then they don't want people running to youtube going look at this piece of
2259360	2265200	shit game and how it crashes well i was gonna say though you remember when we got into bethesda
2265840	2270240	um when we got the appointment with bethesda the first year and they just like go ahead and
2270240	2275520	film star trek that's cool i think a star trek was was coming out soon i was filming call of
2275520	2280160	cthulhu too all right they're just like please please film anything just just get it out there
2280720	2286080	no now with the rise of camera phones yeah leaks are you know they're instant you know you're
2286080	2291040	oh recorded oh it's on youtube and they just don't want to take that chance i understand sorry for
2291040	2295600	the tangent bob and they were watching they were watching for people if they happen to be holding
2295600	2304320	up a phone or something and they had tried to be discreet so now here was one thing is um you know
2304320	2309680	a lot of people i heard a lot of people bitch about another rpg that came out a couple years
2309680	2315200	ago uh that i played the sequel to today final fantasy 13 and why am i bringing that up in
2315200	2320960	reference to siren because that whole chrysanthemum whatever it's called that's your skill system in
2320960	2329840	skyrim interesting huh the way that you uh basically you unlock these constellations in
2329840	2334720	the sky and that's how you choose your skills and inside that there's a little ring where you get as
2334720	2338480	you get more skill points you go to the next point of the ring and it creates a little circle and
2338480	2343440	stuff like that that i mean it does like i looked at it i'm like that's final fantasy 13 right there
2343440	2349040	wow and like people hated it in final fantasy 13 but they're probably gonna love it in skyrim
2349040	2354480	of course of course double standards drive the gaming media what are you talking about
2355680	2359520	yeah see i got it because i didn't bring this up last night the public is an idiot
2359520	2365760	i think um because i i have heard so much like snark and hate and stuff from the gaming community
2365760	2370400	about like everything like it's like you know sitting in the chat room during the press
2370400	2375600	conferences like you think that you know microsoft took a big old dump in the middle of the stage
2376400	2379920	and gave you smell-o-vision so you could smell it at home because like they just
2379920	2385360	hated everything they're like why don't all this stuff that connect oh modern warfare 3 i don't
2385360	2391520	want to see modern warfare 3 oh oh it's another halo oh wah wah and you know and then like nintendo
2391520	2396000	like hey this is like something you've never seen before i don't want that they don't want another
2396000	2401680	mario you'll suck you know and it's like i mean there's a lot of people out there like dude if
2401680	2407600	you don't you know i gaming may have moved on past you and you may need to just stop gaming if
2407600	2413600	there's nothing that has been shown that you like you're a little bit too jaded to be a gamer i think
2414240	2418240	and i've been seeing that a lot it's not here at the show floor like there's not that much hate
2418240	2423680	here it's all the people at home i like that in the absence of loki tonight we get bobby doing
2423680	2428240	the ranting that is not what i expect i thought it would be damn but we get bobby doing the ranting
2428240	2433040	bobby's ranting seems to come off a little bit more cerebral i'm trying to let bobby
2433040	2437120	rant because he sounds like he has some things he needs to work out i think he knows what i
2437120	2443440	think he's right on oh exactly all i can say is agree like times 10 likes this post people yeah
2443440	2451120	exactly like people are idiots they just can't handle it it reggie hit it on the head you know
2451120	2455520	and it's funny that he walked out in public and he just said it he's like look you guys want things
2455520	2460080	that are different but you want something you're comfortable with fine we'll fucking do that we're
2460080	2467760	nintendo it's what we do sony's just like whatever here's a better psp and uncharted microsoft's like
2467760	2472240	connect and everybody's just like oh my god why can't there be something mind-blowing it's because
2472240	2477440	the people are spoiled they got used to these blockbuster e3 announcements every year and now
2477440	2482400	the blockbusters aren't good enough because the gaming companies got practically nothing left
2482400	2486880	or they're just not willing to show it off yet do you think the microsoft thing
2486880	2493360	might have come off a lot different if it hadn't been spoiled literally 30 minutes before showtime
2493360	2500080	yes halo 4 i think so too much much more important had everybody not i think gamer
2500080	2504320	underpants everywhere would have needed to be changed if that had not been honestly they should
2504320	2510960	have led with halo 4 you think exactly all right anyway i don't want to recap the press conferences
2510960	2516880	i gotta i gotta move forward here but um bobby skyrim was it as beautiful as it seems to look
2516880	2522960	when i'm watching it on game trailers or wherever online yes and now i mean they probably souped it
2522960	2527600	up a little bit it was running on a big movie screen uh but it looked and sounded beautiful
2528160	2532640	um you know and then you have all the weather effects and changing the weather effects and stuff
2532640	2539360	like that does does it look like and then right go ahead yeah uh go ahead go ahead now i was gonna
2539360	2543200	say does it seem like you'll sink as many hours into skyrim as you did with oblivion because
2543200	2551040	oblivion you could easily sink triple digit hours into that game it was disgusting yes absolutely
2551040	2555040	because they even showed like these they walked us through a town and like here's all the stuff
2555040	2559440	you can do in the town and you could just go over here and chop wood you can do jobs like a table
2559440	2565360	and you know all that stuff so there's you know lots of other side quests a lot other than the
2565360	2572480	main story that they're packing in here and you know the the dragons are awesome just you know
2572480	2577120	watching you know how they fly around and it's quick and you know all the stuff they're doing
2577120	2582160	and and it's not like a you know pattern boss fight is what they they said they said they've
2582160	2588560	got ai so no two dragon fights will be the same and even like our guy got you know hit around a
2588560	2594880	couple times probably didn't expect so i mean they showed a couple different like two dragon
2594880	2600080	player they showed dragon five we ran away from and then we met up with that dragon again and
2600080	2605520	then a bigger dragon showed up and it was just you know here let me show you how you can do these
2605520	2611360	spells and you know i do this and i can shout this at him and i'll use this fireball on him and
2611360	2615680	you know injure him so he hits the ground and you know runs up to a castle to see if other people
2615680	2620080	will help him and the dragon goes up and eats those people it was awesome do you think it'll
2620080	2628080	make the release date of 11 11 11 uh i believe they will it was i mean it was you know they
2628080	2632160	showed us all the menu systems and so all that stuff's coded in and i think that they're in the
2632160	2638880	polishing phase right now other than that one bug that crashed the thing but um you know i i think
2638880	2643680	they will i think they'll make that and um i i think people will be pleased with it now i mean
2643680	2649360	the fez obviously does have the track record of releasing buggy games and uh games crash and stuff
2649360	2655680	so i i would not be surprised if that's the case here um but you know they've done that and uh you
2655680	2660320	know like all the stuff they've done with the menu system and the map system and kind of makes things
2660320	2665120	more exciting and seamless and stuff and you know they simplified the combat your the right triggers
2665120	2668880	your right hand your left trigger your left hand whatever's in it that's what goes so you know
2668880	2674080	there's your shield and you know your sword and stuff like that do the monsters still level do
2674080	2680480	the monsters still level up with you they did not talk about that interesting but i i would assume
2680480	2688960	that they would because they're Bethesda and they're evil like that all right well so uh was
2688960	2694640	that the only thing that Bethesda showed you or did you get to see anything else i went to see
2694640	2702400	their prey to demonstration okay and and uh you know where you know it's alien noir is what they
2702400	2708000	were calling it and stuff and and you know running around um basically in this game you play as the
2708000	2713280	u.s marshal on a plane that crashed in the first game that you actually saw in the first game so
2713280	2718800	he you know you start off there and then you actually it fast forwards six months later to
2718800	2723920	when you're like the only human on their alien planet and you're now doing jobs oh i didn't
2723920	2726960	realize that's how they were tying it together because when you see that trailer you're like
2726960	2733520	what the hell does this have to do with prey yeah that was my literal reaction this looks awesome
2733520	2738000	and i showed it to alan who loves that like cloverfield and and blair witch kind of stuff
2738000	2742480	that's all and that's very much what the trailer is like right and it was like wow this is awesome
2742480	2749040	it's it's it's prey yeah yeah so i mean basically and you do meet up with the character they did
2749040	2754720	say spoiler alert you do meet up with the character from prey one eventually interesting story
2754720	2760960	but basically you're you are uh a mercenary for hire because you used to be a u.s marshal so
2760960	2765920	that's why you had a gun on the plane when it crashed into whatever in prey one uh so he
2765920	2770160	basically took those skills and now he's a mercenary a human mercenary on this on the
2770160	2775600	home world of the alien and he's actually takes jobs for the aliens he can go through and help
2775600	2780640	people or hurt people and he can corral people in and there's you know thugs will attack you as you
2780640	2787200	go through it's a big open world thing on their alien planet so that that was kind of interesting
2787200	2794480	and and uh you know i watched that until that crashed oh because he was like i need to go up
2794480	2798960	to this guy and there's a climbing thing and so he starts climbing up and his arm starts going
2798960	2806400	through the wall and then it just freezes so it sounds like uh that that would go ahead and then
2806400	2813040	so that that was like and i'm like you know i've seen this it's cool i'm sold i'm gonna go check
2813040	2816880	out something else because you know that was 15 minutes into the demo and i didn't know how long
2816880	2822480	it would take them to get the demo back up and if they'd be in the same spot so that's all i saw
2822480	2829760	pretty too and then i uh since i don't like shooters i still went over to rage and the racing so i
2829760	2834560	could see how that was and it's very smooth and very fluid and i did the little three-lap race
2835280	2840800	and stuff um but it's it's a very those enemies are a little cheap because it's i couldn't figure
2840800	2846160	out how to defend myself against the missiles that they kept throwing at me so i anytime i would get
2846160	2850720	into third out of four anytime i got into third place i would immediately like blow up and there's
2850720	2854080	nothing i could do about it like incoming i'm like okay what do i do okay i'll go around this corner
2854080	2860160	oh it's a homing missile damn i'm blown up again at least you gave it the good old college try
2861200	2869680	i did so um so yeah so i got to that's what i did in the Bethesda booth um and uh so i'm trying to
2869680	2875200	think of what else i uh looked at and played today i mean i i went in and my other appointment was
2875200	2882000	with ccp games and it was it was a powerpoint presentation uh with some videos embedded in
2882000	2886640	about how they're going to be working dust 5.4 into eve online and essentially they were talking
2886640	2892160	about their vision and the technology and it is it's really neat and i've learned the reason
2892160	2900800	they're ps3 exclusive is because sony has relaxed a lot of their rules on what they can and can't
2900800	2908800	do on psn and microsoft wouldn't do that dust 514 is a multiplayer only first-person shooter and it
2908800	2915280	is running on the exact same servers of eve online as in you're going to be in the same corporation
2915840	2922720	as eve online players you can transfer money and items between eve online and dust 514 basically
2922720	2926880	dust 514 is the only way you can be on a planet and eve online is the only way you can be in space
2926880	2932960	wow and so and so corporations that already have wars going on now will have the added dimension
2932960	2941120	of the wars in dust 514 and they will be fighting on the planet and yes i because i as you see this
2941120	2945040	in the trailer and they're like yes this is exactly how it works the people playing dust
2945040	2950960	514 can call up to the people playing eve online and orbit around the planet say i need an orbital
2950960	2955840	strike i need a you know laser strike and the people playing eve can then call down
2955840	2962080	this big massive laser that's in orbit to incinerate something in the dust 514 multiplayer
2962080	2966400	match going on at that same time that sounds awesome i've never played eve online in my life
2966400	2970400	it's just not something that's really jumped out as something interesting to me but that sounds
2970400	2975680	amazing like i i i love how the two different games tie together like that that sounds just
2975680	2984400	awesome and dust 514 is tailored for first-person shooter fans who felt eve was too complex or out
2984400	2988880	of their league a little bit you know they couldn't get into it but they still like the
2988880	2995360	idea of being a part of this universe uh single shard server they said that they've had i think
2995360	3002080	64 000 people concurrent is their record of how many people have played eve online at one time
3002640	3010240	on one for her wow and and uh and also uh dust 514 it's going to be like a it's going to be a
3010240	3015520	psn title downloadable uh 20 or 30 bucks i don't they didn't really pay the price it's somewhere
3015520	3020160	around there so it's a downloadable title and then it's free to play there's no monthly fee
3020720	3025440	oh wow and that money and the coverage they call it a cover charge is what they call buying the
3025440	3032160	title and that money that you pay for that gets turned into in-game currency so you start off with
3033040	3038480	money already in your account which is basically the market value of what you just pay for that
3038480	3043440	cover charge isn't that kind of how eve online works too i i i think you can buy like they
3043440	3049040	support uh real money trade because they they they endorse it or they they do they monitor it
3049040	3056560	they they provide it yeah well yeah well it's there's a monthly subscription for eve online
3056560	3061840	but if you're good enough you can actually buy they're called plex pilot license extension cards
3061840	3067760	in the game that gives you 30 more days oh right okay okay that's how and you can you know trade
3067760	3072480	them in game and stuff like people and that's how you know some corporations will actually pay
3072480	3078800	people to play the game for them by giving them plex wow and you you can do that so you know yeah
3078800	3083520	so it's an amazing economy and they were even talking about you know some of the wars and stuff
3083520	3087760	that have gone on and they even like actually referenced one of these player corporations in
3087760	3093040	their trailer video where it was um i can't remember it might have been like the netherlands
3093040	3097280	or something was where this corporation was from and they were fighting a russian corporation
3097280	3103440	corporation in this one sector of space and you know the russians were out out out powering them
3103440	3109280	and out maneuvering them and in stuff but the the the dutch kept coming back and they couldn't figure
3109280	3114240	out why and so there was espionage in the game by these corporations ccp had nothing to do with this
3114240	3119280	espionage in the game where they kind of figured out that the americans were funding the dutch
3119280	3124800	because they didn't want to fight the russians directly so they cut off they cut off the trade
3124800	3129840	route wiped out that dutch corporation and that was the end of it wow so it's stuff like that
3129840	3133200	that they're you know because they say you know games like world of warcraft and everquest those
3133200	3138080	are theme parks where there are quests given to you and you know it's the same thing every time
3138080	3144160	and stuff like that eve online it's the sandbox they give you the fan the bucket you know the
3144160	3149520	the area and you make the story and that's what they're saying that you know dust 514 is going
3149520	3154720	to do with the same type of thing where you know and and the reason it's geographically like that
3154720	3159520	is because of like time zones and stuff that's when people are playing and so they expect that
3159520	3164480	that's going to be the same way and they did say that uh for latency if you're worried about lags
3164480	3170080	it's the first person shooter eve online is not you know it can handle latency uh the first person
3170080	3176000	shooter they're actually going to have battle servers in various parts of the world so you'll
3176000	3180240	be connecting to that instead because their main eve online server cluster is in london
3181040	3186560	so currently when you play eve online their supercomputer is in london and it's like they
3186560	3192560	said like it weighs more than a ton but i think they said how many machines it was uh but they
3192560	3198800	didn't i can't remember the number but they're going to have battle servers in uh geographic
3198800	3203760	locations so you have a low ping you know when you're playing dust 514 because this most console
3203760	3211040	games are peer-to-peer where one of the other ps3s is the server right in this the server is eve
3211040	3217680	online and sony was the only one that allowed them to do that interesting and they also said that uh
3217680	3222720	i asked you know you're you're infuriating a lot of pc players and stuff and they're like eve
3222720	3229360	online's been around for over eight years you can read between the lines on that wow i feel like
3229360	3234080	i've learned more about this game than anything else at e3 and like i i kind of just went no okay
3234080	3237360	and it might tie into eve online that might be kind of cool but the way you describe it i'm like
3237360	3241680	wow this this this almost makes me want to try eve online at least it sounds interesting yeah it
3241680	3246880	sounds really interesting if they pull it off that's that's fast that's fascinating how the
3246880	3252720	one game could impact the other like that so cool kai judo asks uh when can i get my hands on some
3252720	3257760	stuff they are doing a very closed beta at the end of the year which is going to be closed in
3257760	3262160	the sense of it's going to go to the high end eve online players and you know hand-picked people
3262160	3267600	but sometime next year uh but they've been laying the groundwork for dust inside e
3267600	3272960	for the last three years with their expansion uh like you know planetary building planetary
3272960	3277520	formations and stuff like that you could build refineries on planet that started two years ago
3277520	3282720	that was in preparation for dust and that in introduced some of the server aspects that would
3282720	3288720	handle dust and you know stuff like that so it was i mean it was the reason i'm talking so much
3288720	3292480	about it because they gave so much interesting technical information for me as a technical
3292480	3298720	person as well um that you know it's just they didn't show the game like they didn't play the
3298720	3303360	game they did with the powerpoint they showed some movies it wasn't even real like some of it was
3303360	3307440	real gameplay footage but you know they didn't actually have a playable where they had a playable
3307440	3313040	in other places before um you know they've just said you know we're talking about our philosophy
3313040	3318160	and creating games and here's what we're trying to do and here's what we've already done and you
3318160	3323200	know we're awesome and that's okay you got so much information about it that you're still a little
3323200	3327440	hype for the game i mean at the end of the day it'll really be about well how does it you know
3327440	3332800	how does it pull off because although it sounds awesome in theory like what if this breaks eve
3332800	3337520	online you know like but these you know again like you said eve online has been around for
3337520	3343360	eight years you know it may not be a quote-unquote competitor to wow but it's always been a great
3343360	3348720	like alternative to wow but i just like i think of a game like star trek online which i played
3348720	3352000	just a little bit during the beta but jamie you were really into and the thing with star trek
3352000	3357440	online for me is that i loved the away team stuff but i did not like the space combat at all but
3357440	3361760	like what if that was two separate games and like i could just play a game that's nothing but away
3361760	3365840	team stuff i would have been all over that see it actually kind of got turned around for me that i
3365840	3371440	liked the space see you could play eve i could play dust and we could still kind of be in that
3371440	3377120	same universe that's always something i'd kind of wanted you know that you had your position i mean
3378400	3383040	yeah it's a little different with star trek but i think that i get the thing it would be really cool
3384960	3391360	wow so interesting fascinating you don't get off the ship you're stuck there the most fascinating
3391360	3396560	part of my day wow all right well i i don't know if you can follow that up with other impressions
3396560	3402480	and other things you saw that maybe fascinated you a little bit okay well no i can and actually
3402480	3405360	i got an interview with this guy because you know i was kind of walking around
3405920	3411440	and i passed by nico's booth you know they make all those you know the the extra peripherals or
3411440	3416720	whatever and i'm like usually i'm like eh it's nico all right this time i actually stopped and
3416720	3426880	looked and what they've got is a device that might improve a lot for a lot of people motion gaming
3427680	3434480	it's called the zoom and what this does it's for the connect and it basically because connect
3434480	3438400	fires out all these infrared lasers and that's how it determines the positioning it actually
3438400	3443440	modifies where the lasers go and it gives it a wide angle lens so now you don't have to stand
3443440	3452800	as far away from your tv nice so it basically instead of being six to eight feet away you can
3452800	3462080	now be four to six feet away and two players of connect adventures can be you know stand kind of
3462080	3468560	where one player would stand before and it seemed it worked pretty well from what i was seeing on
3468560	3472800	there so i have a little i have an interview with a guy talking about that and uh you know how much
3472800	3478880	it's going to cost which it's not that expensive it's only 30 bucks and it's coming out in august
3478880	3482320	that could be great for those of us that live in like apartments and things where we're a little
3482320	3487280	more cramped up or just if you have a lot of stuff like some people do that sounds great or not not
3487280	3490400	want to have to move the coffee table every time you want to play connect i think that's that sounds
3490400	3495520	like it could be an awesome peripheral you know if it works but it it seems like if you were watching
3495520	3500480	people play it at e3 that were they're normal people playing it right not not all their people
3500480	3505520	right it's you could have i could have walked up and played it nice you just didn't want anyone
3505520	3515920	to get that on video yeah so uh but um let's see what else did i um i did play uh final fantasy 13
3515920	3521920	too how was that and i don't know if i don't know if shane talked about that or not uh it is uh
3521920	3532240	uh it is uh final fantasy 13 plus shamu because of the with the quick time events and stuff um
3532240	3538080	and and it built some uh other neat camera things and it is going to be a little bit more open
3539040	3544160	uh no open-ended and stuff you can you know because like final fantasy 13 it gave me that
3544160	3548880	sense of urgency of the linearity of it and stuff and then when you get more as urgent then you
3548880	3553520	could roam around well that sense of urgency is probably not going to be there as much in 13 too
3553520	3560240	you know i let you know go ahead yeah i was just saying i looked at the trailer for 13 too online
3560240	3564880	and uh i did notice it seemed like they were emphasizing even in the trailer that there was
3564880	3569360	more open world and open environments you could see in the maps they were not linear so i mean
3569360	3574320	that was one of the biggest you know complaints about 13 so i i could that was one thing i noticed
3574320	3580560	right off the top yep and uh one of the things that happened to me is that a monster joined my
3580560	3587440	party so i had i had a monster in my party i had my two humans and then like this monster suddenly
3587440	3590880	was in my party i don't know why it was you know i couldn't hear anything so i didn't know if it
3590880	3596160	was explaining dialogue but uh you know so and it depending on what paradigm you were in that
3596160	3600960	monster change like he was a little fire plant in commando mode or when you turn him to ravager he
3600960	3607120	turned into this big server thing huh so it was it was that was kind of cool and they introduced
3607120	3611360	this um and i didn't really understand it all that much once again because i was on the show floor
3612000	3618400	uh but it's like you've got a little mod with you and when enemies appear a little countdown timer
3618400	3624400	appears and however quick you hit the enemy uh that you know that determines if you get this
3624400	3628960	first hit or if they hit you first or whatever uh that was kind of interesting and then they did
3628960	3634000	some of like these cinematic events and live events and stuff uh while you're just walking
3634000	3638560	around and you know you can still walk around and like the camera will change to show something
3638560	3647040	happening hmm so it was kind of cool um you know i'm you know i'm sold on it but you also like 13
3647840	3653680	right what you also like 13 and a lot of you also like 13 though right and a lot of people didn't
3653680	3660720	yes i like 13 so you know you keep that in mind when i say that that i you know since i like 13
3660720	3665840	you know i like 32 i like what they added to it but it is you know the core gameplay of the
3665840	3670560	paradigm shifting all that stuff that's that's still there 13 it didn't change at least not what
3670560	3676160	i saw um do you think that maybe there's enough there to kind of squelch the haters a little bit
3676160	3686000	oh no haters are gonna hate all right sounds familiar gamershateeverything.com right that's
3686000	3694160	right okay exactly um so let's see i'm trying to think of what else i kind of walked by and got to
3694160	3701760	see it was i was running around and stuff um i did go into atlas's booth a little bit in the
3701760	3707840	little meeting room area that was open so i could get into it um and they were showing uh rock of
3707840	3714720	ages which is the only one rock of ages and they were showing catherine and they were talking about
3714720	3719040	other things but those were kind of the only ones they were showing um and i played rock of ages and
3719040	3723840	i'm it was it's kind of hard the thing about e3 that people don't realize is that a lot of times
3723840	3729840	they dump you in the middle of things and there's not always a tutorial and there's not always a guy
3729840	3734880	standing there telling you okay here's what's going on so i had no clue what i was doing it's
3734880	3739280	like it's a tower defense game and then it's katamari damasi but not really because it's not
3739280	3745280	tank controls and you're trying to break down another guy's castle and it was it was kind of
3745280	3749200	interesting i'm sure that i'd like it more if i played it you know knowing what i was doing
3750080	3754640	but um that one was kind of cool i didn't you know there was too many people for catherine
3754640	3763040	in the place was getting cramped so i didn't get to go in there um so uh trying to think of what
3763040	3770320	else did you do you remember seeing anything on my twitter that i've been missing no i i mostly
3770320	3774480	wanted to hear about skyrim though but that you were getting some feedback on twitter today any
3774480	3778960	good uh any good questions you were able to get answered for people on twitter at twitter.com
3778960	3784960	slash bobby blackwolf i i did i started answering questions and then loki actually answered them
3784960	3789760	better than i did because like they weren't they weren't giving me exact dates and he'd be like oh
3789760	3797600	no that's coming out on february 12th um one thing i didn't get to play this yet um but uh you know
3797600	3801920	a good colleague of mine shadow next gen he's actually sitting right across from me right now
3801920	3809520	howdy um he he was uh able to get in to see the demo of fable the journey oh we learned something
3809520	3816560	but not many people are talking about what's that the game is not on rails oh it sure looked like it
3816560	3823440	was on rails okay okay it sure looked like it but according to mr molyneux who apparently gave that
3823440	3828720	particular demo just because he had nothing else better to do he said it's not on rails and you
3828720	3834480	know you can believe everything that molyneux says yeah it's always dead on accurate not not over
3834480	3841600	hyped at all so okay well then maybe maybe we'll just need to see more videos of the game in actual
3841600	3847040	well i wonder how do you move around yet you have the connect thing going on that's why i always
3847040	3850320	assumed a lot of connect stuff was on rails because like well if i'm not holding a controller
3850880	3856320	but i i also kind of thought connect was supposed to allow me to sit my big butt on the couch
3856320	3861920	with my controller yeah and maybe i'll maybe i'll lift my hand and wave it for something you know or
3861920	3869520	or at some point it could actually see fingers i don't know yeah now the game i did play today and
3869520	3873680	this is the reason i forgot about this because it was the first one i did this morning i went
3873680	3879200	to disneyland already i've already been to disney you went to play disneyland adventures huh
3880400	3885040	i did i played connect adventures with disney characters and that one the way the way that
3885040	3889520	you move in that and it's kind of interesting funny like in the overworld the the disneyland
3889520	3893600	area they actually have like the quest markers that look just like tabled like the little yellow
3893600	3898560	circles around things um but the way you move on that is you just put your hand down and you
3898560	3904800	start moving and then if you go right and left that's how you turn your character um and i did
3904800	3912720	an alice in wonderland video or mini game and uh it was um you remember the whitewater raft rafting
3912720	3920720	thing that was in connect adventures yes yeah it's that it's that with alice in wonderland characters
3921520	3926320	um so it basically you know when you guys are saying it's connect adventure with disney that's
3926320	3931840	pretty much what it is also i guess to me like i didn't get to do the the peter pan one but it's
3931840	3936160	been a while since i've been there but it's not a one-to-one representation of the ride at least i
3936160	3943600	hope the alice in wonderland ride is not you in a golf in a golf ball with alice hitting you and
3943600	3947760	sending you down and all these cards are trying to you know get in your way and you have to jump
3947760	3952560	over them i can guarantee you the ride is not like bobbie you will not have to worry if we do end up
3952560	3958080	going on that ride on friday we will not get pelt golf balls at you unless you want that full
3958080	3962640	experience because we are going for research purposes that's only on it's a small world at
3962640	3966880	least that's what you feel like by the time you get out of it when a small world breaks down the
3966880	3973760	puppets start pelting oh i've been in there when it during christmas all those people are actually
3973760	3978080	people who are trapped inside of the ride when it broke down and they were turned into little
3978080	3986720	mannequins and then you sing forever so was it was it enough to make you go gosh i i might actually
3986720	3990640	kind of want to get this game or were you like nah this is just the same crap with a new label
3990640	3995440	i i said gosh i might want to put this game on my gamefly queue
3996560	4001920	okay kind of in the middle all right get it from gamefly get my achievements then get out right
4002960	4012560	yeah fair enough yeah um so other than that i'm really i mean i talked to the playstation home
4012560	4016800	developers a little bit oh uh and i'm probably going to be doing an interview with them because
4016800	4021840	blender uh asked me about you know because there's this big freezing bug and they you know you
4021840	4025920	i was talking to people that actually work on i think content creation stuff but they were like
4025920	4031040	yeah we addressed that finally like this you know yesterday and you know blah blah blah and they
4031040	4035840	have like things that they want people to do if they encounter like we want this far
4035840	4040080	wide i'm like so you want to go on the air about that and they're like oh i'd love to
4040080	4046160	but i got to talk to pr so i may have this huge ps home interview tomorrow i'm soliciting questions
4046160	4050400	on twitter tonight some people have sent me some real good ones wow but i may be able to
4050400	4054640	report an interview there i know there's a lot of questions people have about playstation home
4054640	4065120	like when's it getting out of beta is it a google product yeah so um i think it's all data didn't
4065120	4070080	they take the word beta out of home no no when i launched it earlier today or not uh last night
4070080	4074000	you know how i went into playstation home it was completely on accident i met to go i meant to go
4074000	4079520	in the store and i accidentally like because my thumbs are fat like fred flintstone i went up and
4079520	4084240	i went into playstation home instead and i was like well shit now that i launched this i might
4084240	4088880	as well just kind of look around i clearly noticed the beta tag still on it and i was like hasn't
4088880	4098480	this been around for like two years now at least so uh and then uh i did kind of walk through the
4098480	4106080	indicate booth which is all the independent games where they had nerd twister as an actual twister
4107120	4114720	with a voice telling you where to put your next hand or foot on what color but the way that they
4114720	4122960	did it it's it's the i think they call it twister anapolis 5000 it's a race so everybody starts at
4122960	4127280	the end and i posted a picture of this on twitter and it says real long twister board and everybody
4127280	4132160	starts one end of the twister board and it says okay right hand blue and so you put your right
4132160	4139040	hand on blue and you know and you're trying to go forward and whoever makes it to the end first
4139040	4145440	without leaving one of their you know without waving one of your other hands uh they declared
4145440	4151280	the winner so that that was interesting and they had something else like what they had like it
4151280	4156000	looked like a four square court but i couldn't like they were throwing cups or something i don't
4156000	4160960	know what that was but i also saw in there i was just saying because the twister but the twister
4160960	4165920	was nerd twister what happened is that when you got to the very end the mat was pulled away and
4165920	4174880	you all fall into a cologne bath and that's how they kept e3 sane now that was not the craziest
4174880	4181040	thing that i saw in the indicator oh dear okay and i was i wanted to get a picture of this but
4181040	4186720	by the time i thought about getting the picture of it uh they were not playing it anymore it is
4186720	4197120	called a kiss controller a what where a kiss controller okay as in i thought he said a little
4197120	4202720	device you kiss this little device and that actually like they were shown like it does a
4202720	4211520	bowling game and the better kissers you are the better you bowl and you're actually kissing this
4211520	4216160	it is i i didn't want to approach it because i didn't want to you do it myself i wanted to
4216160	4222160	get a picture of somebody else doing it interesting wow they were putting those
4222160	4228960	booth babes to work weren't they i was like and there was this other game that had like a gas
4228960	4233120	mask and i didn't know what that was i don't know what that was but the guy was wearing like a full
4233120	4237280	on gas mask and playing you know might have been like some virtual reality type of thing as well
4237280	4241840	but it also tried to breathing or something i don't know maybe that was just to protect him
4241840	4246640	from the fanboy wink this clearly would have been the type of thing that used to be in kensha hall
4248000	4253520	yes awesome yeah that this stuff that stuff would have been intention because i mean the
4253520	4259040	indicate stuff so it was a lot of the independent games and stuff and then they had normal games in
4259040	4264480	there too that those were like on the edges you know that was the oh i've never thought of that
4264480	4271120	before well now bobby i know you've got one more day left at e3 and i know as part of your day
4271120	4276240	tomorrow you're going to twitter eric can twitter continue your twitter adventures where you let
4276240	4281680	the uh listeners of your show and and the olr listeners who jump in there and want to follow
4281680	4286560	you and direct you around too look at whatever but what else haven't you seen yet that you're

4302720	4308880	were those two games yeah so i i this is not for the shame for all this show but no i mean i want
4308880	4313920	to see both of those because also like even like loki was twittering me have you seen go see saints
4313920	4318960	row go see saints row and i'm like okay i will i promise i just wasn't in that hall i've been in
4318960	4323600	the cell for two days now i've pretty much been in the hall that like sony and nintendo is in so i
4323600	4331360	think i'm done there and i'm going to go try to spend as much as i can in uh the main hall i'm
4331360	4336480	considering trying to get in the line for the vita but if it's really longer than the wii uu line
4336480	4342320	i think i'm gonna skip on that yeah miklotov waited four hours today so take it or leave it
4342320	4348720	i guess and he said it was worth it but of course then he continued to say i'm not waiting in that
4348720	4356640	wii u line so i don't know yeah yeah so so i don't know i may or may not do that i don't think so i
4356640	4360000	really need to like catch up on some stuff i want to see that i want to see if i can get into the

4655680	4660400	line at 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio i noticed we don't have
4660400	4665200	nearly the turnout tonight live that we did last night i think a lot of that is that you know most
4665200	4670480	of what you guys have been able to watch and see you saw in those press conferences so maybe you're
4670480	4674960	it's kind of out of your system at this point but i don't know if it's open if anyone does want to
4674960	4680400	call us give us a call again it's 1877 game olr or our username on skype is orange lounge radio
4680400	4687200	um well we just actually had a facebook post by naoki oh what did naoki say on uh facebook hot
4687200	4693520	news the guy who is behind uh he's a music producer of ddr recently right the 2011s new
4693520	4699040	ddr has been announced for we its name is dance dance revolution 2 its title concept is back to
4699040	4704160	basic the originality of ddr is the part where you play with your feet we have concentrated on that
4704160	4710000	part and created the content so that it will pursue the gameplay of traditional ddr ps not
4710000	4713680	only for the casual fans but we consider this title will be something that could be enjoyed by
4713680	4718880	core ddr fans for a long period of time as well we are aiming for the release of the title for this
4718880	4723520	fall we will do our best to respond to your expectations so please look forward for it
4723520	4728560	very interesting so now keep saying the ddr 2 on the we is going back to basics it basically
4728560	4733360	without saying it none of this balance board and flinging the wiimote around gimmicky shit he's
4733360	4741440	saying it is back to feet because that's what makes back to the feet sure forget it is it a
4741440	4750240	new feature har where's my sad trombone i don't have a soundboard right now so dude you guys
4750240	4756720	harmonize that was awesome all right well some of the other stories i have just to go over quickly
4756720	4761520	some of these have developed in the pastio day or so uh that we didn't get got i feel like with
4761520	4766000	bobby's little like dust thing i was like god i learned more about that than i've read anywhere
4766000	4770000	or heard anything that was great but uh talking quickly about some of the other things that have
4770000	4773360	come up uh just in the past 24 hours a lot of it has to do with nintendo i don't know if you guys
4773360	4778320	heard about this and what you guys think make of this nintendo stock apparently went down five
4778320	4783120	percent yesterday after the wii u was revealed and my question you guys do you think that's a
4783120	4788480	big deal it was right after the keynote uh it went down to sixteen thousand nine hundred seventy yen
4788480	4794880	that's roughly 212 dollars but that is down five percent a low that the company has not seen since
4794880	4802240	before the launch of the original wii is this damning for them or is this eh whatever i think
4802240	4808560	is people being fickle and then you know not thinking about it so but but if i'm not mistaken
4808560	4812880	most of the gamers i'm seeing posting on twitter i mean no offense guys but i don't think it's the
4812880	4817520	same people that are that are are following the uh japanese stock exchange or having a lot of
4817520	4822080	impact on that or even know what stock is apart from chicken now hold on hold on i won't go that
4822080	4826240	far i'm sure people have investments in things but it's a knee-jerk reaction you know the the
4826240	4833120	stockholders gauged what they thought the public reaction was it wasn't like oh my god it's the
4833120	4837920	second coming nintendo quick take our money except for a few people who were like take our money
4838960	4846080	i wasn't like that but i'll buy one so it dipped it's five percent i mean that's a significant drop
4846080	4852880	but over the next you know what year and a half two years demand will build nintendo will make
4852880	4856560	it happen they'll announce a price i think right now everyone's worried that this thing has to be
4856560	4861600	expensive they'll announce a price it'll be reasonable they'll sell a hajillion of them
4861600	4866880	nintendo stock will be a hundred gazillion dollars and everything will be fine for nintendo and more
4866880	4871280	fictional amounts well you know uh one thing that i did read about price is that even though
4871280	4875680	nintendo has not said anything i guess there's been hints from things like you know conversations
4875680	4882160	with executives indirect it will not be out for 250 oh no so we're looking at least probably
4882160	4888000	299 for this thing if not maybe even jumping up 349 or something well with all the competition
4888000	4897360	you know out there at what is it sub 200 now for a 360 oh yeah and and 200 bucks for the top end
4897360	4906880	360 or ps3 you gotta wonder how far nintendo can push that without seeing the uh the competition
4906880	4911920	gets some some bump from it uh now speaking of stock and i wanted to mention this but i'll let
4911920	4919040	the chatters say it because uh they said it too chat.org.com zappy says stocks fluctuate not a big
4919040	4924320	deal apple went down too after worldwide developer conference that's that's the first thing in my mind
4924320	4929360	is that well don't these things usually dip after apple press conferences and especially when all
4929360	4933600	the stuff happened with the antenna you know and their little apology press conference they did
4933600	4938160	with that i'm sure stock dips for them a lot too but they they're apple and they're still doing
4938800	4943280	just fine all these years later yeah they're making a couple bucks just a couple bucks not
4943280	4947600	doing too bad now several people in chat have mentioned this and uh black wolf's now saying
4947600	4951280	he's in chat now kind of cooling off with the listeners they're talking to them uh did you
4951280	4955600	guys cover that nintendo announced that they were ditching friend codes i had not heard that until
4955600	4959280	i walked into studio somebody posted it in chat earlier but apparently nintendo will be ditching
4959280	4968000	friend codes for the wii u good finally applause good job that's one way to get the hardcore gamer
4968000	4974160	base back that's smart i wonder if they've said much more about online let me look tiger claws
4974160	4987280	giving us a little link here so we can take a peek let's see i'm going right now to this story
4987280	4993600	at mtv multiplayer blog because nintendo or mtv is all about the video games i know what's that
4993600	4998000	about actually i hear i don't read a whole lot of these big blogs but i hear the mtv ones pretty
4998000	5002320	good i just i don't have time there's the knees in action well yeah that's the whole super mario
5002320	5009040	brothers me yeah they were talking about i think it's cute let's see um on hand at e3 ubisoft
5009040	5014560	producer adrian blunt according to him the day of friend codes are gone demonstrating ghost recon
5014560	5022800	online for the wii u um i asked him equivalent to a gamer tag on xbox live yeah exactly he said uh
5023680	5027520	what else is there there's a few things on that the first is the ability for individuals to make
5027520	5032240	accounts rather than a machine having an account each individual user has an account so
5032240	5038400	that's an account uh he continued saying also the ability to easily find friends rather than using
5038400	5042720	friend codes which we've had in the past we're able to connect players in a much easier way
5042720	5047360	which allows us to have a community that's playing together in the game blunt wasn't willing to get
5047360	5051200	more specific about the online functionality you know what that sounds like to me remember a couple
5051200	5056240	weeks ago on the show we were speculating that the system tied into facebook somehow i don't
5056240	5063120	like exactly facebook but i bet you anything this whole like find your friends online is going to be
5063120	5068480	some type of maybe that's where the nintendo stream comes in folks maybe the nintendo stream
5068480	5074720	is the online component and the stream is so and so has been playing super mario we and so and so
5074720	5079440	just got caught and catch me i see dan laughing over there you think i'm full of it or oh no no i
5079440	5083120	was laughing about the fact that nintendo has products called the we and the stream
5083120	5087520	but now now that i think about it hearing that i'm like oh the nintendo stream that would make
5087520	5092880	perfect sense it's like you know funny it's what aol aol calls it the live stream right there um
5092880	5099040	updates and stuff yeah yeah so now you can make a stream which i don't use of course i'm i'm
5099040	5103280	obviously the nintendo stream thing was like total fanboy wank speculation i don't think there was a
5103280	5109040	lot to back that up but i'm just having fun with the what ifs but i i still think the facebook
5109040	5114960	concept of nintendo record i i got mildly curious and there are already a full page of search
5114960	5122160	results for weu fan pages uh tiger claw in our chat says i bet the gamer tag thing nintendo
5122160	5127520	has coming is tied to your club nintendo account your club nintendo account has a username that's
5127520	5134080	definitely possible um sure why not why not you have a database you own nintendo hardware there
5134080	5142080	you go well that sucks because i didn't get the name i wanted then bitches and frisbee says oh
5142080	5147840	shit more facebook like crap you know it's one of those things that could be done very well or very
5147840	5152720	crappy i mean how vague is that but seriously like i hear facebook i don't necessarily think that has
5152720	5157680	to be crap because i think a lot of us think of facebook crap as my feed filling up with come play
5157680	5162880	farm bill with me and you know and you can hide that crap and so and so filled out a survey and
5162880	5167840	said something about you hide yeah exactly hide no i do that too but it's just frustrating that
5167840	5174000	bullshit shows up in the first place yeah but if nintendo were to somehow kind of contain all that
5174000	5178640	a little better might be interesting i'm ignoring all those fucking people anyway
5181120	5185440	again the phones are open if you do want to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype
5185440	5190320	is orange lounge radio um if we don't get any calls i'll kind of close quote unquote with this
5190320	5196800	story the weu reel that was showing off some of the third-party games this has been igniting the
5196800	5202960	internet today is apparently using 360 and playstation 3 footage and a lot of people are
5202960	5209600	going fail nintendo oh nintendo why didn't you tell people this is 360 ps3 you're be it you're
5209600	5217520	lyin nintendo and uh i'm kind of thinking is this really a big deal like i can't believe like i kind
5217520	5225280	of figured it was pc or 360 footage because i don't know the system's a year away i know right
5225280	5230080	but they've got the licenses for it they've and keep in mind for all the third-party stuff it's
5230080	5235600	probably what they've been provided by the developers absolutely right absolutely right
5235600	5240240	and i bet a lot of these things were a lot of these deals were probably sealed a month a month
5240240	5246000	two months ago very short time yeah these games are concepts still i and i can tell you this just
5246000	5252080	okay and this is from designer when you're working for a client and you say okay well you
5252080	5256560	want your want me to advertise this product for you i need some of your images they will send you
5256560	5262640	what they have of the item they don't care how big it is they don't care what it originally was on
5262640	5268240	they're just sending you pictures of the item what you know their pr has approved so
5268240	5274640	you get you know you get what they give you whatever you're nintendo how stupid can you be
5275600	5281360	seriously it's i know exactly what you're saying i remember back in like the genesis days and the
5281360	5285760	atari days where they'd show a screenshot of a game and it'd be for all these systems and you
5285760	5290560	know it was the the screenshot of the best looking version but nintendo's out there to make a
5290560	5296320	statement nintendo's out there to say this is our system and this is what it could do okay fine do
5296320	5302960	what you got to do put the put the code on your pc mock-up of of the wii u and play the game and
5302960	5309520	hope that it runs and if it runs great put it on your video don't throw these pictures out into the
5309520	5315680	world and be like this is what our system will do and then like a day later be like oh by the way
5315680	5323360	yeah that that's that's the competition system no no at least don't admit it lie you're nintendo
5323360	5327840	you've lied before dungeon buster says they're placeholders to give the crowd an impression of
5327840	5333600	what it could do right exactly i understand that i have a problem with that you have a problem with
5333600	5340480	everything no i don't i'm not mad i have a problem with you yes of course you do i it it wasn't i
5340480	5345760	mean the smarter thing to do would have been to put in super tiny print in the bottom corner like
5345760	5353360	conceptual video based on existing game footage or something you know something just to cover their
5353360	5356640	ass whatever but they didn't do that they put those pictures out there they put the pictures
5356640	5361040	especially you know the one the one game in there that really got a pop was when ninja guy den showed
5361040	5366480	up right and everybody was like oh fuck it's ninja guy den and it's on the wii u and it looks really
5366480	5371840	really cool yeah you should have known that was the ps3 version of the 360 version kids the one
5371840	5377520	that kind of left me like okay maybe it wasn't smart to do that was the ghost recon where they
5377520	5382000	were showing like the scope and it gave you that impression that somebody was using their little
5382000	5387120	wii u controller as the scope like it just that's what it looked like to me but it was off in the
5387120	5394160	360 version of the ps3 version but if it's true about the guts of this machine it's gonna be
5394160	5399520	basically a 360 with some extra little frills maybe a boost in the ram a boost in the shading
5399520	5404960	graphical components of it and so forth i mean nintendo's going all in that their system has to
5404960	5411920	be at least as good as the 360 or the ps3 systems that have existed for five years now so i think
5411920	5416640	it's safe to say their system will be graphically capable of more than that absolutely it's going
5416640	5421680	to at least be this level of graphics this generation and that is why they showed they did
5421680	5427840	show that little you know for what it's worth that little random ass asian flower face
5427840	5434560	asian flower flying in the bird into the the the pool and everybody went shit what is that looks
5435200	5440640	really good that was the wii u that doesn't exist anywhere else well that was the wii u's
5440640	5447360	development system right so you know is is a high spec pc so and if and if i see okay well that's
5447360	5452240	capable then i'm sure they can pull off the 360 ps3 back in the day when the when the playstation
5452240	5458400	demo disc was out and it had all the ducks and you know all over the water and that t-rex and
5458400	5462560	the t-rex and when everyone's like oh wow that's neat how many games did we get that really look
5462560	5467760	like that until the end of the playstation's life true well right it's just that kind of thing you
5467760	5473600	know it's it's all it's so early people are people are obsessing over the tiniest detail of a system
5473600	5478560	that's a year and a half away and will change and will not be the same when it comes out it'll be
5478560	5483760	better it'll be better than the stuff that's out there now well it can't not be because you cannot
5483760	5490880	buy graphical components that are as weak as the stuff that's in the ps3 and the 360 now it doesn't
5490880	5496960	exist they're gonna be better they're not gonna be next generation better they're going to be peak
5496960	5503680	of this generation better that's how nintendo rolls it's a bridge i didn't you know this whole
5503680	5510400	like generation to generation nintendo has basically said with this that they they're
5510400	5514800	not following that rule they're just following what the markets want or what have you
5517680	5525760	what was that uh from the chat room colibri for yeah that was me that was jamie um i i kind of
5525760	5531600	though one of the fears that i have is that it's gonna pull a dreamcast that since it's coming out
5531600	5536480	well before other systems of uh of this nature
5539200	5544160	do you think that it might actually end up shooting itself in the foot no because it's
5544160	5549840	nintendo and sega only ever really had sonic you know i mean and i'm saying like as far as like
5550400	5554160	catching and getting people and drawing them in and so forth i mean if nintendo's launching with
5554160	5558400	the smash brothers game they got nothing to worry about nintendo's not launching with the smash
5558400	5566480	brothers game it won't be out until that system's uh first holiday season interesting which will be
5566480	5569520	the season i think the only system that ever launched with the smash brothers game at least
5569520	5574880	close to launched was the cube right which by the way we found out today you won't be playing that
5574880	5579600	on the wii u because the wii u has taken out the game cube compatibility that's right i you know
5579600	5583120	what we've got a game cube don't care i know i'm kind of like that i'm not too surprised about
5583120	5587680	that because nintendo usually doesn't do backwards compatible two generations back it's kind of like
5587680	5593360	your ds your ds 3ds or whatever won't play gameboy advance games you know they took that out way back
5593360	5600640	in the dsi right yeah right yeah so i mean that however our ps3 will play ps1 games
5602000	5607040	you couldn't play gameboy games on your ds even though the slot was the same size your ps3 will
5607040	5614800	play atari 2600 games it's not even the same company it's amazing all right well i guess
5614800	5618560	everybody's being shy tonight we're not getting any calls that's okay what's up with that people

5793440	5800080	about their presser we kind of came to agreement that nintendo is that abusive girlfriend that you
5800080	5805920	always take back just thinking that things are going to be different the next time around there
5805920	5811200	is genuine concern in the chat room what will happen to black luigi he will be replaced by
5811200	5817280	shadow the hedgehog oh my god that's trading down really really really far
5819920	5826240	and i'm a sega fan my shadow really at least be knuckles
5826240	5833040	dan if it's any consideration is this a black thing when i walk into a block brother stay
5833040	5839520	black let him talk look dan if it makes you feel any better joe vidya will kick my ass
5839520	5845440	when she sees me dressed as shadow because she is not a shadow fangirl well she's more of a sonic
5845440	5851040	and tails fangirl joe vidya three more times for the rest of us all right uh i i gotta talk more
5851040	5855840	about why why this nintendo hatred what about when i i have to admit i loved it when reggie
5855840	5863120	came out and we've said this before and said gamers want this and they want this so whatever
5863120	5873280	you guys are confusing but here i don't know what gamers he's listening to but i didn't ask for a a
5873280	5879840	six-inch android tablet with a hacked classic controller on each side i had one of those
5879840	5885120	i just want one of those as a system you don't want to put it on your table and play othello
5886480	5894000	no that would be awesome like ben heck to make it what about though the fact though rama that
5894000	5899520	we are still a year away i mean the reason why i'm i'm still kind of like it was all right their
5899520	5904560	presentation was fine i'm not like super excited about it i'm gonna buy one anyway because i'm a
5904560	5910080	consumer whore and i buy them all and help but i'm like we're not really gonna see this system
5910080	5916240	for another year maybe by then they'll actually get their shit together so are you basically
5916240	5924240	giving your abusive girlfriend a year to shape up or ship out i suppose so but it's okay because
5924240	5932160	i will be i will be marrying its younger sister the 3ds ah so the 3ds you were a fan of all the
5932160	5939040	stuff you saw there okay yes uh mario kart yes even i am a mario kart whore like nobody else's
5939040	5945840	business that that's a given and i missed super mario but i went back and watched a trailer for
5945840	5952640	it and i said this is the mario game i've been looking for a 3d platformer that plays like 2d
5952640	5957440	but it's three this is what i wanted right i will sit here and play that i'm not too fond it's
5957440	5965200	called super mario but hey whatever i think it might still be a working title so it seems so it
5965200	5970720	seems to me that you've got this uh relationship with the big sister but really you just want to
5970720	5978880	sleep with the little sister well well yeah that's why i have a ds okay wow all right
5978880	5986000	well rama any other closing thoughts on e3 before we let you go uh let's see then microsoft was a
5986000	5993520	bit of a snore sony had me with with the vita and i'll say this right now yes the vita with 3g
5993520	5998960	powered by at&t it's gonna be 299 but i'm telling you when it comes out you'll be able to get it
5998960	6007040	for 99.99 with a two-year contract mark my word that's not that's not how they sell ipads though
6007040	6013520	that's how they sell iphones ipads iphones netbooks with 3g hell it worked for the taco
6013520	6018880	didn't it well kind of yeah but we got ours for free i think this is a relevant question
6018880	6022640	rama since you are black luigi and we call you that just so people know we call you that because
6023200	6028880	whenever you you you cosplay and you're black and you you dress up as luigi you make your way
6028880	6034000	on camera no matter who's there and we always see you on tv oh it's black luigi there he is
6035040	6040000	that's why you have that name and so tiger klon chat says rama what do you think of luigi's
6040000	6044160	mansion too since you know it's a game starring luigi nintendo finally showing some luigi love
6044880	6051680	i'm all for it because you know i've always said this i've always said that
6051680	6057360	peach is nothing more than a than a whore because mario's always chasing after her to save her
6057360	6064960	she doesn't freak out when bowser kidnaps her you know happens three times a month i know and look
6064960	6070720	they're a coupe of kids we all know who the mother is you know we already know i feel like you have
6070720	6077920	designed this really weird sick mario rp world while really really fucking high
6078720	6084240	i actually i was so brett the time it was very loose and i said this to a friend of mine
6084240	6088400	and it broke him and all my other friends are like holy shit that actually makes sense
6088400	6096720	bowser you are the father all right anyway look luigi has a nice mansion
6096720	6100960	a nice car his girl is in check he's got the good life i mean really
6104400	6110240	but really luigi's mansion a 10 year old game coming back you're all for it yeah i actually
6110240	6113760	believe it or not i actually liked the first luigi's mansion i thought it was a fun game
6113760	6118560	hey i think it's a neat hey rama princess daisy don't want no scrub
6120320	6124080	dad she has an eyeball in the back of her head all right rama we're gonna let you go
6126160	6133040	she stays in the castle okay hey she also plays a mean round of tennis why do you think
6133040	6137920	why do you think luigi got on one knee and proposed rama i'm ending this conversation
6137920	6143040	right now have a good one stay black all right bye you know the daisy does have an eyeball in
6143040	6148640	the back of her head oh it was a graphic glitch but someone that was awesome still i like that
