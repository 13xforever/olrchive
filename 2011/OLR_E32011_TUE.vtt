00:00.000 --> 00:19.840
Tonight, June 7th, 2011, we kick off our live E3 coverage with press conference reactions

00:19.840 --> 00:31.800
and special correspondents Bobby Blackwolf and Miek LaTov in LA on the show floor.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.520
Hello my friends out there on the internet and happy E3 to you all.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.320
I know there's been a lot of news this week.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.360
Welcome to our special E3 coverage.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.000
We're going to be live tonight and tomorrow night.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
That's Tuesday and Wednesday, 7 o'clock Pacific.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Little different this week.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.680
We're on Ustream, checking out a new place to stream the show.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.440
To those of you that are brand new to Orange Lounge Radio, welcome.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.640
If you found this through Ustream or what have you or some of the other referrals, which

00:56.640 --> 00:59.440
we'll talk about in a little bit, welcome to our little show.

00:59.440 --> 01:05.000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice and boy, here's a lot of voices about what's

01:05.000 --> 01:11.160
been talked about from Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, to Lezarec, Stadia and Ubisoft, but there's

01:11.160 --> 01:14.560
just a lot, a lot of talk today and we're going to get right into it, but I need to

01:14.560 --> 01:16.300
introduce everybody on the panel.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.640
First off, my name is Rob Roberts, sometimes known as Sky, and I'll be joining you with

01:19.640 --> 01:20.680
my co-host.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.320
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.320
Meaty.

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
How are you?

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Meaty.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
Feeling fresh and meaty.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.320
Meaty.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.320
All right.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.200
And say hello to the one and only, and I'm so happy he can make it here tonight, Techmaster

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
Loki.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
Hi.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.560
We were a little worried that Techmaster Loki wouldn't be here tonight because of family

01:36.560 --> 01:38.760
commitments, but here he is.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.760
Screw the family.

01:39.760 --> 01:40.760
No, just kidding.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.760
I hope Nelly's not listening.

01:41.760 --> 01:42.760
No, no, no.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
All right, good.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.920
Welcome to you, and we're going to ask you about Nintendo in just a little bit.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.920
Also joining us, we've got other people joining us, we're going to have the one and only Bobby

01:50.920 --> 01:52.680
Black Wolf from the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.240
He usually does a show right before us on our normal live shows Sunday night.

01:57.240 --> 02:02.240
Of course, we're live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, and more

02:02.240 --> 02:05.200
information about all of that is at our website, orangesongsradio.com.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.680
Bobby Black Wolf is in LA at E3.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.840
He will be joining us momentarily to talk about it.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.880
He has played the Wii U.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.480
We're going to talk all about that in a little while.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.240
I want to introduce somebody else here in studio, though.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.240
Dan the Man is joining us.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.240
Hello.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.240
He's on the show tonight.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
What a pleasant surprise.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
How are you, Dan?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
I'm good.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
Awesome.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
So, E3.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.400
I wish I was there.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.880
We're going to get into all of the press conferences and so forth.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.000
Let me just start with this.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.960
Before I plug everything and do the usual plugs, let me... What is one word on your

02:37.960 --> 02:46.120
mind right now that if E3 right now can just boil down to one word, what is that word right

02:46.120 --> 02:47.120
now?

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
Dan?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
Underwhelming.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.120
Underwhelming.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
Loki?

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
Huh.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
All right.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.120
Dark Sakura.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
What?

02:55.120 --> 02:56.120
I'm going to say third party.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
That's two words.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
No.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
Cheater.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.120
All right.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
Fine.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
Third.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.120
That's my word.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.120
All right.

03:04.120 --> 03:10.240
I want to also plug our chat room.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.120
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.520
We will be taking your calls a little later in the show on our toll-free number as well

03:15.520 --> 03:18.120
as Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, but not just yet.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.700
We're going to get to that later in the show.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.220
If you want to join our chat room, please note we do not have a Ustream chat.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.320
We have an IRC chat room.

03:25.320 --> 03:31.120
More information is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, so please, by all means, pull up a chair,

03:31.120 --> 03:34.400
sit in the chat room, and join us there.

03:34.400 --> 03:38.560
Orange Right in the chat room, we'll start us off tonight, kind of all one word slammed

03:38.560 --> 03:42.920
together says, third party saving first party asses.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.200
I guess my runner up would be, seriously?

03:46.200 --> 03:48.160
Oh, that's a good one.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.720
Is it going to be all negative tonight?

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
Really?

03:50.720 --> 03:56.680
Because I swear to God, all I've been reading on Twitter is just cynicism, skepticism, negativity,

03:56.680 --> 04:00.760
and I'm like, this is why everybody hates gamers.

04:00.760 --> 04:06.760
There's not an ounce of positivity I'm seeing on Twitter, but I don't feel 100% negative.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.760
Are there things that I think should be done better?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.760
Sure.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.760
But is it all negative?

04:10.760 --> 04:11.760
I don't necessarily think so.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.760
But is anything mind-blowing?

04:12.760 --> 04:13.760
No.

04:13.760 --> 04:20.760
Yes, but probably not from any of the big five that we're going to talk about today.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.760
I'll leave it at that.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
All right.

04:23.760 --> 04:29.400
Anyhow, I also want to unplug us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter,

04:29.400 --> 04:32.920
twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Bobby Black Wolf, of course, he'll be joining us

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
in a little bit.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.440
We're teaming up tonight to do the coverage.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.560
He is also on Twitter, twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.040
And the reason why I plug that is that today he was pretty dominated at the Nintendo booth

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
all day.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.440
Well, he wasn't dominated at the Nintendo booth, maybe, but his day was dominated by

04:48.440 --> 04:51.960
the Nintendo booth because he was at the Wii U event today.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.560
But tomorrow he will be taking your orders.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.540
You will be dominating him on Twitter and he is going to be your man on the floor at

04:58.540 --> 05:00.720
twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

05:00.720 --> 05:05.800
And if you're like, hey, what freaking Konami games are there that weren't at the press

05:05.800 --> 05:09.960
conference or whatever, and he'll tweet you back and say, glee karaoke revolution with

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Rocky Horror.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
Yay.

05:11.960 --> 05:15.440
Reggie's bitch today, your bitch tomorrow.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.840
So twitter.com slash Bobby Black Wolf.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.840
I also want to say thank you to those of you guys that have retweeted, helped promote these

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
special shows.

05:21.840 --> 05:25.080
I know it's a little weird because we're not in our usual home, but you know, we had to

05:25.080 --> 05:27.920
kind of think fast and this all really came together last minute.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.240
So I want to thank everybody involved.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.720
I want to give a special shout out to video game outsiders who has a show usually live

05:33.720 --> 05:35.180
tonight at all games.

05:35.180 --> 05:38.840
They didn't end up doing one tonight because of personal reasons, but they send a tweet

05:38.840 --> 05:42.340
that was like, eh, go listen to OLR and I thought that was very nice of them to do.

05:42.340 --> 05:45.820
And so I wanted to give them a shout out and a thank you.

05:45.820 --> 05:48.380
It's going to be a night of varying opinions.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.380
It's going to be fun.

05:49.380 --> 05:52.400
So remember kids play nice and be respectful.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Let's jump into it.

05:53.400 --> 05:57.080
Microsoft, Microsoft press conference starts us off tonight.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.060
The Microsoft press conference, of course, was delivered Monday afternoon.

06:00.060 --> 06:05.680
I imagine most of you listening don't need, I'm sorry, well, East coast, Monday afternoon,

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
fine, Monday morning.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.020
Most of you listening don't need a recap of everything that was talked about, but let

06:10.020 --> 06:16.120
me remind you some of the highlights, halo, halo anniversary edition, halo four, neither

06:16.120 --> 06:19.980
of which interesting enough had connect shown.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.160
It was one of the only games.

06:21.160 --> 06:26.000
In fact, I think of that whole press conference that didn't have connect shown.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.380
Are there any excitement whatsoever about the new halo four or the halo anniversary

06:29.380 --> 06:30.380
edition?

06:30.380 --> 06:31.380
Nope.

06:31.380 --> 06:32.380
Did you hear it?

06:32.380 --> 06:33.780
I'm into it.

06:33.780 --> 06:34.780
I like halo.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.180
I'm stoked for more halo.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.740
I'm, I'm looking forward to a new halo as well.

06:38.740 --> 06:43.460
I mean, obviously the teaser was just that it was, it was literally a title announcement

06:43.460 --> 06:44.540
and nothing else.

06:44.540 --> 06:49.660
The only other little, little pickins to drop or to take from that is it's another trilogy.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.820
And I thought that was interesting that they're committing now to six halo games.

06:52.820 --> 06:56.060
I will say this, it did mess with my head.

06:56.060 --> 06:58.460
Not seeing the bungee logo before the halo trailers.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.460
Did it?

06:59.460 --> 07:00.460
Yeah.

07:00.460 --> 07:01.460
I was just like, Oh, it's halo.

07:01.460 --> 07:02.460
Oh yeah.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.860
There is no bungee making halo anymore.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.580
Oh, that's kind of sad.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.580
Yeah.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.700
It did seem like that trailer had a very different look to it as well.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.300
It just didn't have that bungee feel.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.300
Yeah.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.300
It didn't.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.300
It didn't have that big like, oh, that's okay.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.700
I think, you know?

07:15.700 --> 07:16.700
Yeah.

07:16.700 --> 07:17.700
That's true.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.980
Bungee kind of ran, ran their course, I guess, but I don't even say they ran their course,

07:20.980 --> 07:25.860
but it's, it's, you know, it's just like, okay, there were the Batman movies from the

07:25.860 --> 07:27.420
eighties and nineties and stuff.

07:27.420 --> 07:31.420
And then there's, you know, the new Batman series and you know, both.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.420
Okay.

07:32.420 --> 07:36.740
Well the beginning of one was good and you know, the other one is also good, but it's

07:36.740 --> 07:40.860
refreshing, I guess, to have like a new style of gameplay.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.020
Yeah.

07:42.020 --> 07:47.020
But it's, it's hard to deny the fact that, you know, it's bungee's, bungee's franchise

07:47.020 --> 07:48.020
was bungee's.

07:48.020 --> 07:52.860
It's Microsoft's franchise now, but, and it's weird that it won't have their stamp on it

07:52.860 --> 07:57.740
unless the new developers are just sick copycats, which is about the best I could hope for.

07:57.740 --> 08:00.820
Let me jump over to anniversary collection for a minute.

08:00.820 --> 08:04.500
Huge speculation on the internet before that it was going to be very connect heavy.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.020
In fact, I believe there was a domain, halo connect.com or something.

08:08.020 --> 08:11.260
Now granted, there could be more announcements between now and when the game actually comes

08:11.260 --> 08:15.820
out, but unlike most of the other stuff that Microsoft was pushing at E3, wasn't seeing

08:15.820 --> 08:17.980
connect in this halo game.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.820
Do you think they changed their mind?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.260
Do you think this is yet to come?

08:21.260 --> 08:25.860
No, it's because that would have required them to do some extra work because basically

08:25.860 --> 08:27.380
they're just porting the asset.

08:27.380 --> 08:32.080
They're upgrading the assets slightly and they're porting it over to the reach engines.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.460
So it would have required them to rebuild a portion of the engine to get it and oh,

08:36.460 --> 08:39.220
and adjusting the physics so that it's like halo one.

08:39.220 --> 08:43.900
But um, that's what it would have required extra work for them to do that.

08:43.900 --> 08:44.900
Maybe halo four.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.380
Yeah, you can bet your ass halo four will use connect.

08:48.380 --> 08:53.100
Did you find that little footnote that came out after the press conference about that

08:53.100 --> 08:56.460
the multiplayer is all just multiplayer maps for halo reach.

08:56.460 --> 09:01.300
It is not actually a part of the halo anniversary collection or whatever anniversary.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.300
It is.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.300
No, I had read this thing online.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.300
Here's how it works.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
Okay.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.300
Now that can't be right.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.300
Please, please share me.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
Okay.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.300
It's very similar to ODST.

09:10.300 --> 09:16.380
You have one disc that has the single player campaign on it and of course the co-op for

09:16.380 --> 09:17.380
that.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.620
Then you have also the multiplayer disc.

09:19.620 --> 09:27.580
Now the whole multiplayer disc is the full halo reach multiplayer portion, I guess.

09:27.580 --> 09:33.500
And the maps do exist on the reach servers, but in it, since it's also in the reach engine,

09:33.500 --> 09:37.940
that's what's going on is these maps are for reach, but you can play against other people

09:37.940 --> 09:40.540
that also have reach, I believe as well.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.540
Interesting.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.140
Well, I guess that's kind of cool if it kind of bridges that.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.580
Yeah, because ODST is the same thing they did theirs.

09:46.580 --> 09:50.740
It was halo three airplane on.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.900
So it's not, it's not bad.

09:52.900 --> 09:56.100
It's, it's, and considering the fact that it's also going to be a budget price game

09:56.100 --> 09:58.620
too, it's going to be a $40 game when it comes out.

09:58.620 --> 10:02.700
Just because they know they can't make a better multiplayer engine than bungee did.

10:02.700 --> 10:07.420
Let's talk connect for a little bit because obviously connect dominated a lot of Microsoft's

10:07.420 --> 10:10.700
press conference and it's taken a lot of flack on the internet because of that.

10:10.700 --> 10:14.820
I noticed when I was watching Twitter, um, over the press conference, there's a lot of

10:14.820 --> 10:20.800
people hating on Microsoft right now because their conference was very connect heavy and

10:20.800 --> 10:24.900
it didn't seem to address the hardcore gamer, which is funny because that's the battle Nintendo's

10:24.900 --> 10:26.140
been fighting for years.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.140
Bullshit.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.140
I'm sorry.

10:28.140 --> 10:32.100
Well, I have the best stage and that's important.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.580
Hey, it was important.

10:33.580 --> 10:37.100
I mean, we're going to get into it later on, but they're, they're not the only ones that,

10:37.100 --> 10:38.100
you know, okay.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.220
Other than, you know, PlayStation, I guess, uh, they're not the only ones that really

10:42.220 --> 10:45.340
focus on their, their motion gaming stuff.

10:45.340 --> 10:49.180
Um, and yeah, what they showed, I think it's a little bit of everything.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.180
Yeah.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.460
It's some stuff for the hardcore players and he had some stuff that's like, well, this

10:52.460 --> 10:59.420
shit's on, you know, could have been on the Wii or, you know, it's very kidsy, I guess.

10:59.420 --> 11:03.300
Let me ask a question of our chat room at chat.orangelauncherator.com again, uh, for

11:03.300 --> 11:06.540
those that are joining us for the first time because of the Ustream connection here, our

11:06.540 --> 11:10.300
normal chat room is at chat.orangelauncherator.com, uh, answer this for me.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.300
Be honest.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.240
Is there a connect title you want to try?

11:13.240 --> 11:16.340
And I want to talk about some of those connect titles that were announced at the show.

11:16.340 --> 11:19.980
And I want to go to dark soccer for a minute because I know you must've perked up when

11:19.980 --> 11:22.740
you heard about the Disneyland connect game.

11:22.740 --> 11:24.580
Did you hear about the Disneyland connect game?

11:24.580 --> 11:25.940
No, I didn't actually.

11:25.940 --> 11:26.940
Yes.

11:26.940 --> 11:29.780
There's this whole, I relied on somebody to fill me in.

11:29.780 --> 11:32.060
Obviously Dan didn't fill her in on the Disneyland connect.

11:32.060 --> 11:33.060
You didn't ask.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.060
All right.

11:34.060 --> 11:39.360
So there's this whole Disneyland connect game going on where they really harped on.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.580
You're going to get to be in Disneyland and they actually showed, you know, like you're

11:43.580 --> 11:46.620
going through down main street and so forth.

11:46.620 --> 11:51.360
But then as you walk up to a ride, like Peter Pan's adventure, they had these little overacting

11:51.360 --> 11:52.860
kids on stage demonstrating it.

11:52.860 --> 11:53.860
It was just mini games.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.780
And you know what it made me think of, I don't know if you guys remember an old eight bit

11:56.780 --> 11:59.940
game by Capcom years and years ago called adventures in the magic kingdom.

11:59.940 --> 12:00.940
Yes.

12:00.940 --> 12:01.940
It was an old ass NES game.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.520
It was the same thing.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.820
Do you know what this game is?

12:04.820 --> 12:05.820
What?

12:05.820 --> 12:07.040
It's another connected ventures game.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.460
It's seriously connect Disneyland adventures, connect adventures.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.460
It's all it is.

12:12.460 --> 12:16.880
That's why you're flying through stuff and collecting coins or whatever, except it's

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
in Disneyland.

12:17.880 --> 12:18.880
That's all.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.880
Disney hub looked cool.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.660
No mini games looked like fun.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.060
That's exactly where I'm at.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.060
Exactly.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.060
Exactly.

12:25.060 --> 12:29.740
It's fine because it's, it looks fun, but you know, let me put it this way though.

12:29.740 --> 12:34.120
They seriously need to tone down the acting for the people that they have on stage.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.300
It was, it was to the point where it's distracting and I mean, I understand you want to make

12:38.300 --> 12:43.180
it look fun and stuff like that, but Oh my God, just any idea how many Red Bulls those

12:43.180 --> 12:47.580
kids drank, they worked their little hearts off and they're probably dead right now.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.820
They burned out showing you how fun that game was.

12:50.820 --> 12:52.340
I want to know what this horror is.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.340
All right.

12:53.340 --> 12:57.240
Dark soccer's pointing at Minecraft on the connect, which was a, a little, a little thing

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
that was dropped.

12:58.240 --> 13:04.000
And there are some people that are supporting the Minecraft game guru, Minecraft, maybe

13:04.000 --> 13:05.500
Kai's Judo Minecraft.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
I want to try.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.880
So there is some love for Minecraft.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.540
Now we've talked on orange on trade before.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.980
I don't think anybody here in the room got Minecraft quote unquote.

13:15.980 --> 13:16.980
Like I tried it.

13:16.980 --> 13:19.300
I get it, but I just don't want to play it.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.300
Yeah.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.300
Yeah.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.300
I think that's where I'm at.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.300
I'm like, I get it.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.300
And I understand why people love it.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.300
That being said, it's not for me.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.140
I don't have that much free time in my day to play something like that.

13:29.140 --> 13:32.620
But again, what I thought was interesting about the follow-up and what came out after

13:32.620 --> 13:37.420
the press event is that the, obviously the Minecraft was pretty much independently developed.

13:37.420 --> 13:43.420
I think by one guy or just one very small studio, uh, they are not doing this 360 version.

13:43.420 --> 13:47.920
They have basically, I don't know, contracted out or sold the license for somebody else

13:47.920 --> 13:50.100
to develop, which makes sense.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.700
Minecraft's at an all time high right now.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.900
There's iPhone things you're going to see and everything else is going to be everywhere.

13:55.900 --> 14:00.820
You know, I don't have a problem necessarily with being on 360 and it looked fun and I

14:00.820 --> 14:02.300
probably would like Minecraft.

14:02.300 --> 14:07.180
Like I said, if I existed in a world that had 48 hour days, but I don't.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.240
So I unfortunately don't have time to play something like that.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.940
We have some more feedback in our chat room on the Disney game, Disneyland adventures

14:14.940 --> 14:16.360
for the kinetic tiger claw.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.780
When they showed that Disneyland game, I was reminded of that universal studios game on

14:19.780 --> 14:20.780
the game cube.

14:20.780 --> 14:21.780
I remember that game.

14:21.780 --> 14:22.780
Hmm.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.780
Actually, I don't.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.980
So that doesn't bode well for this game.

14:24.980 --> 14:25.980
It was bad.

14:25.980 --> 14:26.980
What was it?

14:26.980 --> 14:27.980
I don't even remember it.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.900
It was a bunch of universal studios, mini games that was all hosted by woody woodpecker.

14:31.900 --> 14:33.540
There was like a back to the future game.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.300
So I was like, I got to see, this has got back to the future in it.

14:36.300 --> 14:39.220
Was that the best talent they could get was woody woodpecker?

14:39.220 --> 14:43.100
Universal's kind of cartoon mascot was woody woodpecker.

14:43.100 --> 14:47.340
That would be like, okay, we've got a Disneyland game coming out, but unfortunately all the

14:47.340 --> 14:51.420
Disneyland characters, like 98% of them were too expensive to license.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.380
So we got Herbie, the love bug to be in the game.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.380
We decided to do Knott's Berry Farm.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.380
It's Disney.

14:56.380 --> 14:57.380
That's it.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.500
We couldn't get Minnie Mouse, Mickey Mouse.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.580
Connect Knott's Berry Farm adventures.

15:04.580 --> 15:08.420
At least they'd have good chicken.

15:08.420 --> 15:13.460
Savalas in the charm says, uh, connect Disney is for families in Nebraska who are not able

15:13.460 --> 15:15.820
to get to a Disney amusement park.

15:15.820 --> 15:18.540
I see it as more like the thing to just shut the kids up.

15:18.540 --> 15:19.540
No, no.

15:19.540 --> 15:24.660
I'm sure that my store, Nebraska Furniture Mart will sell plenty of those, but, uh, no,

15:24.660 --> 15:29.580
I think what it is is it's another connected, you know, adventurous type game and you know

15:29.580 --> 15:30.580
what?

15:30.580 --> 15:35.100
It will sell like crazy because it looks fun and it's better than some of the other mini

15:35.100 --> 15:37.220
game crap that's out there for it.

15:37.220 --> 15:41.500
And Disney people will buy it just because apparently it's going to promise that you

15:41.500 --> 15:44.540
can wander around Disneyland on the connect.

15:44.540 --> 15:48.140
Blackness in our chat room says, I really do hope somebody hacks the Disneyland connect

15:48.140 --> 15:50.900
assets and makes a grand theft auto style port.

15:50.900 --> 15:51.900
Come on now.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.400
Let the kids have something.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.860
Who hasn't made grand theft auto and uh, and GTA yet.

15:56.860 --> 15:57.860
Come on, Matt.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.140
Did you do that or who hasn't made Disney a grand theft auto yet?

16:01.140 --> 16:03.100
Well, I guess the kids do have something.

16:03.100 --> 16:07.580
Did you see the Sesame street game that they spent some time demoing and, and collectively

16:07.580 --> 16:11.960
Twitter was rolling their eyes, but I was like, dude, I wish they had the Sesame street

16:11.960 --> 16:13.740
game when I was six.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.740
I hate fucking Elmo.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.740
Maybe with less Elmo.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.100
If it had like cookie monster and big bird in it, I'd be like, this game is going to

16:20.100 --> 16:21.100
be tight.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.740
If Mr. Hooper was still alive, I'm going to play it.

16:23.740 --> 16:29.380
If Linda, the deaf lady was teaching me how to sign, dude, Linda, the deaf lady was hot.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.620
There you go.

16:32.620 --> 16:36.180
Uh, black Wolf is in our chat room right now talking to the chatters.

16:36.180 --> 16:40.460
They're saying I had Sesame street games on my Intellivision word fun and electric company

16:40.460 --> 16:41.460
math fun.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.660
Dude, the electric company game was amazing.

16:44.660 --> 16:48.940
I want to know more about this whole live streaming TV thing they were talking about.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.580
Was I the only one that didn't really get it?

16:50.580 --> 16:51.640
Like it, I don't get it.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.540
It flowed really weird in their presser for me.

16:54.540 --> 16:55.620
They were watching castle.

16:55.620 --> 16:56.620
Yeah.

16:56.620 --> 16:57.620
They're watching castle.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.460
Apparently I caught a little ad in the sidebar and I don't know if it was just a marketing

17:01.460 --> 17:04.340
placeholder or whatever, but it said the connect show.

17:04.340 --> 17:07.740
And that made me think, is Microsoft producing their own content for this too?

17:07.740 --> 17:08.940
Or was that just a placeholder?

17:08.940 --> 17:12.540
I think it's a placeholder, but here's the thing is it's basically going to be content

17:12.540 --> 17:17.300
that you say, for example, like, you know, I have Comcast, so it's going to be Comcast

17:17.300 --> 17:18.300
programming.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.300
Great.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.580
I can just turn the TV on and watch TV.

17:23.580 --> 17:25.980
You know, I don't need to watch TV through my 360.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.620
My 360 act as a TiVo because if so, I could actually kind of use that.

17:29.620 --> 17:34.660
Well, what it's doing is you guys know what like the review is like those set top boxes

17:34.660 --> 17:36.140
that you just plug into your TV.

17:36.140 --> 17:41.420
And instead of actually having their own content, what they do is they look around the net for

17:41.420 --> 17:45.260
content kind of like windows media center will do, and then let you play it.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.460
It's just going to be a service like that for the Xbox.

17:47.460 --> 17:51.740
And that kind of ties into the other announcements about the partnerships with YouTube finally

17:51.740 --> 17:52.740
coming to Xbox.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.540
I think a lot of us are going, okay, it's about time.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.540
We got a decent YouTube player.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.540
That'd be pretty cool.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.540
That is going to be pretty cool.

17:57.540 --> 18:01.940
And then this whole Xbox Bing thing where I guess you can go Xbox, Harry Potter, and

18:01.940 --> 18:04.860
it'll show you all the games, all the CDs.

18:04.860 --> 18:07.300
So I mean, will it, will it like search the internet too?

18:07.300 --> 18:08.300
I mean, do we have a legit?

18:08.300 --> 18:11.700
No, it won't search the internet because it doesn't have a fucking web browser in it.

18:11.700 --> 18:19.040
Will connect finally respond to me going Xbox, Bing, gay porn.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.240
It'll probably look up my little pony.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.420
It'll come back with some indie gay.

18:23.420 --> 18:32.580
I'll come back with my little Care Bears, the Smurfs, Lady Gaga on HBO.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.980
I hate the new interface.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.980
It was weird.

18:37.980 --> 18:41.380
It took me a minute to figure out that they were actually demoing a new interface.

18:41.380 --> 18:43.560
Like I, I mean, I'm not stupid.

18:43.560 --> 18:48.440
I saw that it was a new interface, but I thought it was kind of like a spinoff for the TV thing.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.580
Like like the connect thing is, is a little separate thing.

18:51.580 --> 18:58.720
I didn't think I was looking at a whole new dashboard and I was kind of like, okay.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.540
It looked like the crossbar a little bit.

19:00.540 --> 19:06.020
No, it's, it's modeled after windows seven phone stuff and then also windows eight is

19:06.020 --> 19:08.220
supposed to be very similar to that.

19:08.220 --> 19:12.260
Good for them to do that kind of, first off, you know, windows eight, you know, that shit

19:12.260 --> 19:13.260
is optional.

19:13.260 --> 19:14.340
It's like the fucking media center.

19:14.340 --> 19:17.340
You don't have to use media center if you don't want to.

19:17.340 --> 19:21.180
However, on the Xbox 360, it's not fucking optional.

19:21.180 --> 19:26.300
I I'm sorry, hitting the guide button again to get my fucking blades back is not fucking

19:26.300 --> 19:27.300
optional.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.300
That is, I want the blades.

19:28.300 --> 19:33.420
I mean, it's, you know what, here's the, here's a thought and I know this is crazy and out

19:33.420 --> 19:38.780
there, but how about we have themes we can download where we can say, Hey, you know what?

19:38.780 --> 19:39.780
I like the blades.

19:39.780 --> 19:40.780
I'm going to keep it on the blades.

19:40.780 --> 19:45.220
Hey, I know I want to keep it on this, you know, the new Xbox experience.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.640
All this is now is, Hey, look at this.

19:47.640 --> 19:48.640
What game am I playing?

19:48.640 --> 19:51.860
Is that a tiny little box in the corner and all these ads are everywhere else.

19:51.860 --> 19:56.040
Uh, technus in our chat room at chat.org.com says, I think it's great.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.760
They added complete voice search.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.580
It's pretty hard and quite pathetic that in the current dashboard it's hard to find shit.

20:01.580 --> 20:02.580
I agree.

20:02.580 --> 20:03.580
That's kind of my problem.

20:03.580 --> 20:08.020
You know, connect fun labs was on the thing like right after the press conference.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.700
You had to dig to find it.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
No you didn't.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.700
You should.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.700
I, it was not on the main bar.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.700
You had to go to the E3 coverage.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.700
You didn't look hard enough.

20:14.700 --> 20:15.700
Then you go to connect.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.700
No, no, no.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.700
It was on mine.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.700
It did not come right up.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.700
All right.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
It was on the community page.

20:20.700 --> 20:21.700
The community bar that was right there.

20:21.700 --> 20:25.540
It was like one of the first, you know, few, I should have thought to look in community.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.540
God damn it.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.540
It was right there.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.540
Yeah.

20:28.540 --> 20:32.260
Instead of having to dig, well, when it's like the thing you just announced today, shouldn't

20:32.260 --> 20:33.900
it be like on the main bar?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.260
I mean, I don't know.

20:35.260 --> 20:39.340
It is on one of the main bars, isn't community basically where it starts?

20:39.340 --> 20:42.660
I thought it was, yeah, pretty much whatever.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.660
All right.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.820
Uh, moving on to some other announcements.

20:45.820 --> 20:48.900
Uh, some of the nonconnect things at the top were actually pretty cool.

20:48.900 --> 20:53.220
Uh, there was the modern warfare three demo that they demoed and you know, I'm not into

20:53.220 --> 20:56.700
those games, but I was kind of looking at the footage going, oh, that's really pretty.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.060
That's, that's pretty cool.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.420
If I could actually do that when I play the game, as opposed to just running into walls

21:01.420 --> 21:03.080
constantly and shooting my friends.

21:03.080 --> 21:08.860
You mean there's a modern army game where I can shoot things and shit explodes?

21:08.860 --> 21:11.260
That's revolutionary and brand new.

21:11.260 --> 21:14.380
I have to admit, I thought it was pretty cool when they were doing that whole little getaway

21:14.380 --> 21:15.380
in the raft.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.500
I was like, it's like super army cart.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.820
They had, they had a raft at the end of the last game.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.860
Oh, shows you how much I play those games.

21:21.860 --> 21:22.860
Modern warfare.

21:22.860 --> 21:24.940
And the truth is I like modern warfare.

21:24.940 --> 21:27.140
All right.

21:27.140 --> 21:28.800
And then, and I love this.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.820
The Tomb Raider demo was hot.

21:30.820 --> 21:35.780
I thought that that was like my favorite thing was neat, but once again, you know, I've already,

21:35.780 --> 21:40.620
I've kind of, you know, set that franchise aside for, well actually since the first Tomb

21:40.620 --> 21:42.620
Raider, I just never got into Tomb Raider.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.340
Well, see the thing about this, but it looks cool.

21:44.340 --> 21:45.340
Yeah.

21:45.340 --> 21:49.900
The thing about this new Tomb Raider is that it didn't look at all like the old ones.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.620
Cause it didn't look like a reboot at all.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.140
I know it looks like uncharted

21:53.140 --> 22:01.980
Maybe that's why they have adventure sense, which is like saying, Hey, you can't figure

22:01.980 --> 22:03.300
out the puzzle.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.620
We'll do it for you.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.420
I'm going to need Tomb Raider for idiots.

22:07.420 --> 22:11.420
Well, I, I, what I loved about it though is that there was scenes very reminiscent of

22:11.420 --> 22:15.400
that movie, the descent, which is like one of the few movies ever to legit scare the

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
shit out of me.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.580
So I can kind of see where the survival horror thing is coming from for Tomb Raider.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.700
Cause some of that stuff did look kind of scary.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.140
I Tomb Raider needs something.

22:23.140 --> 22:32.140
And if this, if this rejuvenates the franchise, great, but just the same, it's like it's uncharted.

22:32.140 --> 22:36.300
How many times have they tried to reboot, you know, Tomb Raider so many times and it's

22:36.300 --> 22:37.300
failed every time.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.220
So hopefully this time is a little different.

22:39.220 --> 22:40.640
Congratulations, X-Box.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.740
You get uncharted.

22:41.740 --> 22:42.740
It's Tomb Raider.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.600
Well, I thought, well, but Tomb Raider is not exclusive to the 360 either.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.780
So I thought it was weird that they demoed it at the PS three people could just play

22:48.780 --> 22:49.780
uncharted.

22:49.780 --> 22:51.500
Yeah, that's why they didn't demo it.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.900
They don't want to show uncharted and then, you know, Tomb Raider, Hey, this looks kind

22:54.900 --> 22:55.900
of similar.

22:55.900 --> 22:57.260
Like, Oh, wait a minute.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.260
Uncharted is awesome.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.060
And Tomb Raider is trying again.

23:00.060 --> 23:03.580
Tiger claw in our chat room says the Tomb Raider demo got kind of creepy with all the

23:03.580 --> 23:09.220
moaning and panting from Laura Croft game guru says Tomb Raider looks too much like

23:09.220 --> 23:10.820
a survival horror game.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.300
Uh, let's see.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.620
Randy you says, dude, stabbing Laura and closing her eyes.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.620
What the fuck?

23:16.620 --> 23:24.300
Jenai in our chat room says uncharted is so bro, bro, bro, uncharted is pretty cool.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.220
Did watch that little bit of the demo of the uncharted demo.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.220
Yeah.

23:28.220 --> 23:29.220
Yeah.

23:29.220 --> 23:30.220
Dan was watching it.

23:30.220 --> 23:31.760
It was let's drown for awhile.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.420
Let's press a repeatedly.

23:33.420 --> 23:34.620
Let's not drown for awhile.

23:34.620 --> 23:35.620
That's uncharted.

23:35.620 --> 23:37.460
So I was like, yeah, it won't play.

23:37.460 --> 23:38.460
Let's shoot people.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.700
And then quick time events.

23:39.700 --> 23:40.700
Awesome.

23:40.700 --> 23:44.900
Uh, and then of course connect fun labs was shown and I wanted to see the look on Loki's

23:44.900 --> 23:46.220
face when that was being demoed.

23:46.220 --> 23:47.220
That was awesome.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.220
Well, here's the thing.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.220
Okay.

23:49.220 --> 23:50.220
All this stuff got spoiled.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.220
Like right before the press conference.

23:51.220 --> 23:54.700
Oh look, our E3 page got leaked out.

23:54.700 --> 24:00.700
So it, no, all the big, you know, announcements, they were already out there and connect fun

24:00.700 --> 24:01.700
labs.

24:01.700 --> 24:07.540
That shit leaked a while ago, but, and here's what you connect fun labs is it's, Hey, look,

24:07.540 --> 24:11.380
here's all the tech stuff that we said we could do before and couldn't do.

24:11.380 --> 24:15.840
Now you can, you know, remember the whole, Hey, I can scan my skateboard in there and

24:15.840 --> 24:17.420
you know, play the first thing that they showed.

24:17.420 --> 24:21.860
Did you notice even the lady said, finally, she's like, and now you can scan in your skateboard

24:21.860 --> 24:22.860
finally.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.980
So, you know, she'd been catching shit about that for a year.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.660
Like the first thing they show is someone scanning a skateboard in and then jumping

24:28.660 --> 24:31.780
on a virtual skateboard and playing, and now they're like, Oh, you can do it.

24:31.780 --> 24:32.780
Well.

24:32.780 --> 24:36.620
And the thing about connect to me too, and the whole fun labs that it is not changing

24:36.620 --> 24:37.700
your avatar.

24:37.700 --> 24:42.180
Like it's not like how the 3ds will make a me out of taking a picture of you.

24:42.180 --> 24:46.060
It is just like a temporary thing to do fashion magazine poses.

24:46.060 --> 24:50.300
Like what the fuck is the whole thing where, Oh, you don't have to fumble through menus

24:50.300 --> 24:54.060
anymore to, you know, pick your, your avatar then you're full of shit.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.860
I'm trying to be, I'm not hooking up our connect after all.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.620
You can not make the avatar out of it.

24:59.620 --> 25:03.620
You know what I did, what I wanted to test, I wore my Pikachu shirt to see if it would

25:03.620 --> 25:07.540
take a picture of the Pikachu shirt and like actually show Pikachu, if it would just be

25:07.540 --> 25:10.260
a yellow shirt and it came through as a Pikachu shirt.

25:10.260 --> 25:14.140
I mean, it was a horrible scan of it, but it was definitely Pikachu.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.660
And I was thinking, well, obviously this won't be the main avatar because they can't show

25:17.660 --> 25:19.980
all that copyrighted stuff that people scan in.

25:19.980 --> 25:21.820
Somebody will wear a Dick on their shirt.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.500
I haven't tried it yet, but that's gotta be wrong.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.500
I am.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.860
I am not see if you can figure it out.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.860
Chat.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.860
Is anyone play connect fun labs?

25:28.860 --> 25:29.860
Tell me for all.

25:29.860 --> 25:30.860
I do not believe you.

25:30.860 --> 25:31.860
Let's hook up our connect.

25:31.860 --> 25:32.860
Save your avatar.

25:32.860 --> 25:33.860
Sure connect.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.860
Someone was supposed to lend me dance masters.

25:35.860 --> 25:36.860
Alright.

25:36.860 --> 25:40.340
Dance central two.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.340
Yeah.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.340
Dance central.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.340
What'd you think of dance central two?

25:43.340 --> 25:44.340
It looks like dance central one.

25:44.340 --> 25:49.900
I, I, I have to admit I'm a big fan of dance central, but I didn't see besides obviously

25:49.900 --> 25:51.340
der the two player thing.

25:51.340 --> 25:52.780
I didn't see what was new about it.

25:52.780 --> 25:53.780
Here's what's new about it.

25:53.780 --> 25:57.740
And I know this because I saw the actual feature list so that what they did is they improve

25:57.740 --> 26:04.140
the break it down mode where you can actually repeat individual, um, like moves or practice

26:04.140 --> 26:05.140
individual moves.

26:05.140 --> 26:06.140
It needed to be.

26:06.140 --> 26:12.420
You can also, um, you know, repeat whole sections of, um, you know, that stuff.

26:12.420 --> 26:18.220
Uh, there's also, I think what else there was in there, you know, the two player at

26:18.220 --> 26:22.660
the same time, they also have the ability where you can get rid of the freestyle stuff.

26:22.660 --> 26:26.940
Say you don't want to do that where you flail about randomly during the song.

26:26.940 --> 26:30.540
You can take that out or you can change the way it looks.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.740
Um, some of that stuff.

26:32.740 --> 26:35.820
And then of course, you know, the, the new music that they're going to have in there.

26:35.820 --> 26:36.820
Yeah.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.780
I don't think they did a whole lot with dance central too.

26:38.780 --> 26:42.460
And honestly, they probably could have just left it alone, but well, it's also one of

26:42.460 --> 26:44.700
those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

26:44.700 --> 26:47.260
How many dance games are on the Wii or not?

26:47.260 --> 26:48.260
Sorry.

26:48.260 --> 26:51.220
The, uh, the connect connects what there's that dance.

26:51.220 --> 26:52.740
There's dance masters.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.860
Just dance was announced, will be coming.

26:54.860 --> 26:56.380
Uh, and there's that dance paradise.

26:56.380 --> 26:57.380
Is that what it is?

26:57.380 --> 27:03.380
There is there's dance masters, dance central to just dance three right now available right

27:03.380 --> 27:04.380
now.

27:04.380 --> 27:07.940
Dance paradise, uh, dance masters and dance central.

27:07.940 --> 27:08.940
So it's three.

27:08.940 --> 27:13.340
I like how they're like, it's the number one selling game on the connect and Michael Jackson,

27:13.340 --> 27:14.340
the experience.

27:14.340 --> 27:15.340
Okay.

27:15.340 --> 27:16.340
Maybe there's four.

27:16.340 --> 27:19.340
Well, because it is the number one selling one by a mile and with kind of good reason

27:19.340 --> 27:21.100
because it's the only good one.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.100
Just the answer.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.100
But here's the thing though.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.340
Just dance though.

27:24.340 --> 27:28.540
I mean, it's good on like the Wii and stuff because of the limitations of that.

27:28.540 --> 27:33.460
But you know, when you kind of bring that in with, you know, dance mat, well not necessarily

27:33.460 --> 27:36.220
dance, but dance central, I don't know if it's going to be able to hold its own.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.900
I mean, people will buy it because they're like, Oh, Hey, just dance.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.100
It's popular.

27:40.100 --> 27:44.980
But um, you know, I think it dance central does a better job though.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.980
I think just dance sells well cause it's got the right name.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.820
Everyone's like dance central.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.160
What's that all about?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
Just dance.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
Hey, I can just dance.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.740
Have really solid, uh, song lists too.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.940
And I think that's a big part of it.

27:56.940 --> 28:01.620
And more dance masters stumbled is that sure the Konami thing reaches a very niche audience,

28:01.620 --> 28:05.100
which you know, happens to be a lot of the people that's listened to this show historically,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.900
but unfortunately it doesn't really reach anybody beyond that.

28:07.900 --> 28:12.420
You know, people pick up the box for dance masters and go, what's this dance paradise?

28:12.420 --> 28:14.900
Just it was late to the game and it kind of looks clunky.

28:14.900 --> 28:15.900
I don't know.

28:15.900 --> 28:19.660
I said only ones I'd seen were dance masters and dance central and the only one I've tried

28:19.660 --> 28:20.660
is dance central.

28:20.660 --> 28:27.420
I would love to see a dance game with like half Konami ish songs, half dance central

28:27.420 --> 28:30.820
ish songs in the dance masters interface, because I think there's some cool things that

28:30.820 --> 28:31.980
dance masters brings to the table.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.980
I want more Para Para.

28:32.980 --> 28:38.580
Well then you would be talking about part of my, my pitch for a new DDR game, of course,

28:38.580 --> 28:39.580
you see.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.500
All right, let me get to some quick, quick thoughts.

28:41.500 --> 28:42.620
We want to get on to Sony.

28:42.620 --> 28:50.060
I want to get to Bobby and all that, uh, quick thoughts fable the journey.

28:50.060 --> 28:53.060
Here's my problem with necessarily fable the journey.

28:53.060 --> 28:54.060
Looks good.

28:54.060 --> 28:56.300
I mean, it looks nice cause it's an unreal three now.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.380
Um, here's my problem with the connect game.

28:58.380 --> 29:01.260
So everything's on fucking rails.

29:01.260 --> 29:03.340
Everything is on fucking rails.

29:03.340 --> 29:07.060
Doesn't the halo rail shooter make more sense than a fable rail shooter?

29:07.060 --> 29:09.100
Everything is on fucking rails.

29:09.100 --> 29:14.980
The ghost recon game on rails, the fable game on rails, star wars on rails.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.580
It's that's all they can do is on rail shooters.

29:17.580 --> 29:24.380
They can't actually do anything where you have actual control that that's where one

29:24.380 --> 29:29.300
thing that plays Asian has over, you know, the connect is, Hey, you know what?

29:29.300 --> 29:30.860
We have a navigation controller.

29:30.860 --> 29:32.740
We can navigate around the map.

29:32.740 --> 29:34.620
Whereas you guys are stuck on a rail.

29:34.620 --> 29:38.540
You need the Xbox nunchuck.

29:38.540 --> 29:42.940
I you know, I'm coming off of fable three and what I was just talked about on last week.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.740
So LR and I was not feeling that great about fable three.

29:45.740 --> 29:51.100
And so when I saw this preview, I, I was just kind of, eh, if it's $20 maybe, yeah, it looked

29:51.100 --> 29:52.100
all right.

29:52.100 --> 29:55.300
It would be pretty cool, like Xbox live arcade game and I liked how the perspective is a

29:55.300 --> 29:56.300
little different.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.180
It actually knew it'd be kind of, it kind of reminded me of, cause it is an on rails

29:59.180 --> 30:02.220
shooter is it would be a pretty cool arcade game.

30:02.220 --> 30:09.180
Yeah, actually an actual arcade, an actual arcade game because it's an on rail shooter.

30:09.180 --> 30:13.860
Other quick thoughts since she's brought up on rail shooter, what I think will be as much

30:13.860 --> 30:16.860
as we're all probably looking at it going, eh, I think it's gonna be huge this holiday

30:16.860 --> 30:19.140
connects star wars.

30:19.140 --> 30:23.580
I just hope they fix the lag of shit because the lag looked terrible from what they were

30:23.580 --> 30:25.500
showing the guy playing.

30:25.500 --> 30:28.180
Even the guy doubling it looked like ass playing it.

30:28.180 --> 30:29.180
It was horrible.

30:29.180 --> 30:33.060
Did you see when he tried to lift that ship up and move it and he dropped it?

30:33.060 --> 30:34.060
That was hilarious.

30:34.060 --> 30:37.100
Oh man, I was, I felt bad for him.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.960
But of course the games are still early on.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
So there you go.

30:39.960 --> 30:40.960
Uh, let's see.

30:40.960 --> 30:41.960
Did I miss anything else?

30:41.960 --> 30:43.260
Do you guys think of big, big stuff?

30:43.260 --> 30:45.660
I mean, there was Tom Clancy game was shown as well.

30:45.660 --> 30:48.560
Uh, Gears of War three, which I actually.

30:48.560 --> 30:56.500
The one that looks kind of cool is a rise that the new cry tech, um, game, uh, the yeah,

30:56.500 --> 30:57.500
the Roman one.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.940
I saw the dude kicking in that and I was like, he's going to like kick his connect right

31:00.940 --> 31:01.940
off the TV.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.400
I can't play that in my house.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.220
I get to see the achievement now.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.660
This is Sparta.

31:08.660 --> 31:13.980
Every time I do that, you know, but that, that's why a game like that'll sell because

31:13.980 --> 31:16.900
there's going to be a lot of like, that's the thing though.

31:16.900 --> 31:22.220
It's an actual, but as long as the, you know, combat's good and not clunky, like, you know,

31:22.220 --> 31:24.380
fighters uncaged or something like that.

31:24.380 --> 31:25.380
I don't know.

31:25.380 --> 31:29.500
It, there was a lot of cool stuff that they show like forza four looks pretty awesome.

31:29.500 --> 31:33.700
Um, and the head tracking stuff and that once again, also kind of laggy, but I don't really

31:33.700 --> 31:37.340
know how you would be able to do that anyways, cause you're kind of, you can't really turn

31:37.340 --> 31:43.740
your head, you know, it just doesn't really work with a stationary, you know, monitor.

31:43.740 --> 31:47.020
It sure didn't work in a Gran Turismo five.

31:47.020 --> 31:52.660
Uh, and oh yeah, forza, which is Dan, I know you're a racing game fan forza.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.660
Forza looked great.

31:53.660 --> 31:54.660
Now did you see that?

31:54.660 --> 31:55.660
Great looking racing game.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.660
Did you see their new steering wheel that they have?

31:57.660 --> 32:02.300
That looks like, but $60 wireless steering wheel.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.300
What's the point?

32:03.300 --> 32:06.020
Oh, you can wave it around in mid air.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.020
Sweet.

32:07.020 --> 32:10.500
Gears of war three ice tea reuniting.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.980
Why is he always look angry?

32:11.980 --> 32:19.060
He's like, you know, it's like every, I don't understand why he was just like scowling.

32:19.060 --> 32:24.340
He looked angry cause he was playing gears of war, which is a testosterone game for men.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.340
War looks angry.

32:25.340 --> 32:30.460
Well, you don't have to like be all, you know, fronting like you're just, you know, I'm going

32:30.460 --> 32:33.420
to murder somebody after I'm done playing this game.

32:33.420 --> 32:37.620
Although I got to say though, the gears of war three limited edition Xbox looks pretty

32:37.620 --> 32:38.620
nice.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.620
The black and red one.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.620
Yeah.

32:40.620 --> 32:41.620
That's good.

32:41.620 --> 32:46.380
I want to quickly just mentioned the EA press conference that happened mass effect three

32:46.380 --> 32:49.620
interesting voice command thing going on there.

32:49.620 --> 32:50.620
Useless.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.060
How quick, you know, I would never use that.

32:52.060 --> 32:55.500
I would never, I mean, is it a great demo thing?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.580
Like to show off your console to your friends?

32:57.580 --> 33:00.340
Like look at this space minority report technology.

33:00.340 --> 33:04.060
It's fun for like five minutes commanding your troops or whatever, you know, to do different

33:04.060 --> 33:05.060
things.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.060
Maybe.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.060
I don't know if that was like that part.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.500
Yeah, I could see that like doing the actual dialogue trees and stuff.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.300
I have a directional pad right in my thumb.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.140
Why do I need to even bother with this bullshit?

33:16.140 --> 33:17.300
All right.

33:17.300 --> 33:21.420
And then of course, a star Wars, the old Republic had its kind of first, uh, what is the opening

33:21.420 --> 33:23.060
trailer shown for the game?

33:23.060 --> 33:25.300
I don't know that people, that trailer was sick.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.300
Yeah.

33:26.300 --> 33:29.020
It looked, I don't know why the star Wars movies can't be like that.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.500
That trailer was sick.

33:30.500 --> 33:31.660
Uh, quickly.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.420
The Ubisoft press conference with Mr. Caffeine.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.500
What was up with that guy?

33:35.500 --> 33:36.940
I didn't watch the whole thing.

33:36.940 --> 33:42.020
I saw caffeine, by the way, when you actually go to a show and see Mr. Caffeine in person,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.020
he's amazing.

33:43.020 --> 33:46.380
Uh, far cry three was the only game I'd really seen.

33:46.380 --> 33:51.660
And I was like, there was part of the dialogue to me, felt like it was trying to be too edgy.

33:51.660 --> 33:52.660
I don't know.

33:52.660 --> 33:56.020
All I know is when it showed the dude doing the stealth kills, where he like walked up

33:56.020 --> 33:59.580
behind the guy, pulled the knife out of the guy's pocket and stabbed him with it.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.340
A little part of me, my heart grew three sizes.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.340
The game parts.

34:03.340 --> 34:08.380
I mean, I'm not going to play it, but man, I watching that dude kill people like that

34:08.380 --> 34:12.660
was he, he like grabbed the guy's knife, stabbed him with it, whooped it out of him, and then

34:12.660 --> 34:14.220
threw it at another guy and killed him.

34:14.220 --> 34:19.480
I mean, it had to be prescripted because nobody could probably make that look that good, but

34:19.480 --> 34:21.780
it looked like it would be really cool if I knew how to play it.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.900
I like the fact that you don't have malaria.

34:23.900 --> 34:27.220
All right, I'm going to go to the phones.

34:27.220 --> 34:29.460
We're going to give Bobby Black Wolf a call.

34:29.460 --> 34:34.460
He is our man, our correspondent that is at E3 this year.

34:34.460 --> 34:37.580
The other thing too, Bobby's actually like syndicating what we're doing tonight on his

34:37.580 --> 34:41.260
own feed, which I totally forgot to mention at the top of the show because there's just

34:41.260 --> 34:42.860
so much going on tonight.

34:42.860 --> 34:47.060
So of course, a big thanks to him for agreeing to do this with us tonight, and I think Bobby

34:47.060 --> 34:48.060
is now on the line.

34:48.060 --> 34:49.460
You there, Bobby?

34:49.460 --> 34:50.460
I am here.

34:50.460 --> 34:51.460
What's up, guys?

34:51.460 --> 34:52.460
Not much.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.460
How's the weather?

34:53.460 --> 34:54.460
Well, a lot actually, but that's all right.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.900
How's the weather in LA?

34:57.900 --> 35:00.960
Not as warm as it is in Atlanta right now.

35:00.960 --> 35:02.300
What an interesting change of pace.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.300
It's been raining up here.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.300
All right.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.300
Forget the weather.

35:05.300 --> 35:09.240
E3, how did day one treat you?

35:09.240 --> 35:13.660
My feet hurt, but it was a lot of standing around.

35:13.660 --> 35:15.500
It was a lot of standing around.

35:15.500 --> 35:19.700
Yeah, because you waited all day today to play Wii U, didn't you?

35:19.700 --> 35:20.700
Yes.

35:20.700 --> 35:26.100
I was about two hours before I got in there, but then I had about an hour and a half to

35:26.100 --> 35:28.140
kind of go through their eight demos.

35:28.140 --> 35:31.060
Two hours actually isn't that bad, all things considered.

35:31.060 --> 35:35.020
Did they have entertainment in the Wii line this year, or Wii U, excuse me, line to keep

35:35.020 --> 35:36.020
you going?

35:36.020 --> 35:42.020
No, and actually, when I walked up to it, it was about two o'clock, and the show floor

35:42.020 --> 35:48.140
closes at six, and I walked up at two, and there was a lady at the end.

35:48.140 --> 35:52.700
There was a sign that said, line closed, and I said, is it already full?

35:52.700 --> 35:56.700
And she's like, well, yeah, we've cut off the line.

35:56.700 --> 36:00.860
You're more than welcome to stay in here, but realize you may not get up to the front,

36:00.860 --> 36:03.300
and you may waste the rest of your day.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.300
And I said, okay.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.300
Oh, wow.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.140
And I got up there, and it wound up two hours later, you know, four o'clock, I'm starting

36:08.140 --> 36:10.740
to play with the Wii Wii Wii U.

36:10.740 --> 36:11.740
That's not that bad.

36:11.740 --> 36:13.540
So I guess they were just trying to scare people away.

36:13.540 --> 36:16.780
That's not that bad, all things considered, because the lines in the past, like the 3DS

36:16.780 --> 36:19.700
line was atrocious last year, and then, of course, the original Wii line.

36:19.700 --> 36:23.780
We all saw those videos on the internet of just the line keeps going and going and going.

36:23.780 --> 36:24.780
That line was awesome.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
All right.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.060
Anyhow, we'll get to Nintendo in a minute, but let's start by talking about Sony, because

36:29.060 --> 36:35.140
Sony happened yesterday, and you were there at the press conference, right, Bobby?

36:35.140 --> 36:36.140
Correct.

36:36.140 --> 36:37.700
So how was it?

36:37.700 --> 36:40.780
You got like right in the front, practically, didn't you?

36:40.780 --> 36:44.420
Yeah, it was kind of funny, because I got there a little late.

36:44.420 --> 36:49.660
Like I took the shuttle from my hotel, and it started at five, and so I got on the bus,

36:49.660 --> 36:55.380
on the bus, at about four or four-o-five, and in LA traffic, it was like 4.55 when we

36:55.380 --> 37:01.580
finally pulled up to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which is on USC campus.

37:01.580 --> 37:06.620
So we finally pull up, and I'm like watching everybody, and we can't get off the bus.

37:06.620 --> 37:11.140
It takes us like 15 minutes just to get around the corner into the parking lot.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.380
And we're all like kind of walking in and stuff.

37:13.380 --> 37:17.040
I missed all the food in the beginning and all that stuff, because I was hungry, because

37:17.040 --> 37:20.100
I had eaten since Atlanta that morning.

37:20.100 --> 37:24.820
And I made it all the way, you guys feel there?

37:24.820 --> 37:25.820
Yeah, we're here.

37:25.820 --> 37:26.820
Okay.

37:26.820 --> 37:29.820
It was just some cut out from my phone.

37:29.820 --> 37:35.820
Anyway, so I was walking, running in, and before I went through the door, there was

37:35.820 --> 37:40.020
a guy saying, hey, there's more seats if you go down this ramp to the VIP area.

37:40.020 --> 37:43.620
So I'm like, okay, I'll go down that ramp.

37:43.620 --> 37:47.220
And so we went down that ramp, and it went underneath, and we were on the floor area,

37:47.220 --> 37:48.780
and people were just directing us.

37:48.780 --> 37:55.540
And they pointed to these seats on folding chairs on the floor right in front of the

37:55.540 --> 37:56.540
stage.

37:56.540 --> 37:57.540
Nice.

37:57.540 --> 38:00.520
And there were like a lot of Sony employees sitting there, and so I was sitting there

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
with them.

38:01.520 --> 38:05.580
And then all the Sony employees got kicked out, and more people came in.

38:05.580 --> 38:09.700
And I realized everybody else that was sitting around me, like Michael Pachter and them,

38:09.700 --> 38:12.980
all had these red VIP lanyards.

38:12.980 --> 38:13.980
And I didn't have one of those.

38:13.980 --> 38:19.860
So I was kind of like covering up my shirt or something, so it looked like I had a lanyard,

38:19.860 --> 38:20.860
and they never noticed.

38:20.860 --> 38:24.020
You were just in the right place at the right time.

38:24.020 --> 38:28.060
Well, they got to make that section, you were just in the right place at the right time,

38:28.060 --> 38:29.060
it sounds like.

38:29.060 --> 38:31.420
Yeah, I hate being late.

38:31.420 --> 38:32.420
Yeah.

38:32.420 --> 38:34.940
And they've got to make that section look full, because that's the part of the auditorium

38:34.940 --> 38:37.880
you can see on TV constantly, is kind of that first little area.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.260
So it's got to be full and animated.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.940
So I'm not surprised they were trying to fill it up.

38:42.940 --> 38:48.020
But every time the camera was on me, I was tweaking.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.620
Nice.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.980
Let's talk a little bit about what happened at the Sony press conference.

38:51.980 --> 38:56.820
Obviously, we're going to get to taboo when we come back with the Orange Launch Radio

38:56.820 --> 38:59.040
next Sunday, the regular episodes.

38:59.040 --> 39:03.660
But I lost a point in taboo, because Sony just opened right off the bat with somewhat

39:03.660 --> 39:08.540
of an apology, and one that it seems like most people accepted.

39:08.540 --> 39:09.540
Loki?

39:09.540 --> 39:11.460
Loki's shaking his head a little bit.

39:11.460 --> 39:12.460
It was retarded.

39:12.460 --> 39:13.460
Really?

39:13.460 --> 39:18.260
It's like, yeah, we learned a valuable lesson with this PlayStation outage set.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.800
We realized how much you like playing online.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.340
That's all they fucking learned.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.340
That's all they learned.

39:23.340 --> 39:28.140
It was not like, oh, hey, we're sorry that your credit card information was compromised.

39:28.140 --> 39:31.520
It was, hey, you guys like playing online.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.860
We're going to focus more on online play.

39:33.860 --> 39:36.060
Let me ask the chat room how they feel about it.

39:36.060 --> 39:40.240
Chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com, were you satisfied with Sony's apology?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.240
What do you think?

39:41.240 --> 39:44.780
How did that go over in the crowd there and with you?

39:44.780 --> 39:50.540
Well, first off, it was kind of interesting because you notice he never said they got

39:50.540 --> 39:51.540
hacked.

39:51.540 --> 39:52.540
They called it an outage.

39:52.540 --> 39:55.620
They didn't say why it was an outage.

39:55.620 --> 39:59.660
But a lot of people round up, and you gotta realize since I'm in the VIP section, I'm

39:59.660 --> 40:02.540
around people who've been in the industry 20 years and all that stuff, and they kind

40:02.540 --> 40:06.420
of were more understanding than the people that were probably up in the normal seats

40:06.420 --> 40:07.900
and people at home.

40:07.900 --> 40:18.300
So they were like, okay, he did mention it, and Jack, he does really good on stage.

40:18.300 --> 40:23.620
Every year, because he always goes up there and something is bad press for Sony whenever

40:23.620 --> 40:26.460
he walks up at E3.

40:26.460 --> 40:30.940
He and his script writers handle it really well.

40:30.940 --> 40:34.860
That was scripted because I can see the teleprompters from where I was.

40:34.860 --> 40:38.420
And I knew how much of the entire press conference was actually scripted.

40:38.420 --> 40:39.420
Oh, yeah.

40:39.420 --> 40:40.420
They all were.

40:40.420 --> 40:44.300
And he did a good job, and it stopped people from echoing them because that was one of

40:44.300 --> 40:49.180
the things somebody asked me on Twitter is how many people were gonna interrupt the conference

40:49.180 --> 40:54.820
yelling about the PSN hack, and nobody did because they addressed it right in the beginning

40:54.820 --> 40:56.700
and said, hey, here's the elephant in the room.

40:56.700 --> 40:57.700
Here it is.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.700
We're sorry.

40:59.700 --> 41:03.020
Going to some comments from our chat room at chat.worried.com, Rama in the chat room

41:03.020 --> 41:07.660
says, that was not an apology, that was more of a thank you for the fans for sticking out.

41:07.660 --> 41:08.660
That's a good way of putting it.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.660
Yeah.

41:09.660 --> 41:10.700
Technist says, yeah, it was okay.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.980
It was mainly a canned response.

41:12.980 --> 41:16.900
Dartitsuya says, better him than Kazurai.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.860
Techie Q says, where was Kevin Butler?

41:18.860 --> 41:19.860
Uh-huh.

41:19.860 --> 41:20.860
Good question.

41:20.860 --> 41:22.500
Did you spot Kevin Butler there?

41:22.500 --> 41:25.660
No, I did not spot Kevin Butler.

41:25.660 --> 41:32.000
He was there last year, but I think they're like, okay, we did that joke, and now we can

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
move on.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.140
Kaijuto in the chat room, one of the comments here I want to get, Sony didn't need to apologize.

41:38.140 --> 41:40.740
Free games and getting it back up was enough.

41:40.740 --> 41:41.740
Not their fault.

41:41.740 --> 41:43.060
Some dicks hacked them.

41:43.060 --> 41:48.560
I just had to say, though, that it really did sound quite a bit more sincere than the

41:48.560 --> 41:50.740
other canned stuff we had before.

41:50.740 --> 41:54.880
Yeah, it was one of those things where it was like, it could have been a lot worse.

41:54.880 --> 41:59.260
But seeing as like most of the Twittersphere at the end of the day seems to be dogging

41:59.260 --> 42:02.780
on Microsoft and Nintendo, again, I'm making broad generalizations.

42:02.780 --> 42:06.580
But most of the Twitter that I'm looking at is dogging on Microsoft and Nintendo, but

42:06.580 --> 42:12.380
is kind of praising Sony, I would say, distraction successful.

42:12.380 --> 42:13.380
I think that Sony-

42:13.380 --> 42:15.260
Yes, that was a distraction event.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.260
Right.

42:16.260 --> 42:19.660
Well, but it's exactly what their PR needed.

42:19.660 --> 42:26.660
Speaking of audience reaction, Bobby, since you were there, how was it when you, in the

42:26.660 --> 42:32.500
theater, when it was announced that the PlayStation Vita is going to be exclusive 3G on AT&T?

42:32.500 --> 42:37.180
Because I could tell you, we heard it pretty clear, how bad was it where you were?

42:37.180 --> 42:39.740
Was it really a lot of groans?

42:39.740 --> 42:45.700
It wasn't loud, but I mean, I heard like all the laughter of, yeah, we figured it and all

42:45.700 --> 42:46.700
the groans.

42:46.700 --> 42:50.300
And we could even see Kaz was kind of like not expecting that.

42:50.300 --> 42:55.060
I think if he had said the word Verizon instead, it would have been a much different reaction.

42:55.060 --> 43:00.580
But no, it was very, that was the one negative part of their press conference was that.

43:00.580 --> 43:01.580
Yeah.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.860
Nobody didn't present it very well, because honestly enough, I was in the chat.

43:04.860 --> 43:08.820
I was watching online and so I was watching the people chatting in the sidebar and those

43:08.820 --> 43:12.880
people are absolute blithering idiots, but they were just like, does that mean I can

43:12.880 --> 43:14.460
only get it through AT&T?

43:14.460 --> 43:18.340
And it's like, oh my God, please just die.

43:18.340 --> 43:22.860
Well, and it just struck me as interesting because I feel like he started to say something

43:22.860 --> 43:28.980
else like that deal had just been sealed within the past 48 hours.

43:28.980 --> 43:31.420
He wasn't quite prepared to say that.

43:31.420 --> 43:32.740
That's how it came across to me.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.980
That's what E3 is all about.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.740
I have AT&T on my iPhone.

43:35.740 --> 43:37.780
I'm one of those people that's like, whatever.

43:37.780 --> 43:38.860
I'm hoping there's a deal.

43:38.860 --> 43:43.060
As we have iPhone plans, that doesn't mean that we get on for free.

43:43.060 --> 43:44.060
Yeah.

43:44.060 --> 43:47.660
I'm not buying a 3G, PS, Vita, Velveeta, whatever.

43:47.660 --> 43:48.660
Screw that.

43:48.660 --> 43:54.820
Just, you know, tether to your iPhone or tether to, you know, whatever.

43:54.820 --> 43:57.300
Well, let's talk about the Vita.

43:57.300 --> 44:00.220
Bobby, I'll let you start it off since you were there.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.420
What was kind of the reaction to the Vita that you saw?

44:02.420 --> 44:05.340
What did you observe?

44:05.340 --> 44:10.020
The people that were around me, they're like, okay, why are they saying that this is the

44:10.020 --> 44:14.780
first time we've ever had augmented reality on a handheld because of the cameras?

44:14.780 --> 44:17.420
And you know, why are they saying that this is the first time you've been able to do such

44:17.420 --> 44:21.580
and such when they're like listing features in the 3DS?

44:21.580 --> 44:27.060
But a lot of people are saying, you know, okay, I can see why they're doing it.

44:27.060 --> 44:30.360
They think it's priced too high.

44:30.360 --> 44:35.380
It's also the first time they've done it on a PlayStation Portable.

44:35.380 --> 44:43.060
They have the camera for their stupid new iPad game and also for, what was it, the Invisimals

44:43.060 --> 44:44.380
and stuff like that.

44:44.380 --> 44:48.220
Well, interesting because a lot of the folks I was seeing online were really happy with

44:48.220 --> 44:52.460
that price point saying, oh, Nintendo, Sony's coming after your 3DS.

44:52.460 --> 44:54.780
Let me ask the chatters in our chat room.

44:54.780 --> 44:57.720
Are you convinced you need a PlayStation Vita?

44:57.720 --> 44:59.180
Why or why not?

44:59.180 --> 45:02.100
How was your reaction to the price announcement?

45:02.100 --> 45:03.100
So chat.orangelandre.com.

45:03.100 --> 45:12.980
And here's one of the things that somebody said was that if it had HDMI output, sold.

45:12.980 --> 45:14.340
Interesting.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.340
What about that whole...

45:15.340 --> 45:16.340
Now...

45:16.340 --> 45:17.580
Go ahead.

45:17.580 --> 45:19.280
I did not get the PlayStation Vita.

45:19.280 --> 45:22.680
They had it there, but it was a long ass line.

45:22.680 --> 45:26.900
And I decided that taking part in their distraction boos was more important.

45:26.900 --> 45:31.260
So I haven't been able to play the Vita yet, but they did have it there.

45:31.260 --> 45:35.940
But nobody I knew stood in the line because, like I said, there was distraction boos.

45:35.940 --> 45:36.940
Right.

45:36.940 --> 45:37.940
Right.

45:37.940 --> 45:42.540
You were kind of talking about the whole HDMI out and all that.

45:42.540 --> 45:43.540
One of the games that...

45:43.540 --> 45:46.700
And I'm sure this was the one that caught most people's attention was The Ruin, the

45:46.700 --> 45:52.620
dungeon crawler where they were playing it on the PSP and then did the transferring.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.220
So it's not just Konami doing this.

45:54.220 --> 45:58.260
Well, I guess it was a little different, but the transferring concept, I guess you could

45:58.260 --> 46:01.740
say, where they stopped on the PSP and then went right over to the PS3 and kind of picked

46:01.740 --> 46:02.740
it up.

46:02.740 --> 46:03.740
Right.

46:03.740 --> 46:04.740
Do they need...

46:04.740 --> 46:09.260
Yeah, and the question that I have about that is, do you have to be a PlayStation Plus member

46:09.260 --> 46:11.060
for the cloud savings?

46:11.060 --> 46:13.180
I would think so, yes.

46:13.180 --> 46:15.900
But obviously those are the details they want to leave out.

46:15.900 --> 46:18.540
Let me get to some of the immediate chat comments about the Vita.

46:18.540 --> 46:22.900
Tiger Claw says, I got to admit, the PS Vita for $249.99 is a pretty good price given all

46:22.900 --> 46:24.980
the tech that's in it.

46:24.980 --> 46:29.260
Savalas in our chat room says, does my new Vita have a firewall to protect me from hacks?

46:29.260 --> 46:33.260
Janai says, I will buy one, but it will feel like an updated PSP.

46:33.260 --> 46:38.580
Frisbee U says, nope, price is okay, but doesn't have any good games.

46:38.580 --> 46:44.340
Zappi says, I need a Vita, Uncharted, Wipeout, Little Deviants, and LittleBigPlanet look

46:44.340 --> 46:46.900
great.

46:46.900 --> 46:47.900
So lots of...

46:47.900 --> 46:51.820
Now, Tiger Claw says something here, and I want to kind of point this out.

46:51.820 --> 46:55.200
He says the PS Vita produced PS3 quality graphics.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.540
That is incorrect.

46:57.540 --> 47:04.700
It is comparable to the PS3 because the Vita has a smaller resolution, but it could not

47:04.700 --> 47:08.420
do 1080p PS3 quality graphics.

47:08.420 --> 47:11.900
It's because of the resolution of the screen is not 1080p.

47:11.900 --> 47:17.620
It's able, and it's also the screen is smaller, it's able to get away with making something

47:17.620 --> 47:21.340
that is comparable to the PS3, but it is not exact to the PS3.

47:21.340 --> 47:24.780
Hence why maybe the HDMI output may not be such a good idea.

47:24.780 --> 47:27.140
It may kind of ruin the quality.

47:27.140 --> 47:28.660
Right.

47:28.660 --> 47:32.300
And then you're going to get something that looks a little more PS2-ish when you actually

47:32.300 --> 47:34.300
hook it up to your TV.

47:34.300 --> 47:35.300
Right.

47:35.300 --> 47:38.780
Let's talk about some of the other stuff that happened at Sony's press conference.

47:38.780 --> 47:45.340
What about, well, there was obviously some new core Sony games shown, Uncharted 3, Resistance

47:45.340 --> 47:46.580
3.

47:46.580 --> 47:48.820
Any reactions to that?

47:48.820 --> 47:53.240
I thought the Uncharted 3 looked kind of cool because there was a very Helen Mirren slash

47:53.240 --> 47:57.820
Dame Judi Dench-esque villain in it.

47:57.820 --> 47:58.820
She was awesome.

47:58.820 --> 47:59.820
Yeah.

47:59.820 --> 48:00.820
It went over well.

48:00.820 --> 48:04.340
Everybody liked that, and a lot of people around me are like, why are they...

48:04.340 --> 48:08.740
Because the people that were around me in the VIP section, they were older than me.

48:08.740 --> 48:13.020
And they're like, God, do we really need more 3D?

48:13.020 --> 48:14.020
Do we really need more...

48:14.020 --> 48:17.100
Why are they pushing the 3D stuff on me?

48:17.100 --> 48:19.500
So that was kind of mixed in my area.

48:19.500 --> 48:23.820
I think it got more pop up in the seat.

48:23.820 --> 48:32.660
But what's interesting is that they had Ken Levine come out to talk about him doing the

48:32.660 --> 48:39.820
Vita, and they did not show Ratchet & Clank, which they had back there, and they didn't

48:39.820 --> 48:44.180
show Twisted Metal, which they had playable on that floor at the end.

48:44.180 --> 48:46.700
And so they left some of those out.

48:46.700 --> 48:51.420
The only game I played after that was Little Big Planet 2 with the Move support.

48:51.420 --> 48:54.700
Oh, what'd you think?

48:54.700 --> 48:55.700
They did...

48:55.700 --> 48:56.780
It was kind of what we expected.

48:56.780 --> 48:58.580
It's not Sackboy's prehistoric move.

48:58.580 --> 49:00.360
They did something a little different.

49:00.360 --> 49:06.140
And I got to play some of the story level from the one in their minigames.

49:06.140 --> 49:10.980
And the main tool that they give you is, I think it's like the brain-inator or something,

49:10.980 --> 49:12.660
but it's where you actually move things.

49:12.660 --> 49:16.420
So you're still playing Little Big Planet exactly the way that you're used to, with

49:16.420 --> 49:22.000
the buttons and the sticks and everything, and you're just moving things around and bouncing

49:22.000 --> 49:24.220
yourself off with some of these.

49:24.220 --> 49:26.960
And they did a really good job with it, and then they've got a minigame that they had

49:26.960 --> 49:32.340
in the play, where it's one of those, it's kind of like cut the rope a little bit, where

49:32.340 --> 49:37.660
there's a ball at the top and you're trying to get it to the end, but you have to place

49:37.660 --> 49:38.660
things.

49:38.660 --> 49:42.720
And then when you release the ball, it kind of goes through this Rube Goldberg machine

49:42.720 --> 49:43.720
that you've created.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
Interesting.

49:44.720 --> 49:46.720
And that was kind of neat.

49:46.720 --> 49:50.980
So this is something that's going to be like free patch, free upgrade for Little Big Planet

49:50.980 --> 49:52.580
2, right?

49:52.580 --> 49:53.580
I believe so.

49:53.580 --> 49:55.300
It's not something I'm going to have to buy separately.

49:55.300 --> 49:59.460
And they better, because on the box of Little Big Planet 2, it says, better with PlayStation

49:59.460 --> 50:00.460
Move.

50:00.460 --> 50:04.380
It's got the Move logo, but it's not part of the game right now.

50:04.380 --> 50:08.900
So I think that'd be kind of stupid if they put that on the box and then said, oh, but

50:08.900 --> 50:12.300
you got to pay extra to get that part that's in the blue sticker on the front of the box.

50:12.300 --> 50:14.100
It's just better if you own it.

50:14.100 --> 50:16.100
It just makes you feel good.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.180
Let me go to this comment in our chat room about the Move.

50:18.180 --> 50:23.420
Technis says, was it me or was the Move almost nonexistent in the entire press conference

50:23.420 --> 50:25.900
except for maybe four mentions and a game demo?

50:25.900 --> 50:30.100
And yeah, that medieval game they were showing that used the Move, medieval moves, Deadman's

50:30.100 --> 50:35.980
Quest, I got to admit, well, the facilitator they had doing it was probably their weakest

50:35.980 --> 50:37.300
one of the whole press conference.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.300
And I was-

50:38.300 --> 50:39.300
Good job, Jeremy.

50:39.300 --> 50:40.300
I was a little underwhelmed.

50:40.300 --> 50:41.300
Good job, Jeremy.

50:41.300 --> 50:42.300
I was a little underwhelmed.

50:42.300 --> 50:47.580
Wasn't that the same guy that like showed up the stupid medieval tech demo last time

50:47.580 --> 50:52.100
when they were first showing off the Move stuff?

50:52.100 --> 50:55.900
The medieval tech demo last time was the sports champions thing, I think.

50:55.900 --> 50:56.900
Yeah.

50:56.900 --> 50:57.900
I think it's changed quite a bit.

50:57.900 --> 50:58.900
I don't think...

50:58.900 --> 51:02.060
Some of the ideas are probably still there, but I don't think any of the assets or anything

51:02.060 --> 51:03.060
is still the same.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.980
When they first showed it off, he was the guy demoing it.

51:05.980 --> 51:06.980
Hmm.

51:06.980 --> 51:07.980
Oh, same demo-er?

51:07.980 --> 51:08.980
Maybe.

51:08.980 --> 51:13.500
One of the other big moments of the Sony press conference was a special unannounced guest.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:15.220 --> 51:16.220
What?

51:16.220 --> 51:17.220
What?

51:17.220 --> 51:18.220
There was another move being shown.

51:18.220 --> 51:19.220
What's that?

51:19.220 --> 51:21.100
Kobe Bryant came out and sucked at it.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.780
I was just about to say that.

51:22.780 --> 51:26.600
Yeah, the other big guest that was at Sony's press conference was the Kobe Bryant moment.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.620
And I tweeted you and I'm like, quick, throw your shoe.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.620
What kind of...

51:30.620 --> 51:32.900
Yeah, but I liked my shoe too much.

51:32.900 --> 51:35.860
What kind of reaction did Kobe get from the crowd?

51:35.860 --> 51:37.260
Because it sounded very mixed.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.260
It was...

51:38.260 --> 51:45.140
I mean, he got some pops and, you know, yeah, I guess, you know, when he kind of made jokes

51:45.140 --> 51:47.620
about himself or something, that got some reaction.

51:47.620 --> 51:51.660
But it was, you know, we had partially a lot of answers for him.

51:51.660 --> 51:52.660
Right, right.

51:52.660 --> 51:56.860
It was a pretty resounding endorsement by him as well.

51:56.860 --> 52:01.180
I mean, I'm sure he gets paid handsomely to say it, but still, you know, you couldn't

52:01.180 --> 52:05.340
help but feel the little punch in the gut to EA after what happened to them last year.

52:05.340 --> 52:13.460
So one of the big, big buzz things that happened at the Sony press conference was those 3D

52:13.460 --> 52:14.460
monitors.

52:14.460 --> 52:19.340
And, you know, one thing Sony has definitely learned from the past is how to get a price

52:19.340 --> 52:20.340
right.

52:20.340 --> 52:24.860
Because, you know, when the PlayStation 3 was first announced, there was a lot of heckling.

52:24.860 --> 52:27.500
But now a lot of folks say the Vita is priced right.

52:27.500 --> 52:35.260
And now a 3D television with resistance 3, 3D glasses, HDMI cable, $499.

52:35.260 --> 52:37.060
3D monitor.

52:37.060 --> 52:43.340
3D monitor, oh, so it won't actually get TV signal.

52:43.340 --> 52:44.860
I guess it probably doesn't have an accessibility.

52:44.860 --> 52:48.940
And it's probably, it's probably going to be sized like your computer monitor.

52:48.940 --> 52:51.460
Like I don't know if they said what size it was.

52:51.460 --> 52:52.460
24 inch.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.180
24, so you're right on the money.

52:54.180 --> 52:55.180
Yeah, 24 inch.

52:55.180 --> 52:57.340
So that that's not really TV.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.340
That's a monitor.

52:58.340 --> 53:01.940
Also, I wanted to mention something because I know I'm going to go back, I'm watching

53:01.940 --> 53:02.940
chat too.

53:02.940 --> 53:03.940
That's fine.

53:03.940 --> 53:07.660
Randy, you that E3 is the only place you can see Kobe play in June.

53:07.660 --> 53:11.940
Actually most times at E3, the LA Lakers are in the NBA finals and we have to fight them

53:11.940 --> 53:14.220
because the Staples Center is right next to E3.

53:14.220 --> 53:15.220
That's true.

53:15.220 --> 53:17.160
I'm actually glad he's not playing in June because that's hell.

53:17.160 --> 53:23.220
Me too because that means traffic on Thursday won't be as bad as it was the year before.

53:23.220 --> 53:27.660
But yeah, so well, I thought it was interesting the way he marketed it when they were, when

53:27.660 --> 53:29.800
he was mentioning the new monitor.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.460
It's perfect for a dorm room.

53:31.460 --> 53:36.060
I thought that right there was like a huge, like we know exactly who needs this and who

53:36.060 --> 53:37.500
our audience is for this.

53:37.500 --> 53:39.060
And I think that was right on the money.

53:39.060 --> 53:45.700
I think that's going to cause this thing to get on a lot of college wish lists this year.

53:45.700 --> 53:46.700
So we'll see.

53:46.700 --> 53:47.700
Except for me.

53:47.700 --> 53:48.700
Except for you.

53:48.700 --> 53:49.700
Not interested?

53:49.700 --> 53:52.000
Oh yeah, because you don't, you don't do 3D.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.960
I can't see the 3D and actually it screwed me up.

53:54.960 --> 54:00.160
Like I was, because I was so close and at an angle and I put those glasses on because

54:00.160 --> 54:03.040
they were showing a lot of us, a lot of trailers in 3D.

54:03.040 --> 54:09.320
It was actually messing me up because I usually like, if I'm like looking straight at it,

54:09.320 --> 54:10.320
it's fine.

54:10.320 --> 54:14.420
Like it's just a darker 2D except for maybe some things that the edges, but being at that

54:14.420 --> 54:17.080
angle, it, it sucks.

54:17.080 --> 54:22.300
Now one thing that they said they were going to do with the 3D technology, this is the

54:22.300 --> 54:26.140
stuff with the technology that I really am looking forward to and I would actually be

54:26.140 --> 54:33.100
confused, is because they do the stutter technology, they have, you know, they actually implemented,

54:33.100 --> 54:36.920
and I don't know if they're showing it here or not, where, you know, instead of having

54:36.920 --> 54:41.320
each eye shutter differently, they have each pair of glasses shutter differently, you can

54:41.320 --> 54:47.020
actually have two different screens, or people seeing two different images on the screen.

54:47.020 --> 54:48.020
That is awesome.

54:48.020 --> 54:52.480
Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool too and very Wave of the Future, very much so.

54:52.480 --> 54:56.100
So I want to get to Nintendo here in a minute, but a couple of things I've got to, got to

54:56.100 --> 54:59.580
mention out of the Sony press conference, we won't have time to hit everything, but

54:59.580 --> 55:05.340
Dar Sakura, I know you had been looking at Star Trek the game and some of the announces

55:05.340 --> 55:06.340
that were made around that.

55:06.340 --> 55:10.100
Did you hear about the PlayStation move that's going to look like a phaser?

55:10.100 --> 55:12.280
Why am I so not surprised either?

55:12.280 --> 55:15.580
I, I, I'm not going to lie, it sounds kind of awesome actually.

55:15.580 --> 55:17.820
I don't own a move yet and now I want to hold out and get one.

55:17.820 --> 55:20.620
I would only have a move if it looked like a phaser.

55:20.620 --> 55:25.060
I mean it really depends, like they didn't show a lot of the playable game and I don't

55:25.060 --> 55:27.340
know if it's out there on the, well probably not, it's still a ways out and they don't

55:27.340 --> 55:28.340
want to see the movie.

55:28.340 --> 55:29.340
It's pre-alpha right now.

55:29.340 --> 55:30.340
No, no, no.

55:30.340 --> 55:31.780
I'm trying to get an appointment to see the game.

55:31.780 --> 55:32.940
Oh, ho, ho, I hope you do.

55:32.940 --> 55:33.940
I really hope you do.

55:33.940 --> 55:34.940
I hope so too.

55:34.940 --> 55:35.940
Yeah.

55:35.940 --> 55:37.940
I want to count the lens flares.

55:37.940 --> 55:41.780
But with anything that new, I'm going to keep my judgment reserved.

55:41.780 --> 55:42.780
Right.

55:42.780 --> 55:44.100
I don't think you can count that high.

55:44.100 --> 55:47.780
But I mean they are investing a lot in this because it wasn't just this official game,

55:47.780 --> 55:53.980
but I guess a PSN precursor, I guess what comes to mind, Dead Rising 2K0-esque thing

55:53.980 --> 55:59.140
for the Star Wars game, or excuse me, Star Trek game is supposed to be there as well.

55:59.140 --> 56:02.180
More information next year, a little closer to the movie's launch I'm sure.

56:02.180 --> 56:05.940
Loki, I got to let you have a moment because they did mention at the PlayStation 3 conference

56:05.940 --> 56:10.060
exclusives coming to Saints Row the 3rd and I know you've got to have an opinion on that

56:10.060 --> 56:11.060
game.

56:11.060 --> 56:13.140
I don't really care about the exclusives that they have coming to that.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.700
I'm still getting on 360.

56:14.700 --> 56:15.700
Really?

56:15.700 --> 56:16.740
But what about the game itself?

56:16.740 --> 56:19.180
The game is fucking amazing.

56:19.180 --> 56:24.940
I saw some gameplay footage they had during an interview prior to one of the conferences

56:24.940 --> 56:33.220
and they have a guy just doing wrestling moves on random pedestrians and then they even showed

56:33.220 --> 56:36.900
the giant purple dildo weapon and stuff like that.

56:36.900 --> 56:41.300
They're talking about the vehicle that you can suck people up into it and launch them

56:41.300 --> 56:43.300
back out.

56:43.300 --> 56:46.140
It's going to be awesome.

56:46.140 --> 56:51.380
Basically they said that their goal was to make the most over the top game possible and

56:51.380 --> 56:55.660
everything that they asked to do in there, where they thought they would truly get turned

56:55.660 --> 56:57.940
down, they're like, nah, go ahead and do that.

56:57.940 --> 56:59.260
So I can't wait.

56:59.260 --> 57:02.060
I have to admit, I approve of that approach.

57:02.060 --> 57:03.060
You know what?

57:03.060 --> 57:04.060
Go big.

57:04.060 --> 57:09.580
But here's the thing too, I watched this morning the trailer, they have a new trailer out there

57:09.580 --> 57:15.020
for Postal 3 and I got to tell you, it looks like shit.

57:15.020 --> 57:16.900
Because they're like, oh, look how edgy we are.

57:16.900 --> 57:20.180
No, I'm sorry, Saints Row 3 blows that shit away.

57:20.180 --> 57:24.500
Who gives a fuck that you have a guy dressed up like a nut sack?

57:24.500 --> 57:25.500
Who cares?

57:25.500 --> 57:29.700
There's a weapon that's a giant purple penis that you can hit people with in Saints Row

57:29.700 --> 57:30.700
3.

57:30.700 --> 57:33.500
If you want to do edgy, you're going to have to make a game based on the Human Centipede

57:33.500 --> 57:36.100
part 2.

57:36.100 --> 57:41.340
I don't know how much room we have for masturbating with barbed wire in a...

57:41.340 --> 57:46.340
Hey, did you see on the PS Vita, and Dan, I know you are a Fighting Game fan stream.

57:46.340 --> 57:47.340
Well, hang on.

57:47.340 --> 57:48.340
Hang on.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.340
Yeah, yeah.

57:49.340 --> 57:50.340
I want to interject on the Saints Row thing real quick.

57:50.340 --> 57:51.340
Go for it.

57:51.340 --> 57:57.460
Because I haven't seen it yet, but they have done the most genius marketing here at E3.

57:57.460 --> 57:58.460
What's that?

57:58.460 --> 58:04.340
They bought or rented out for the week that parking lot across the street from Staples

58:04.340 --> 58:09.100
Center and have offered free parking to all E3 attendees that get in there.

58:09.100 --> 58:13.280
They have bikini models at the entrance trying to direct people in.

58:13.280 --> 58:17.540
They've got tents in there, and they've got it all decked out in Saints Row.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.540
Awesome.

58:18.540 --> 58:21.860
I know where we're going Thursday.

58:21.860 --> 58:22.860
No doubt.

58:22.860 --> 58:23.860
All right.

58:23.860 --> 58:29.020
Dan, I know you're a Fighting Game fan.

58:29.020 --> 58:31.020
Jamie's giving her husband a stare down.

58:31.020 --> 58:32.020
What?

58:32.020 --> 58:33.020
Jamie, come on.

58:33.020 --> 58:34.020
You know you want to see...

58:34.020 --> 58:35.020
You know, this is radio, so no one can see that.

58:35.020 --> 58:38.020
Jamie, even you have to admit boobies.

58:38.020 --> 58:42.920
I just didn't want him to get to the boobies first.

58:42.920 --> 58:43.920
There we go.

58:43.920 --> 58:46.460
There'll be plenty of boobies to go around at E3.

58:46.460 --> 58:47.460
Even I'll get some boobies.

58:47.460 --> 58:48.460
All right.

58:48.460 --> 58:49.460
Word.

58:49.460 --> 58:50.460
And you'll like them.

58:50.460 --> 58:53.700
Let me ask this question real quick, because you're a Fighting Game fan.

58:53.700 --> 58:57.620
On the Vita, Street Fighter crossed Tekken, some of the first kind of footage of that

58:57.620 --> 58:58.620
game in action.

58:58.620 --> 58:59.620
You're a fan?

58:59.620 --> 59:00.620
You a fan, Dark Zyra?

59:00.620 --> 59:01.620
He want.

59:01.620 --> 59:02.620
She loves Tekken.

59:02.620 --> 59:03.620
Yeah?

59:03.620 --> 59:04.620
Are you kind of...

59:04.620 --> 59:05.620
Nah.

59:05.620 --> 59:06.620
You feeling a little...

59:06.620 --> 59:09.380
Like a 2D fighter?

59:09.380 --> 59:10.380
Well it's that whole...

59:10.380 --> 59:11.380
Made out of a 3D fighter?

59:11.380 --> 59:12.380
Yeah.

59:12.380 --> 59:13.380
Well...

59:13.380 --> 59:14.380
It'll be cool.

59:14.380 --> 59:15.380
That got very little reaction.

59:15.380 --> 59:16.380
Well, it was...

59:16.380 --> 59:20.380
The thing was, it was weird to me, because as much as I like that idea of Street Fighter

59:20.380 --> 59:25.140
crossed Tekken, then they announced, okay, so it's Street Fighter world and Tekken world

59:25.140 --> 59:30.600
collides, and then we're going to throw in Cole from Infamous, and it's like, what does

59:30.600 --> 59:32.440
he have to do with anything?

59:32.440 --> 59:34.460
Because Namco likes throwing in random characters.

59:34.460 --> 59:39.020
Like, if we're going to put our Tekken franchise on the line here, we've got to have random

59:39.020 --> 59:41.580
people who have nothing to do with the universe in it.

59:41.580 --> 59:44.380
We can't have Darth Vader, so here's Cole.

59:44.380 --> 59:47.860
Actually, since Namco's involved, why didn't they just put Kratos in there?

59:47.860 --> 59:48.860
I know, right?

59:48.860 --> 59:50.140
Everybody would have gave a shit if it was Kratos.

59:50.140 --> 59:53.220
Besides, wouldn't it be funny just to see Kratos just hacking up Ryu?

59:53.220 --> 59:56.220
Well, there's also that moment where, well, Kratos has now kind of already been done this

59:56.220 --> 59:59.980
year in Mortal Kombat, so it would be a little much to do another fighter back to back like

59:59.980 --> 01:00:00.980
that.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980
Oh yeah, he's in Mortal Kombat, he's not in Soul Calibur.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980
Yeah.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.860
They needed, though, instead of Cole, they needed the iPad, have the iPad fucking shit

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.860
up in there.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860
No, they needed Sackboy.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.860
Sackboy?

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.860
No, no, no, no.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:13.860
Sackboy would have been amazing.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.860
Now you guys are getting stupid.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.740
No, no, no, it's not stupid, because keep in mind, Tekken 3, we had Gon.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740
That's right, you do have Panda.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740
Sackboy.

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.900
No, well Panda and Kuma were always part of the story, but, I mean, freaking Gon.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:29.460
There's a bear fighting here, but, oh, Sackboy, that's ridiculous.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.460
That's silly.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.620
Oh, but you're playing a chibi dinosaur.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.620
You can have shit.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.620
You can punch him.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:39.540
You can, oh, actually, I can make it all the way through Tekken Street mode with Gon.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:44.780
All right, we gotta get to the next press conference this morning, Nintendo.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.580
Let's talk about Nintendo for a little bit.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.780
I'm gonna leave the room so that I can actually hear Loki without going deaf.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780
What's that, Bobby?

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:54.540
You don't want me to talk about James' addiction?

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.300
Do you want to, oh, yes!

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:01.060
I totally forgot to ask Bobby about what happened behind the scenes at the Sony press conference

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.340
before we get to Nintendo, because, yo, when we're watching at home, it cuts out at the

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.420
end, but you were there for, what, like two and a half more hours, right?

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.100
Yeah, it ended at 10.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.100
Wow.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.100
So what was happening, James?

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.300
Basically, at the end of the press conference, the entire stage went away, and that's where

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:22.340
all their demo kiosks were, and they brought food, lots of food, like grilled cheese sandwiches

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:29.580
and pasta salad and cookies and cupcakes and other, like, it was great.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.220
And then beer and alcohol flowing open bar, and then at nine o'clock, James' Addiction

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.220
comes on.

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:36.220
Oh, James Addiction.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.580
I'm like, okay, I saw them in Activision last year, so I'm good.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.100
But they came out and did an hour set.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.780
And for no particular reason than, hey, we got James Addiction, because we're Sony.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.940
They better have been caught stealing.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.380
They had Mixmaster Mike there, too.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.380
I love him, too.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.380
Yeah.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.380
Wow.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:02.420
But him, they had all their trailers of their games, but it was messing with the color and

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:05.220
everything, and that was kind of the visuals around.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:11.260
But they also had all these, like, scantily clad women on top of the stage's areas that

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:17.260
were still doing, like, doing slow dances and stuff, and it was the techno music.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.780
And it was kind of weird, because we're sitting there playing video games while there's, like,

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:27.180
a hot chick above us, like, kind of doing a pole game.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.660
So I guess they knew their audience.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:29.660
All right.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.260
So, and how many Sony beers did you have again?

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.680
What?

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.820
How many Sony beers did you have again?

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.460
Honestly, because they had crappy beers, only one.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.980
Tonight is the night that I'm going to have way too many beers.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980
All right, all right.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.980
Well, then we gotta, we gotta get-

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980
They had crappy beer?

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980
I'm so sorry.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:50.660
We gotta get through Nintendo's press conference so that Bobby can get to the beer drinking.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.660
But you know what?

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.100
Bobby, with all due respect, I gotta let Loki kick this one off.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:59.460
So Loki, why don't you give us a little report on Nintendo's press conference?

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:08.900
So Nintendo came out and basically showed off some of their 3DS stuff, and no one cared.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900
No.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.740
No, they talked, first they started off actually by talking about the Zelda 25th anniversary

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:15.740
edition.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.740
Which was awesome.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.540
Which, you know, they had, like, an orchestra.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:24.220
They had an orchestra, and they had Miyamoto out there, and my Zelda fanboy soul was like,

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.220
yes!

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.580
It was beautiful.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:30.500
And then they were talking about how they're kind of celebrating it on all the different

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500
platforms.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:37.540
For the 3DS, of course you had, you know, the Game Boy Color Zelda game that's available

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:38.540
for download on there.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.460
It's gonna be the first one in the Game Boy Color Virtual Console lineup.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.660
I bought it.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.180
Sucker!

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:53.260
And then for the Nintendo Wii, obviously, you know, Skyward Sword is gonna be available

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.040
later this year.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.340
For the DSiWare, which I'm assuming also means the 3DS as well, they're gonna have Zelda

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:04.460
the Four Swords Adventure as a free download, which is kinda cool.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.660
Too bad that's not playable by itself, though.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:18.900
And then of course they're also gonna do some sort of pre-order bonus for the 3DS with Ocarina.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.940
That you're gonna be able to get a music CD with the soundtrack from the game for if you

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:32.080
register the game quite early on the Nintendo, you know, club thing.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:38.020
And then of course they're gonna do some sort of orchestra, you know, live shows and stuff

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.860
like that with the Zelda music.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.820
It's gonna be all over the world.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:47.140
And then they're gonna have a CD for that that's gonna be available with the Skyward

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.020
Sword game.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:52.620
And then 3DS stuff, they showed off, you know, the new Mario game, which looks kinda cool.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:58.160
It's kind of like a cross between Mario Galaxy and like Mario 64, which is not bad.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.380
And then Star Fox, they showed a little bit of that.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.780
I mean, it's just souped up Star Fox 64.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:07.780
What else did they show?

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:13.300
Luigi's Mansion 2, which is, you know, supposed to be, you know, brand new for that and stuff.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:17.300
And I called that there was gonna be an augmented reality game where you hunt ghosts with the

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.300
camera.

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:21.420
I still think there is, but they just haven't announced that yet because it makes sense.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.860
With like the Face Raiders stuff.

01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:29.020
I just wanna know why Luigi's Mansion, because the first one was crap.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.020
It has its fans.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:34.180
Actually the best part of it was when you went into the attic and then the lightning

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.780
would flash and then his shadow would be hanging by a noose.

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.260
So and then, okay, so they do the Kid Icarus and all these 3DS games.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.060
The Kid Icarus and then Mario Kart, what the fuck's up with Mario Kart, okay?

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:50.960
Mario Kart, now with, you know, monster trucks and, you know, hang gliders.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960
And that's innovative.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.940
And they were like, you've never, you've never raced this game before.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.380
And like all the first few tracks that they were showing were all tracks from other games.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:07.060
I'm like, actually, yes, I have raced every single one of those.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.820
And then they decide, hey, you know what, let's talk about this new console that we've

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.860
got.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.260
And of course what they do, they don't show the console, because, you know, that would

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.260
be too easy.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.980
So they show the controller and the controller is basically everything that was rumored to

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:20.980
be.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.100
It's, you know, it looks like it's made out of the plastic that's from the nunchuck or

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.100
something like that.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.300
It's got the tiny stuff and it's got the, you know, 6.2 inch touch screen.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.540
And then they go to say, hey, what are we calling this thing?

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:39.220
Uh, well, you know how everybody hated the name Wii, but then they eventually got used

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.620
to it and stuff.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.620
We got another one for you.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.620
Wii U.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620
What?

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:49.460
I, like, seriously, they said Wii U is the name of that.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.940
I was like, what?

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.380
My brain hurts for how stupid this is.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.140
But, you know, people will get used to it.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:00.220
They could still change their mind.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.940
You know, Dan and I were saying before the show, like, what if they had just called it

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:05.000
the Nintendo U?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.620
I think that would have been, like, U as in Ultra IDK, like, I think Nintendo U would

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:10.620
have been fine.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.620
No, well, here's the problem.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.460
They have to do Wii because people are fucking stupid and they're not gonna understand.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.840
I can use my Wii stuff with, see, then they know that they can use their Wii stuff with

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.840
it.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:21.840
Great.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:27.780
The problem is, is already everyone's kind of half assuming, I thought it was a new system,

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.780
not just a new controller.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.780
And it is a new system.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.780
It is a new system.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:33.780
Dura does HD.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:34.780
People don't know that.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.820
They're just like, oh, I just use it with my existing Wii.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:45.340
I know Bobby is dying to jump in here in a minute here, but let me let Loki wrap up here.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.100
What other impressions did Wii U leave you with?

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:55.500
It's a neat piece of hardware, but it just seems so gimmicky to me.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.300
It's just, how expensive is it?

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.500
Some of the graphics, like their little tech demo pre-rendered thing looked kind of cool

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.860
and what it does.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.620
But the whole conference, they didn't fucking announce anything.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:07.620
Oh, okay.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:12.920
They hinted that Smash Brothers is coming to the Wii U and 3DS.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
They hinted at that.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.940
And then they said, oh, but that's gonna be a while now.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.460
Yeah, just like they hinted at Pikmin coming out.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:20.900
And how long has that been?

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.340
Oh, wait, it's still not out yet.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:27.580
So Smash Brothers, oh, let's get them all excited and promise this game that's not gonna

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.020
come out for two years.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:37.140
And then Wii U, and I'm sorry, it's just, like the tech demos they showed off, it's

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:42.460
like, oh, hey, look, I can play Wii Sports Golf and I can put this controller on the

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:45.580
ground and make it so I can see a ball there and stuff.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.460
All right, Bobby's been waiting patiently.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:52.220
Bobby, what do you think about them showing just a controller and not really showing the

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.140
specs of the console off?

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.460
Wii U, Wii U, Wii U, Wii U.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:08:59.460
Sorry.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.460
Gun pal under the piss.

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.460
Is there a fire truck driving by?

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:10.020
So, well, first I want to jump in because we started with the 3DS stuff.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.020
Sure, go ahead.

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:16.500
And I do want to mention that I have, like, 100 street pass me now.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500
It's, like, awesome.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:22.260
I've almost got, like, all the puzzle pieces of all puzzles.

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:30.620
But I played Mario Kart 3DS because they had a couple of games out in intense and stuff.

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.260
And I actually did play it and I enjoyed it.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.260
It is Mario Kart.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:38.980
I mean, all the same tricks on how to, you know, boost around corners and stuff is still

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:40.520
there and stuff.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.580
But to me, it was Mario Kart meets Diddy Kong Racing.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.860
How so?

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:50.780
With all the different ways that you could, you know, like, either you would be a plane

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:55.140
or you'd go underwater, which they didn't really do underwater in Diddy Kong Racing.

01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:01.140
But, like, with the planes and stuff and monster trucks and having the different types of vehicles

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.140
and stuff.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.660
So that's kind of what it reminded me of.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:10.500
But it was still Mario Kart and, you know, it's, for fans of Mario Kart, it's a lot of

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500
it.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.500
Yeah.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500
See, that's the problem right there.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500
Okay?

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.980
Here's basically what Nintendo's innovation is.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.180
All right.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.940
What can we add to this to make it better?

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.180
Oh, let's add some more vehicle types.

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.640
Do people really give a shit about more vehicle types?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.760
What they want you to do is they want you to come up with some new tracks and stop fucking

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.880
repeating tracks from every goddamn game that you've already released.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.620
It would be nice to hear just a tinge about the online capability because 3DS already

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.300
has better online than the Wii.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.940
So it'd be, I would like to hear more about that, but Bobby?

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:46.940
Well, I mean, the tracks that they had in the demo that I played, you know, because

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:51.980
the ones, like, that went underwater, you know, and there is, you know, different physics

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:52.980
underwater.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.580
And, you know, gliding through the air and having to determine where you're going to

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.620
glide and when you're going to go up and down.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:01.700
So I mean, the demo had new tracks.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.700
I don't recognize any of the tracks that were in the demo.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:09.820
Now, the trailer probably showed tracks that you might have seen, you know, segments of

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:14.620
tracks that you've seen before, but, you know, like, yeah, there's a track that looks like

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.660
the Donkey Kong tracks from the N64, but it's not the same layout.

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.060
It just has the same scenery.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:29.300
So don't write it off based on the three second stiffness in the trailer because it does change

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300
it enough.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:35.580
Yes, it's still Mario Kart, and yes, it's still, you know, not new but fun, maybe.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580
I don't know.

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:37.580
It's just like how they thought-

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.580
You know, a lot of people are like, what's wrong with more of what I like?

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.340
It's just like how they thought it was necessary to put motorcycles in the Wii version.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.340
Who gives a shit?

01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:46.340
It's a kart racing game.

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:47.340
You don't need fucking motorcycles.

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.620
Oh, now let's put monster trucks in there.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:50.620
Who cares?

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.780
Well, then it would be more like a side truck if they did that.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780
Look at-

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:54.780
No, no.

01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.780
See, here's what they do if it's a side truck.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:59.220
Oh, let's put jet engines in there and put, you know, let's put boats.

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.220
All right.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.220
Look-

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.220
Excite boats.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.220
Since we're talking 3DS, let me throw out-

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.220
That's going to happen.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.700
We've just put that out in the atmosphere.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.700
Nintendo right now has just started to work on excite boats.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.020
Let me throw out this question for the chat room.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:17.380
For all you folks in chat who do not currently own a 3DS, are you interested in 3DS now?

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.180
They showed more titles.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.800
I thought it was interesting, and that's the question I've got for our chat, chat.orangetouch.com.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.660
Are you interested in a 3DS now?

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.500
Because I thought it was interesting because leading into that, Reggie, and Reggie just

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.460
showed why he was Reggie.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.980
And he said something, and Bobby, maybe you can help fill me in here.

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:38.740
He said something like, well, you want to see the same old stuff again, but you want

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:39.740
to see innovation.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.740
And he goes kind of like, conflict, fine.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:44.740
We can handle that.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.740
That's our industry.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740
Here you go.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.220
We're fucking Nintendo.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.220
Suck it down.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.220
Yes.

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.220
Let's see innovation.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.260
Hey, you will like it.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.620
Let's talk innovation, Nintendo.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.620
Let's start off.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.620
Innovation is deeper and wider.

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620
That's what she said.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.620
What?

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.620
What?

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.620
No.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.700
Let's talk innovation here, Nintendo.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.660
Animal Crossing.

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.340
Now you can sit on park benches and go swimming.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.620
It's the same fucking game still.

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:15.620
Same damn game.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.620
Same everything.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.620
There's the same patterns.

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:18.860
I even saw the screenshots.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:24.060
The same fucking patterns that have been in that game since it first came out on the goddamn

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.180
GameCube or in this stupid game.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.460
Actually, it came out on Nintendo 64.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:32.420
I understand that, but over here- For God's sake, it's fucking Animal Crossing.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.580
Who cares?

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.900
I care because you know what?

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.660
They get away with this shit with every goddamn franchise that they have because their fans

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.660
love it.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.660
You know what?

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:41.660
Your fucking Smash Brothers come out.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.460
I bet you that it's going to be all the fucking same characters again.

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.980
Fuck, they're just going to pork that shit from the Wii is what's going to end up happening.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.820
But that's what makes it a franchise.

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:50.820
Dark Sakura.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.820
I want it.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.580
I want the Smash Brothers too.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:55.580
Animal Crossing.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.580
I was actually going to start playing my GBA one again.

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.140
Then I have to ask as a follow-up, why?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:09.620
Because I watched the anime last night and it was super cute and I was like, I remember

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.660
this in the game.

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.300
I remember that in the game.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.460
I miss playing it.

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:14.460
You can ask Dan.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.460
He was here the whole time.

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.460
As soon as they took out Unlock-A-Whole-Nest games, fuck that franchise.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.300
Bobby, do you think it's odd that they left Animal Crossing and Paper Mario out of the

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.300
conference totally?

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.860
Well, except for, I guess, logos at the end?

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:35.380
I think that they felt they had enough that they were showing that they didn't teach you.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:40.100
What I was actually surprised at is that there were no live demos of games.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:45.460
They didn't bring those two out to show people.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:48.020
Is that maybe because the whole 3D, 2D thing?

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.820
No, no, I'm talking about the Wii U.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.820
Oh, excuse me.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.820
I moved on already.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:53.820
Oh, sorry, sorry.

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.820
But they didn't bring it out.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:58.100
They showed videos, but I'm like, is it even here?

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.820
Because I'm seeing all these conceptual videos and stuff.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:05.700
I didn't even think it was even at E3, because usually they would have brought it out or

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.700
something.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.220
Tethered to lovely-looking ladies, right?

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.220
Yeah.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.180
Let me get to some of the feedback from our chat room on the 3DS, and then we'll move

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.180
into Wii U.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.980
For the non-3DS owners, are you interested in a 3DS now?

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:20.180
Gio Videa says, no, can't use the 3D on the 3DS anyway.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.900
Burr says, still not interested.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.140
Dungeon Buster, not really.

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:27.620
Blender, not interested in the 3DS at all.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.620
So there's some of the negatives.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.620
But then we get some other positives.

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.020
Dark Tetsuya, oh, definitely.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.220
New Mario Kart looks neat.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.220
Yay, Tanooki suit.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.620
I think he might be, or was Tanooki suit in Mario Kart, or is he just blurring the other

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.620
Mario game?

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.620
He's talking about the...

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.620
He's blurring them.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.620
All right.

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.180
Defective Candy says, no, I'm not impressed with the 3DS.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:47.540
Lacklustre title still, and the system was not even done when it came out.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:50.620
I'll stick to my DSi until they discontinue making games for it.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:53.420
Frisbee U, no, we don't want to see the same stuff again.

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:58.260
Technus, I want Star Fox 64 3DS, but the picture thing was so fucking stupid.

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.260
So no.

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.500
Interesting, because there's not a lot of yeses.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.820
And here's the thing about Star Fox, that he was talking about fucking innovation, how

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:11.380
you can tilt it to, you know, you can optionally, I guess, tilt it to control, you know, your

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380
ship.

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.740
Yeah, except it fucks up the 3D when you do that, dumbass.

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.300
Oh, no kidding.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:21.860
Let's put tilt controls on a 3D game that requires you to keep the system at an actual

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:26.020
view so that you can see the 3D.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:29.140
I guess that's for people who don't give a shit about 3D, but then again, why the fuck

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:31.540
are you buying, you know, a 3DS sim?

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.300
Or better yet, why the fuck are you buying a game that came out on the Nintendo 64?

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.660
Oh, because that's innovation for Nintendo.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.580
We can port old shit and make it slightly better.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:41.780
The hobby wants to jump in.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:48.540
Well, I mean, I am a 3DS because it's a higher resolution top screen.

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:53.900
For me as well, like, I bought a 3DS because I skipped the DSi and I skipped the DSi XL

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:57.340
and I, you know, the last one I had owned was a DS Lite, so I thought, eh, it's time

01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.340
for upgrade.

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340
Why not?

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.340
That's why I did it.

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.700
But anyway, let's move on to Wii U because I know Bobby wants to move on.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.580
Let me throw a question out to chat that we'll get to in a minute.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.360
And then I want to talk, Bobby, your time with the hands-on Wii U.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.980
On a scale of 1 to 10, chatters, 10 being very and 1 being not at all, I'm sounding

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:21.000
like a club Nintendo survey, but I'm just kind of curious here, 1 being not at all,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.420
how interested are you in Wii U?

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.860
Scale of 1 to 10, 1 not at all, 10 very.

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:33.980
Bobby, you got your hands on it after four hours of waiting, right?

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.980
What do you think?

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:40.320
First off, what I want to say is I want to give a history lesson.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.920
Back in 2005 at Nintendo's press conference, they decided that they were going to show

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:49.620
this brand new revolutionary control scheme.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:57.740
And they showed the remote and they did, you know, that was when, you know, Miyamoto came

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.460
out, flashing Zelda swords and all that stuff.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:01.820
And they showed it.

01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.300
And when you played the games, you realized they were running on Gamecubes.

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:10.300
And that's where the whole joke of two Gamecubes tucked together came from.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:15.340
In 2006, they actually showed the console that the controller was for.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:22.220
Fast forward to 2011, they are showing the controller for their next console, but they're

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.340
not telling you that much about the console itself.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.900
They're focusing on the input mechanism.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:31.020
Next year, we're actually going to see more of the console.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:38.620
Now, the demos that they're showing here are running on new hardware, but it's not like

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:42.160
they even like to show a box there, but I was actually told that's not running anything.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:47.180
It's like running, there's a PC back there, running a, you know, a souped-up Wii dev kit.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.900
And that's what they're running things off of.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.380
So they're not ready to talk about the console yet.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:57.180
They're trying to get people to concentrate on the controller and the conceptual demos.

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:02.700
There is not a single retail game being shown, except, well, okay, there's one retail game

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:06.500
and it's a third-party game that's being shown here at E3 for the Wii U.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.940
So I kind of wanted to straighten that out.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:12.340
Which one is that, the Lego game?

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.340
Huh?

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.340
Which, what's the third-party game?

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.340
The Lego game?

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.340
Uh, no.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.660
They're showing Ghost Recon online.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.660
Oh.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:19.660
Wow, okay.

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:23.060
You know what, though, Bobby, you're wrong because those are going to be an actual game

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.020
because that's what Wii Sports and Wii Play ended up being.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.700
It's all those tech demos and they've had, hey, you know what, we're going to be innovative.

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.260
We're going to slap that shit together, kind of duct tape it a little bit, and throw it

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:37.500
out with a controller because people are suckers and they want free controllers.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.940
But Bobby, that should make Bobby happy because that Chase Me is basically Pac-Man Versus.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.940
Pac-Man Versus is awesome.

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:44.940
Right.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.300
And what I'm saying is, like, people are, you know, when people look at these stuff

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.900
they're going to be like, wow, they're going to make me pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.020
No, they're not going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.740
They're going to make you pay 50 bucks for Chase Me, Battle Me, and all that other stuff.

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.220
But I mean, they were very adamant with me when I talked to people that actually worked

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:05.060
at Nintendo and weren't just hired for the Wii.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.340
As you can tell, by the way, because the people that worked at Nintendo have QR codes of their

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.300
knees on their badge that you can scan.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.420
But they actually were very adamant saying these are conceptual demos.

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:19.460
These are not final products.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:25.420
These are to get your mind working and trying to tell you this is the type of stuff you

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.420
can do.

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:33.820
Yes, we may see, you know, the shield pose game and Chase Me and Battle Me in some kind

01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:37.620
of compilation, but not as stand-alone games.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:41.820
The only stand-alone games, like, they had the Mario game running there and then, you

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.180
know, goes online running.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.260
But the rest were tech demos.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.740
Just so you guys know, the feedback on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being very, 1 being not at

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:53.540
all, how interested are you in the Wii U?

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.460
I see lots of, it's just all over the board.

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:58.920
There's some 9s, but there's also some 1s.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.520
There's a 0 from Joe Videa.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.900
A lot of 5s and 4s, and then like a 6.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.380
So there's a universal meh.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:07.380
It's all over.

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:11.580
And that's because, it's because it's all conceptual right now.

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.180
People aren't seeing final products right now.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.340
And you know, even the hardware isn't finalized.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.540
And they didn't really emphasize enough that, you know, this is a new console.

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.460
You could actually walk away from there, and even I thought, this is just a new controller

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.240
for my Wii.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:33.620
And you know, right now you're playing some of the games with Wii Remote, it's got a Wii

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:41.420
sensor bar underneath each TV, even though there's a sensor bar in the Wii Wii controller.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:45.740
But essentially, I eat this out of them.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:52.180
The console is called the Wii U, and they haven't named the controller yet.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.220
I want to name it Bob.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:22:02.380
I just wonder this, are we ready for the era of the game controller to cost $100 plus?

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:07.620
I don't think it will, because that touch screen is not, it's a cheap, it's the DS touch

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:08.620
screen.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:09.620
I called it on Sunday's show in Summerguard.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.020
But it's a 6 and a half.

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.020
It's larger.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.460
Well, I don't think, I still think, it's a lot larger.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.460
I don't know.

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.460
7980.

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.420
Yeah, but it's larger, but it's not multi-touch.

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.420
So that's one big thing.

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.420
Bobby went, go ahead.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.660
Yeah, go ahead, finish your thought, sorry.

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:31.020
So it didn't seem to be like, I couldn't do any multi-touch stuff.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.980
Maybe their current demos don't have multi-touch, but yeah, I mean, it's just a larger version

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.940
of the DSi screen.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:43.140
Bobby, were there any demos that were using more than one of those controllers on the

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.140
same system?

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.520
Because that was something I noticed at the conference, none of the games were using more

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.000
than one of those controllers.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.980
Everything was supplemented with additional Wiimotes.

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:55.060
I didn't get a good look at Battle.me.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.980
That was the only one that might have.

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.940
But everything else, it was either, you know, it was a one-player experience, or, you know,

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:07.340
it was one person using that, and then four Wiimotes.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:11.520
I think I watched a video of Battle.me on Nintendo's website, and I want to say the

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.820
person flying the spaceship was using the controller, and everybody else was on a Wiimote,

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.780
so no, if the videos are to be the definitive answer.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.180
I thought that was interesting.

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.540
Like, maybe the price of the controller really isn't going to be such an issue, because they

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:29.860
aren't really going to have you, or want you to have more than one.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.060
Maybe the games aren't really going to need more than one.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.060
That's baloney.

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.860
That sounds to me like just the whole thing with the GBA connector.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860
Oh yeah.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860
Oh yeah.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.860
It's the same theory.

01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.460
Why don't they just make a connector for the DS?

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:44.060
Here's the thing.

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:48.980
The controller is not creating any graphics, and I think that might be why.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:49.980
They're actually...

01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:56.420
The graphics on the controller is being created by the Wii Wii Wii Wii, and it's being sent

01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:02.780
wirelessly with very little lag to the controller.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:08.540
That makes sense, and that's some technology you can see right now in the PS3 and the PSP.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:10.940
You can log into your PS3 on your PSP.

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.860
It's a very little advertised feature, but you can fire up your PSP and log into your

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.740
PS3 and see the image on your PSP, and it does work.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:25.100
And remember back when Kasarai was first showing Ridge Racer, the original concept was that

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.220
that PSP was supposed to be your rear view mirror.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:32.500
We never saw that really fully realized, but the idea was out there a while ago.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.420
If no one minds actually if I go back to an old point, because she just made the point

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.420
to me.

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.420
Sure.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:46.180
But Sierra has said that as a person who bought around eight different versions of Final Fantasy

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.900
VII, I don't care if it's the same game.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.700
Talk about back to the Animal Crossing thing.

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:54.540
The fans will buy it if they like it, so that's why it says the same thing.

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.300
Then the fans can't complain when they say, oh, well, it's just the same game, they didn't

01:24:58.300 --> 01:24:59.300
do anything.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.300
Four, not seven.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:08.580
Bobby, you're in a unique position that none of us, and probably most of our chatters and

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:12.040
even listeners are in tonight, where you're the only one that's actually held one of these

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.140
Wii U's.

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:18.180
So coming out of there, how are you, because I know you said at the end of the press conference

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.980
you were feeling a little meh, but coming out of the demo, are you thinking you're going

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:28.160
to buy a Wii U, or are you kind of like, I need to see more next year?

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.340
I want to hand Nintendo my wallet, and they say here, take it.

01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.340
And what was it about it that just made you go, I'm sold?

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:43.980
Well, I can actually contextualize a lot more, and I can see where they're going with it

01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:49.220
and a lot of the neat stuff that they're doing, and the neat gameplay that they're doing with

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:51.900
that, and what they can do.

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:55.860
I can kind of see where they're going with it, which a lot of people usually can't.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.740
When they first announced the DS, everybody was like, why would I want a touch screen

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.620
on my game?

01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:06.260
And now iPhone games are really popular.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:09.580
And I could see where that was going, and nobody else could figure out why would I want

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.740
a touch screen gaming system.

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:16.660
I actually saw, when I first saw the DS, here's why you'd want a touch screen gaming system.

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.700
I could actually see it, and it's true.

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:23.100
And a lot of people are like, oh, this is a gimmick and all that stuff.

01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.700
And a lot of Nintendo's innovations have been copied by everybody else, and they were called

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:31.220
gimmicks at first, like Rumble was a gimmick.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:37.300
And now we have touch screens on everything, motion controls are on everything.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:41.700
I think that Nintendo is going to innovate in this space, and you're going to see in

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:46.700
a couple years other companies copied them, and it's not the first time they've done this

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:50.060
because they've already done the GameCube, Game Boy Advance thing.

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.500
So they've already got a track record of some of the stuff they already know.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.780
Very, very interesting response.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:01.700
I know this is all speculation at this point, no one knows, but any idea when this thing

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:02.820
might hit shelves?

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.660
Does it seem like, no, we're going to have another E3 where we see the Smash Brothers

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.100
and we see the games, and we're going to talk Holiday 2012, or is this going to be a 3DS

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.500
style launch where you think maybe it's coming March?

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.580
Holiday 2012.

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.580
It'll be Holiday 2012.

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:23.020
Just from being in retail, Nintendo always saves the machines for Christmas.

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.020
But not the 3DS?

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:25.740
No, no, not the portables.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:31.500
No, this is coming from one of those guys that has the QR code on his badge.

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.500
Oh, okay.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:33.500
So that's the official word, then.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:38.420
Bobby, what did you think about the analog 6 being above the actual D-pad and the face

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:39.420
buttons?

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.460
That's a little backwards compared to the controllers now.

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:42.460
3DS is that way.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.460
It felt natural.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.460
All right.

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.460
All right.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:51.540
Because of where the triggers are, there's the triggers and then the LB and the RB, but

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:56.020
because of where they are, that is the exact position your thumb would really want to be

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.420
if you wanted to use the dual analog sticks.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:03.120
Bobby, if I'm not mistaken, you were kind of in this wee line yourself and doing this

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.460
whole thing, kind of going in there by yourself.

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:09.500
Now, I know when I'm in a big environment like that by myself, because I did E3 myself

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.340
one year, or at least one of the days, and one of the things that I couldn't help but

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:16.460
do was listen to other people around me and do a little bit of people watching.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.100
Yes, I was being a little nosy.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.980
Were you doing any of that maybe in the Nintendo booth and kind of picking up some of the buzz

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.860
from people around you?

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:30.500
Not really, because everybody around me spoke different languages.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500
Touche.

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500
All right.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.380
But, I mean, people were generally, they had been in that line for so long, they weren't

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:45.020
really enthusiastic except for in the shield pose game where you kind of have to be, but

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:48.100
you know, some people, it seemed like they got a decent response.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.060
I think the hate that's on the internet is not on the show floor.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.060
Okay.

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.780
A lot of questions from chat.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:56.780
We have a couple, chat.ownerswannatraday.com.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.660
Frisbee U says, Bobby, does the controller feel too big?

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.300
And Jenai asks, how heavy is the controller?

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:10.040
The controller is actually lighter, or it's about the same as my iPad.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.780
If I don't have a cover on it, it feels about the same weight as my iPad does.

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.780
Okay.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.780
And how did it feel?

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:22.420
And as for, it felt natural, like, I mean, you think it's big, but then you hold it and,

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:27.460
you know, I mean, I had normal-sized hands, and it felt fine, because you're not reaching

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.940
all the way down to the bottom.

01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:31.900
Like, all the buttons are easily accessible.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:36.500
You know, it's, you know, yeah, it's also, I mean, it's also a prototype controller as

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:37.500
well.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:41.380
It could change at the end, and it was also, like, tied down, like, four different ways.

01:29:41.380 --> 01:29:42.380
You couldn't take it.

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:46.260
But that probably added the weight as well.

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.900
But no, it felt natural.

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:50.620
It felt, it was lighter than I expected.

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:55.660
D.R. Froyev, I don't even think you would know the answer to this, but maybe some buzz.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.140
What is the battery life like on that Wii U controller?

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:02.780
We didn't hear anything about, like, is it batteries, is it charge, how does it work?

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.780
Nothing on that.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.300
Well, it was wired when I played it.

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:11.060
Ah, so maybe it's feeding, well, no, because they showed in the other concept videos, it's

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.060
going to be wireless.

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:17.420
We talked about beaming the image wirelessly, but it's too early now, it's early on.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.460
The proto pictures I've seen online look like they have a charge port on them.

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.980
I want to know what this parrot has to do with anything.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:23.980
Bobby?

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:25.980
It's just in a demo.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:26.980
What?

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.980
I'm sorry, you were going to say something, we were cutting you off.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:36.220
No, it was just, it's wired here, it's a prototype, I mean, things change, you know, I mean, the

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.780
3DS didn't really change all that much, but I remember, like, the original DS was different

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:45.100
when it came out, so this is the prototype thing, it could change its layout, I don't

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:48.700
even think they know what the tech specs are going to be in the final product.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:53.700
Alright, let's move on from Nintendo a little bit, Bobby, because I know, but what?

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.900
I gotta say one thing.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.660
Alright, yes please, Logie.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:59.660
I gotta say, cycling sounds awesome!

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:00.660
What?

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:04.700
Didn't you ever see, didn't you see that part where they're doing the FaceTime thing?

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.700
Let's go cycling!

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.700
Cycling sounds awesome!

01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:10.060
Actually, I do have one question about the controller itself.

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:14.020
How is it ergonomically?

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:20.140
Like I said, when I held it, my fingers went to all the right places, and it, like, on

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.460
the back, which you don't get to see all that much, there is actual grooves for you to hold

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:34.740
with your three fingers that aren't playing with the triggers, and it felt, it felt good,

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:39.940
I mean, it was like, I picked it up, and my hands were in the right place, it didn't hurt,

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:46.180
or anything, they've got it ergonomically sound for at least my size hands.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:49.220
That's what I was wondering about, because it was actually, people were talking about

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:53.500
the original Xbox controller, about it being massive and huge and too big for everybody,

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.540
and I was like, well I wonder if this thing, and then I looked at it, and from the front,

01:31:56.540 --> 01:32:00.660
it doesn't look like it's very ergonomically comfortable.

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:04.900
But again, on the back, it's got grooves on the back that, well, for you to hold onto

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.700
and for your fingers to naturally curve around.

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.940
Well, see, I was thinking the same logic, though, with the Saturn dual analog controller

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.260
on the front, it doesn't look like it would be very comfortable, but it's one of the most

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.660
comfortable controllers there are.

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:14.660
Yeah.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:17.540
So, yeah, I was wondering if it was along the same lines.

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:18.540
Yeah.

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:23.420
Okay, so for real now, moving on from Nintendo, because Bobby wants to go to some parties,

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:29.020
so we gotta let him go soon, but Bobby, any other observations from the show floor today?

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.940
Was your whole day Wii U, or did you get to see some other stuff?

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:37.660
I had an appointment with EA Sports, so I got to play the pre-alpha build of the new

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:44.500
SSX, and I can see that people who like SSX are really gonna like this.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:50.180
They've talked about how they've got this snow avalanche system that is dynamic, like

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:56.880
it's not split second or anything that has these predetermined catastrophic events.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:04.380
They actually say that they take the stability of the area, how stable it is, to see if that

01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:09.580
actually affects more snow or stops the snow, and that's one of the modes where you're trying

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:13.980
to survive, not die, you're trying to get down this mountain without getting crushed

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.980
by snow.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.660
It's very uplifting.

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:26.060
But they did basically Google Earth, it was kind of funny, they licensed with NASA topography

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:31.220
data of the entire world, and they said it's nice to have friends in high places, that

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:38.260
was their pun, and they had all the major mountain ranges, and you can pick those mountains

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:43.060
to go down, and it's the actual mountains from the actual NASA topography data, and

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:45.180
those are the mountains that you go down.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:49.820
And they've done some things with it, like one of the mountains that's on the China border,

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:52.900
they decided they were gonna put pieces of the Great Wall of China in there that you

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:56.780
could grind off of and stuff, though it's not completely realistic.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:00.380
But it's still, it's a lot more than they've done in the past.

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:06.140
But it worked well, I mean, it's not a final build by any means, there was some lag in

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.780
it, but I mean, that's because it's a pre-alpha build.

01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:08.780
Interesting.

01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:13.260
So basically, I saw that, they showed me some stuff about HEPA, which I'm not a huge Docker

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.620
fan, but it was kind of neat, some of the stuff they did, so I saw that, and then I

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:24.580
walked through Microsoft's booth to see what was kind of in there, and I'm going to go

01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:30.780
play that Disneyland Connect game, because I know where I'm going Friday.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:34.700
And Friday is a research trip.

01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:38.420
Friday is a research trip.

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.860
But apparently in the demo, like I guess in the briefing, because I didn't see the briefing

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:49.940
I was in the air, but apparently I guess it cuts off at the end of the Peter Pan ride?

01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:50.940
In the presser?

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:54.740
I think so, yeah, I just thought it was a time thing, yeah.

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:55.740
Yeah.

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.980
Well, it cuts off, apparently you do actually fight Captain Hook.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.340
Now they showed that a little bit.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:02.340
Interesting.

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:05.020
Maybe it was in a video or something, alright.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.020
What else?

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:11.060
There was that, and then I walked by and I immediately thought of ROG, because there

01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:17.980
were these four chicks wearing black dresses up on a stage, doing the time warp.

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:18.980
From the Rocky Horror Picture Show?

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.420
And I just had to get pictures.

01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:23.820
And so this means they're doing a Rocky Horror Picture Show video game?

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:24.820
Yay!

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:25.820
Yes!

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.820
Yes, it is called Glee Karaoke Revolution 2.

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:29.820
Ugh.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:30.820
No.

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:36.100
You've mentioned the four-letter G word.

01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:37.100
Therefore I must go in-

01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.100
I even took video for you.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.100
Oh, wait, here we go, here we go.

01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:47.860
You mentioned the four-letter G word, now I must go throw up.

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:52.620
Well, yes, and I did get the picture, thank you Bobby.

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:57.700
Did you get some hands on time with anything else?

01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.700
Not really.

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.220
I mean, I did, I stopped by, I have a friend who works at Double Fine, and I walked by

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:09.220
and played Trenched, which is their Xbox Live arcade game, which is a third-person mech

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:15.900
tower defense game, where you're fighting waves and waves of enemies, and you can drop

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:19.580
turrets and different things like a tower defense game, but then you're also in this

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.780
mech shooting at them, and running around and stuff.

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:27.780
It was two-player offline because I was playing with the person standing next to me on his

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:29.780
console.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:36.660
Unfortunately, this demo, they dropped you at a mission that's like in the last third

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:41.020
of the game, so you've already gone through the tutorial by this point and all that stuff,

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:46.100
and it was a little confusing key because I haven't really done much with the game,

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:49.380
but I can see people liking it.

01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:54.200
It's not over the top like you'd expect from Kim Schafer, though.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.360
So what's on deck for you tomorrow?

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.360
What are your plans?

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.580
I know we mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'm sure you want to talk about your Twitter

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.580
project.

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:06.640
Right, I have two appointments tomorrow, and other than that, I'm letting people direct

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.980
me.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:13.060
My two appointments, just so people kind of know, at one o'clock, I'm going to visit a

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:16.620
Georgia company, because being in Georgia, I actually have contacts there.

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:22.420
I'm going to go to CCP Games, where they just announced that Dust 514 is a PlayStation 3

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:27.420
exclusive, and they're actually going to show the connectivity between Dust 514 on the PlayStation

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.900
3 and Eve Online, the Excel spreadsheet simulator on the PC.

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:37.980
I'm very curious about that, because we miss that with so much coming out of Sony.

01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:42.540
But yeah, I'm very interested in this whole, how does this game impact the MMO of Eve Online?

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.860
Very interested.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:48.020
Yeah, and I am too, because I have played Eve a little bit, so I actually understand

01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:50.580
the universe and stuff, so I'm going to go in there and see them.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:54.340
And then at four o'clock, I do have a Bethesda appointment, where I'm going to get to see

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.540
the demo of Skyrim that everybody else has seen already.

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.300
Yeah, I guess it was on TV.

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.820
I think we saw a portion of what will be a longer demo for you.

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:07.100
I heard it's a 30-minute demo behind the doors, so very curious about that.

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.120
So good, those are two games we can definitely talk more about tomorrow.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.900
And so if folks want to follow you on Twitter?

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:17.020
Bobby Blackwolf.

01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:20.520
And tomorrow also, I'm going to be trying to hit Atlas, so if you have any specific

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:24.540
questions about Catherine or any of other Atlas games, I'm probably going to hit them

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:27.080
after the CCP appointment, because they're next door.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.700
And our Chibi Wolf picture?

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.900
I'm going to go try to find Natsume and get your Chibi Wolf picture and everything.

01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:34.900
Yay!

01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:37.900
Need to go play Scenes Row 3.

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:38.900
I need my cowl.

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.940
Let me, actually, the one thing, not to load you up with assignments, Bobby, but there

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:47.040
is a couple, maybe you already know the answers to a couple of these, but there's two things

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:51.460
that are kind of missing right now, where I'm like, what happened to...

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:56.060
One of them is Grand Theft Auto V. Everybody was convinced Grand Theft Auto V was debuting

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.360
at E3, and we have heard nothing.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.360
It's gone.

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.020
It's not there, right?

01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.520
I have not seen it.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.700
And then the other big question mark is, what the hell's Activision doing?

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.940
Yeah, they've got a booth.

01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:14.440
I'll go stop by them, but I think they're doing this little game that's called Modern

01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:15.440
Warfare 3.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:16.440
Oh, yeah.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440
All right.

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.440
They're fine.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440
Don't know if you've heard of it.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.840
Well, but still, when Activision is a huge company like EA and EA, I could name easily

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.080
like 10 games EA we know they're doing.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.800
Activision's got maybe a couple, you know.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:30.800
I'd like to know.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.800
No, they have more than that.

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.200
Yeah, but where's the bungee game?

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.240
Where's, you know, I just thought there'd be more coming out from Activision.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.440
Maybe because of lack of press conference.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.680
I don't know.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:40.680
Any music games?

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.680
Yeah, they've scaled back.

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:42.680
Yeah.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680
Mm.

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680
Very interesting.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:50.640
Yeah, it's Modern Warfare 3 for them, X-Men Destiny, Spider-Man, uh, where are they?

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:51.640
Spyro.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.920
Well, the Activision, if I'm not mistaken, was awesome.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.920
Spyro, cha-ching, Skylanders is what that's called.

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:04.120
It's basically, hey, guess what, we're gonna charge you $70 for the starter kit, and then

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.880
if you want your individual, you know, collect them all figurines that you can use for playable

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.000
characters in the game, those are each gonna cost you $8.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.800
If I'm not mistaken, wasn't Activision also at one time the company that said, we're just

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.280
not doing E3 anymore?

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:19.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:20.280
Yeah.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:26.400
And their big title now is so big that they're just like, we don't need E3, really.

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:29.480
You know, if they're gonna do a show, we'll make an appearance, but we don't want to spend

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.480
the money or the time.

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:35.160
Well, then I hope Battlefield 3, you know, blows the shit out of them, because that game

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.440
looks nice.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.400
Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.400
Everybody wants to see Activision put in their place.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.320
Yeah, I just watched, like, a mission, there was like a tank mission or whatever that they're

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:45.720
showing with Battlefield 3.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.880
It's just amazing.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:49.040
I mean, Call of Duty, it's pretty action-packed.

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.000
Ultra-realistic-looking wargame!

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Wow!

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Another one!

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.040
But it looks way better, though.

01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.600
They all look great, but I mean, it's just like, awesome!

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.000
We gotta let Bobby go find some...

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I have...

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.480
No, no, hang on, I gotta respond to something in here in chat.

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:12.000
Kaijuto says, the reason why there isn't a GTA 5 is because Agent is coming up with the

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
GTA 5.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.680
Now, I can't remember who exactly I heard this from, but it was from somebody I trust.

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.600
Apparently, they heard somebody ask, I think it was Jack Trenton, is Agent still a PS3

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.600
exclusive?

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.880
And his response was, you'll have to ask Rockstar about that.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.560
Hmm, interesting.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.640
Bobby, we gotta let you go find some good beer in LA.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:42.360
But before we do, I can't imagine anyone that listens to Orange Lounge Radio doesn't already

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.140
know about your show, but just in case there's like the one person that doesn't, tell us

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:48.760
a little bit about your show.

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.760
I'm the opening band.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760
Stop.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760
And I am on at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, right before Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:01.000
It's me talking for about 30 minutes, and then I take calls and everybody tells me I'm

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.200
wrong for the next 20 minutes, and then I goof off with Rob and Dark Talker for 10 minutes,

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200
and that's my show.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.200
That is my entertainment.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.200
And it's at All Games Radio, it's where it's live, or bobbyblackwolf.com is the website

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.480
where I've almost, you know, I'm not as old as they all are, but I'm coming upon the ears

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:19.480
next month.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:20.920
That's still very impressive.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920
Very impressive.

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920
You're still a big boy.

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.200
You can sit at the big kids' table.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:29.200
All right, well, Bobby, we'll be talking to you again tomorrow and have a lot of fun at

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:33.360
E3 tomorrow and just play as many games as you can, all right?

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.360
I will.

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.080
I mean, Thursday also is wide open.

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.480
I don't have any appointments on that day, so, you know, if I don't get through it tomorrow,

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.680
I want to get through it Thursday, and I want to say, because some people don't believe

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.480
me when I say this, is they started asking me, go ask Microsoft if they're going to charge

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480
for Skype.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.680
I'm like, no, I can't, because I don't have that kind of access.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.680
Right, right.

01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:53.680
Exactly.

01:42:53.680 --> 01:43:00.240
Try to keep your questions to games that maybe aren't triple-A titles or from triple-A developers.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.840
I want to find, you know, like this here, Scribblenauts.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.720
Scribblenauts I had never heard of until I saw it in the back corner of WB's booth a

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:09.760
couple years ago, and it blew me away.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.080
Katamari Damacy I really hadn't heard of until Namco showed it off a couple of years ago

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.960
at E3, or many years ago at E3 now, so I'm looking for those games, and if you hear something

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.960
that maybe you want to hear more about that GameSpot and iGn at the big sites aren't going

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.880
to cover, those are the games I want to find.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:31.800
I'm not going to be able to tap Peter Molyneux about Fable the 30.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.560
I'm not going to be able to ask Sony about, you know, if they're going to be doing this

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:39.120
or that with the Vita, because they're not going to talk to me.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.960
What the smaller does, they will answer my question, and those are the people I want

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:43.960
to talk to.

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:47.480
Alright internet, you have your homework assignment, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf, and I just

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.440
want to clarify, even though Bobby will still be at the show Thursday, we will not be having

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:53.120
an E3 special Thursday.

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:58.280
Anything Bobby does on Thursday, he will be doing on his own show this upcoming Sunday

01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:02.560
when he broadcasts live, and we will not be here live on Sunday.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.160
It's all weird, this programming thing.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.240
I'm just going to have to like draw a grid, but follow our websites and stay tuned for

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.000
all the information in our twitters.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.360
That's how you can stay on top of the world.

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:16.720
And on my show Sunday night, I will actually talk about the actual demos of the Wii Wii

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.240
Wii Wii that I played, and how each of them felt and played and all that stuff.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.800
Alright, sounds good.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:27.760
Alright, well Bobby, we're going to let you go so we can get to some other calls, and

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.800
I got to call Shane too, who's also there waiting to talk to us.

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.560
So take care, buddy.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.120
Yeah, no, hey, I get to go watch nerds riding a mechanical bull now, it's going to be great.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.360
Awesome, have fun.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.360
Thank you.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360
Bye.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.480
The one and only Bobby Blackwolf, everybody.

01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:46.820
Thanks so much to him for joining us for over an hour on that call.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.920
One hour, nine minutes, he's been joining us here.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920
That's a long phone call.

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920
That's a long phone call.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920
That's a lot of minutes.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920
Poor Bobby.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.880
Alright, before we get to Shane and Miklotov, bringing him on the show, talking, he was

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:03.040
also at Nintendo's press event, so we're going to hear about Wii U all over again, yay Logie.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.640
Have you guys been experiencing E3 from home?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.640
What have you guys been doing?

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.880
You know, we're not there this year, which is kind of different, especially me being

01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:12.880
there last year.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:16.760
I'm kind of sad I'm not there this year, but it's been interesting kind of doing E3 from

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.760
home.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.440
I like that some of the stuff I can go right on and download right away, like ConnectFunLabs,

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:26.120
I was all over that for like 10 minutes, and Logie, you were a big fan of my Sailor Moon

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.120
videos, right?

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.120
That's pretty funny.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:35.680
Well, I've been going on Twitter and seeing random, this is bullshit, Wii U what?

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.120
So my Twitter's been a source of hilarity.

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.760
Dan, what about you?

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:47.000
I've been streaming all the press conferences, and I've been going to the game sites, and

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.560
just experiencing it as much as you can from the comfort of your computer chair.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.040
That's right.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:55.920
And where the food is reasonable.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:56.920
We should be there.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:57.920
I know.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:45:58.920
We failed.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:45:59.920
Next year.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.920
Next year.

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:04.040
Alright, let me ask this question too, Logie, I know you've had some hands on with this,

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.680
some of the stuff that's been released during E3, we've had a few, not just ConnectLabs

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:12.040
was, it's out today, but there was also ExciteBike3D came out.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:15.400
Did you get a chance to grab the ExciteBike3D on 3DS?

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:22.720
I did, I checked it out, I'm glad that it wasn't just them kind of offsetting each individual

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.480
sprite layer, but, I mean, it still wasn't that great, it was like watching ExciteBike

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:34.320
on a really tiny screen, because when you do it in 3D, it's just, it's really tiny.

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:35.760
Do you have that here with you?

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.760
I don't.

01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:37.760
Dammit.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:38.760
Do you have it, Rob?

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.640
Yes, I do, actually.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:41.640
Give to Daddy.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:45.880
We'll see what you think of this, let me, I have Zelda Link's Awakening up right now,

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:51.240
which by the way, I love that you can actually frame it inside a little Game Boy, and it

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.960
does this 3D effect, where it's just like the image is indented just a little bit, like

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.880
you're playing on an actual Game Boy, because remember how the screen was behind the glass

01:46:58.880 --> 01:46:59.880
a little bit?

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.880
Yeah.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.880
Yeah, it's kind of funny.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:04.280
If anything's gonna sell me a 3DS, it's crap like that, but they need to drop the price

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.280
like 50 bucks.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280
Let's get one right now.

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.520
It's just too expensive.

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:11.400
They probably will before too long, so here you go, I'm gonna give that to Dan, he can

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:14.060
check that out right now.

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:19.160
I do like how when you zoom, use the 3D slider on it, how it zooms it back into like the

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:26.520
original game, which is kind of neat, but I mean, beyond that gimmick, I just can't

01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.400
get too excited about it, you know what I mean?

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:34.520
It's just, I don't know, it's as exciting as Excitebike is, I guess.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:42.080
Alright, well we are going to give Miek Latov a call and ask some more questions about Nintendo.

01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:46.080
We're gonna hear another perspective, and I don't know if, I don't think he got hands

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:53.680
on with Wii U today, but he was there at the Nintendo presser, and Dan's like, this is

01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.200
widescreen, what's going on?

01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.440
Alright, we're gonna give Miek Latov a call, I just punched in the digits, one ringy dingy,

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:06.960
two ringy dings, live radio, special presentation here on Ustream, we'll be back next Sunday.

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.920
Hi, Miek Latov, how you doing?

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:09.920
Good.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:16.040
Hey, it's Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, of course, with DarkSakura, Loki, and Dan all here, and

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.240
we've been talking, of course, about E3, you're there in Los Angeles.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:24.240
We've already kind of covered the press conferences, let me give you, let me get some quick reaction

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.240
from you.

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.600
You didn't go to them, but you know, you're a gamer too, obviously.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.200
Microsoft and Sony, what did you think of their press conferences?

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.880
Microsoft bored me to tears.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:36.880
Why is that?

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:42.400
Because they didn't have anything interesting, they were all, here's the Kinect that we've

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.760
been pushing for a year, and we're trying to keep it relevant, but here's some titles

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.760
for it.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:56.600
And by the way, here's Gears of War with probably a drunk or high iced tea, who would be funny.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.120
That's why he was angry, he wasn't drunk yet, and it was 11 AM.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:03.400
There you go.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.480
And really, they had me with Van Central, and that was it, nothing else was interesting

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.480
to me.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.480
And then Sony?

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:14.760
Sony, I actually really liked.

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.040
I liked their monitor.

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.480
I didn't see it yet in action, but I liked the idea of two people looking at it and seeing

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:26.440
different things, and it's cheap.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:34.880
I liked the idea of the Vita, I liked Uncharted 3, talking about Pico and Shadow of the Cloth,

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.600
this just often makes me happy.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.160
So overall, they did really well in my eyes.

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.640
Now let's move to Nintendo, because you were there, you were at the press conference today, correct?

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:45.640
Yeah.

01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.120
And how was it for you?

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:50.560
Now we've already kind of recapped, obviously, what was shown, but how was it for you kind

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:52.280
of being there?

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.920
I really liked it.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:57.320
I'd like to go again.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.960
It was also, while I liked it, I thought it was cool, like the orchestra, and that was

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.920
neat, and a golden remote was cool.

01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:11.440
I was also kind of dull, and it went by really fast.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.800
So it was almost like a blink and you missed it.

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.800
How were your seats?

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.800
Were you way up in the nosebleeds?

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:15.800
Oh, they were really good.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.800
No, no, I was seven rows from the front.

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.800
Nice.

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:21.800
Good for you.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.800
So you could probably see that little Wii U mote, or whatever they're going to call

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:30.320
it, in their hands when they were showing that off, huh?

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.040
I don't remember them showing it off in person.

01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.040
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.040
Bobby even said that.

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.040
They didn't bring it out.

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.200
It was only on the videos.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.200
That's right.

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.200
Well, whatever.

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.200
Well, what did you think?

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.200
What was your impressions of Wii U?

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.200
I know you haven't done hands-on, or did you do hands-on today, or no?

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:50.520
No, I went there first thing this morning, and of course all the visitors were in line

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520
first.

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.160
That's what they do.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.960
And it looked like it was a three-and-a-half-hour wait from where I was at, so I said, do it,

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.240
and I'm just going to do it tomorrow.

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.200
I believe Bobby waited four hours, but it moved a little.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:08.560
He got in line after they said it was closed, and they told him flat out he might not see

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.600
it, but he did get to see it finally by four.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.960
But I think he was in that line for four hours today.

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:18.040
Yeah, that's why I just wanted to go and look at other things today, because I knew that

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.840
tomorrow and the next day would be mostly Vita and Wii U.

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.440
Well, I want to get to those other things.

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.240
Oh, is there big lines for Vita, too?

01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240
Is that all behind the scenes?

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.240
Oh, yeah.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.240
Oh, wow.

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:29.240
Okay.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.240
Okay, interesting.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:32.920
It's kind of like how Sony did the move last year.

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:37.080
Quickly though about Nintendo, you did get some hands-on with some of the 3DS stuff,

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:38.080
right?

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.080
Oh, yeah.

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:43.840
So what they talked about today for the 3DS, I got to play.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:44.840
Oh, wow.

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.800
So that was pretty cool.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.960
I like that they had their titles at the press conference, and I'm like, oh, yeah, and everything

01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:54.040
we're talking about, they'll play it now.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.400
Wait, so Kid Icarus was playable, too?

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.400
Yeah.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:59.080
Oh, my God, I love Kid Icarus.

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.080
Wow.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.760
Tell us a little bit about how that demo played.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760
Okay.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.400
So there were two, well, three demos.

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.080
I think two of the three so far.

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:15.480
The first demo is a aerial mission and a ground mission combined into one.

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:21.000
So with the aerial mission, it's pretty much, if you played Sin and Finish Me, you've got

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.760
your little target that you control with the stylus, and then the spherical pad is how

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:35.880
you strafe and move up and down, and your firing is all based out of the left button

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:39.400
at the top bell button.

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:46.800
And before you actually do the mission, you actually had, I think, around nine options

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.200
for what you wanted because of your weapon.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.200
Hmm.

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200
So that was pretty neat.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.860
I went with Pan Blast because I thought that was cool.

01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:03.600
So when you're playing, if you target an enemy with a target, I don't know how to pronounce

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:09.760
it, it'll lock onto them, kind of.

01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:15.000
If you hold down the L button, it'll shoot a rapid succession of shots.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.700
If you just target them, though, and just single press it, you will deliver like a fully

01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:24.480
charged blast that can actually take out several enemies in that area.

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.480
Hmm.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:31.400
So, was that, I'm sorry, did you say the other one was the multiplayer demo?

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.920
Oh, there were two other ones.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:37.920
There was a multiplayer demo, I did not get to do that.

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.520
I don't know why, I don't think I wanted to hang around at that point.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:48.240
But the other one they had was AR cards, which actually, if you did the demonstration with

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.240
them, you got a pack.

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:55.080
So I have a pack of Kid Icarus AR cards, once the game comes out, they'll be able to use.

01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:02.400
But all it really is, is just putting characters on, you know, through the AR, on the card,

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.000
and then they can battle each other.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.240
It was that thing that some were joking like, hey, didn't we see this already when it was

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.720
called the Eye of Judgment?

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:13.880
Yes, that's all it is, but that's pretty much all their AR cards are.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:20.040
Interesting that Nintendo just slaps Kid Icarus on it, and now people are going crazy about

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.040
it.

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.040
Isn't that funny how that works, Loki?

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.040
Yeah.

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.320
Is there a bet still on if a million copies of that game sell?

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.320
No, there is no bet.

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:28.320
It's done.

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.320
Just get over it.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.320
Alright, alright.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.320
What else did you play on DS?

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:34.320
3DS.

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.040
I played Luigi's Mansion 2.

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.960
It played like Luigi's Mansion, there was some big shocker there.

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:48.480
The one thing that I did not like is that, I know it's early in development, but the

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:53.440
frame rate chugs, even when you weren't doing much of anything.

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:57.160
Okay well hopefully they get that ironed out, I mean yeah, that's an early development thing

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:01.240
I'm sure, but they'll have to fix that.

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.520
Mario was cool.

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:10.760
It played like Mario Galaxy on the stages that didn't have the 3D worlds where you're

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:17.960
running around the entire planet upside down and stuff like that.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.160
Nothing much really different there, you've got your raccoon suit back, but it looks like

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.640
the Tanooki suit, but it has the raccoon suit powers, so it's kind of weird.

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.640
Interesting.

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.640
Let's see, Mario Kart.

01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:31.640
Mario Kart was fantastic.

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:36.680
60 frames a second from what I was told.

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680
Even in 3D?

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:39.640
It works hard.

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:40.760
Even in 3D?

01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:41.760
Even in 3D it does 60 frames a second?

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:42.760
Yeah.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:43.760
Wow.

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:44.760
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:45.760
Who would play it in 2D?

01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:47.480
Losers would play it in 2D.

01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.600
Well I'm thinking of Dead or Alive Dimensions where they were saying, oh it'll do 60 frames

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.920
in 2D in 3D in 3D, like it was kind of split, so I was wondering if they were going to do

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.920
it.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:57.920
Yeah, same with Street Fighter.

01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:58.920
Huh, okay.

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:05.120
Yeah, but no, this was 60 frames greedy, it worked hard, which was amazing because Mario

01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:14.040
Kart has not been hard in years, the paint lighting mechanic, when you had the jumps,

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:20.480
that was interesting because you either had to slow down in the air to collect coins,

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:25.560
or you knocked the ground as fast as you could to continue racing, so it was a weird trade-off.

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:26.560
Interesting.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:34.600
The sub propeller, when you're underwater, whatever, that was stupid, it did nothing

01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:35.600
for me.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.600
And Star Fox?

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:43.080
Star Fox, I don't know if I had a single player, I played multiplayer though, and it felt a

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:49.080
lot like the multiplayer that was from the DS game, which I kind of liked, just really

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.080
nice looking.

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:56.320
What was cool though is that out of our four people battle, I totally killed everybody

01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:02.400
in one, and the little, not really a Nintendo rep that was hired for this event, she was

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.320
complaining because I killed her first.

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:09.000
Were you aiming for her because you can see her little picture or whatever?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Yes.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Is it just a static picture?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.600
There's a girl, clearly you have to make her feel inferior.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.600
It's a changing picture?

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.120
Does it get reactions like when you get blown up, like I'm thinking of that Burnout game?

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.120
Oh, how funny.

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:28.340
No, yeah, well, it's not a changing picture, it's a stream of you, so you can see what

01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:32.400
they're looking at, like if they're going to look up in the upper corner or something

01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:38.420
or if they make a weird face randomly, it's seriously refreshing but fairly slow.

01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:41.600
No picking your nose and playing Star Fox then?

01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:45.520
You could, but it'd be hard because of the way you have to hold the system, you know,

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.520
the system.

01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.360
All right, so that's cool, so it sounds like you got your hands on at least a lot of the

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.360
3DS titles today.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:55.080
What was your favorite out of the bunch?

01:57:55.080 --> 01:58:02.640
Probably a tie between Mario Kart and Kid Icarus, because I forgot to say Kid Icarus,

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.820
beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:11.520
The water in that game, as Nintendo's known to do, just was amazing, it blew me away.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:16.360
One more 3DS question, I'm not sure if you're aware, but Nintendo unloaded onto the eShop

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.420
today trailers for Animal Crossing and Paper Mario as well.

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:23.240
Were those games anywhere to be seen?

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:28.240
Not that I saw, because I really wanted to play at least Animal Crossing.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:34.000
I did download the trailer though when I got back to the hotel room for Animal Crossing,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.800
and I'm not sure if you guys talked about it or not, but it's got some really interesting

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:38.800
features.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:39.800
Oh, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.800
What's that?

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.800
It looks what?

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:46.080
I said it's got some really cool new features.

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.080
I'm not sure if you guys...

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.360
Yeah, Loki had a thing or two to say about it.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:51.360
Sitting on benches and swimming?

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.360
Awesome.

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360
Yeah.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.160
That's crazy.

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.960
Was your mind blown by swimming?

01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.960
I was like, oh my god, I can sit down!

01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:04.360
Wait, Mikolatov, did Animal Crossing have colored balloons?

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:07.960
No, no, it wasn't that cool.

01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960
All right.

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.400
Okay, then what else did you do at the show today?

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:15.480
So, you didn't stand in line for the Vita all day like Bobby had to.

01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.720
What did you get your hands on today?

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:25.160
Well, I also wanted to be thrown that I played Zelda as well on the 3DS, and it was fan-freaking-tastic.

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:30.360
That was a close call for my tie for best 3DS game I played.

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360
What does that...

01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:38.080
I mean, is it just the 3D to what many consider a classic video game that did it for you?

01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:41.200
Or did it feel new?

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.280
What was it that made it so great?

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:45.760
Or could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?

01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.680
Sorry, what did you say?

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:50.080
Could you tell you were playing a 13-year-old game?

01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:53.000
What made it so great?

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:58.100
I'm not sure I could tell I was playing a 13-year-old game.

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:04.600
I will say that the graphics are definitely much nicer.

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:07.600
The frame rate is crazy nice.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.600
The 3D effects, I didn't really care for.

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.920
It didn't really do anything for me.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:20.920
I did like people switching to the slingshot or the hookshot would allow you to move the

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:24.700
system around instead of using the directional pad to find your target.

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:25.700
That was neat.

02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:26.700
All right.

02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:29.400
Well, what else did you get to play at the show today?

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.400
Let's see.

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:36.360
I personally walked around, which is kind of a waste of a day.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.280
I played the new Silent Hill game, both in 3D and in 2D.

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.280
Interesting.

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.280
What'd you think?

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.200
Crap is what I think.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:53.240
It was terrible in 3D and it was terrible in 2D, so this is definitely a pass for me.

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.200
I'm not even interested.

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.200
Why was it terrible?

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:57.200
What did it play like?

02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:59.400
Was it more like the Wii Silent Hill, which I don't see anymore?

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.720
Was it more like Alan Wake?

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.720
Was it Alan Wake?

02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.720
What was it?

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:08.380
I wish it was like Alan Wake or even Shattered Memories.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:20.960
It was like a generic survival horror that ran really choppy and was boring and not scary.

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:25.960
At least in every other demo that I've played at E3 for a Silent Hill game, something has

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.320
been kind of freaky about it.

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.320
Not this one.

02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:31.520
It was just boring.

02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.320
It's not Silent Hill if it's not freaky.

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.720
Exactly.

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:38.680
And it was just dull.

02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:42.400
Like oh, there was an ending that jumped out and I think was supposed to scare me, but

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.880
this more annoyed me because they aren't scary.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.920
Speaking of scary, did you see the Tomb Raider stuff?

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:51.800
I don't know if it's playable on the show floor or whatever.

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.400
I found that that trailer seemed to be pretty, I mean, I don't know, we've had some differing

02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:01.120
opinions in here, but I compared it to The Descent, which I found to be a scary-ass movie.

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.880
The only thing I ever saw for Tomb Raider wasn't on the floor, it was during the Microsoft

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:07.240
Next conference.

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:12.800
So I was over in Corey Enix's booth for a bit today and I didn't see it anywhere, but

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:16.120
I was also playing the entire demo for Final Fantasy XIII-2.

02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.560
Ooh, what'd you think of that?

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.360
I actually really like XIII despite what other people think, so I like this one a lot.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:34.640
They added a few interesting features like a, what's that called, the real-time segments

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:41.640
like God of War and Heavy Rain tabs, which was, you know, it's a little out of place,

02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:43.140
but it was still neat.

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:49.840
They definitely tried to give players a little more freedom and faith with some options that

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:55.880
were like, you gotta take to attack this guy or go try to weaken him first by using this

02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:56.880
device.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.520
I hear if you went to attack him, you died, and you'd have to reset the whole bit of the

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:02.520
demo over again.

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.920
So I thought that was neat.

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:06.920
But no dress sphear.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:07.920
No dress sphears.

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.920
Do they have a release for that?

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:14.160
I definitely don't know who the main character is that I was playing as.

02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:17.680
Do they have a, I think it's supposed to be Lightning Sister, do they have a release for

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680
XIII-2 yet?

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:20.240
Loki, have we heard one?

02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.240
No.

02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:22.240
No?

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:23.240
No.

02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.240
No.

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.240
Wow.

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.240
Interesting.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:27.240
Interesting comment in our chatroom, chat.orangelandsradio.com.

02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:28.240
Jenai says, Silent Hills Konami Sonic now.

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.800
And Randi Yu says, wouldn't go that far, Sonic is laughably exhausted.

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.080
Frisbee Yu jumps in, speaking of Sonic, was Sega at E3?

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:39.200
Of course Sega was at E3.

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:47.160
I went over there quite a bit, looking at my darndest for PSA-2, but it wasn't there.

02:03:47.160 --> 02:03:48.160
Oh, I was just gonna ask.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:49.160
It might be somewhere.

02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:54.880
Surely you had to see if there was a Phantasy Star or online too, oh bummer they didn't

02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.880
bring that.

02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.800
Yeah, but there was a lot of Sonic stuff for their new Sonic game, and it actually didn't

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:01.800
look that bad.

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:03.800
I didn't get to play it though yet.

02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:04.800
Hmm.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:07.720
Alright, you'll have to let us know when you do finally get your hands on it.

02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720
What else?

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:14.040
There was this really neat Kinect game by Konami.

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:18.520
It was called Lead Me's, I believe.

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:23.840
It's both Kinect, and I believe it's a download title they said, but it plays a little bit

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:24.840
like Lemmings.

02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:31.440
So you stand in front of the Kinect sensor and you become this like wire frame character

02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:32.560
pretty much.

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:36.320
And you have these little adorable things that fall down and you have to get them to

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:41.080
safety by using your limbs as bridges, stuff like that.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.080
Interesting.

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:49.040
Okay, so like you use your body to build the path to get these guys safe, basically?

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.040
Yes.

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:51.040
Interesting.

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:56.000
Any other, I know you're a big fan of music games too, any music games that you saw besides

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.320
Dance Central 2?

02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:05.600
No, I saw DDR, but it's laughable nowadays, so it's not even worth talking about.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:11.120
Aww, but I kinda wanted to know how laughable it was.

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:15.400
It had four licenses, I believe, and the rest were not in the originals.

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:23.400
And what I watched looked like the character models looked like DDR PC quality, but not

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:24.400
as awesome.

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.400
Because there was no Mr. Spanky or anything like that, they were just like really poorly

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:29.960
done character models.

02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:31.960
Nobody loves Mr. Spanky.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:34.080
What was that?

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.080
Forget it.

02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:36.080
Oh, okay.

02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:42.000
I did not hear you, because I'm hearing me talk every time I talk, so...

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
D'Artesia says, no Dance Masters 2?

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.720
No Dance Masters 2.

02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:53.640
I do know the only thing that's behind closed doors at Konami, because I still have my hookup,

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.360
is Pro Evolution Soccer, so everything else that's on the floor is all they're showing.

02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.360
Interesting.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.080
And it's pretty sad also.

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:08.160
Like, this E3 has been kind of let down in terms of what's being shown, despite having

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:10.840
two new consoles.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:15.440
What about Dance Central 2, didn't you say you had some hands-on time with that?

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:22.480
Yeah, I played Dance Central 2, it was fantastic, but it was just Dance Central with new characters

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:23.880
and new moves.

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.480
Is Harmonic showing anything else at their booth?

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:28.200
Aren't they supposed to be unveiling a new game?

02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.240
Oh, I didn't see that at a Harmonic booth.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.400
I hadn't seen a Harmonic booth at all.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.400
That was at Microsoft.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.400
Interesting.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:37.640
So it must be kind of a behind closed doors thing, or in a conference room.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.640
Interesting.

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.640
Yeah, yeah.

02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:40.640
All right.

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:45.600
Well, anything else that you had some hands-on time with you want to share with us tonight?

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:47.600
I'm wrecking my brain.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:57.360
No, I want to play Nintendo a whole lot, but I saw a lot of neat games that were briefly

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:01.320
mentioned at the end of the press, or just via a title.

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:08.040
So I saw Risen Heaven, I saw the new Kirby game, of course I saw Legend of Zelda Skyward

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:12.200
Sword, which looks amazing now, I'm really excited for it.

02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:15.560
What's your plan for tomorrow?

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:21.360
I'm hoping a coin later to decide if I'm standing in line for Vita or Wii U.

02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:27.280
Personally, I'm leaning more towards Vita, because I don't really think I care much about

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.880
the Wii U at this point.

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:29.880
Ouch.

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:32.440
All right, yeah, we need someone to go play the Vita, and I don't know if Bobby will get

02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.240
around to it tomorrow, so I think you should do that.

02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:35.240
Do the Vita?

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:36.240
Yep.

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:37.240
Okay.

02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:38.240
I'll try that one.

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.240
All right.

02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:41.720
Well, anything else you want to share before we let you go so we can get to some other

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:46.080
callers from our chat room at 1877 Dean Waller?

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:47.080
The first thing...

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.600
Okay, this will be cool to some of those people out there.

02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:52.320
Let's start with the lamer one for a second.

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.320
Okay.

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:58.120
I was going down Hollywood Boulevard yesterday, because that's where my place I'm staying

02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:06.360
at is, and if people follow reality TV at all, or gay porn, I fully ran into Dustin

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:09.120
Tito from either Real World or Flat Pad.

02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:11.240
That was pretty funny.

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.040
The one with the sordid past, apparently, yes.

02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.040
Yes.

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:18.360
I wanted to just go up to him and be like, hey, I've seen you naked.

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.360
That might have been awkward.

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:21.360
I don't know.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.360
Yeah, just slightly.

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:27.440
But the actual cool thing that people may care about is right when I walked out of the

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:33.560
Nokia theater here today after Nintendo was done, I ran Snapchat instead of Kiriyamaoka.

02:08:33.560 --> 02:08:34.560
That was really cool.

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:35.560
Oh, nice.

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:37.200
Did you get a picture or anything, or say hello, or just...

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.720
Yeah, I got a picture, I said hello, we shook hands.

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.960
I tweeted him actually after the fact, and he tweeted back, and by him tweeting back

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:52.120
at me, somehow G4 is now following my Twitter, which is a waste of their time.

02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:57.480
It might be one of those spam Twitters, so look out, because I see a lot of those.

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:58.840
No, it's a real one.

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:00.840
I looked into it.

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:01.840
Weird.

02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.840
Well, whatever.

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.840
All right.

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.800
Well, Mikkelshof, enjoy the rest of the show.

02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.440
Get some hands on with Vita tomorrow and whatever else, and we'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440
Okay.

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.440
Sounds good.

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440
All right.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440
And try to stalk more celebrities for us.

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:14.440
Yes.

02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.440
All right.

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.440
I will do that.

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:17.440
Take care, buddy.

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:18.440
All right.

02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:19.440
Bye.

02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:22.040
We're running a little long tonight, but we will open it up for a few quick, quick calls

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:24.160
if anyone wants to call and just talk impressions.

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.160
What do you think?

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:26.160
Where are you at?

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:31.600
Are we completely off base with what we're saying about Wii U or Kinect or the Vita?

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:36.820
Give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:37.820
That's all one word.

02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:42.320
If you are going to use Skype to give us a call, please make sure you use ECHO123 first

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.320
before you give us a call.

02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:44.320
Again, what were your impressions?

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:48.240
I'm sure many of you, you know, I didn't want to just recap the news tonight with you guys

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.720
because I'm sure most of you were watching it.

02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:55.160
Although I'm liking hearing about these hidden things like that Konami game that sounds like

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.160
Lemmings.

02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.480
I want to hear about more of those types of games.

02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:01.040
So we'll see.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.040
All right.

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.620
Again, 1877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:07.520
Quick programming note, we are live tonight.

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.700
We are live tomorrow night.

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:14.480
We are off Sunday because Bobby Blackwolf and some of us here at OLR are going to go

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:17.040
celebrate E3 broadcast by going to Disneyland.

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:18.040
I'm sorry.

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:19.680
We're doing research for Disney Connect.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:21.920
We got to make sure that Disney Connect game is accurate.

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:22.920
Absolutely.

02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.640
And we will leave no stone unturned.

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:28.300
And there have to be hidden cats in the game for it to be accurate.

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:32.200
But we will be back next Sunday on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.760
That will be June the 19th.

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:39.600
Bobby Blackwolf will be here June the 12th, not here, but at allgames.com where he's usually

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.640
at June the 12th and of course on his podcast feed.

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.400
That's where you're going to hear his Thursday impressions since we will not be live Thursday

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:47.400
night.

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.960
So I hope everybody got the programming worked out there.

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:54.200
Again 1877 game OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:59.680
I have to point out, Sega did not announce a system.

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.080
So that's a no minus point.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.080
You didn't get buzzed on that.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:05.080
Exactly.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.640
I think I'm the only one that has a buzz so far because Sony did indeed apologize for

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:11.600
what had happened.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.600
And they showed Fable.

02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.360
I think they weren't going to show Fable either.

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.360
I don't remember.

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:17.360
All right.

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:18.360
Well, apology.

02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.760
It's kind of a gray area.

02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.480
He said they weren't even going to mention it.

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:23.480
Not true.

02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:24.480
Maybe.

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.480
Which they let off with by saying mentioning.

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:26.480
All right.

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:27.480
Let me get to the phones.

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:28.480
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:29.480
Who's this?

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:30.480
Hey, it's Sturlock.

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:31.480
Hey, Sturlock.

02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:32.480
How you doing, buddy?

02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.480
Pretty good.

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:34.480
How's E3 going for you?

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:35.480
What are your thoughts?

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:39.080
It looks pretty awesome.

02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.640
I really want a Vita.

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:42.960
Why?

02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.080
Street Fighter vs Tekken.

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:48.480
But can't you get that on the PS3 or the 360?

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:49.480
Yeah, but come on, man.

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.480
It's a portable version.

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.480
That's just awesome.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.760
What did you think about this whole announcement that Cole's in it as well?

02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:57.800
I was like, what?

02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:58.800
Okay.

02:11:58.800 --> 02:11:59.800
Whatever.

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:00.800
It's kind of random, right?

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:04.760
But, I mean, you got, I mean, it's pretty common for an Abaco, though.

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:09.960
I mean, you've got Tekken characters and, like, urban rain, so.

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.120
I guess that's true.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:19.480
They do that kind of stuff all the time, but Nintendo, I don't know, I still can't get

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:21.080
my head around this name.

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:22.960
Yeah, I know.

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:26.640
The name's a little weird, but remember, I mean, and I don't like the name either, to

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:27.640
be honest.

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:30.080
I think they should have just called it the Nintendo U, and we could have just all said,

02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:33.920
oh, the U stands for Ultra or something like that, you know?

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.660
Or if they wanted to go back to, like, the old school, they could have called it the

02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:41.420
U-Force, like that old peripheral.

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.920
That's a super Wii.

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:44.920
I like the Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii-Ou-Wii.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:50.120
Yeah, I've been doing that all day, too, I was just like, oh my god.

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.240
So, damn it, where was I going with this?

02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.880
Everybody's got an opinion on the Wii U.

02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:03.080
What do you think of the console itself besides just the name?

02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.880
Which I do think everyone will get used to eventually, by the way.

02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:08.380
Ooh, do we have a network outage?

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.380
I think we did.

02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.380
I think we had a drop.

02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:11.380
Shit.

02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:15.000
Did we have a drop stream?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.520
I don't know if we're even still broadcasting at this point.

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.520
I think we are.

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.880
But we had an internet, okay, we had an internet downtime.

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:27.000
I think we're, oh wow, we just reconnected right away with Strelok.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Okay, yeah, we had a weird drop thing happen there, so that's weird.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
But we're back.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Silly internets.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Yeah, silly internets.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Yes.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
All right, well, whatever.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.720
So, what's on your mind with the Wii U?

02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:45.000
Well, I'd like to see more from it than just the spectrum of stuff.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:51.120
The controller is kind of interesting, even though I honestly really can't use too much

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:52.120
of it.

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:56.480
But it's an interesting concept.

02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:03.840
But really what has me excited is something from the Microsoft, it's not the only thing

02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:08.320
that I really cared about from the Microsoft press conference, but something that kind

02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:21.280
of touched on briefly was the whole Bing thing with Kinect, where you could tell it what

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:23.280
to play.

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.160
If you want to search for a game and then play it by voice, you can do that.

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.520
And that's really exciting.

02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:31.680
Xbox, Bing, pornography.

02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:32.680
Yes.

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.680
Awesome.

02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:34.680
Indeed.

02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:43.160
A lot of people are kind of on what Microsoft showed.

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.320
What did you think of the press conference overall?

02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.520
Overall, the Microsoft conference, yeah, exactly, was just kind of like, really, more shooters.

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:50.520
Don't care.

02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:52.080
Too many first-person shooters, huh?

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:53.080
Too many shooters.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.080
It's oversaturated.

02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.080
All right.

02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:57.200
We're going to let you guys go get some other calls before we do.

02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.880
Any other final thoughts for us?

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:02.880
I'm just one more.

02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:08.720
I want Konami to announce the Snatcher game, but that didn't happen.

02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:10.200
Sadly, it's probably not going to.

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:11.200
Don't hold your breath.

02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:12.200
I was going to say.

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:13.200
All right.

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.200
All right, buddy.

02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.200
We're going to let you go get some more calls, but have a good one, okay?

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:16.200
All right.

02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:17.200
Thanks.

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.200
All right.

02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.200
Thank you.

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:20.200
Thanks for putting up with the internet outage, too.

02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:21.200
That was kind of weird.

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:22.200
It's just another day here at OLR.

02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.200
Yeah, I've been having...

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:24.200
Hey, what's up, guys?

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.200
This is Kaijuto.

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.200
Hey, Kaijuto.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:27.200
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:33.320
Yeah, that the Wii U, the controller, scares the fucking hell out of me.

02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:35.760
Why does it scare you?

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:38.480
I mean, it looks like it's going to break.

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.760
I mean, all the stuff they want you to do with it doesn't seem very safe for the controller,

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.080
like putting it down on the floor, sticking it on that gun and swinging it around.

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:49.080
I don't know.

02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:51.120
It just looks like a lot of kids are going to break that thing.

02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:54.160
You know, I think you're kind of onto something here, because I can't tell you, and this is

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.760
kind of embarrassing, but I can't tell you how many headsets I've broken on my computer,

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:00.160
because I'll sit it down on my chair when I get up to go to the bathroom, and then I

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:03.120
come back, crunch, my fat ass sits on it and crunches it.

02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:04.400
So you have to be really careful.

02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:05.800
Like, you're going to need...

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.980
Everybody needs a coffee table to put that controller on, and that's away from the dogs

02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:12.640
and the cats that tend to do this.

02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:14.920
Yeah, it's like the big glass on it.

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:16.400
It's like, you know, it just...

02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:20.560
To me, it feels like it's going to just break within a couple of weeks.

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.560
Let's be real.

02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.660
It's not really glass.

02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:25.040
It's that cheap, plasticky thing that the DS has used.

02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:27.040
It's the same touchscreen from a DS, just bigger.

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.040
Oh, yeah, I did not.

02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:29.040
Those get broken.

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.040
It looks like glass to me.

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.040
Yeah, they will get...

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:33.040
It'll still get broken, but yeah.

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:34.040
So...

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:39.400
Well, let's say that controller is invincible.

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.400
What is your thoughts about Wii U otherwise?

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:46.560
As far as, like, being innovative, I think they're going somewhere with it.

02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:50.880
I'm going to agree with Bobby Blackwell if I saw a lot of potential with what they were

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:51.880
showing that you could do with it.

02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:57.160
I mean, it's still not something that I want to run out and get right away until I see

02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:03.080
something that I really like, but you know, I do appreciate them for trying to bring some

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:08.000
innovation to the game where even though they're recycling the same old games, you know, just

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:18.080
putting Mario on everything, but other than that, they are innovative with their shit.

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:20.440
At what point would Nintendo be charging too much?

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:22.480
I get a lot of feedback, by the way, just to let you know.

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.720
I'm like hearing myself talking about it.

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:25.720
Yeah, and we have an Echo thing going on, but just...

02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.520
Well, do you have the Ustream running, because you've got to pause it.

02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:36.640
The other thing is, at what price do you think the Wii U becomes too expensive right now?

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:37.640
$399.

02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:38.640
$399.

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.360
So, if it's $398, you might be there.

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:43.360
No, no.

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:46.040
No, I get it at $298.

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.040
Alright.

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.040
$299, $298.

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.880
Alright, well, Kajuda, we're going to let you go to see if we can get another call,

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.160
but thanks so much for the call.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.160
Take care, buddy.

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.160
Alright.

02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:56.160
Good night.

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:57.160
Good night.

02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:58.160
Later.

02:17:58.160 --> 02:17:59.160
877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:05.200
Give us a call, and as we start to wrap up here while we wait for one more call, where

02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.200
are you guys at?

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:10.680
You know, a lot of people feel the need to rank Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony, but let

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.200
me kind of leave it here with this.

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:17.360
Out of what we've talked about tonight, what are you most excited about?

02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:20.880
What are you most interested in hearing more about?

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:21.880
Dark Sakura?

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:22.880
Animal Crossing.

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:23.880
No, really.

02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:32.880
To be honest, I'm still actually kind of meh about a bunch of it, really.

02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:39.400
There were things I had hoped to see that didn't pop out, and really, it was a lot

02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.040
more of what I expected, although I do really like that new controller.

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.760
I'm more excited about that controller for the Wii U, even though the name is, you know,

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:48.760
stupid.

02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:51.760
Alright, we'll get to the other feedback in studio here in a minute, but we do have

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:53.280
another call coming in, so let's get to that.

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.280
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:55.280
Who's this?

02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:57.280
Hey, this is Blender from Napo.

02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:58.280
What's going on?

02:18:58.280 --> 02:18:59.280
Blender!

02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:00.280
What's on your mind?

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:01.280
Nothing.

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:04.480
I just, I, one thing I don't know if you guys mentioned, I was like five minutes late

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:11.400
getting into the show, and nobody mentioned, I was really interested in the BioShock Infinite

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.440
with the move support.

02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:17.920
You're right, we did kind of skip over that, and that is kind of a big deal, yeah.

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:21.960
I didn't even, I gotta be honest, I was really terrible, and I didn't even play that

02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:26.160
far into the first BioShock game, but I was all over this look of the new game, it's

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:27.160
awesome.

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:30.040
With the whole like, air rails and stuff, that game looks sweet.

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.800
I'll finally get to wipe the cobwebs off of my move.

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.600
What did you think about Ken Levine's little kind of comment?

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:44.040
He had this, it was almost awkward to me a little bit, his little interlude about how

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.320
he's finally got won over by the move.

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:48.320
He sold out.

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:49.320
Yeah.

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:51.600
Sony said, hey guys, guys, money.

02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.600
And they're like, oh, we like money, and they're like, alright, put move support in

02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:56.600
your game.

02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:00.000
And they're like, oh, okay, and say something good about the move for us.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.320
Alright, I can do that, because I like money.

02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:06.000
It was like Gabe Newell last year with the whole Valve thing, but.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Exactly.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.640
Well, what else caught your eye, Blinder?

02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:16.480
Well, I just, Uncharted 3, of course, I'm just a huge Uncharted fan, the multiplayer

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:17.480
looks fantastic.

02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:24.680
But, other than that, well, see, I only own one system, I only own the Sony, so.

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.920
So there's not a lot for you on the other ones.

02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:31.860
Did maybe, I have to ask it, did Microsoft or Nintendo maybe make you think twice about

02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:33.760
picking up another one?

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:38.000
Not Nintendo, but Microsoft, I mean, I'm still kind of on the edge.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:45.400
I mean, I'm not a fanboy, if I had the money, I would pick up another system, you know.

02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:54.280
But it's just, mainly what I've been listening to is just for the Microsoft thing, would

02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:59.680
be like, if they did it, they need to make a Kinect, like an L.A. Noire Kinect game.

02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:01.560
That would tell me.

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:04.000
Where I can just slap the bitch if I think they're lying.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Pop!

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.000
All right.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.400
Have your partner do, hey, go over there and go investigate this for me, I'm gonna go have

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:11.400
a beer.

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:12.400
All right.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:14.320
Blinder, any other last thoughts for us before we let you go?

02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.320
No, that's it.

02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:16.320
All right.

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:17.320
Take care.

02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:18.320
We'll see you later.

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:19.320
All right, you too.

02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:20.320
All right, bye.

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:21.320
All right.

02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:22.320
We are gonna go ahead and close the Skype line, guys.

02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:23.320
I'm very sorry to those folks that didn't get through.

02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:26.520
Don't forget, we're gonna be back tomorrow, and we'll have a little more time to take

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:27.520
more calls tomorrow.

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:29.600
So if you didn't get through tonight, don't be mad.

02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:32.240
You can also email us mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:35.900
We will go to the mailbag tomorrow, because we won't have press conferences.

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:38.000
We're gonna hear about other games tomorrow.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.000
We still haven't talked Skyrim.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.720
We gotta talk a little bit about Skyrim.

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:43.360
Some of the other games, we'll probably dive into Bioshock a little more.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.400
Whatever it is that Bobby and Shane can get their hands on, we're gonna talk a little

02:21:46.400 --> 02:21:50.120
more about tomorrow, and your calls will really help fill in and email us tomorrow.

02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:51.640
And Chibi Wolf.

02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:52.640
And Chibi Wolf.

02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:53.640
Let's hope.

02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:56.380
For now, I wanna go around and get everybody's kind of last thought here.

02:21:56.380 --> 02:22:00.360
And again, guys, sorry to cut it off, but we were only intending on going till nine,

02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:01.640
and it's almost 9.30.

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:05.560
So I wanna try and wrap up, and everybody's being a real trooper for staying with us.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:09.280
But Dan, what are you walking away from this most excited about?

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:10.840
The Wii U.

02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:11.840
The Wii U.

02:22:11.840 --> 02:22:12.840
Wii Wii Wii.

02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:14.880
Why is that?

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:17.260
It could be really awesome.

02:22:17.260 --> 02:22:18.560
Or it could fucking suck.

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.560
No, I'm just kidding.

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.560
Well, and that's exactly it.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:24.800
If Nintendo comes through with the price, and they come through with the games, and

02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.320
you know, some people do some great development for it, I mean, it could be really, really

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:30.960
smooth.

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:32.720
And it could do a lot of cool stuff.

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:35.080
Or it could be an absolute waste of technology.

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.220
And Nintendo's scary, because Nintendo does that.

02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:40.840
Sometimes Nintendo hits something, and they just knock it out of the park.

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:45.400
And then sometimes Nintendo's just like, yeah, look at our great thing!

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:47.240
We have no fucking idea what to do with it.

02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:50.600
I mean, the Vita is really cool.

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:54.260
And I mean, I kinda knew it was gonna be a really cool thing.

02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:59.080
And when Sony came through with pricing, that wasn't, you know, ridiculous, because I swore.

02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:04.000
I swore they were gonna say, $599 US dollars, and everybody was gonna laugh them out of

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
the arena.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.600
When they said $250, and everyone was like, alright.

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:14.200
You know, I was like, okay, maybe Sony's learned a thing, but it's just a better PSP.

02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:17.840
Where the Vita could be something completely new.

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:20.560
They didn't just say, okay, here's a new Wii controller.

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:25.720
They said, here's a new, different thing that no one's done before.

02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:28.280
And that could be pretty slick.

02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:29.280
I'm with you there.

02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:32.660
I wanna go to chat real quick, because one of the other games that's being brought up

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:35.040
in chat right now that we didn't get into depth about today.

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:37.360
Randy Yu says, Batman, Batman, Batman.

02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:41.240
And Blender says, did you see the Catwoman trailer, Randy Yu, which, you know, was shown

02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:42.240
at one of the press conferences.

02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:47.240
Now I gotta say, there were two things out of the whole three press conferences that

02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:51.440
made me audially, audible say, wow.

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:54.220
I said wow twice during the press conferences.

02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:57.080
One of them was the $499 3D monitor.

02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:58.080
I said wow.

02:23:58.080 --> 02:24:01.840
The other one was when they announced that Batman Arkham City was gonna be on the Wii

02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:02.840
U.

02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:03.840
Batman on Nintendo.

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:05.400
That's just, I don't know why.

02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:06.560
It's just crazy to me.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:10.780
Well, and if they don't have to make huge graphic compromises, it means that the Wii

02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:14.400
U has at least the horsepower of the current generation of consoles.

02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:15.400
Correct.

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:16.400
So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.040
Uh, Loki, I know you still need to answer.

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:19.800
I will, uh, let me go first here.

02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.600
Uh, I'm gonna say the thing I am most excited to see more about, I'm gonna be honest.

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:26.560
I'm gonna go kind of off the beaten path here a little bit.

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:29.120
Although the Wii U, yes, of course I'm gonna see more of that.

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:33.880
I really just feel like, I just, everything is fucking speculation till next year.

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:35.760
You know, it's, it's so, so early.

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.600
Now we know that most of the rumors were true and we've seen where they're going with it.

02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:46.400
But for me, the more immediate question, I actually want to see these hardcore games

02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.080
with the Kinect functionality.

02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:50.320
I want to see how the public responds to it.

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:59.580
I want to see, I, when I play Kinect, I do really like it and I, I really want so much

02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:03.920
more out of the Kinect and I'm just, I'm really curious how some of these shooters are going

02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:04.920
to play.

02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:09.880
I mean, I kind of even want to play the Ghost Recon game just to check it out.

02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:12.080
That is never a game I'd be interested in otherwise.

02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:13.080
It's so weird.

02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:14.120
I'll save you the trouble.

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:18.040
The response is going to be, eh.

02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:20.360
But maybe like two people are going to like buy it.

02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:24.960
It's just like, that's what Twitter will say, but what will the dollars say?

02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:26.800
That's what, that's what the dollars are going to say.

02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:27.800
You think?

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:28.800
I, I, I disagree.

02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.680
In my life, I've dealt with a lot of mainstream gamers.

02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:38.000
I've worked at game stores for 10 years and I've seen those guys come into the store and

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:46.320
the Twitter crowd, as much as I hate to say it, is kind of the voice of the quote unquote

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:47.760
hardcore gamer.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:53.360
The guy who cares enough to be sitting on the computer watching that press conference

02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:56.960
and not because he's going to come on here tonight and talk about it.

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:00.040
You know, there's just not going to be a lot of interest.

02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:01.040
Fair enough.

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:02.040
You know, it'd be sweet.

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:03.480
It'd be sweet if they could pull it off.

02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:06.240
I'm the first guy to admit I have an unopened connect.

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:12.840
It's Jamie's and uh, if they did something sufficiently awesome, that would make me rip

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.840
into that thing.

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:14.840
I mean, I would love it.

02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:19.840
I'm probably going to open it now just to try connect labs, but it's just like, wow,

02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.360
I would love to see the shooter that, you know, you could stand in front of your TV

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.720
and play and not have it be a real shooter or hell, even just the light gun game.

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:29.280
Cause I totally missed light gun games.

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:31.040
Well, the Wii U is going to have a lot of this.

02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:32.040
Yeah.

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:34.920
Like, you know, I was complaining about the on rail stuff and that's all I connect do.

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:35.920
You know what though?

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.560
Like ghost squad on the Wii is fucking awesome.

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.960
Squad is an awesome game and the Wii Zapper is a good ghost squad control.

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.520
I wanted the ghost squad rifle.

02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:45.520
Okay.

02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:46.520
That's a little too far.

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:52.880
Cause it's got the little trigger and it's got the pull thing, but I wanted the ghost

02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:56.260
squad rifle to be the Xbox 360 rifle and it just never happened.

02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.160
I like that new connect looking rifle, or not connect, the move rifle, by the way, it

02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.160
was cool.

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.320
I got to say though, Dan, I'm not disagreeing with your perspective necessarily about like

02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:07.480
who the hardcore gamers are and all that, but I got to say, I really think that with

02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:14.640
no Wii U this year, Microsoft kind of has that Nintendo soccer mom casual market cornered

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:16.040
this year.

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:19.880
And it's, it's just going to be interesting to see what connect games rise to the top.

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:25.600
Will it just be dance central to number one seller this year or will that connect functionality

02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:27.320
float a hardcore game up to the top?

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:31.480
Well, they need to come up with, you know, their Wii sports resort or with their Wii

02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:32.520
fit.

02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:35.360
That one game that just every connect owner has to have.

02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:36.360
Dance central.

02:27:36.360 --> 02:27:37.360
I think it's dance central.

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:38.600
But it's not dance central.

02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:43.400
All the dance fans love dance central, but the common folks aren't just like, oh man,

02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:44.400
dance central.

02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:47.080
Because I was in a room full of common people the other day and nobody really liked dance

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.080
central.

02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:49.080
Really?

02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:51.920
I would say dance central, not just like music fans like us who've been following a few years,

02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:55.120
but like rock band fans, which is a much wider audience.

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:56.120
All right.

02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:57.120
Air guitar freaks.

02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:58.120
We've got to get towards wrapping up.

02:27:58.120 --> 02:27:59.120
Yes.

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.120
I've got to let Loki have his say.

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:02.120
Loki, what left you wanting more?

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:04.880
Saints Row 3.

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:06.400
Air Saints Row the Third.

02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:07.400
It's awesome.

02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.640
And god damn it, I wish they'd just announce a new Grand Theft Auto and be done with it.

02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:12.640
No kidding.

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:14.280
And Half Life 2 Episode 3.

02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:15.280
Fuck you, Valve.

02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:16.280
Fuck you right in the ear.

02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:17.280
We know it's coming.

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:18.280
I mean, come on.

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.380
Just, just, just come out and say it.

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:23.520
You know, that's, that's really it.

02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:24.520
All right.

02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:25.520
Fuck Valve.

02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:29.840
And the fact that, you know, so what Nintendo's console can play Batman Arkham Asylum.

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:30.840
You know what?

02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.600
The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 can also play that.

02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:34.600
Why do I care?

02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:35.920
A year earlier.

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.640
I, yeah, and I'm not gonna go buy, you know, a console just because they can play a game

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:44.280
of a console that I can already have.

02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:49.600
I want to see what titles Nintendo's gonna have that are exclusive to this that are actually

02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.040
gonna be worth my time instead of saying, hey, lookit, we got this really cool thing.

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.680
Because here's the problem.

02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:00.840
They're hoping that the publishers are, you know, gonna be creative enough to use this

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:02.640
technology that they built.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.320
Last time I checked, it never was a problem that, oh, these games aren't creative enough.

02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:14.160
It's oh, we just don't give a crap about fleshing up this game to the point of, you know, attracting

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:18.480
other people other than casual gamers because, eh, casual gamers still just buy whatever

02:29:18.480 --> 02:29:23.560
as long as it's $19.99.

02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:24.560
Alright.

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:28.920
Well, um, anything you guys are hoping, well, Loki, you're not gonna be here tomorrow.

02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:30.920
No, I'm not gonna be here.

02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:34.400
And Dan will be here and Dark Soccer and myself.

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:37.880
But since you kind of have, this is your last chance to say whatever you want on the show

02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:41.660
here about E3 till next Sunday, anything else you kind of want to get out about your thoughts

02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:42.660
on the show?

02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:48.280
Um, I mean, other than just like some of the stuff that's already been, there's nothing

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:52.320
really that's like brand new, nothing out of those conferences that was really just

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.800
caught me off guard.

02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:59.800
You know, um, I don't know, it was just no real surprises, nothing like, oh my God, that's

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:00.800
so amazing.

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:01.800
And you could see it.

02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:03.040
The crowds weren't into it.

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:08.020
There were like one or two pops when something that they were supposed to pop at came.

02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:13.400
There were a lot of pauses where the companies expected applause and nobody was into it.

02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:16.240
It was a very apathetic attitude.

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:21.480
Even the big stuff that people were supposed to be into just didn't win people over.

02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:26.840
All right, we'll be back tomorrow to do some more E3 coverage.

02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:32.420
Dark Soccer, myself, Dan, and you guys in our chat room and of course in LA, a big thanks

02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:36.840
of course to Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, Miklotov are both in LA and they will be back with

02:30:36.840 --> 02:30:38.960
more game opinions tomorrow.

02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:42.240
But for tonight, we say goodnight.

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:43.360
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:48.080
We'll see you back here tomorrow at our little temporary space here on Ustream, seven o'clock

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:50.360
Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:54.880
No video yet, but hopefully you stream in the future and not tomorrow either, but you

02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:55.880
stream in the future.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:31:00.040
We might have some more video features, kind of like we used to back in the day on OLR.

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:02.720
So besides that, I'm so completely unglamorous right now.

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.600
I can't be on video or it will explode.

02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:07.120
So that's going to do it for our E3 coverage tonight.

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:09.680
We'll be back tomorrow, seven o'clock Pacific, 10 o'clock Eastern.

02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:10.680
We'll see you here.

02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:12.600
Email us, mailbag at orangeauceredi.com.

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:13.600

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:15.200
