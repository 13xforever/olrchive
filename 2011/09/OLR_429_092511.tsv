14438	15439	Don't listen to this part.
15539	16139	It's lies.
16179	16760	It was last week.
16780	19561	Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and it's pink.
19942	22643	The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch.
23003	26866	And Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN Terms of Service.
27746	30868	Orange Lounge Radio.
32289	38293	Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.
38993	43756	I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.
44862	53784	Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Lady Tron tonight in San Francisco.
55685	57025	So anyway, what are we?
58085	65567	We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice, be it digitized or if we're saying it for you or whatever.
66349	79663	So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff and we tape live every week on allgamesradio.com and that starts at 6 o'clock pacific time right after the Bobby Blackwell show and if you're listening to us live get in our chat room.
80123	84167	It's chat.orangeradio.com and we are on Game Surge server.
84948	86950	So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?
87506	88387	Thanks for watching!
106338	109500	But thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool.
110160	114362	Although we didn't get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.
114403	116263	It drops us every now and then.
118205	119585	More often than every now and then.
120766	121646	Pretty often, actually.
123127	126648	Um, and then, you know, Grand Theft Auto is the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.
126948	129649	Um, still trying to keep my winning streak going.
130489	133210	And, um, what else did I try?
134010	140832	Well, actually, it wasn't really game related, but I did mess around with the, um, Xbox Marketplace a little bit.
141132	144152	Uh, watched, my wife wanted to watch an episode of Up All Night.
144532	147913	And, uh, so we watched that real quick and actually worked out pretty good.
147953	150394	Never really used the Zoom Marketplace before, so that's kind of neat.
151495	157759	And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy, some of the Xbox Live Indie games.
157779	159200	And man, there's some weird shit on there.
159600	160821	I don't even know.
161942	164303	There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.
164403	168746	There was The Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.
169647	170307	Looks hilarious.
170687	172248	I didn't pick it up, though, but...
173209	202448	just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great but it is kind of hard to navigate everything so hopefully they fix that and maybe with one of these updates maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little bit so it's easier to find stuff I think that's really all that I've played maybe a little bit more Zelda I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week but yeah that's about it I played WoW that's it
204042	205223	Well, you're consistent.
229855	230835	Thanks for watching!
249602	257345	But yes, the Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th and of course they do have some details on what it's going to cost you.
257785	260306	They have different subscription packages.
260386	261786	You can go month to month which is $14.99.
262226	268809	Of course each game does come with a 30 day subscription that runs out and after 30 days you have to pay for it.
270489	292454	if you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum you will save a little bit of money 3 months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month and then 6 months at a time $12.99 a month so if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time maybe the lump sums are the way to go you know what?
292834	299536	I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online and now I'm very glad I didn't because it's going free to play yeah
301130	302651	I would advise everyone to hold off.
303212	311099	Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them are going free to play, but six months isn't bad.
311460	313942	I imagine that Star Wars game is going to be around for at least six months.
314850	317031	Yeah, well, who knows?
317271	324714	I mean, I quit playing, well, no, that was February of, no, I started playing in February.
324734	326374	I quit actually a year ago.
327515	328735	Star Trek Online, this month.
329295	329555	Wow.
330456	331276	Nope, in two months, sorry.
331316	336718	Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime thing, don't do it.
337018	337558	Don't do it.
339099	340959	Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.
341360	342380	Well, maybe that's worth it.
344622	351245	Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.
351545	354666	John Smedley is saying they're a free-to-play model for DC.
354706	355086	Sony.
355386	355686	Sony?
356147	357007	Sony Entertainment.
357447	358328	I don't know why I said Sony.
358388	359088	Online Entertainment.
359748	360148	You know what?
361169	361689	I'm derp.
363049	363950	I'm still mad at Rob.
364170	364830	I'm still mad at Rob.
365711	366651	I'm not really mad at Rob.
368031	368332	Okay.
369672	374234	Sony Online Entertainment has a free-to-play model for DC Universe Online.
375749	378711	So it's going to be three membership levels.
378731	380453	There's free, premium, and legendary.
381273	386997	And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.
387438	395804	So free players will have two character slots, and you downloadable game packs and updates, additional character slots you can pay for them.
396004	398066	I refuse to use the term microtransaction.
398926	402048	Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.
402708	405909	That's including former subscribers and in-game item purchasers.
405969	409031	We'll have additional character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.
409691	413132	Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.
413773	417775	More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.
419535	422397	And this is happening really soon, as in next week.
422637	422877	Yeah.
424077	425198	So that means I can play the game.
425868	428091	Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
444625	448028	Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free-to-play.
448568	452311	I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free-to-play, God, I don't know.
452972	454152	I may have to get back into that.
455954	457355	Nelly will wonder what happened to you.
457655	470245	Well, no, it's not that big of a deal, because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself paying, I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was only playing it maybe one evening a month.
471746	472567	I can't see myself...
473087	474448	Thank you for watching!
491094	500122	Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the reason why the Old Republic did announce to be shipping this year.
500502	502323	Diablo 3 is actually going to launch early 2012.
502764	504946	It's not going to make it out this year, unfortunately.
506387	513894	They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period, of course, since obviously the game's going to be coming out later on.
513934	514134	They have
514574	518055	More time to test it and hopefully get any kinks out of it.
519195	526557	Of course, they're saying, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.
527177	528477	We were too.
529157	537419	Of course, ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives up to our expectations and yours as well.
537779	541200	We should take a little more time to add further polish to a few different elements of the game.
541460	543382	So, in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.
543522	545004	So, that's fine.
545204	545864	What else is new?
547086	548607	There's too much stuff coming out this year, anyway.
549408	562360	Yeah, I've just... They actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft, by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh, you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give us your password, blah, blah, blah.
562401	564503	If you give anyone your password, you're stupid.
564523	565604	Sorry.
565624	565864	Sorry.
567728	570952	Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III Diablo III
586360	602741	whatever well anyway so let's move forward into other news shall we shall speaking of Blizzard they are talking about patch 4.3 which everyone has been all abuzz about in game you know we get transmogrifying that means you can make your new shit look like old shit
603522	604803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
623888	624488	Well, you know what?
624528	630230	Actually, in the Firelands, the first boss has a dog with him named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.
631230	633931	His attack is called Face Rage.
634811	635791	So we just call it Face Rape.
636251	636591	That's awesome.
636871	637071	Yeah.
638392	641413	Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around.
641813	647754	Because before, all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the ground and not in the air.
648694	650875	Trust me, it took forever to get that stupid achievement.
651810	654693	So, he's going to be a raid.
654713	660379	You actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and the whole thing is going to end on the dragon's back.
660539	666726	So, you have to pull off pieces of his plate armor as he's spinning down into the maelstrom.
667847	671471	And then, you know, get all stabby on him and maybe try to kill him.
671571	673873	Or at least, you know, make him really pissed off at you.
675999	679705	It's supposed to be really, really huge.
680046	687237	And I was reading some of the technical development behind it and they said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.
688298	690983	I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's going to be forever.
691483	691964	Thanks for watching!
708264	708604	So that's it.
708624	708684	Hmm.
735572	756967	And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing Smackdown This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week Talking about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects The folding at home is a really popular one Well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit
757747	765774	And what Foldit is, is it's not just, you know, folding with your actual system or PC or whatever that you're using.
766114	768916	It does require some human interaction as well.
769016	772819	So kind of use, think of it like mind folding, I guess.
774020	781646	Basically, they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus worked and stuff like that.
782487	785109	Also cancer and Alzheimer's as well.
785849	812130	and I guess these are related to proteins and what the project does is I guess basically it's spatial recognition or something where players will I'm not really sure what you do but apparently it has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in here they have I guess figured out how these actually work now so
813191	813812	Thanks for watching!
830927	843099	Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem-solving skills to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction mythology.
843900	852868	Players collaborate with teammates while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and proof-of-concept tests.
853208	854570	Foldit players most of
855231	870088	who have little or no background in biochemistry were able to solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.
871069	874593	Here we report folded player successes in real world...
875354	885838	Real-world modeling problems with complex deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein crystal structure problem.
886658	894200	And they said basically, yeah, this is going to possibly lead to a cure for this stuff.
894300	896441	So that's pretty amazing.
896943	902365	Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?
902985	903245	Yeah.
903585	910608	Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to them in a term that they're going to understand it.
913725	929877	The critical role of folded players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging scientific problems.
930337	942223	Although much attention has been recently given to the potential of crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.
942283	948065	These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real-world scientific process.
948886	957570	The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that, if properly directed, can be used to solve a wide range of scientific problems.
957950	966274	So you never know, they may be just using this for other diseases, obviously potentials unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?
966494	973317	Well, I was reading before that they had broken, what was it, one of the HIV virus models, right?
973378	974458	Yeah, this is what that's about.
975018	982182	So, I mean, think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about anything.
983562	987324	It really is a good way to get new resources.
987344	993147	Because any type of research, if it hits a dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.
993827	995868	And the Foldit thing hasn't even been around that long.
995948	1004171	It's basically 236,000 players, which as far as compared to Folding the Home, I think that's a lot less than what they've got.
1004632	1005272	Instead, I guess...
1006012	1026558	That they've been working together the last three years And it only took them ten days to unravel that actual scientific problem there So that one alone, ten days with that many people Can you imagine if they just integrated this into all the places that the folding at home stuff is?
1027258	1033020	It could be pretty powerful And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation
1034985	1059736	this is a lot of even though they have it set up as a competition in the end it's a lot of people working together and they're getting results by people having a common goal and working towards it and I think that we could all stand to learn something from that yeah cool so moving forward man that's actually super cool though I mean I'm still kind of whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it actually makes my brain hurt a little bit
1060851	1067176	So, how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly, it's not surprising.
1067656	1071339	28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature.
1071680	1073901	They say it detracts from their games.
1075162	1088593	There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned it off altogether.
1089914	1102063	56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected to a TV with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.
1103843	1105764	Well, I think right now it's still really early.
1106044	1110465	I mean, it's just, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.
1111345	1114246	And even this, I mean, goes to Nintendo.
1114386	1122709	I mean, some of their design choices in games are really stupid, especially like with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D.
1122749	1123369	That doesn't work.
1123829	1132595	It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a certain perspective that you view the screen at.
1132915	1137618	And if you're turning and tilting the screen around, it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.
1138159	1143502	Granted, you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play with it without tilt controls.
1143642	1153369	But, I mean, to fully utilize the game, it's kind of impossible the way that they have it, I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that, which is kind of stupid.
1154250	1157793	Um, but yeah, 3D consoles, I think, is definitely the way to go.
1158154	1163359	Have you noticed, though, that some people, when they play a game that requires turning and things, that they'll lean with their controller?
1164821	1165902	Yeah, when you're five.
1166122	1167824	I mean, I don't think anyone does that anymore.
1168244	1169245	I do if I really get into it.
1169285	1174050	Like, when I was playing Katamari, though, I'd get motion sick, so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.
1174431	1175392	Yeah, I see.
1175412	1175432	I...
1176818	1178120	I don't need my little pony in 3D
1192344	1193266	I don't know.
1193947	1202459	I don't really... The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid PR shot of people playing a video game and they're so excited!
1202499	1205624	They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.
1206305	1207988	But, I mean, it's just...
1209480	1209720	3D Glasses
1227659	1228279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1249415	1250316	Is this the one with Blu-ray?
1250416	1253519	I mean, he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.
1254380	1263850	He hasn't had time to game and that kind of stuff, but there's a lot of people out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of
1265467	1266087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1285818	1304070	so there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about the 3DS 3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox 360 but
1307432	1323209	but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really well actually I guess Gears 3 did but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much it's mainly just the third parties the cross platform stuff like you know Batman Arkham Asylum or
1323809	1326050	Yeah, actually, Arkham Asylum had 3D support.
1326911	1334075	Not the stereoscopic shutter glasses 3D, but the red cyan glasses.
1334155	1339519	And then they also have... But Arkham City does have 3D support, and there's some other games that do support 3D.
1340059	1344902	It's just not really advertised widely, I guess.
1348044	1348204	Huh.
1350808	1360344	Well, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old school Cyan Magenta, like the newer ones, right?
1361246	1363029	That you don't really see Cyan and Magenta anymore.
1364224	1381729	I've honestly I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff I mean it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see that but I've never I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the color
1382887	1384249	Release dates Release dates
1399208	1403414	The US is still going to have a lot of stuff coming out this week.
1404416	1407059	Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter, technically.
1407680	1414470	So, starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii coming out a little bit later than the rest of the platforms.
1415530	1416971	Some re-releases from THQ.
1416991	1418472	They've got a Beach Fun 2 pack.
1418552	1420433	It's just some of their old party games.
1420953	1423735	And a Game Show Fun pack, which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.
1424055	1426476	That's on the Wii.
1426576	1428977	Gunslinger from Valcon.
1429077	1432779	It's a generic on-rails shooter game for the Wii.
1432899	1434960	Quest for Zoo from Activision.
1435781	1436381	Cabela's.
1436481	1440203	There's the first of four Cabela's games this year.

1658300	1660001	That would still be quite early for the Vita.
1661722	1662363	PSP.

1731252	1733317	Lots of games this week on the PSP, I'm surprised.
1735161	1736364	Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.
1739763	1743026	Also, Neon Genesis, Evangelion, Third Impact.
1743086	1749572	I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, an Asian version or something like that.
1750593	1756699	Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.
1758601	1759542	They're even doing a...
1761044	1766771	I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for Third Impact.
1767192	1769735	They love their Evangelion over there.
1769995	1772458	And then finally, let's see, Wanda Fortune 2 and
1776303	1792039	Tante Boo Detective Club that's coming out I guess as well lots of stuff on the PSP which is kind of odd because in the US man there's nothing there's like maybe three titles this year and left and that's it well
1794004	1797805	Okay, and then on the Wii, not a whole lot.
1798166	1805408	They're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles set.
1805708	1807929	The two gun shooter games that they had.
1808529	1809469	That's it for the Wii.
1810490	1810630	And...
1813942	1841513	3DS few things Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan no idea what that is but let's take a look here real quick no idea what that is looks like it has a butterfly on the cover weird maybe it's a bug collecting sim actually that could be bug collecting is kind of a big thing
1843275	1844195	Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.
1845756	1849097	Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something.
1849437	1850137	Bird feeding.
1850177	1852018	You collect the bugs and feed the birds.
1852038	1863982	I think it's something about photography because it's showing like they have stuff for shooting flowers and they've got kind of like a collage.
1864722	1868163	Yeah, it looks like just nature photos or something.
1868984	1869444	Some sort of
1872112	1872792	Very niche.
1874634	1876815	And finally, it's the Nintendo DS here.
1880958	1882019	Don't know if they've really got anything.
1882139	1883199	Oh, actually, it's kind of neat.
1883479	1893586	They've got some re-releases on PlayStation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, Rockstar's Classic Edition, also San Andreas and Vice City Stories all making their way out as well.
1894387	1894487	Um...
1897636	1910926	Haru Kanaru, Jinku no Kade 4, that's getting re-released as well, and Nintendo DS, nothing in Japan right now.
1912507	1913768	Nintendo doesn't love you, Japan.
1913788	1916591	Well, at least no DSs this week.
1916791	1916951	Yeah.
1917571	1921034	Well, how about we hop over a couple more oceans and get to Europe?
1922055	1922355	Sound good?
1924412	1926735	In the UK, we have stuff.
1926935	1931982	On the 27th, Resident Evil Code Veronica X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
1933203	1936187	Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Collection HD for PS3 on the 28th.
1936247	1937168	Also on the 28th, Mercury HG
1940672	1968714	Roshard, The Binding of Isaac, Worms Ultimate Mayhem, Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition On the 29th we have Katamari Amore on the iPhone And on the 30th we have Game of Thrones, Genesis, Child of Eden Driver San Francisco, FIFA 12, We Sing UK Hits, and X-Men Destiny That's pretty much it Alright
1970794	1971634	You got anything else for us?
1972135	1973715	Yeah, I've got some stuff here.
1974236	1978318	Actually, I think we should do the classic game of the week.
1979198	1979438	Really?
1979598	1979819	Okay.
1979959	1981339	Well, then let's go ahead and do the classic game of the week.
1982180	1983600	As soon as I find the music.
1983761	1987022	Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here, it's a very short show.
1988263	1988703	Might as well.
1990984	1992285	Well, then let's go ahead and get right into it.
2000808	2007214	This is the Classic Game of the Week, where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show you games that you should have been playing.
2007695	2008435	But did you play them?
2008896	2009316	No!
2009937	2011578	Because you probably weren't born.
2012980	2013580	Damn kids.
2015021	2023189	Today's game is one called Quartet, that anyone who actually is a fan of Project D.Va might recognize the game.
2024450	2050537	you know um quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega you could have one to four players um lead your characters through a base taken over by an army of robots and it was set in the fantasy zone as in fantasy zone and uh um space harrier in fact uh Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games back in the day were all set in the fantasy zone that they were gonna say every one of their games were set there but that didn't quite catch on
2051932	2079729	at any rate you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door key so you can go to the next level and you get different power-ups like a jetpack and springs for jumping and boosting and different kinds of fun like that so I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about that so you can hear what it's like
2083550	2088077	I'm gonna start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.
2091142	2091663	If it will play.
2113775	2116757	This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good.
2116797	2119900	But then again, Master System games really did have a lot of great music.
2121181	2126985	At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups.
2127926	2131849	But if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.
2132609	2149269	and it came out around the same time as Gauntlet sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet but it did come out on the Master System but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R so it came out in Japan as Double Target but over here it still came out as Quartet
2149870	2153274	There is also home versions.
2153314	2157480	There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.
2158581	2165690	And the Okie Rap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991 Spider-Man the video game.
2166591	2176467	So, Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you can only play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.
2176567	2178751	So, that's the game of the week is Quartet.
2179332	2179692	Now...
2181320	2198853	I was mentioning that fans of Project Diva should be able to recognize this song because a version of the song was used in Project Diva 2nd or I know it was in Project Diva Arcade so I was going to play a little bit of that for you guys now but if you stay tuned after the show, I'll play the whole thing.
2202096	2202576	So here it goes.
2228317	2248787	I'm going to skip up the music, guys.
2252769	2254570	And that was the version from Project Diva.
2255191	2255771	Pretty cool, huh?
2256871	2257112	Sure.
2257532	2257712	So...
2260834	2261255	What next?
2262620	2262981	All right.
2263282	2264646	Let's move on along here.
2264666	2265849	We've got a few more stories left.
2268982	2269823	So let's see here.
2270123	2276567	Since we were talking a little bit about, you know, Project D.Va and, you know, kind of reminds me of actually some of the Bomani games.
2277188	2283592	There's actually a new Bomani, well, not technically a new Bomani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.
2284153	2288796	Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the U.S.
2288816	2293959	You may remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami that didn't really sell very well, but...
2295240	2296341	It was like Para, I guess.
2297182	2305389	But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades where they have an actual cabinet that's being location tested right now.
2306811	2317200	And I love the first licensed song because it does kind of sum up everything.
2317801	2320303	So the first licensed song is Irony.
2321564	2327187	Irony by Clary S and a couple other Japanese songs.
2327507	2332690	One from AKB48 and Morning Musume.
2333390	2336932	And then, of course, some Konami originals on the cabinet as well.
2336992	2340735	Agatia's Dream by Naoki featuring Smell Decay.
2341015	2344777	Into Your Heart, the Roughage remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin.
2345537	2366681	Keep On Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by June, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gela, and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naokimeda featuring JB, and Still In My Heart by Naoki, and Unity by The Remembers.
2368161	2368941	Sounds fun.
2369981	2374222	They'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home version.
2374540	2376224	Well, it's basically, yeah.
2376264	2380274	I mean, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there as well.
2380614	2383301	And they didn't really show any sort of, like...
2385814	2386875	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2412918	2417448	Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the game.
2417608	2422017	So, yeah, interesting, I guess.
2422278	2422579	I mean...
2423649	2424029	I'd play it.
2424049	2426950	Then again, I like Dance Masters.
2427750	2435772	I don't know if I would, but it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell to do.
2436993	2439473	But I mean, if you're used to playing par, I guess it's not too different.
2439754	2446155	Well, especially not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game because the par routines are basically the routines from the game.
2447256	2448336	So yeah, I don't know.
2449807	2450589	Well, that's still pretty neat.
2450630	2453980	I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.
2454903	2457130	So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.
2458860	2462721	And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before.
2462941	2464081	It's called Snatcher.
2465062	2470423	And there was a radio drama called Datcher, S-D-A-T-H-E-R.
2471123	2473824	And the first two episodes of it have been translated.
2474924	2476664	So that's actually pretty cool.
2477044	2484066	And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able to see it.
2486593	2492497	I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it again.
2493738	2509929	Maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear Rising game that's I don't even know where the hell happened with that game.
2509989	2510349	I mean, it's
2511869	2513049	Maybe the end of next year.
2513649	2517611	And then, of course, he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for.
2517691	2519271	So, it could be a while.
2521912	2530034	Well, I would very much like to... See, that's the problem with talented people that get too much on their plate.
2530474	2532354	They don't get the right stuff on their plate.
2533775	2534655	At least to come out anyway.
2535037	2536098	And yes, I agree, Zeether.
2536619	2537860	Snatcher kicks ass.
2538160	2546448	I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese and my husband lost patience with it really quickly.
2548049	2548429	But who knows.
2548509	2551752	So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skype line.
2552453	2554515	I will change this to online.
2555176	2556177	You can give us a call.

2579440	2582002	A third round of songs have been announced for Dance Dance Revolution 2.
2582242	2587246	In case you're interested in picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work.
2588067	2589648	He has a song in there called Aftershock.
2589788	2592451	Also, of course, K with Dirty Digital.
2593592	2594673	Dummy by Ram.

2651599	2659261	I've, uh, first thing is, um, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all time.

2696522	2703608	Yeah, I'm actually a really fan of Pulse Boot, not Pulse, that's Pulse Voice I'm thinking of, of the little boot thing.
2703748	2704589	The Kubrick shoe?
2704729	2705509	Kubrick, thank you.
2706330	2708332	I don't think I've seen that before, actually.
2708372	2709673	That's Super Mario Bros.
2709933	2709673	3.
2710774	2710874	Oh.
2711995	2717179	Well, I... Yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.
2717239	2722083	I mean, I've played, like, Super Mario... The new Super Mario Bros.
2722103	2723904	for the DS and a lot of others, but...
2727051	2728252	I just like everything about him.
2729013	2729493	That's cool.
2730314	2732836	So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about.
2732856	2733376	What was the other?
2734797	2737720	The other one is I want to talk about prototype.
2738280	2739041	Prototype, okay.
2740642	2744385	What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.
2744545	2746087	You can do pretty much everything.
2748749	2751131	So you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?
2754766	2755267	What did you say?
2755327	2756748	You could blow up the earth if you wanted to.
2757648	2763793	Well, maybe, but like how you can... What is it called?
2763853	2769096	Yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn into them if you need to to sneak around places.
2770497	2772199	That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.
2772299	2774520	Now, are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?
2775361	2776221	Prototype 2?
2777602	2781245	I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.
2784119	2802948	and uh and what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running the parkour stuff because you can you run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing yeah that's pretty cool I didn't ever play it oh really I've been too busy playing WoW
2804309	2804589	Addict?
2805751	2807432	Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.
2811657	2815281	I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.
2816522	2817743	What are your opinions on him?
2818344	2818784	Iconic.
2819145	2819926	That's all I can say.
2823229	2824390	That's a good character, I guess.
2824651	2825912	Good franchise for Nintendo.
2830228	2832970	Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.
2833090	2836332	And, yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.
2837112	2838093	Party time!
2838233	2838953	Happy birthday.
2838993	2840874	You're only two years away from the big party.
2841835	2842375	Yeah, I know.
2843196	2844036	Well, you have a good one.
2844276	2845097	Thanks for calling in.
2845737	2845957	Uh-huh.
2846378	2846858	Bye-bye.
2849019	2851981	So, any other callers want to give us a call?
2852201	2857204	You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Sounds Radio.
2858004	2858665	Please call...
2860684	2862045	While we're waiting for more calls here.
2863746	2871594	Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding more content to the PlayStation 3 version in the form of an older game.
2872454	2885426	Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite is going to have the original Bioshock in there, Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the Blu-ray space and they can do that and...
2886207	2891030	Unfortunately, they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding trophy support or anything like that.
2891110	2895152	But hey, you get another game in case you maybe don't have the first Assassin's Creed.
2896412	2896692	I don't know.
2897333	2897753	Need a guess.
2899974	2904036	Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.
2905197	2905697	We have a call.
2905777	2907018	Can we hold that one for after?
2908138	2909859	Hello, thank you for calling Orange Jones Radio.
2910019	2910800	Who is this?
2911650	2913031	This is Kaijudo, can you hear me?
2913291	2913912	Yes, we can.
2913972	2914813	Hi, Kaijudo.
2915574	2916054	Hey, what's up?
2916454	2923160	Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, when he was talking about Mario, and it made me think about something.
2923681	2926023	Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?
2926583	2927664	Like, how old is he by now?
2928525	2929026	About 40, 50?
2929326	2933850	Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.
2935291	2935371	Ah.
2936815	2942677	That maybe, you know, he seems to be a very, well, maybe, you know, fungus people and humans aren't compatible.
2943918	2944478	Yeah, maybe so.
2944498	2948579	Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.
2948799	2952781	Either that or she's, you know, produced spores, but they mutated and turned into Goombas.
2955871	2959832	and I don't know, I guess next thing I talk about is games I'm looking forward to.
2959932	2969095	I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying and I just realized that I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.
2969235	2969515	Really?
2970035	2973036	Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.
2974616	2982118	Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because, you know, it's like single disc and you're promised there's...
2983632	2984472	Uh-oh, sorry.
2985333	2986173	Give us a call back, sorry.
2987713	2987994	Alright.
2991755	2992295	What was that?
2992635	2996356	I accidentally picked up a call by accident, so my bad.
2997937	2998277	Okay.
2998837	3005419	I'm going to try to call... Yeah, this is ghetto-ass broken radio.
3007265	3009466	Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident.
3009486	3010706	We're going to have Rob edit this out.
3011187	3012887	I will call you back as soon as this call is over.
3012927	3013308	How's that?
3013888	3014248	Alright.
3014268	3015028	Okay, thank you.
3022171	3024512	Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.
3025333	3025873	Resume call.
3026053	3026733	Hi, sorry.
3028994	3029294	Are you there?
3032304	3032644	Yeah, I'm here.
3032744	3033044	Can you hear me?
3033064	3034845	I'm so sorry.
3035526	3038987	We got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button, so it put you on hold.
3039868	3040148	Yeah.
3040548	3041909	So, my apologies.
3041949	3044230	I'm normally not the one that handles the skyline, as you can tell.
3045391	3046931	Yeah, I'm getting, like, double talk now.
3047692	3048392	Oh, fun.
3048792	3050853	Well... Oh, wait a second.
3050993	3051494	Alright, there it is.
3051634	3051854	Okay.
3051914	3053214	I turned down my computer.
3053675	3054175	That would help.
3054995	3056016	So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?
3056056	3059317	Yeah, so, I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3.
3059337	3060318	I just realized that, so...
3061465	3061785	I don't know.
3062225	3063146	I don't think I'm the only one.
3063166	3066847	I think maybe 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.
3067687	3070488	Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?
3071208	3071428	Yeah.
3072148	3072648	It's about time.
3073129	3076250	Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.
3076970	3077530	Yeah, that's true.
3078210	3078410	Yep.
3079591	3079771	Yep.
3079991	3080411	Alrighty.
3080471	3081011	Well, goodnight.
3081271	3082351	Alright, sorry for the mix-up.
3082892	3083392	Yeah, it's no problem.
3083512	3083992	Okay, bye-bye.
3086858	3095381	Okay, now I will try to get a hold of Zeether again, who was calling and I was being a derp.
3097022	3097842	Hello, Zeether, are you there?
3100223	3102123	Hi, it's Zeether from the chat.
3102263	3102864	Hello.
3104584	3107725	I was thinking of something to call about, and I finally thought of something.
3108966	3110826	You've heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?
3110846	3111687	The DS game?
3112427	3112647	Yeah.
3112667	3112747	Yeah.
3115101	3126050	I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX and it is awesome it is just one of the best things I've ever watched one of the best Japanese television shows I've ever watched so what do you like about it?
3127491	3141962	it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games to get to the end and it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it
3144281	3145222	That sounds pretty cool.
3145302	3146823	So it's just, you like the struggle.
3147664	3151547	Yeah, it's very, they make it, like, overly dramatic sometimes.
3151608	3156872	Like, he'll be at, like, this impasse, and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he gonna get through this?
3156932	3159555	Is he gonna be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?
3159615	3165860	Like, in one episode, he was doing ghosts and goblins, and the red demon was constantly giving him hell.
3166881	3169383	And it was like, how is he gonna get past this guy?
3169423	3170985	He's stuck in game over hell.
3171591	3177353	Oh, that, I can imagine, too, because, like, that last level is especially crappy with the red demon.
3177993	3184734	Oh, yeah, and when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not gonna do this, I'm gonna just hand it over to one of the other guys, he's gonna do it.
3185635	3189536	It's... Oh, yeah, because you beat the game, and then it's like, no, go back.
3189556	3190996	Yeah, no, you have to do it again.
3191496	3194257	That, that was, that game was, like, one of the ultimate in rage quits.
3195276	3221672	yeah it's definitely and he actually I actually found out the guy who was on the guy who did the guy on the show who does the gate planes playing the games his name is Arno he was actually in California at one point that like a couple weeks ago he was doing a special taped special that was going to be him going to the US and and a lot of people showed up that's pretty cool
3223169	3226510	Yeah, the Retro Game Challenge game is also extremely fun.
3226790	3228951	It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.
3230091	3235613	I might have to check that out, given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game, old school game people.
3236134	3237014	It's very good.
3237174	3240255	It's got some really, really good games in it.
3240295	3248838	The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation for it, and so far, from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first game.
3249238	3249998	That sounds awesome.
3251119	3251419	Yeah.
3253044	3259255	and yeah, Snatcher really good game, Snatcher is fantastic I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy
3260228	3261608	Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.
3261708	3264649	I've just had to emulate, but it's really good.
3265450	3266350	I really like it.
3266970	3267950	The plot is great.
3268491	3273612	I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the... pretty decently far into the game.
3274372	3275193	But it's really good.
3275213	3276053	I like the music.
3276113	3278354	I like the voice acting.
3278394	3282055	It's very well done for a game that's from the early 90s.
3282255	3283455	The little Metal Gear cameo.
3284216	3286136	Yes, Metal Gear walking around.
3286976	3287797	I especially liked...
3289045	3315729	the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you went there you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami characters there and who was it Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in and Metal Gear was like, I think we fit in more than you think and I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference very, very cool Yeah, that's super neat Well, pretty cool So you got anything else for us?
3316488	3317288	No, nothing else.
3317628	3320229	Alright, well I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.
3321069	3321689	It's alright.
3322489	3324830	I attribute that to derp, because it's the derpisode.
3325390	3326370	It's mad buggy.
3327931	3328411	Bug report!
3329511	3329851	Alright.
3329871	3330431	Alright, later.
3331091	3331471	Later.
3333632	3335152	Alright guys, you can give us a call.
3335172	3336532	We'll take one more call.
3336733	3337473	It's at 877-GAME-OLR.
3339687	3341408	Do you have any other last minute stories for us?
3361775	3363056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3389591	3391752	Hello, you have reached Orange Lounge Radio.
3391812	3392252	Who is this?
3393012	3394432	Yo, it's Xenocore from the OKC.
3394452	3395032	How y'all doing?
3395273	3395733	Doing good.
3395793	3396553	How are you, Xenocore?
3397653	3398753	Well rested from my trip.
3398794	3405735	I think you might have heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and back is no fun.
3405795	3407296	That doesn't sound like fun at all.
3407316	3411077	Yeah, especially when it's just for family duties and not a real vacation.
3411137	3413217	But anyway, we're here about games.
3413658	3413838	Yep.
3414478	3415218	So what is up?
3416509	3416829	Not much.
3417309	3423791	I did want to include a small thing on top of, you know, Arino playing old school games on Game Center CX.
3423811	3427252	He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.
3427552	3429753	He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.
3430133	3433274	He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.
3433594	3438435	There's a lot of stuff that, like, for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing and doing some...
3439213	3440994	Awful voiceover and some of the stuff.
3441454	3448799	But there's an account on YouTube that somebody's been putting all the fan subs that have been done online.
3449319	3450860	And I put a link to one of them in chat.
3450960	3456843	But they've got over 24 of the episodes already, including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.
3457383	3459244	It's really an outstanding show.
3459925	3461085	I'm going to have to check that out.
3461486	3463467	I mean, it sounds like something totally up my alley.
3463567	3467149	I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.
3467918	3470162	Yeah, right around 903 in chat.
3470202	3472806	If you take that link, that'll give you the account name.
3472846	3474849	I think it's like Active Circle or something like that.
3474889	3476692	But he's putting all that stuff on there.
3476712	3477373	You can give it a go.
3477995	3479817	And the other thing...
3482186	3493451	I'm still curious as to whether or not as much as I loved Space Marine I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died out.
3493811	3494111	Really?
3494631	3495751	It kind of sucks.
3495811	3497392	I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.
3497592	3504095	It's probably just fanboys complaining but I hope not because that game was awesome and I played it from Gamefly.
3504455	3509917	I do want to get a full version of it but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer isn't there because that's the only thing that's left in there for me.
3511382	3513843	Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?
3514523	3518444	Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was the single player.
3518504	3519944	Once you go through that, you pretty much know it.
3520304	3525285	As fun as it is, I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.
3526245	3531786	But I hope they make another one, because that was an outstanding representation of what to do with that franchise.
3532206	3533807	They can keep their fingers crossed, right?
3535107	3535827	Offer a little prayer.
3536584	3537024	Yep, yep.
3538465	3539606	Awesome job today, guys.
3540347	3542588	Sky isn't missing a thing, so good job.
3542648	3548012	He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco, and I was going to reply that I'm hateful and jealous, but nah.
3549193	3549933	That's okay.
3549993	3556378	He has to stay in the audience with the rest of the... Granted, Lady Tron's playing, but he's going to get funk right all over him, so you know.
3556758	3558299	Yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot.
3561301	3562222	And then he's going to get sick.
3562342	3562782	No, I'm kidding.
3563243	3564263	All right, well, thank you for calling.
3564443	3565104	Did you have anything else?
3565936	3567618	No, that's pretty much it, pretty light today.
3568158	3571422	Alrighty, well you take care and we will hear from you next week, maybe?
3572283	3572663	Hopefully.
3573124	3575506	Next week we actually have a special guest on the show.
3576167	3576627	Another host.
3577268	3578830	It's Dan, so I guess he's not that special.
3578870	3579570	I mean, he's special.
3580231	3581132	Special to me.
3581573	3583114	Just a little bit special.
3583855	3586418	Okay, bye-bye.
3586438	3587339	Alright, later.
3588675	3596238	Alright, that was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because believe it or not we did have people trying to get in but nope, that was it.
3596778	3598779	And I actually do have another story.
3599619	3607282	Just a little story that came to us courtesy of Tiger Claw.
3608322	3614965	And that's that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back on Xbox Live.
3616278	3627588	So they actually, Stephen Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were mistakenly made by a different software being used and so they are bringing those people back.
3627628	3632672	They're unbanning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft points.
3635470	3643095	and they said it was a very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September 9th so they've got it lined up.
3644056	3646497	So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.
3649265	3651206	Do you have anything else for us?
3651386	3656029	Just one thing real quick, and it's more of a PSA than anything.
3656629	3660791	Remember I talked about the Tommy Wee Show?
3661572	3668835	That, I guess, is something that's running from Machima on YouTube and stuff like that.
3669255	3673758	Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy Wiseau.
3674558	3698765	and it is fucking stupid first off it's a ripoff of Mr. Sanctuary 3000 secondly Tommy Wiseau cannot form English sentences he's just it's just so fucking stupid and the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid so I mean if you like watching stupid people play games I'm sure there's plenty of
3700555	3701216	Thanks for watching!
3711585	3738418	well that's just and it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played it's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him and I mean at one point he accidentally hits the playstation button and it goes to the cross menu bar and he's just how do I get out of this I mean it's dumb so please don't watch it just let it die in a fire
3738849	3739389	Lame.
3740470	3742310	Well, that's it for OLR.
3742350	3744391	But I'm actually going to go ahead and play.
3745332	3746592	Actually, you know, I closed the show roll.
3746612	3747032	So never mind.
3747052	3747913	I'm not going to play anything.
3748313	3751314	But I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.
3751774	3757857	Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified pump up the volume.
3758957	3760778	So do you have any final thoughts?
3762337	3762638	Uh, no.
3763398	3770904	Yeah, I don't have any either, except that I'm just gonna do some music for about an hour so that you guys don't feel, you know, like we've gone, huh, don't wanna, okay.
