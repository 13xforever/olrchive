0	24600	The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new
24600	32440	section to the PSN terms of service.
32440	38640	Hello and welcome to episode 429 of this derpisode of Orange Lounge Radio.
38640	44160	I am your hostess of the evening, DarkSakura, and with me always is our techmaster, Loki.
44160	45160	Hello.
45160	49960	Yes, this is take two because someone was forgetting to start recording.
49960	54560	Because someone's very jealous that Rob's off seeing Ladytron tonight in San Francisco.
54560	55560	Blah.
55560	58120	So anyway, what are we?
58120	61600	We are the video game talk show where every gamer has a voice.
61600	66400	Be it digitized, or if we're saying it for you, or whatever.
66400	71200	So over the next few hours we will be talking about game stuff, and we tape live every week
71200	74200	on allgamesradio.com.
74200	77800	And that starts at six o'clock pacific time, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
77800	80160	And if you're listening to us live, get in our chat room.
80160	85000	It's chat dot Orange Lounge Radio dot com, and we are on Game Surge server.
85000	87240	So Loki, again, how was Earth Defense Force?
87240	88480	It was good.
88480	92160	That's what I've been playing this week among other things like Grand Theft Auto.
92160	99280	Of course, as I was saying, the survival mode in that game, it's difficult because they
99280	103520	basically give you the lowest tier weapons possible, and then they put you up against
103520	106520	lots and lots of really hard bugs.
106520	110520	And thankfully you do get up to six players, which is kind of cool, although we didn't
110520	114440	get to play very long because our internet connection at work is kind of sketchy.
114440	124440	It drops us every now and then, or more often than every now and then, pretty often actually.
124440	125440	And then, you know, Grand Theft Auto.
125440	128240	That was the usual Grand Theft Auto stuff.
128240	130680	Still trying to keep my winning streak going.
130680	134120	And what else did I try?
134120	140320	Well actually, it wasn't really game-related, but I did mess around with the Xbox Marketplace
140320	141320	a little bit.
141320	146000	I watched my wife on the Watch An Episode of Up All Night, and so we watched that real
146000	147880	quick and it actually worked out pretty good.
147880	151560	I never really used the Zune Marketplace before, so that was kind of neat.
151560	157640	And then also got to check out, well, I browsed and buy some of the Xbox Live and E Games,
157640	159440	and man, there's some weird shit on there.
159440	161440	I don't even know.
161440	164440	There was a game I saw that was about prank calling people.
164440	169720	There was the Babymaker Extreme 2, I know, and we've talked about that before.
169720	170720	Looks hilarious.
170720	177460	I didn't pick it up though, but just a lot of stuff that's on there that's not great,
177460	183600	but it is kind of hard to navigate everything, so hopefully they fix that and maybe with
183600	187700	one of these updates, maybe the next fall dashboard update will fix the store a little
187700	192000	bit so it's easier to find stuff.
192000	193520	I think that's really all that I've played.
193520	194520	Maybe a little bit more Zelda.
194520	200720	I don't remember if I actually played that or not this week, but yeah, that's about it.
200720	202200	I played well.
202200	203200	That's it.
203200	206080	Well, you're consistent.
206080	211720	So moving forward, as has been mentioned, Rob isn't here, so we're doing a short show
211720	216120	tonight, but everyone needs to be a little pumped for what's coming on a little after.
216120	219760	I'm doing a throwback to the past so that people don't feel like we're shortchanging
219760	225840	them because we love you, not in a romantic way or anything, but in a way.
225840	226880	We do.
226880	229920	So why don't we go ahead and get right into our stories of the night.
229920	230920	All right.
230920	237480	Well, it's been kind of the longest anticipated announcement, at least this year.
237480	240600	People are starting to get worried that Star Wars The Old Republic wasn't going to be coming
240600	245400	out this year, and maybe it prompted them to announce a release date for this year based
245400	249720	on the fact that certain other games may be coming out a little later.
249720	255160	But yes, The Old Republic will be shipping on December 20th, and of course they do have
255160	257820	some details on what it's going to cost you.
257820	260400	They have different subscription packages.
260400	262720	You can go month to month, which is $14.99.
262720	269000	Of course, each game does come with a 30-day subscription that runs out, and after 30 days
269000	270480	you have to pay for it.
270480	276600	If you choose to pay for some of your months in a lump sum, you will save a little bit
276600	277600	of money.
277600	282520	Three months at a time will break it down to $13.99 a month, and then six months at
282520	284660	a time, $12.99 a month.
284660	289320	So if you're dedicated to playing this game for a long time, maybe the lump sums are the
289320	290320	way to go.
290320	291320	You know what?
291320	292320	What?
292320	297000	I had the opportunity to get a lifetime membership for Star Trek Online, and now I'm very glad
297000	299840	I didn't because it's going free to play.
299840	303320	So, I would advise everyone, hold off.
303320	306680	Well, lifetime memberships, yeah, you might hold off on that because you never know the
306680	310400	life cycle of these games nowadays that a lot of them grow up free to play, but six
310400	311400	months isn't bad.
311400	314360	I imagine that Star Wars games are going to be around for at least six months.
314360	317200	Yeah, well, who knows?
317200	324960	I mean, I quit playing, well no, that was February of, no I started playing in February,
324960	327600	I quit actually a year ago.
327600	328600	Star Trek Online.
328600	329600	This month.
329600	330600	No.
330600	331600	Nope, in two months, sorry.
331600	335880	Anyway, but yeah, I'd say though, six months is fine, but if they offer any type of lifetime
335880	337160	thing, don't do it.
337160	339160	Don't do it.
339160	341240	Not even if they give you a lightsaber that works.
341240	343800	Well, maybe that's worth it.
343800	351440	Well, in other news, we have something about Sega of Europe.
351440	355200	John Smedley is saying that they're a free to play model for DC.
355200	356200	Sony.
356200	357200	Sony.
357200	358200	Sony Entertainment.
358200	359200	I don't know why I said Sony.
359200	360960	You know what?
360960	362960	I'm derp.
362960	363960	I'm still mad at Rob.
363960	365520	I'm still mad at Rob.
365520	368920	I'm not really mad at Rob.
368920	369920	Okay.
369920	375800	Sony Online Entertainment has a free to play model for DC Universe Online.
375800	378840	So it's going to be three membership levels.
378840	381440	There's free, premium, and legendary.
381440	387480	And they have full access to the game that has different levels of flexibility.
387480	393440	So free players will have two character slots and new downloadable game packs and updates.
393440	395840	Additional character slots, you can pay for them.
395840	398080	I refuse to use the term micro transaction.
398080	402840	Premium, so that's going to be people who have spent at least $5 on the game.
402840	406560	That's including former subscribers and in game item purchasers will have additional
406560	410200	character slots, inventory slots, and higher cash limits.
410200	413800	Legendary will have the maximum, including free DLC.
413800	419560	More than 15 character slots and more than 80 inventory slots for $15 a month.
419560	423160	And this is happening really soon, as in next week.
423160	424160	Yeah.
424160	425160	So that means I can play the game.
425160	426160	Yeah, because it's funny.
426160	427160	Because I ain't going to pay for it.
427160	428160	We got the message there.
428160	434960	Yeah, you need to tell all your customers to send them back their copies of DC Universe
434960	440200	because we're making it free to play, so they don't need those discs anymore.
440200	444320	Well, I will be trying it out, but honestly I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
444320	448480	Yeah, I think a lot of these MMOs should go free to play.
448480	452880	I'm telling you, if Final Fantasy XI ever goes free to play, god I don't know.
452880	454760	I may have to get back into that.
454760	457720	And Nelly will wonder what happened to you.
457720	462000	Well no, it's not that big a deal because really the whole thing is I couldn't see myself
462000	466760	paying I think it was $13 a month or something like that for Final Fantasy XI, but I was
466760	471680	only playing it maybe one evening a month.
471680	476360	I can't see myself paying for that because it's just a waste of money.
476360	478480	But free to play, that would be fine.
478480	485280	I really wish I hadn't sold my, you know, or not really sell my stuff, but give away
485280	487000	my stuff that I had in my bar.
487000	488000	But whatever.
488000	489000	Yeah.
489000	491220	That would be fun.
491220	496560	Some more information going along the lines with, it's not really an MMO, but maybe the
496560	501400	reason why the older republic did announce to be shipping this year, Diablo 3 is actually
501400	503200	going to launch early 2012.
503200	506400	It's not going to make it out this year unfortunately.
506400	512640	They did mention that they're going to extend the beta period of course since obviously
512640	515920	the game's going to be coming out later on, they have more time to test it and hopefully
515920	519200	get any kinks out of it.
519200	524080	Of course they're saying, you know, while the news may not be a complete surprise, I
524080	527200	know many of you were hopeful that Diablo 3 would ship this year.
527200	528200	We were too.
528200	534640	Of course, they're ultimately, we felt to deliver an awesome Diablo sequel that lives
534640	539540	up to our expectations and yours as well, we should take a little more time to add further
539540	541500	polish to a few different elements of the game.
541500	543600	So in other words, it was buggy and they needed to fix it.
543600	544600	So that's fine.
544600	547200	Well what else is new?
547200	549520	There's too much stuff coming out this year anyways.
549520	554480	Yeah, I just, they actually were starting to put out little warnings on World of Warcraft
554480	561120	by the way, that if someone messages you saying, oh you've got the Diablo 3 pass here, give
561120	562400	us your password, blah blah blah.
562400	567600	If you give anyone your password, you're stupid, sorry.
567600	573560	I don't even think that people sending out ones for Diablo 3 should be enough to make
573560	579280	people lose control of their facilities.
579280	580280	Should people like to-
580280	581280	Their faculties.
581280	582280	That'd be funny.
582280	583280	I said facilities.
583280	584280	Whatever.
584280	585280	Their brain.
585280	586280	Whatever.
586280	590320	Well anyway, so let's move forward into other news, shall we?
590320	591320	We shall.
591320	595680	Speaking of Blizzard, they are talking about patch 4.3, which everyone has been all abuzz
595680	596680	about in-game.
596680	599920	You know, we get transmogrifying.
599920	603720	That means you can make your new shit look like old shit.
603720	606660	So that people don't all look the same.
606660	609720	And then there's gonna be, and I was reading up on this the other day, and it's actually
609720	615200	kind of exciting, is that there is a new raid content that's gonna take place all over the
615200	617560	world of Azeroth.
617560	621440	I thought for a second there, and I know this is wrong, that you said rape content, and
621440	623080	I was like, what?
623080	624080	That's weird.
624080	628240	Well you know what, actually in the Firelands, there's a, the first boss has a dog with him
628240	631280	named Rageface, but everyone calls him Rapeface.
631280	636160	His attack is called Face Rage, so we just call it Face Rape.
636160	637640	That's awesome.
637640	638640	Yeah.
638640	643280	Anyway, Deathwing's just not sitting around, you know, because before all he had, you know,
643280	646600	all he was doing was showing up in areas and burning people to death if they were on the
646600	648740	ground and not in the air.
648740	651880	Trust me, I took forever to get that stupid achievement.
651880	657960	So he's going to be a raid, you actually have to go into the future, go into the past, and
657960	662240	the whole thing is gonna end on the dragon's back, so you have to pull off pieces of his
662240	669460	plate armor as he's spinning down into the Maelstrom, ooh, and then, you know, get all
669460	673440	stabby on him and maybe try to kill him, or at least, you know, make him really pissed
673440	676120	off at you.
676120	682160	It's supposed to be really, really huge, and I was reading some of the technical development
682160	688160	behind it and said that they've had to really pull some technical strings to get it to work.
688160	691480	I'm looking forward to seeing it, although honestly right now it's gonna be forever.
691480	695680	And then like I said earlier, there is transmogrifying, so basically you can only change, like, one
695680	701200	type of armor to look like the same type of armor of another level.
701200	704960	So like, you can't change cloth mail to plate mail, you know, make it look like plate mail,
704960	708260	and you can't make your axe look like a polearm.
708260	712440	It has to be the same type of stuff, and it's gotta be something with stats on it.
712440	716480	And then void storage is coming out, which is basically if you've got a bunch of stuff
716480	721300	that you were tired of sitting in your regular storage, and you think, I'm never gonna get
721300	725620	back to it, but for some reason I'm a pack rat and can't sell it, ew, then you can put
725620	730080	it in your void storage and it removes all enchants and socketing, and you have to pay
730080	732520	a lot of money to get it out.
732520	735640	So that's it.
735640	741360	And then of course, like I said, the Deathwing smackdown.
741360	746400	This is kind of interesting, there was a story on Rock Paper Shocking this week, talking
746400	752320	about, you know how there's a lot of these folding projects, the Folding at Home is a
752320	757900	really popular one, well there was one, I guess it was a little bit newer, called Foldit,
757900	765080	and what Foldit is, is it's not just folding with your actual system or PC or whatever
765080	771760	that you're using, it does require some human interaction as well, so think of it like mind
771760	774520	folding, I guess.
774520	780560	Basically they were using this to kind of figure out how viruses like the AIDS virus
780560	788600	worked and stuff like that, also cancer and Alzheimer's as well, and guess these are related
788600	795280	to proteins and what the project does is I guess, basically it's spatial recognition
795280	801880	or something, where players will, I'm not really sure what you do, but apparently it
801880	807080	has something to do with matching stuff and based on your results and what they have in
807080	814120	here, they have I guess figured out how these actually work now, so it's kind of cool, because
814120	820240	apparently this is going to lead to obviously research and testing and whatnot, but it will
820240	826480	actually lead to maybe even a cure for these diseases, thanks to this folding project,
826480	830120	and it's pretty impressive I guess.
830120	834600	So yeah, they're saying Foldit players leverage human three-dimensional problem solving skills
834600	840560	to interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and algorithms from
840560	845460	the Rosetta structure prediction mythology, and says players collaborate with teammates
845460	851600	while competing with other players to obtain the highest score, lowest energy models, and
851600	853400	proof of concept tests.
853400	858320	Foldit players, most of whom have little or no background in biochemistry, were able to
858320	865620	solve protein structure refinement problems in which backbone rearrangement was necessary
865620	871200	to correctly bury hydrophobic residues.
871200	878680	Here we report Foldit players' successes in real world modeling problems with complex
878680	883720	deviations from native structures leading to the solution of a long-standing protein
883720	893600	crystal structure problem, and they said basically, yeah this is going to possibly lead to a cure
893600	897160	for this stuff, so that's pretty amazing.
897160	903040	Seems to me like in some cases education might get in the way of intuition, don't you think?
903040	904040	Yeah.
904040	908400	Some people have a natural aptitude towards solving puzzles as long as you give it to
908400	911080	them in a term that they're going to understand it.
911080	915120	Yeah, and then they go on to comment a little bit more, they said, the critical role of
915120	923760	Foldit players in the solution of the M-PMV PR structure shows the power of online games
923760	928800	to channel human intuition and three-dimensional pattern matching skills to solve challenging
928800	933280	scientific problems, although much attention has been recently given to the potential of
933280	938600	crowdsourcing and game playing, this is the first instance that we are aware of in which
938600	942400	online players solve the long-standing scientific problem.
942400	948920	These results indicate potential for integrating video games into real world scientific process.
948920	955720	The ingenuity of the game players is formidable force that if properly directed can be used
955720	959680	to solve a wide range of scientific problems, so you never know, they may be just using
959680	967160	this for other diseases, obviously potential is unlimited, new forms of energy, who knows?
967160	973400	I was reading before that they had broken what was one of the HIV virus models, right?
973400	975080	Yeah, this is what that's about.
975080	981880	So think if they've come to that, this could be applied towards cancers, tumors, just about
981880	982880	anything.
982880	983880	Yeah.
983880	989400	It really is a good way to get new resources, because any type of research, if it hits a
989400	993880	dead end, it's going to need a fresh pair of eyes and a fresh brain to go with it.
993880	998840	And the folded thing hasn't even been around that long, it's basically 236,000 players,
998840	1003760	which as far as compared to folding the home, I think that's a lot less than what they've
1003760	1004760	got.
1004760	1011060	Instead I guess that they've been working together the last three years, and it only
1011060	1017660	took them 10 days to unravel that actual scientific problem there.
1017660	1022520	So that one alone, 10 days with that many people, can you imagine if they just integrated
1022520	1029160	this into all the places that the folding the home stuff is, it could be pretty powerful.
1029160	1035060	And another thing too, this actually says a lot for the spirit of cooperation.
1035060	1038240	This is a lot, even though they have it set up as a competition in the end, it's a lot
1038240	1044400	of people working together, and they're getting results by people having a common goal and
1044400	1045400	working towards it.
1045400	1048800	And I think that we could all stand to learn something from that.
1048800	1049800	Yeah.
1049800	1050800	Cool.
1050800	1054280	So, moving forward, man that's actually super cool though.
1054280	1058440	I mean I'm still kind of, whenever I try to think about the possibilities for that it
1058440	1060920	actually makes my brain hurt a little bit.
1060920	1065320	So how about something that won't make my brain hurt that much, because honestly it's
1065320	1066320	not surprising.
1066320	1075280	28% of 3DS users do not like the 3D feature, they say it detracts from their games.
1075280	1082440	There was a study done out by the research firm Interpret LLC that said 22% of those
1082440	1087760	thought the 3D improved gameplay, but 13% were so put off by the effect that they turned
1087760	1089280	it off altogether.
1089280	1097420	56% also found that their ideal 3D gaming experience was a 3D capable console connected
1097420	1103920	to a TV, with only 7% giving a nod towards the 3DS.
1103920	1111840	I think right now it's still really early, I think a lot of games aren't using it correctly.
1111840	1118720	And even this goes to Nintendo, some of their design choices in games are really stupid,
1118720	1123320	especially with Star Fox where they have the tilt controls and then the 3D, that doesn't
1123320	1124320	work.
1124320	1130520	It's going to break the 3D because your 3D method requires people to basically have a
1130520	1134420	certain perspective that you view the screen at, and if you're turning and tilting the
1134420	1138120	screen around it's going to break that and it's going to turn it 2D anyways.
1138120	1142000	Granted you could turn the 3D off and play with the tilt controls or turn it on and play
1142000	1149400	with it without tilt controls, but to fully utilize the game it's kind of impossible the
1149400	1152200	way that they have it I guess, unless you're supposed to tilt your whole body with that
1152200	1154200	which is kind of stupid.
1154200	1158200	But yeah, 3D consoles I think is definitely the way to go.
1158200	1161600	Have you noticed though that some people when they play a game that requires turning and
1161600	1164880	things that they'll lean with their controller?
1164880	1168040	Yeah when you're 5, I mean I don't think anyone does that anymore.
1168040	1170980	I do if I really get into it, like when I was playing Katamari though I'd get motion
1170980	1174480	sick so I'd actually follow the direction of the TV to keep from getting motion sick.
1174480	1176800	Yeah I see and I...
1176800	1179540	Then again the 3DS makes me motion sick anyway.
1179540	1180540	I don't know.
1180540	1182360	The moment the 3D breaks my head hurts.
1182360	1187000	Maybe people they don't play games a lot because they just get really into it, but I don't
1187000	1188240	think I've ever done that.
1188240	1192240	I don't need my little pony in 3D.
1192240	1195120	I just, I don't know, I don't really...
1195120	1199200	The only time I ever see that nowadays is when they have a stupid, you know, PR shot
1199200	1202560	of people playing a video game and they're so excited!
1202560	1206440	They're so psyched to be playing the game and they're just really getting into it.
1206440	1210920	But I mean it's just, it's just not real.
1210920	1213640	Now this is something that I think is a little derpy.
1213640	1220360	Is that they basically said that awareness of the device was up 60% on this time last
1220360	1227720	year but 28% of that total weren't aware that it required, that it didn't require 3D glasses.
1227720	1231640	Well yeah because they're probably interviewing people that have no idea what these consoles
1231640	1232640	are.
1232640	1236520	I mean there's a lot of people out there that don't know what, you know, the gaming consoles
1236520	1237520	offer.
1237520	1239080	I mean how even some celebrities.
1239080	1245400	I remember that video they have of Orlando Bloom and Mark Ruffalo signing him an Xbox.
1245400	1247880	Orlando Bloom didn't know what, you know, what that was.
1247880	1250400	He thought, you know, is this the one, Blu-ray?
1250400	1253800	I mean he didn't know because he's busy fucking making money and working.
1253800	1259160	He hasn't had time to, you know, game and that kind of stuff but there's a lot of people
1259160	1266000	out there that aren't really into games and aren't really aware of what's out there.
1266000	1270240	I mean, granted, I think they've stepped up their advertising quite a bit for the 3DS
1270240	1273240	now especially since they've dropped the price.
1273240	1277120	They're kind of highlighting what's coming out in the fourth quarter with, you know,
1277120	1283400	the Zelda and not, well they still show Zelda, Zelda Star Fox, Mario 3D, or Super Mario 3D
1283400	1285880	Land and Mario Kart 7.
1285880	1290400	So there's going to be a lot of awareness going into the fourth quarter about, you know,
1290400	1291400	the 3DS.
1291400	1299960	3D stuff for the Playstation a little bit, I think no whatsoever mention for the 3D stuff
1299960	1304680	that they have on the 360 because there are a lot of games that do support 3D on the Xbox
1304680	1311960	360 but there's no mention of that because first party wise they don't really, well actually
1311960	1317880	I guess Gears 3 did, but first party wise they don't really support 3D too much.
1317880	1322080	It's mainly just the third parties, the cross platform stuff like, you know, Batman Arkham
1322080	1328760	Asylum or, yeah actually Arkham Asylum had 3D support, not the stereoscopic, you know,
1328760	1336680	shutter glasses 3D but the red cyan glasses and then they also have, but Arkham City does
1336680	1340120	have 3D support and there's some other games that do support 3D.
1340120	1348280	It's just, it's not really advertised widely I guess.
1348280	1350920	Huh.
1350920	1357440	Well it, you know what, now I'm trying to picture playing through, not like the old
1357440	1361320	school cyan magenta, like the newer ones, right?
1361320	1364120	That you don't really see cyan and magenta.
1364120	1368400	I've honestly, I haven't used those types of glasses in a long time and I still think
1368400	1371000	that all I see is cyan and magenta and that stuff.
1371000	1375540	I mean, it would be awesome if they had some sort of glasses like that that I didn't see
1375540	1381360	that but I've never, I haven't seen anything like that recently that doesn't affect the
1381360	1382800	color.
1382800	1387240	I went to a movie not too long ago that used one of the services that was a cyan and magenta
1387240	1389600	but it was a very pale one.
1389600	1390600	It was interesting.
1390600	1393360	You really couldn't see it.
1393360	1395840	But moving forward, shall we?
1395840	1396840	Release dates.
1396840	1398960	Yes, Wii has release dates.
1398960	1403720	The US is still gonna have a lot of stuff coming out this week.
1403720	1407760	Of course, because we're in the fourth quarter technically.
1407760	1413080	So starting things off, we've got FIFA Soccer 12 on the Wii, coming out a little bit later
1413080	1415640	than the rest of the platforms.
1415640	1420360	Some re-releases from THQ, they've got a Beach Fun 2-pack, it's just some of their old party
1420360	1426720	games, and a Game Show Fun pack which is Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy, that's on the Wii.
1426720	1432920	Sun Slinger from Valkon, it's a generic on-rail shooter game for the Wii.
1432920	1435800	Quest for Zoo from Activision.
1435800	1441080	Cabela's, there's the first of four Cabela's games this year.
1441080	1445600	We've got Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012, it's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, and
1445600	1449640	of course they've got the Top Shot Elite bundles and the Swell with those.
1449640	1454960	Another game from Activision, X-Men Destiny, which is kind of an X-Men themed brawler game.
1454960	1459120	It's on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
1459120	1466600	Atelier Totri, The Adventurer of Arland, coming out on PlayStation 3 this week.
1466600	1471400	Also on PC, Dragon Sang Complete Saga.

1478800	1480920	in HD now.
1480920	1486680	Child of Eden on PlayStation 3 this week, one of those games that does support 3D.
1486680	1492520	Prevolution Soccer 2012, coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week, rest of the formats
1492520	1494400	later on the year.
1494400	1499440	Brunswick Pro Bowling 3DS for the Nintendo 3DS.
1499440	1504440	Eco and Shadow Colossus Collection on PlayStation 3 finally making its way out this week, definitely
1504440	1505440	a must-buy.
1505440	1515840	FIFA Soccer 12 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PSP, Xbox 360, 3DS, and the Wii.
1515840	1518960	Of course, as I mentioned earlier, I believe the Wii is actually coming out later on.
1518960	1522160	It's not supposed to be this week, I believe it's next week.
1522160	1529680	Let's see here, Sulatorobo, Red the Hunter for Nintendo DS this week from XSeed.
1529680	1538920	Air Conflict Secret Wars on Xbox 360, Driver San Francisco on PC, Touch and Play Collection
1538920	1542800	for Nintendo DS, just kind of another mini-game collection.
1542800	1550960	Sid Meier's Civ V, Game of the Year Edition on PC, and finally, one week from today, Tetris
1550960	1554240	Axis on the 3DS.
1554240	1557920	That's it for US, and then let's see here for Japan.
1557920	1561280	I've got a few things coming out this week.
1561280	1568040	Over there, Monster Hunter Frontier Online, the Forward 2 premier package coming out in
1568040	1570320	Japan on Xbox 360.
1570320	1576520	They also have a Monster Hunter console bundle over there, 250 gigabyte system, including
1576520	1579800	an online trial pack.
1579800	1586240	Game called Code 18 coming out over there in Japan, and looks like it may be another
1586240	1587240	dating sim.
1587240	1593720	That's from Cyber Front, yeah, definitely looks like a dating sim adventure game or
1593720	1595720	something like that.
1595720	1599000	Yeah, adventure game.
1599000	1606040	Let's see, moving on, also we've got the collector's edition for the Monster Hunter Frontier Online
1606040	1612440	Forward 2 premium package, and let's see, that's it for a 360.
1612440	1619800	Moving on down here to PlayStation 3, I believe.
1619800	1624880	We've got some weird games from Konami.
1624880	1631480	Formula One 2011 in Japan, they're getting their release over there for that game.
1631480	1636160	MLB Bobblehead, that's coming from Konami.
1636160	1646880	Let's see here, Shin Sengoku Musou 6, that's coming out both regular and a premium box
1646880	1649440	set as well.
1649440	1653000	That's it for PlayStation 3.
1653000	1659400	Next we've got, let's see here, nothing on the Vita yet, that would still be quite early
1659400	1661400	for the Vita.
1661400	1674400	PSP, a couple things on PSP, looks like Bullet Butlers coming out, Bullet Butlers from Boost
1674400	1678080	On, that's coming out in both regular and limited edition.
1678080	1682960	Also they're getting code 18 as well, regular and limited edition there.
1682960	1690600	Dead End Orchestra Maneuvers in the Dead End, that's a weird title, that's coming out as
1690600	1693680	well, regular and limited edition.
1693680	1697840	Lots of stuff this week, let's see.
1697840	1710240	Getting Iyu Densetsu Eo no Kiseki, that's both regular with a drama CD and limited edition
1710240	1711240	as well.
1711240	1716040	Evangelion Shin Genki Joban 3rd Impact.
1716040	1717040	Oh great.
1717040	1723320	More Eva Games, the series that will not die.
1723320	1730280	Hakuisei Renee Shokoden, that's coming out as well.
1730280	1735160	Man, lots of games this week on the PSP, I'm surprised.
1735160	1739240	Holy crap, there's a ton of stuff.
1739240	1743040	Let's see, also Neon Genesis Evangelion 3rd Impact.
1743040	1750640	I'm assuming that's maybe a localized version, Asian version or something like that.
1750640	1758040	Secret Game Portable, Yeti Best, that's coming out as well.
1758040	1767240	And they're even doing a, I guess a branded memory stick duo or whatever for 3rd Impact.
1767240	1770080	They love their Evangelion over there.
1770080	1781440	And then finally, Wanda Fortune 2 and Tantei Buu Detective Club, that's coming out I guess
1781440	1782440	as well.
1782440	1788000	Lots of stuff on the PSP, which is kind of odd because in the US man, there's like maybe
1788000	1794960	three titles this year left and that's it.
1794960	1801600	And then on the Wii, not a whole lot, they're pretty much just getting that Biohazard Chronicles
1801600	1806840	value pack, which is the Umbrella Chronicles and Dark Side Chronicles set, the two gun
1806840	1810680	shooter games that they had, that's it for the Wii.
1810680	1827640	And let's see, 3DS, few things, Hanatu Ikomo no Ritai Zukan, no idea what that is, but
1827640	1831120	let's take a look here real quick.
1831120	1837000	No idea what that is, looks like it has a butterfly on the cover.
1837000	1839280	Maybe it's a bug collecting sim.
1839280	1845880	Yeah, it's a bug collecting game.
1845880	1849640	Bug collecting or maybe just photos or something, nature.
1849640	1852040	Bird feeding, you collect the bugs and feed the birds.
1852040	1860840	I think it's something about photography because it's showing they have stuff for shooting
1860840	1869040	flowers and they've got a kind of like a collage, yeah it looks like just nature photos or something,
1869040	1874760	some sort of, I don't know, very niche.
1874760	1882520	And finally let's see Nintendo DS here, don't know if they've really got anything, oh actually
1882520	1887480	it's kind of neat, they've got some re-releases on Playstation 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, Rock
1887480	1892900	Stars Classic Edition, also San Andreas and Vice City Stories, all making their way out
1892900	1896200	as well.
1896200	1907040	Haru Kannaru Jinku no Kade 4, that's getting re-released as well.
1907040	1912400	And Nintendo DS, nothing in Japan right now.
1912400	1914400	Nintendo doesn't love you Japan.
1914400	1917640	At least no DS's this week.
1917640	1924400	Well how about we hop over a couple more oceans and get to Europe, sound good?
1924400	1926920	In the UK, we have Stuff.
1926920	1933720	On the 27th, Resident Evil Code Veronica X for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, Ico and Shadow
1933720	1941960	of the Colossus Collection HD for PS3 on the 28th, also on the 28th Mercury HG, Roshard,
1941960	1948640	The Binding of Isaac, Worms Ultimate Mayhem, Zelda Four Swords Anniversary Edition.
1948640	1954640	On the 29th we have Katamari Amore on the iPhone, and on the 30th we have Game of Thrones
1954640	1965240	Genesis, Child of Eden, Driver San Francisco, FIFA 12, We Sing UK Hits, and X-Men Destiny.
1965240	1968240	That's pretty much it.
1968240	1969240	Alright.
1969240	1971920	You got anything else for us?
1971920	1974520	Yeah, we've got some stuff here.
1974520	1978840	Really, I think we should do the Classic Game of the Week.
1978840	1979840	Really?
1979840	1980840	Okay.
1980840	1981840	Well then let's go ahead and do the Classic Game of the Week.
1981840	1983840	As soon as I find the music.
1983840	1988360	Since we're like, you know, flipping things around here and it's a very short show, might
1988360	1991080	as well.
1991080	2000920	Well then let's go ahead and get right into it.
2000920	2005200	This is the Classic Game of the Week where I take you back in time in my TARDIS and show
2005200	2008960	you games that you should have been playing, but did you play them?
2008960	2012360	No, because you probably weren't born.
2012360	2015040	Damn kids.
2015040	2021920	Today's game is one called Quartet that anyone who actually is a fan of Project Diva might
2021920	2024520	recognize the game.
2024520	2028800	You know, Quartet came out in 1986 and it was an arcade game put out by Sega.
2028800	2032840	You could have one to four players lead your characters through a base taken over by an
2032840	2034080	army of robots.
2034080	2036040	And it was set in the Fantasy Zone.
2036040	2041080	As in Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier.
2041080	2045160	In fact, Dan was telling me that Sega had this whole thing where their set of games
2045160	2048720	back in the day were all set in the Fantasy Zone that they were going to say every one
2048720	2051960	of their games were set there, but that didn't quite catch on.
2051960	2057200	At any rate, you've got a character named Joe, Mary, Lee, or Edgar and you go through
2057200	2060400	side-scrolling levels and you have to advance through the level and fight opponents that
2060400	2064520	come out of portals in the walls and eventually defeat a boss that has the door case you can
2064520	2065520	go to the next level.
2065520	2071240	And you've got different power-ups like a jet pack and springs for jumping and boosting
2071240	2074160	and different kinds of fun like that.
2074160	2078440	So I'm going to go ahead and actually get the music playing since I didn't think about
2078440	2080440	that so you can hear what it's like.
2080440	2085920	I'm going to start it over so you can hear it from the beginning because this is actually
2085920	2091160	one of the best pieces of gaming music ever.
2091160	2113880	If it will play.
2113880	2117560	This is from the Master System, so that's actually pretty good, but then again Master
2117560	2121200	System games really did have a lot of great music.
2121200	2128120	At any rate, you've got different weapon types, different orbs that will give you power-ups,
2128120	2132760	but if it's another player's color, then it just gives you bonus points.
2132760	2136680	And it came out around the same time as Gauntlet, sort of like I guess Sega's answer to Gauntlet.
2136680	2142440	But it did come out on the Master System, but you could only play as Mary or Edgar and
2142440	2144600	it was misspelled E-D-G-E-R.
2144600	2149960	So it came out in Japan as Double Target, but over here it still came out as Quartet.
2149960	2153440	There is also home versions.
2153440	2158720	There were Commodore 64, Amstrad, CPC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.
2158720	2164720	And the Okie Wrap and FM Funk music from the game were actually used later in the 1991
2164720	2166680	Spider-Man video game.
2166680	2173000	So Quartet 2 is an updated version that was done in a conversion kit that you could only
2173000	2176640	play two players in the arcade one, but you could still select your characters.
2176640	2179400	So that's the game of the week is Quartet.
2179400	2188280	Now, I was mentioning that fans of Project D.Va should be able to recognize this song
2188280	2193240	because a version of the song was used in Project D.Va 2nd.
2193240	2196000	I know it was in Project D.Va Arcade, so I was going to play a little bit of that for
2196000	2202160	you guys now, but if you stay tuned after this show, I'll play the whole thing.
2202160	2226640	So here it goes.
2226640	2255320	And that was the version from Project D.Va.
2255320	2257960	Pretty cool, huh?
2257960	2258960	Sure.
2258960	2260960	What next?
2260960	2264680	All right, let's move on along here.
2264680	2269040	We've got a few more stories left.
2269040	2270280	So let's see here.
2270280	2275680	Since we were talking a little bit about Project D.Va, and it kind of reminds me of actually
2275680	2280680	some of the Bahmani games, there's actually a new Bahmani, well, not technically a new
2280680	2284200	Bahmani game, but a new game to the arcades, I should say.
2284200	2288920	Dance Evolution, which was basically titled Dance Masters over here in the US, you may
2288920	2293240	remember it as kind of the Kinect dancing game from Konami, that didn't really sell
2293240	2297240	very well, but it was like Para, I guess.
2297240	2302840	But now it is making full circle and going to the arcades, where they have an actual
2302840	2309520	cabinet that's being location tested right now.
2309520	2317820	And I love the first licensed song, because it does kind of sum up everything.
2317820	2327520	So the first licensed song is Irony, Irony by Klarius, and a couple other Japanese songs,
2327520	2333440	one from AKB48 and Morning Musume.
2333440	2338960	And then of course, some of the Konami originals on the cabinet as well, Geisha's Dream by
2338960	2345660	Naoki featuring Smell Decay, Into Your Heart, The Roughage Remix, Naoki featuring Yasmin,
2345660	2356480	Keep on Movin' by NMR, Kimono Princess by Joon, My Summer Love by Mitsuo with Gala,
2356480	2364920	and let's see, Open Your Eyes, Naoki Maida, featuring JB, and Still in My Heart by Naoki,
2364920	2368440	and Unity by The Remembers.
2368440	2369440	That's fun.
2369440	2373840	We'd have to really do a lot of the upgrades to make it compete with just getting a home
2373840	2374840	version.
2374840	2379640	Well, it's basically, yeah, from the look of the cabinet, it's got a camera in there
2379640	2388880	as well, and they didn't really show any sort of actual game stage, it's just basically
2388880	2393840	the cabinet from the looks of it, and I'm thinking it's going to be very similar to
2393840	2398560	how the home game played, it's basically just kind of in front of a camera.
2398560	2403760	Unfortunately, they don't really have too much to go off of other than just a shot into
2403760	2407280	the cabinet, which looks like it's just got an HD screen.
2407280	2408720	They better have a lot of Eurobeat.
2408720	2410000	That kind of stuff in there.
2410000	2412520	Because honestly, that game just lends itself to Eurobeat.
2412520	2417160	Yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots, it looks just like a straight port of the
2417160	2422200	game, so yeah, interesting I guess.
2422200	2427480	I mean, I'd play it, and again, I like Dance Masters.
2427480	2435520	I don't know if I would, but I just, it lacked some stuff as far as cues on what the hell
2435520	2436520	to do.
2436520	2440400	But I mean, if you're used to playing Para, I guess it's not too different, well, especially
2440400	2443780	not too different if you're playing certain songs in the game, because the Para routines
2443780	2447320	are basically the routines from the game.
2447320	2449320	So yeah, I don't know.
2449320	2450600	Well, that's still pretty neat.
2450600	2454980	But I actually really want to see a machine before I pass judgment on it.
2454980	2459040	So maybe we'll get one over here eventually.
2459040	2463040	And in other news, now there is a game that I have mentioned to everybody before that's
2463040	2465180	called Snatcher.
2465180	2472880	And there was a radio drama called Dature, S-D-A-T-H-E-R, and the first two episodes
2472880	2475020	of it have been translated.
2475020	2477140	So that's actually pretty cool.
2477140	2483700	And I will link that to the chat room so that anyone who is a Snatcher fan will be able
2483700	2486520	to see it.
2486520	2492800	I would actually just like for them to do another update of the game so I can play it
2492800	2493800	again.
2493800	2498520	Oh, maybe as soon as he finishes all the other damn projects he has on deck, like the Metal
2498520	2505240	Gear Solid 3D game for 3DS that's still not out yet, or, oh, I don't know, the Metal Gear
2505240	2507920	Rising game that's...
2507920	2512520	I don't even know where the hell it happened with that game, I mean, it's maybe the end
2512520	2513520	of the next year.
2513520	2518960	And then of course he has his new Fox engine that he's working on games for, so it could
2518960	2522120	be a while.
2522120	2529160	Well, I would very much like to, see, that's the problem with talented people that get
2529160	2534200	too much on their plate, is they don't get the right stuff on their plate, at least to
2534200	2535200	come out anyway.
2535200	2538080	Yes, I agree, Zeether, Snatcher kicks ass.
2538080	2544800	I've actually got Snatcher for PS1, but of course it's all in Japanese, and my husband
2544800	2546800	lost patience with it really quickly.
2546800	2548560	But who knows.
2548560	2555220	So let's go ahead and open up Ye Olde Skypline, I will change this to online.
2555220	2566500	You can give us a call, our number is 1-866-877-GAME-OLR, and you will be live on air and we can embarrass
2566500	2568840	the crap out of you.
2568840	2570560	Ooh!
2570560	2571560	Are you afraid?
2571560	2579800	While we're waiting for calls to come in, just gonna read a couple other things, a third
2579800	2583120	round of songs have been announced for D&D Revolution 2, in case you're interested in
2583120	2588200	picking up the Wii version, I'm glad to see that DM Ashura is still getting work, he has
2588200	2595680	a song in there called Aftershock, also of course Kay with Dirty Digital, Dummy by Ram,
2595680	2606340	In Love With You, Kotaru featuring Aya, Sakura Storm by Ryu Star, also Delta Max by DM Ashura
2606340	2607680	as well.
2607680	2615320	It's really funny seeing all the old Bomani, DWI, step mania artists getting songs into
2615320	2616960	these games nowadays.
2616960	2618960	He said DWI.
2618960	2626440	Yeah, fans with intensity stuff, it's old school, John's not old school.
2626440	2632080	Well looks like no one's, oh we just got a caller, so I will go ahead and pick this up.
2632080	2635360	Hello, you've reached OLR, who's this?
2635360	2637640	Hi, it's CD Thunder.
2637640	2641280	Hello CD Thunder, and a happy belated birthday to you.
2641280	2642280	Thank you very much.
2642280	2645360	Welcome, so what's up, what's on your mind?
2645360	2650920	Not too much, just have a couple things to discuss.
2650920	2653480	Okay.
2653480	2659200	First thing is, I'd like to talk about one of my favorite video game characters of all
2659200	2660200	time.
2660200	2661200	And who is that?
2661200	2662200	Mario.
2662200	2663200	Oh.
2663200	2666920	So why is Mario your favorite?
2666920	2667920	It's one of my favorites.
2667920	2669240	One of your favorites, okay.
2669240	2671760	So what do you want to say about Mario?
2671760	2676840	Well the reason I like Mario is because I really like his outfit.
2676840	2683920	I love his hat and everything he can do with the fire flowers and all that stuff.
2683920	2688760	Is the fire flower your favorite power up for him?
2688760	2692160	For me it's the tanooki suit.
2692160	2697080	It would be the fire flower and that feather that gives him the cape.
2697080	2698080	Yeah.
2698080	2702800	I'm actually really a fan of Pull's boot, not Pull's voice, I'm thinking of the little
2702800	2703800	boot thing.
2703800	2704800	The kuberu shoe.
2704800	2705800	Kuberu, thank you.
2705800	2708480	I don't think I've seen that before, actually.
2708480	2710680	That's in Super Mario Brothers 3.
2710680	2711680	Oh.
2711680	2717200	Well, I, yeah, I mean, I haven't played many of the games.
2717200	2723840	I mean, I play like Super Mario, the new Super Mario Brothers for the DS and a lot of others,
2723840	2729120	but I just like everything about him.
2729120	2730360	That's cool.
2730360	2734800	So you said there were a couple of things you wanted to talk about, what was the other?
2734800	2737800	The other one is, I want to talk about prototype.
2737800	2738800	Prototype, okay.
2738800	2744560	What I like about that is you're a guy who's basically a human weapon.
2744560	2748800	You can do pretty much everything.
2748800	2751440	So like, you could blow up the earth if you wanted to?
2751440	2755360	What did you say?
2755360	2757520	You could blow up the earth if you wanted to?
2757520	2763880	Well, maybe, but I like how you can, what is it called?
2763880	2767440	You can, yeah, you consume other people and you can actually turn them to them if you
2767440	2770560	need to, to sneak around places.
2770560	2772320	That sounds like episodes of Supernatural.
2772320	2775800	Now are you looking forward to the sequel coming out next year?
2775800	2777520	Prototype 2?
2777520	2786040	I haven't actually seen anything about that, so I'm not sure what I feel on that yet.
2786040	2792320	And what you basically do with your character is a lot of free running, the parkour stuff,
2792320	2798080	because you can run up the walls and do flips and all that type of thing.
2798080	2800080	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
2800080	2801080	I didn't ever play it.
2801080	2802080	Oh really?
2802080	2803080	Yeah.
2803080	2804080	I wasn't too busy playing WoW.
2804080	2805080	Addicts?
2805080	2811560	Rob's my dealer and I can't yell at him.
2811560	2815720	I just wanted to see what you guys thought of Mario.
2815720	2818320	What are your opinions on him?
2818320	2819320	Iconic.
2819320	2823360	That's all I can say.
2823360	2824720	That's a good character, I guess.
2824720	2827720	Good franchise for Nintendo.
2827720	2833240	Well, yeah, that was pretty much all I wanted to call in about.
2833240	2837360	And yeah, birthday was yesterday and I turned 19.
2837360	2838360	Party time!
2838360	2839360	Happy birthday!
2839360	2841120	You're only two years away from the big party.
2841120	2842520	Yeah, I know.
2842520	2843520	It's scary.
2843520	2844520	Well, you have a good one.
2844520	2845520	Thanks for calling in.
2845520	2846520	Uh huh.
2846520	2847520	Bye.
2847520	2848520	Bye bye.
2848520	2852240	So, any other callers want to give us a call?
2852240	2858120	You can call us at 877-GAME-OLR or reach us on Skype or Orange Lounge Radio.
2858120	2859120	Please call.
2859120	2862520	While we're waiting for more calls here.
2862520	2868200	Kind of neat, Assassin's Creed, one of those games now that they're going to be adding
2868200	2872560	more content to the Playstation 3 version in the form of an older game.
2872560	2876600	Kind of like how Bioshock Infinite's going to have the original Bioshock in there.
2876600	2880800	Assassin's Creed Revelations is going to have the original Assassin's Creed on the same
2880800	2884520	disc because, you know, hey, the game doesn't use up all the blu-ray space and they can
2884520	2885520	do that.
2885520	2889520	And unfortunately they haven't really done anything to the original game as far as adding
2889520	2893000	trophy support or anything like that, but hey, you get another game in case, you know,
2893000	2895200	maybe you don't have the first Assassin's Creed.
2895200	2897200	I don't know.
2897200	2899080	Neat, I guess.
2899080	2905200	Also, I was going to mention Final Fantasy XIV is actually getting some updates.
2905200	2906200	We have a call.
2906200	2907200	Can we hold that one for after?
2907200	2908200	Sure.
2908200	2909200	Okay.
2909200	2910200	Hello, thank you for calling Orange Lounge Radio.
2910200	2911200	Who is this?
2911200	2912200	This is Kaijuto.
2912200	2913200	Can you hear me?
2913200	2914200	Yes, we can.
2914200	2915200	Hi, Kaijuto.
2915200	2916200	Long time no talk.
2916200	2917200	Hey, what's up?
2917200	2918200	This is what I was thinking.
2918200	2921920	Really don't know what to talk about, but your last caller, he was talking about Mario
2921920	2923720	and it made me think about something.
2923720	2926640	Why the hell doesn't Mario have a kid yet?
2926640	2928640	Like how old is he by now?
2928640	2929640	About 40, 50?
2929640	2934720	Yeah, but they say that sometimes obesity affects fertility.
2934720	2936960	Ah.
2936960	2943040	God maybe he seems to be a very well, maybe fungus people and humans aren't compatible.
2943040	2944480	Yeah, maybe so.
2944480	2948480	Yeah, I forgot that Princess Peach isn't necessarily from this dimension.
2948480	2955920	Either that or she's produced spores, but they mutated and turned into goombas.
2955920	2961480	And I don't know, I guess the next thing I'll talk about is games I'm looking forward to.
2961480	2965760	I've been going over my game list, like what I plan on buying, and I just realized that
2965760	2969400	I don't think I'm buying anything for the Xbox 360 for the rest of this year.
2969400	2970400	Really?
2970400	2974600	Yeah, I think everything that I'm buying is basically going to be for PlayStation 3.
2974600	2980720	Battlefield 3, I'm getting for PlayStation 3 just because it's like single disc and your
2980720	2982440	promise there's...
2982440	2985400	Uh oh, sorry.
2985400	2989400	Give us a call back, sorry.
2989400	2990400	Alright.
2990400	2993520	What was that?
2993520	2997000	Definitely picked up a call by accident, so my bad.
2997000	2998000	Okay.
2998000	3002800	I'm going to try to call, um, ah.
3002800	3005680	Yeah, this is ghetto ass broken radio.
3005680	3010640	Sorry, I didn't mean, I called you again by accident, we're going to have Rob edit this
3010640	3011640	out.
3011640	3012960	I will call you back as soon as this call is over.
3012960	3013960	How's that?
3013960	3014960	Alright.
3014960	3017960	Okay, thank you.
3017960	3024800	Okay, now I'm trying to figure out how to accept the call again.
3024800	3025800	Resume call.
3025800	3026800	Hi, sorry.
3026800	3027800	Are you, are you there?
3027800	3028800	Do you have me here?
3028800	3029800	Do you hear me?
3029800	3030800	I'm so sorry.
3030800	3039520	Um, I, we got another caller pop up and accidentally hit the answer button so it put you on hold.
3039520	3040520	Yeah.
3040520	3041520	No problem.
3041520	3044560	So, my apologies, I'm normally not the one that handles the Skype line as you can tell.
3044560	3047400	Yeah, I'm getting like double talk now.
3047400	3048400	Oh, fun.
3048400	3049400	Well.
3049400	3050400	Oh, wait a second.
3050400	3051400	Alright, there it is.
3051400	3052400	Okay.
3052400	3053400	I turned down, turned down my computer.
3053400	3054400	That would help.
3054400	3055400	Yeah.
3055400	3056400	So, I'm sorry, what were you saying?
3056400	3059320	Anyway, yes, so I mean, every game that I'm getting is pretty much going to be for PS3,
3059320	3061360	I just realized that, so.
3061360	3063160	I don't know, I don't think I'm the only one.
3063160	3067560	I think maybe, ah, 2012 is going to be the year of PS3 maybe.
3067560	3071240	Well, it seems like it's about time they did something right, huh?
3071240	3072240	Yeah.
3072240	3073240	It's about time.
3073240	3076640	Well, you know, it's like we said, the system's only as good as the games that are on it.
3076640	3077640	Yeah, that's true.
3077640	3078640	Yep.
3078640	3079640	Yep.
3079640	3080640	Alrighty.
3080640	3081640	Well.
3081640	3082640	Goodnight.
3082640	3083640	Alright, sorry for the mix-up.
3083640	3084640	Yeah, it's no problem.
3084640	3085640	Okay, buh-bye.
3085640	3094720	Okay, now, um, I will try to get a hold of Zither again, who was calling and I was being
3094720	3095720	a derp.
3095720	3099200	Hello, Zither, are you there?
3099200	3102640	Hi, it's Zither from the chat.
3102640	3103640	Hello.
3103640	3109000	Um, I was thinking of something to call about and I finally thought of something, um, you've
3109000	3110800	heard of Retro Game Challenge, right?
3110800	3112800	The DS game?
3112800	3113800	Yeah.
3113800	3119600	The, um, I've been watching the show that it's based on, Game Center CX, and it is awesome.
3119600	3123560	It is just one of the best things I've ever watched, one of the best Japanese television
3123560	3124560	shows I have ever watched.
3124560	3126760	So what do you like about it?
3126760	3131360	Um, it's really fun to watch because it has this guy struggling to get through the games
3131360	3137840	to get to the end and it's just, it's just cool watching him constantly try to make it
3137840	3144320	through and spending out these hours planning things out and getting through it.
3144320	3145320	That sounds pretty cool.
3145320	3147240	So it's just, you like the struggle.
3147240	3151640	Yeah, it's, it's very, they make it like overly dramatic sometimes.
3151640	3156000	Like, he'll be at like this impasse and they'll be like, and they'll be like, oh, how is he
3156000	3157000	going to get through this?
3157000	3159640	Is he going to be able to beat this enemy that's giving him trouble?
3159640	3165160	Like in one episode he was doing ghosts and goblins and the red demon was constantly giving
3165160	3169400	him hell and it was like, how is he going to get past this guy?
3169400	3171280	He's stuck in game over hell.
3171280	3176760	Oh, that I can imagine too, because like that last level is especially crappy with the red
3176760	3177760	demon.
3177760	3178760	Oh yeah.
3178760	3181440	And when he found out he had to do it all over again, he was like, I'm not going to
3181440	3182440	do this.
3182440	3183940	I'm going to just hand it over to one of the other guys.
3183940	3184940	He's going to do it.
3184940	3185940	It's.
3185940	3186940	Oh yeah.
3186940	3189720	He's going to beat the game and then it's like, no, go back.
3189720	3191840	No, you have to do it again.
3191840	3194880	That was, that game was like one of the ultimate in rage quits.
3194880	3196860	Yeah, it's definitely.
3196860	3201460	And um, he actually, I actually found out that the guy who was on, the guy who did,
3201460	3205840	the guy on the show who does the games, playing the games, his name is Arino.
3205840	3211840	He was actually in um, California at one point that like a couple of weeks ago he was doing
3211840	3218940	a special tape special that was going to be him going to the U S and, and a lot of people
3218940	3220080	showed up.
3220080	3222600	That's pretty cool.
3222600	3223600	Yeah.
3223600	3226900	The retro game challenge game is also extremely fun.
3226900	3230000	It's definitely one of my favorite DS games.
3230000	3234840	I might have to check that out given, you know, my husband and I are like the huge game,
3234840	3236200	old school game people.
3236200	3237240	It's very good.
3237240	3240280	It's got some, it's got some really, really good games in it.
3240280	3243980	The sequel didn't come out here, but there's actually a group that's working on a fan translation
3243980	3244980	for it.
3244980	3248720	And so far from what I can tell, it looks pretty close to what we got here for the first
3248720	3249720	game.
3249720	3251720	That sounds awesome.
3251720	3253080	Yeah.
3253080	3255520	And uh, yeah, Snatcher, really good game.
3255520	3257000	Snatcher is fantastic.
3257000	3259360	I've still been trying to find a Sega CD copy.
3259360	3261600	Oh yeah, it's really hard to find it.
3261600	3264760	I've just had to emulate, but it's, it's really good.
3264760	3266960	I, I really like it.
3266960	3267960	The plot is great.
3267960	3272800	I still, I need to get back to it because I've gotten pretty far into the, pretty decently
3272800	3275200	far into the game, but it's really good.
3275200	3276200	I like the music.
3276200	3278480	I like the voice, the voice acting.
3278480	3282280	It's very, very well done for a game that's from like the early nineties.
3282280	3283920	The little Metal Gear cameo.
3283920	3286440	Yes, Metal Gear walking around.
3286440	3292640	I especially liked, um, the club, the Outer Heaven Club and when you were, when you went
3292640	3297000	there, you got to pick a mask and I picked the Moai head and there was all the Konami
3297000	3303000	characters there and, um, who was it, um, Gillian was like, I don't know if we fit in
3303000	3305520	and Metal Gear is like, I think we fit in more than you think.
3305520	3308960	And I kind of caught that subtle Gradius reference.
3308960	3310400	Very, very cool.
3310400	3312000	Yeah, that's super neat.
3312000	3313560	Well, pretty cool.
3313560	3316040	So you got anything else for us?
3316040	3317200	No, nothing else.
3317200	3318200	All right.
3318200	3321120	Well, I'm sorry that I hung up on you earlier.
3321120	3322120	It's all right.
3322120	3325440	I attribute that to derp because it's the derpisode.
3325440	3327160	It's mad buggy.
3327160	3329480	Bug report.
3329480	3330480	All right.
3330480	3331480	All right.
3331480	3332480	Later.
3332480	3333480	Later.
3333480	3334480	All right guys.
3334480	3335480	You can give us a call.
3335480	3336800	We'll take one more call.
3336800	3341440	It's a eight seven seven game O L R. Do you have any other last minute stories for us?
3341440	3342440	Yeah.
3342440	3343440	I was going to finish up real quick.
3343440	3344440	Yeah, that's right.
3344440	3345440	The yeah.
3345440	3346440	Yeah.
3346440	3348440	Final Fantasy 14, you know, they didn't really fix the game yet all the way, but they did
3348440	3354020	add chocobos and uh, you can get a three, they have three different chocobos stables
3354020	3359400	in the game, um, which you can eat your very own chocobo whistle and you can ride chocobos
3359400	3361140	pretty much anywhere in the game.
3361140	3366720	Also they have added materia so you can add materia and augment your weapons as well.
3366720	3372920	And then finally airships, um, have been added into the game as well so that you can actually
3372920	3374480	ride across everything.
3374480	3375480	I don't know.
3375480	3379480	It's just really, you didn't have chocobos or airships in this game.
3379480	3381280	I mean you had it in 11.
3381280	3384960	Why is, should this be any different considering that you're reusing everything anyways?
3384960	3387280	Well, we got another call in.
3387280	3389640	This is the last call of the night.
3389640	3390640	Hello.
3390640	3391640	You have reached orange launch radio.
3391640	3392640	Who is this?
3392640	3394480	Yo, it's Xenocore from the LKC.
3394480	3395480	How y'all doing?
3395480	3396480	Doing good.
3396480	3397480	How are you Xenocore?
3397480	3398760	Uh, well rested from my trip.
3398760	3403280	I think you might've heard a bit when I spoke on Bobby, but yeah, driving to Florida and
3403280	3405000	back is no fun.
3405000	3407520	Uh, that doesn't sound like fun at all.
3407520	3408520	Yeah.
3408520	3412680	Especially when it's just for family duties, not a real vacation, but anyway, we're here
3412680	3413680	about games.
3413680	3414680	Yep.
3414680	3415680	So what is up?
3415680	3417080	Uh, not much.
3417080	3422360	I did want to include a small thing, uh, on top of, you know, uh, Arino playing old school
3422360	3423840	games on Game Center CX.
3423840	3427160	He also does do interviews with some of the game makers in Japan.
3427160	3430160	He's already talked to the guys in charge of Castlevania.
3430160	3433720	He talked to Kojima about Metal Gear and its history and other things like that.
3433720	3437660	There's a lot of stuff that, like for instance, Kotaku is covering the gaming that he's doing
3437660	3441640	and doing some awful voiceover on some of the stuff.
3441640	3447280	But there's an account on, uh, YouTube that somebody has been putting all the fan subs
3447280	3449360	that have been done online.
3449360	3453440	And I put a link to one of them in chat, but, uh, they've got over 24 of the episodes already,
3453440	3457400	including the one where he went to Korea and talked to some gamers over there as well.
3457400	3459860	It is really an outstanding show.
3459860	3462900	I'm going to have to check that out as, I mean, it sounds like something totally up
3462900	3463900	my alley.
3463900	3467640	I just had never, I mean, I've heard of it before, but I haven't ever seen any.
3467640	3468640	Yeah.
3468640	3472840	Right around 903 in chat, if you take that link, that'll give you the account name.
3472840	3476400	I think it's like active circle or something like that, but he's putting all that stuff
3476400	3477400	on there.
3477400	3478400	You can give it a go.
3478400	3487600	And, uh, the other thing, um, I'm still curious as to whether or not I should, as much as
3487600	3493400	I love Space Marine, I've heard rumors that the multiplayer population has already died
3493400	3494400	out.
3494400	3495400	Really?
3495400	3496400	It's kind of sucks.
3496400	3497720	I'm not sure if that's accurate or not.
3497720	3501960	I mean, it's probably just fanboys complaining, but I hope not because that game was awesome
3501960	3504400	and I, I played it from game fly.
3504400	3507920	I do want to get a full version of it, but I'm not going to do it if the multiplayer
3507920	3508920	isn't there.
3508920	3510200	Cause that's the only thing that's left in there for me.
3510200	3511200	Yeah.
3511200	3514200	Well, I mean, if the game doesn't give you what you want, what's the point, right?
3514200	3518560	Well, it gave me everything I wanted, but it was a multi, the single player, you know,
3518560	3521040	once you go through that, you pretty much know it as fun as it is.
3521040	3524800	I'm not the kind of guy that can just do that repeatedly and get enjoyment out of it.
3524800	3525800	So yeah.
3525800	3530360	But, uh, I hope, I hope they make another one cause that was an outstanding representation
3530360	3531880	of what to do with that franchise.
3531880	3534240	So they can keep her fingers crossed, right?
3534240	3535240	Mm hmm.
3535240	3536240	Offer a little prayer.
3536240	3537240	Yup.
3537240	3538240	Yup.
3538240	3541880	But, uh, awesome job today, guys, uh, sky isn't missing the thing.
3541880	3542880	So good job.
3542880	3546420	He actually just texted that he made it to San Francisco and I was going to reply that
3546420	3550000	I'm hateful and jealous, but nah, that's okay.
3550000	3553920	He has to stay in there and the audience with the rest of the granted lady Tron's playing,
3553920	3556020	but he's going to get, you know, funk right all over him.
3556020	3561880	So you know, yeah, he's going to come back smelling like pot and then he's going to get
3561880	3562880	sick.
3562880	3563880	No, I'm kidding.
3563880	3564880	All right.
3564880	3565880	Well thank you for calling.
3565880	3566880	Did you have anything else?
3566880	3567880	No, that's pretty much it.
3567880	3568880	Pretty light today.
3568880	3569880	So alrighty.
3569880	3571880	Well you take care and we will hear from you next week maybe.
3571880	3576300	Oh, hopefully next week we actually have a special guest on the show.
3576300	3577300	Another host.
3577300	3578300	It's Dan.
3578300	3579300	So I guess he's not that special.
3579300	3581700	I mean he's special, special to me.
3581700	3583280	Just a little bit special.
3583280	3584280	Just special.
3584280	3585280	Okay.
3585280	3586280	Bye bye.
3586280	3587280	All right.
3587280	3588280	Later.
3588280	3589280	All right.
3589280	3592560	That was our last call of the night and sorry anyone else who was trying to get in because
3592560	3596800	believe it or not, we did have people trying to get in, but nope, that was it.
3596800	3599680	And I actually do have another story.
3599680	3608480	Just a little story that came to us courtesy, courtesy, courtesy of a tiger claw and that's
3608480	3614180	that Microsoft is allowing a small number of mistakenly banned Xbox 360 players back
3614180	3616360	on Xbox Live.
3616360	3623140	So they actually, Steven Toulouse wrote a blog about that some of the suspensions were
3623140	3627360	mistakenly made by different software being used and so they are bringing those people
3627360	3631560	back there and banning them and will give them a free three month subscription to Xbox
3631560	3635600	Live Gold and 1600 Microsoft Points.
3635600	3640160	And they said it was very specific issue and it happened between August 29th and September
3640160	3641160	9th.
3641160	3644120	So they've got it lined up.
3644120	3649280	So I guess that's nice of them saying, oh, we screwed up here.
3649280	3651760	Do you have anything else for us?
3651760	3656080	Just one thing real quick and it's more of a PSA than anything.
3656080	3657080	All right.
3657080	3663340	Remember we talked, well, I talked about the Tommy Wee Show that I guess is something that's
3663340	3669040	running from Makima on YouTube and stuff like that.
3669040	3676780	Well, they had the first episode featuring Tommy with so and it is fucking stupid.
3676780	3680440	First off, it's a rip off of Mr. Science Theory 3000.
3680440	3687000	Secondly, Tommy with so cannot form English sentences.
3687000	3690280	He's just, it's just so fucking stupid.
3690280	3694880	And the only humor that you'd find in this is that he's really stupid.
3694880	3700880	So I mean, if you like watching stupid people play games, I'm sure there's plenty of videos
3700880	3706920	out there on the Internet of people playing games, but it is seriously a rip off of Mr.
3706920	3711520	Science Theory 3000 straight up to the set, to the logo, to everything.
3711520	3712520	Wow.
3712520	3713520	That's just.
3713520	3717260	And it's not even to the fact that he's mocking a game being played.
3717260	3722960	It's him playing a game while this alien's mocking him.
3722960	3727280	And I mean, at one point he accidentally hits the PlayStation button and it goes to the
3727280	3732720	cross menu bar and he's just, how do I get out of this?
3732720	3737160	I mean, it's dumb, so please don't watch it.
3737160	3739440	Just let it die in a fire.
3739440	3740440	Lame.
3740440	3745600	Well, that's it for OLR, but I'm actually going to go ahead and play, um, oh, actually,
3745600	3746600	you know what?
3746600	3747600	So never mind.
3747600	3751840	I'm not going to play anything, but I'm going to give everyone a little bitty tip.
3751840	3756840	Stay tuned after the show and you will hear a blast from the past in the form of a modified
3756840	3758360	pump up the volume.
3758360	3760960	So, uh, do you have any final thoughts?
3760960	3761960	Uh, no.
3761960	3762960	Yeah.
3762960	3767880	I don't have any either except that I'm just going to do some music for about an hour so
3767880	3771120	that you guys don't feel like we've gone, oh, don't want to.
3771120	3772120	Okay.
3772120	3773120	So anyway, thank you for listening.
