14047	26916	Tonight, September 18, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink, the PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new section to the PSN Terms of Service.
31579	39165	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39639	51245	My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode number 428 with my co-host, first off, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51385	53626	We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken.
54326	55186	You can have some if you want.
55627	56067	I see, yes.
56447	57508	DarkSakura's eating chicken.
57828	61049	TechMasterLoki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken.
61329	61529	Yeah.
61970	64611	And I am chicken-less, but I do have... You can have some chicken.
64831	65411	No, it's okay.
65491	66592	I actually don't really want chicken.
67012	68653	I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino.
69133	69634	So I'm good.
69854	70935	I had a pumpkin spice latte.
71375	74317	I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full.
74598	76699	So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry.
76939	77340	It's weird.
77780	78401	I can't explain it.
78981	79241	Okay.
80002	80282	Anyhow.
81063	83885	By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that cracked article.
84491	86212	What is this article you were reading about?
86352	90395	It was one of those little Photoshop things where they do rejected book covers.
91215	93897	And one of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand.
94698	98000	You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not knocking it.
98020	99340	This is just what I've noticed about them.
99360	100241	An observation, if you will.
100581	102663	They really seem to have made a name for themselves.
102763	104444	I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine?
104564	106705	Like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years ago?
106985	108786	Yeah, it was Mad Magazine and Light.
108826	109767	Does that still exist?
109867	110708	Like Cracked Magazine?
110728	111128	I don't even know.
112769	118715	Cracked is on Dig and those websites all the time because they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that.
118775	119396	I think it's awesome.
119496	121057	That's all they do is lists.
121518	122319	I'm going to do one for them.
123480	124841	Do they take user-submitted articles?
125502	130747	Well, they do, but the better that they are, they'll start paying you for them or something.
130907	131387	There you go.
131407	131928	Okay, cool.
132268	133108	New industry for you.
133468	146812	Hey, why don't you join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com We do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
146932	149133	Although, to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight.
149733	177984	but never mind if you're listening on the podcast and you've never heard a live show before he'll be back next week so again if you are listening to us live at All Games Radio though join us in the chat room again that's chat.orangeloungeradio.com where we do often read comments from chat tonight which actually I gotta admit chat's a little more dead than I usually see it and I don't know if that's just we didn't have a lead in tonight because Bobby was off or is it the Emmys like is everybody off watching the Emmys like I know that's our competition we are always up against some stupid award show
178584	185989	I can't wait till it's over so I can see Kathy Griffin's roast of the Emmys She's doing something now where she like bashes the Emmys when it's over
200225	202425	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
225590	226431	It's part of the shmemies
249969	251091	Nick Arcade Video Game TV Shows
266414	281909	I was, um, I watched that one, and I can never remember the name of it, where, um, they would send the team through this, like, labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests, and they would attach the prizes to their vests as they went along.
281989	283790	I vaguely remember that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
283911	287734	And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons, so I would watch it all the time.
287814	288034	Uh-huh.
288975	293276	and I was like, you can't stick a TurboGrafx to your front, put it on your back.
293316	295057	They were empty boxes probably.
295077	296758	It was just all props or something like that.
296778	299418	But I mean, they'd grab games and stuff and it was pretty cool.
300019	301099	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
301739	302599	I can't remember the name of it.
302619	303220	It was, um...
304580	305020	Outro Music
325788	328130	The Biggest Loser is his thing.
328971	330233	How appropriate for him.
331594	333576	There was another show that was on too that he switched.
333596	335178	He will always be Funhaus to me.
335298	336179	I'm sorry, okay?
336259	336819	That's what it was.
337139	338040	No, it wasn't Funhaus.
338060	340102	Funhaus was like the double dare turned up to 11.
342136	348238	But it was also, well, you remember that show, what was it, The Quest of the Kingdom or something?
348618	351299	But that's not one of the thing of, there's another guy who had brown hair.
351780	353260	He'd always wear like a members only jacket.
355061	355461	This was the 80s.
355481	357041	Is that John Davidson?
357522	359102	Wasn't he on Hollywood Squares?
360163	363344	He sat in a chair that looked a lot like Captain Kirk's chair.
364584	379757	and I remember this show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and about taking the cards and switching them out you know putting them in the machine saving your game and coming home and playing it at home and for the life of me I cannot remember what the name of the show was
381727	387511	Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters at chat.arnstalksradio.com shout it out.
387751	393575	Why is it that video game television hasn't really seemed to work?
394416	396257	There has been a few exceptions.
396337	397998	I know some of you guys dig X-Play.
398058	402141	I know there's that show on Spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives, the one that Jeff Keighley does.
402661	412331	There's been a few things here and there but G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games but it didn't work because it went this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys.
412672	418278	Is it just that we're too busy wanting to play video games than watch people talk about it on the TV?
419058	420480	Why doesn't it work?
421218	422639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
445621	448462	Internet's faster than TV or print media.
448642	449363	That's just the way it is.
449423	452604	Unless they're breaking news, that's kind of the way it goes.
452784	454365	I'm positive one of them was video power.
455325	457146	We have a story coming up later tonight.
457166	463929	I'm not going to totally get into it now, but one of the big consoles is launching a TV-related thing, and we'll talk more about that later.
465109	488460	but that does kind of seem to be like the future especially when we talk a lot about like video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation as well as Xbox and do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices like almost for some people maybe replacing cable someday I don't know do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles?
489116	494600	Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming-related content on there.
494700	497282	They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything.
497702	501505	Kind of like the Majors Minute on Xbox 360.
501605	506709	As nice as that is, let's be real, it's just a product awareness thing for Microsoft, right?
507429	516995	I'm trying to find... There was an article I saw talking about some new video game show that's coming and it was by the guy that did The Room or something like that.
517076	520838	Not Silent Hill The Room, but actually... Like the horrible cult movie The Room?
520898	522279	Yes, the horrible cult movie.
522519	523320	It's actually him.
524080	525821	And it looks so fucking terrible.
526021	527722	I just can't remember what it's called.
527742	529462	Then it's parody or it's a joke or something.
529503	531323	I don't think it's something to take too seriously.
531443	533344	I am your something interest.
533364	534165	I don't remember what it was.
534305	535225	It was just retarded.
535245	539887	For the record, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show but different seasons of it.
541728	542348	It's Video Power?
542488	545229	Video Power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became a game show.
545790	546230	Oh, yeah.
546250	546870	I remember that one.
546890	547710	Yeah, it was like a game show.
547750	548211	It had tips.
548331	548771	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
549224	549244	1990-92
572635	573356	Wow, was it really?
573576	575658	In two different formats from 1990 through 92.
575778	577760	Gosh, I'm with Dan in the other room.
577800	579061	I thought it was way earlier than that.
579642	582284	Of course, Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right?
582384	583886	Presented by Stevie Poskoski.
584286	585627	I'm going to double check IMDB.
587849	588850	Let me hit on this.
589150	590371	I want to mention this.
590691	600479	You know one thing that I think would have made an awesome television show would have been the 1 vs. 100 on Xbox 360.
601059	605162	I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a goldmine with that and they let it go.
605663	608365	I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but
609005	612646	Man, I know so many people that were so into that, and it's really weird that they let it go.
612946	620388	And it really made me think, like, why hasn't, like, Game Show Network tried to pick up, like, an actual game show that runs through consoles or something?
620428	620788	I don't know.
620928	621648	All right, I found it.
621868	627250	It's called the Tommy Wee Show, and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau.
628130	630971	And basically, it's supposed to be this weird...
632404	632905	I don't know.
634286	650238	They're saying it's going to be presented by Makima, and it basically follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games.
651019	660304	So it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy that looks like he's the Undertaker or something like that.
660404	661545	It's just ridiculous.
661605	661925	I don't know.
662025	662806	Hey, guess what?
664647	665207	No one cares.
665745	667046	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
689343	702247	We'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other game-slash-TV-related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be tied into an MMO.
702507	704068	It popped in my head.
704108	705448	It was something I think they had talked about at E3.
705488	707089	Do you remember anything about that, Loki?
707109	710310	I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called, and nor do I care.
712610	713571	It's a sci-fi show.
713591	713971	I mean, come on.
714671	715872	X-Play
729707	734169	um what was the other one that was yeah Portal was kind of lame they had that on there um
760436	761917	Just watch all the online reviews now.
761937	765058	Dave, where he'd go running around in MMOs.
765718	767279	Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted?
767879	768100	No.
769440	776403	I just really watch YouTube like the angry video game nerd and, you know, crap.
776423	780225	What's that other one that you watch?
780705	781426	Classic Game Room.
781446	781986	Maybe that's it.
782066	784547	Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming.
784907	789049	Such as the show you're listening to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey.
790083	792525	We have a YouTube channel, we just don't really do anything with it.
792886	793346	There you go.
795248	799292	I use mine to post videos of Shermie and my best friend's son.
799893	803116	My post-grant, I thought, are related videos.
804099	808663	and one video that I had to upload a trailer so I can link it on a newsletter I was doing.
809163	815328	Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there because it's some really crappy hunting game.
818110	818850	Hey, you know what?
818970	819971	I don't care if it sucks.
819991	821052	I had to put the trailer up there.
822516	826398	Tiger Claw mentioned something about a Gunstringer game that was put out by Troma.
827098	828199	You know what Troma did, right?
829019	830079	Toxic Avenger movies?
830099	835001	Yeah, I was going to say, they do all the really campy B-movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet and stuff, right?
835182	842985	It's just that Sars, what's his name from Troma, Lloyd McCoffman or whatever, he's in there.
843005	843585	Yeah.
846980	847260	All right.
847860	851321	Stop trying to get into stories that we make up for later on, bastard.
851921	852341	Let's move on.
852361	852901	You listen.
852941	854002	You don't control the show.
854022	855282	That's okay.
855302	855862	I don't care.
855982	857482	I don't think we're even talking about that tonight.
857642	858442	Let's move on.
858603	859823	Let's talk about our gaming week.
859843	863324	So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.
863404	864624	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
864904	865384	Wow.
866904	868465	As in the worlds of Warcraft?
868705	869145	Wow.
869545	869885	Nerd.
870225	871065	Wow, you're a nerd.
871465	872345	Wow, get a life.
872465	872946	And Sims.
873226	873846	I've been playing Sims 3.
873906	874086	Okay.
875598	877360	and I played some Tiny Tower.
879042	879502	Wow.
880183	882245	Of course, these are all the same games I play, but I like to make them.
882285	884007	And I played Espagaluda.
885328	886349	I can never say it.
886909	890193	Espagaluda 2 on my phone.
890293	892115	Did you check out Radiant Silvergun on Xbox yet?
892135	893356	That seems like something that would be up your alley.
893456	894257	I know that came out this week.
894277	895278	We've already got like
896837	899898	But don't you want to see the super uber HD version prettiness?
899918	902138	I don't think that we got it yet, now that I think about it.
902418	905139	Yeah, I was thinking of you when I saw that on Xbox Live the other day.
905159	905859	I was like, oh.
905879	907239	I want to play the crap out of that.
907279	914081	Well, I was actually going to sit down and play some Symphony of the Night today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day.
915181	916722	Damn Dracula causing those migraines.
917422	917722	Yeah.
917742	918122	Damn him.
919362	922863	It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine.
924165	925146	Loki, how was your gaming week?
925686	926026	It was alright.
926146	928028	Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff.
929048	930109	Mainly just three things.
930669	933291	Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon, played lots of that.
933891	938574	I think I have my jet guy now almost level 7.
940716	949801	And Grand Theft Auto, we went back to Lost and Damned again because they got tired of getting punked in Battle of the Gay Tonys, so now they're getting punked in Lost and Damned.
951062	952083	Mixing it up a bit, I guess.
953685	961468	Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, Virtual Console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that right now.
961508	965670	I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um...
967838	968279	It's fun.
969980	975485	The virtual console stuff is alright, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really covered it before.
975505	976546	I'm sure they have.
977667	985595	But, man, that D-pad... I mean, Nintendo is known for pretty good D-pads, especially with the NES and stuff like that.
985675	989278	Great D-pad work, I think, pretty flawlessly.
989298	989378	Yeah.
990399	1019092	but that d-pad on that 3DS is terrible and that what are they calling it now the circle pad or whatever not good either so it's just kind of like okay which terrible control method do I want to use so I end up using the circle pad for most things but it is not not good at all aside from that though the emulation is good it's just that d-pad is terrible but no d-pad looked good the one with Vita
1020686	1022848	Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say.
1022868	1024089	But I guess we'll get into that a little later.
1024109	1026231	Because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds.
1026271	1027652	It's like, this is like handheld week.
1027992	1029473	There's tons and tons of news about both.
1029934	1030814	We'll get into that a little later.
1030834	1031615	Is that it for your gaming week?
1032136	1032536	Sounds like it.
1032656	1032836	Yeah.
1033076	1037040	Alright, my gaming week was mostly uneventful.
1037200	1039622	I played a lot of the same stuff like WoW and so forth too.
1039702	1042965	I had to really talk myself down from buying Magicka on Steam today.
1043385	1044546	Although the game looks kind of fun.
1044626	1045847	I might still buy it when I get home.
1046227	1046648	It's like...
1047568	1071770	only like nine bucks for the uber edition right now on Steam or you can get like the buy four copies of the game for seven dollars and like it's it's some obscene sale going on on Steam right now and man I love and I hate Steam you know what I mean like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap I hate that I'm keep spending money on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'd be all like oh I gotta go back to WoW
1072630	1075032	As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A.
1075072	1087559	Noire on the consoles, did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action sequences, and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you can just skip the action sequences, because I just wasn't getting it.
1087619	1089800	Let me put it this way.
1089920	1095323	At the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and the suspect just bolts.
1095583	1096464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1116857	1117418	Thank you for watching!
1136081	1144724	because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and going to investigate the suspects or excuse me, interrogate the suspects and put that all together.
1144764	1145845	And investigating.
1145965	1151287	It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something.
1151347	1156129	And it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button.
1156509	1159610	Like I literally sit there and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
1159630	1163231	And it's like, your final answer is truth.
1163591	1165192	And then it goes, do, do, do.
1165552	1165912	Fuck!
1167294	1168295	I knew the bitch was lying.
1168956	1175322	They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird at the guy.
1177524	1183671	But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto games and all that stuff, but I'm really liking L.A.
1183691	1184171	Noire.
1184371	1188676	I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so...
1189376	1191577	So, yeah, I'm going to play some more of that one.
1191838	1192398	It's really cool.
1192698	1196280	Some comments on Magicka in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1197461	1200503	Infinel, I hope I said that right, says Magicka is crazy fun.
1201183	1204005	And Kaijudo says Magicka is crazy lag for me.
1204365	1206867	Make sure they fix that lag before you buy.
1207247	1210168	I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing.
1210529	1210949	Interesting.
1211589	1211829	Okay.
1213150	1231440	so yeah I've been playing that now there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week and I didn't know if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's box here by saying what I've been playing but I figure what the hell I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway so if any hate mail comes in I wouldn't see it anyway
1232120	1236346	So if you've listened to the show for any length of time, I told you guys I don't pirate games.
1236566	1238348	I don't download a lot of games.
1238388	1239129	I don't pirate games.
1239189	1244917	Except I have downloaded in the past, like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bomani games.
1245456	1246677	I was going to bring you something.
1246697	1248239	I was going to bring you President Cat.
1249339	1250500	I forgot both things.
1250520	1251021	That's different.
1251041	1252602	That's different.
1252662	1259128	But I was going to play the – you used to back in the day I would download – because I'm not paying $80 to import all these games.
1259588	1263592	My mindset is if you want my money, release the game in my territory and I'll buy it.
1264432	1266034	Xenoblade Chronicles Xenoblade Chronicles
1279810	1280090	Yes.
1280610	1283251	Is it something the Wii needs on its system?
1283551	1284251	I think so.
1284791	1287892	But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles.
1287932	1293193	The first thing out of my mouth, because Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well, how was it?
1293614	1294574	And I said, you know what?
1295514	1299035	It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game.
1300945	1321497	and that's kind of how I felt about it is that the graphics really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 which you know is understandable it's the Wii the game itself feels a lot like I don't know it's kind of like Final Fantasy 12 with MMO elements and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other you know Xeno games so
1322538	1323879	There's a lot to do in the game.
1323979	1325120	There's a lot of quests.
1325140	1327062	There's a lot of things you can do in the game.
1327082	1328223	And the world is vast.
1328623	1330665	And it's really something else.
1330865	1337231	And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting the game out here.
1337611	1340553	And quite frankly, if they're not going to put it out here, you should do what I did.
1341554	1342775	Don't miss out on a great game.
1342855	1346578	Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what?
1346879	1349761	I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country.
1352383	1352843	There you go.
1353523	1354724	You need to mod our Wii.
1375288	1390653	Really easily being adapted for the Wii U There's a lot, like the menu system There's a lot to it, there's a lot of subscreens You could use that second device The little controller, very easily To do a lot of that, and then you could have The really nice souped up graphics And to be honest, if Nintendo
1392077	1394578	I think Enchanted Arms was the only remote RPG available for like six months.
1394598	1394819	Oblivion?
1412128	1414349	Oh yeah, but I'm thinking Japanese RPG.
1414449	1421654	I'm not thinking... There's a big difference in my mind between a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion.
1421714	1423755	Oblivion's its own thing.
1424556	1425577	But yeah, you're right, you're right.
1425637	1428639	Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title.
1428679	1429860	No, here's what they're gonna do.
1429920	1430280	Come on.
1430760	1432803	I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo.
1432843	1434666	And yeah, I can see them doing that because you know what?
1435067	1439333	They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U. They've got nothing.
1439413	1446363	So they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer because people will just be really pissed off then.
1447484	1448604	But here's what they're going to do.
1449104	1451885	All they're going to do is they're going to fucking upscale that shit.
1451905	1453606	They're not going to redo the graphics.
1453626	1456826	They're going to upscale the polygons, and you're going to have low-res textures.
1458287	1464768	Like you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection, there's different ways that they do HD.
1464848	1467249	Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft website.
1467469	1468010	Thanks for watching!
1490612	1491672	That's all they're going to fucking do.
1491912	1495514	And they're going to maybe add some support for the Wii U tablet thing.
1495574	1496974	But you know what?
1497034	1499035	People will be like, Oh my God, that's amazing.
1499075	1499555	That's great.
1499835	1500755	But that's what they're doing.
1500795	1508978	They're holding out so that they go, Look it, we understand what the hardcore fan wants and we brought it to you with the Wii U and you're supposed to go...
1509458	1511741	Oh my god, Nintendo, my savior!
1511861	1513483	I'm gonna go buy your system now!
1513783	1529021	But you need to see through this shit and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to hold this little carrot in front of my nose so I buy another fucking system that they end up catering to the goddamn masses for and make all these casual games and completely forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system.
1529437	1551109	Here's the thing though like I agree and I don't because the thing is at the end of the day it's not just about the graphics and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome especially like if you like JRPGs at all or you like these kind of like you know very open world do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cut scenes for battle and all this.
1551890	1553091	The presentation of the game is great.
1553171	1557114	And the game itself, story and everything, is pretty awesome.
1557594	1566962	I don't think they need to do... I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even up-rezzing or whatever little tweaks they can make to it that bring it a bump up, I think it's okay.
1567403	1569805	Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself.
1570165	1572207	System is only as good as the games that are on it.
1572247	1572447	Right?
1573560	1579202	Well, then if that's the way they want to go, they want to bring it out over here and they need to bring it out on the Wii like it is now because it's done.
1579442	1588106	It can be put out now and then they can do a special edition later on that has better graphics or an HD version and that would come out like a year later.
1588266	1589106	What's the problem with that?
1589186	1591267	You get to sell it twice and people may buy it twice.
1591994	1604321	The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn to the dark side to do it.
1604701	1611565	And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade in the US.
1611645	1613806	Like, Nintendo is just being fucking deaf.
1614546	1642852	and that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U but I think they should have announced that by now and like I would have waited to play this game if they'd announced it on the Wii U I would have said cool it'll give me a launch game that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online but seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like you know what this game is never going to come out and I really want to play it so gosh there's this ABC how to run these games on my Wii right in front of my face I
1643325	1643705	I'm doing it.
1644586	1645407	I want to play this game.
1647949	1651232	So, be mad if you want, but I'm just being real.
1651492	1652653	I'm not the only one out there.
1653334	1656657	Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it.
1656817	1661501	To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game.
1661762	1664204	Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that.
1664404	1666546	But, let's be real...
1670729	1671649	Let's be real.
1672590	1677492	You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people.
1677692	1678553	Come on.
1679613	1680294	Don't be ignorant.
1680314	1681374	And I say that to everybody.
1681934	1683675	So it is what it is.
1684215	1685216	It's that, you know.
1686276	1689338	So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U?
1689958	1693100	Probably, but I don't know.
1694001	1698264	That depends if we want to buy the Wii U. Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U?
1699305	1699885	I don't know.
1700786	1705349	Well, here's the thing with the Wii U. I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system.
1705469	1707450	There's like Batman Arkham City.
1708591	1709051	Why?
1709732	1713835	You're going to release a game that's been out for a year now on that system?
1714435	1715616	I mean, who cares?
1715636	1715896	Yeah.
1717775	1718735	I just don't even see a point.
1718795	1720716	Release Skyward Sword on there then.
1720976	1723557	No one's going to fucking care because it's been out for a year.
1726478	1726798	I don't know.
1727078	1729439	Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that.
1731320	1733060	I'd be surprised if that system comes out next year.
1734421	1735261	Alright, well we'll see.
1735741	1736462	Alright, well that's it.
1737422	1738802	That's all I'm going to say for my gaming week.
1739763	1741063	Yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game.
1741423	1744564	And it's really too bad that Nintendo won't release it here.
1744664	1745225	What else can I say?
1746690	1751612	Alright, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's stories.
1752373	1753953	I will not be here for the next two weeks.
1754554	1755314	Yeah, two weeks.
1755674	1765979	I'm actually, after last week's show, I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that and it's the one I do every year, so...
1766710	1787906	yep I'm taking a little break sorry guys but I believe the one and only Tiara is going to be here covering at least next week if not both weeks I don't know yet just next week so there will be some type of live shows so tune in as always and I'll miss you guys but at the same time damn we need vacations once in a while give me a break
1789727	1790888	Let's get into some gaming news.
1790948	1791209	Oh, yeah.
1791469	1791889	Facebook.
1791929	1793571	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1793951	1794872	Add us on Facebook, please.
1795213	1795713	And Twitter.
1795773	1798316	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1798876	1800338	Now we can get into some gaming news.
1800678	1801879	We'll start it off with Loki.
1802080	1803961	I don't take vacations at all.
1805703	1811146	So, Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Tokyo Game Show press event.
1811166	1817690	Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for, you know, ones that you may have purchased a system for?
1818231	1819251	Yeah, they're not coming this year.
1819872	1826416	Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions.
1826956	1829658	And, of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and...
1830518	1832059	Yeah, looks amazing.
1832379	1835501	They had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year.
1836902	1837222	Too bad.
1838763	1844227	Of course, there's going to be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November.
1844827	1847609	And this is going to add 3D video capture as well.
1849811	1854914	And definitely kind of a cool thing, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool.
1855356	1855937	Thanks for watching!
1871580	1881747	You know that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with, there's going to be better cameras in it, I'm sure, that will help with the 3D.
1881787	1886950	Because let's be real, not a lot of people have 3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that.
1887430	1890893	You know, the whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that.
1890973	1893355	I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch.
1893995	1896157	I'm not surprised at all that it's being patched in.
1896237	1897178	You're surprised?
1898078	1902522	The device didn't have all the features that they talked about.
1902762	1904463	Oh, yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff?
1904543	1906285	Eh, that's not coming for a few months.
1906365	1906685	Touche.
1906745	1908886	Oh, hey, you want to browse the internet?
1909087	1911168	Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there.
1911188	1912529	It wasn't quite done yet.
1914911	1915291	Rush?
1915451	1916751	No, we didn't rush the system.
1916792	1917632	What are you talking about?
1917672	1919173	This was always planned like that.
1920753	1923675	Yeah.
1923715	1924455	So, November.
1924955	1926356	Because, you know, they don't like to rush things.
1926476	1927436	They're taking their time.
1930316	1956583	And of course, one of the things that came out was this god awful ugly circle pad attachment for Monster Hunter Tri-G And of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually support it Including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat 3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance
1957403	1972692	and of course this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back and it will also add a couple extra shoulder buttons and of course the circle pad.
1973433	1978716	Funny thing about the circle pad is it's not needed for Monster Hunter.
1978956	1982118	In fact all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it.
1983783	2012205	interesting this this thing is so interesting because well a the whole fact that it requires a separate battery to run like you could just hear the face palming going on across Twitter and the blogs and so forth when that was announced so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself and the whole yeah yeah sure they plan to do this the whole time I'm really sure because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this and power it but oops um of course then again you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3ds because it's not like it holds a lot to begin with right um
2013306	2020468	but it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of Motion Plus only it's happening a lot faster.
2021349	2021529	Yeah.
2021829	2025030	And I really wonder how long it's going to be before this thing is mandatory.
2025130	2031512	And you know on the remake next year there's going to be better cameras and the second analog pad.
2033192	2033693	Look at that.
2033713	2035453	Second analog pad can go right there.
2035593	2038494	Nice little home for it right on the device.
2038594	2041075	No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller.
2042645	2049948	Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are... Oh, actually, the buttons are above, or below the thing.
2049988	2050348	Well, fine.
2050628	2053529	They'll move the buttons down, and then they'll put the circle pad there.
2058291	2061752	Hey, but they got you to buy a system because they dropped the price, right?
2061892	2063133	Ha ha, suckers!
2064813	2065794	And you'll buy it again.
2066814	2069555	That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again.
2070416	2070936	Remember Game Boy?
2072591	2100415	coinora chatroom at chat.orangelandreda.com Randy says that 3DS attachment makes the thing look like a Game Gear a little bit I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure and then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it out in pink so they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October yeah cool
2102932	2104093	Not necessarily in the U.S.
2104574	2105894	Not in the U.S., in Japan only.
2106415	2107716	Are people really that shallow?
2107776	2112239	I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system.
2112339	2113159	Oh, it's in pink!
2113559	2114020	Oh, okay.
2114540	2115821	Yes, people are that shallow.
2115961	2117042	Just accept it and move on.
2119423	2120504	I shake my head at you guys.
2121905	2123566	See, this is how they deal with all that shit.
2124067	2125788	Put out a pink box for a game, huh?
2125868	2130571	Whenever blue systems come out, Miklatov's right there ready to buy one, so I don't know what to tell you.
2131091	2131572	It's on, Dan.
2131592	2132152	What do you want to say?
2134334	2135255	Except it's muted.
2135295	2135795	Sorry about that.
2135835	2136096	Go ahead.
2136396	2138978	Pink Systems, giant sellers at Christmas time.
2139558	2140138	Are they really?
2140579	2141039	Oh yeah.
2141139	2144221	You can't get the pink DS light.
2145042	2147303	You couldn't beg, borrow, or steal one of those at Christmas time.
2147924	2149925	And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them.
2150105	2150626	Isn't it really?
2150646	2155149	Well, remember when I got my GBA?
2155529	2156290	Oh dear God, no.
2156730	2157550	My pink GBA.
2158031	2158451	What about it?
2158511	2159772	And no one else could find them.
2161357	2161597	No.
2162778	2166480	But, you know, it's not really just... GBA, that was a long time ago.
2166600	2167861	Isn't this pink and hard to find?
2167981	2170003	It's not really just about the colors, though, right?
2170023	2181110	Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conference that was going on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl-tailored games, which were... They looked really creepster to me.
2181190	2181910	Like, I didn't get it.
2181950	2184172	But, of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever.
2184272	2186693	Like, some comedian-based game, I think, was one of them.
2186713	2187274	They have...
2187694	2190135	A lot of girl-based games already.
2190275	2195076	I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games.
2195416	2197777	I mean, there is a ton of DS games.
2197857	2201878	I want to preface by saying, like, tween girl games.
2201979	2211602	Like, I don't want to infer, because DarkSakura might kick my butt, that girls, like, play different games and, like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that.
2211662	2215103	But, like, you know, the ones that are aimed at, like, the little girls.
2216423	2219085	I'm gonna punch you with this microphone.
2222486	2225788	Although, let's be real, she did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week.
2226749	2227169	Just kidding.
2228150	2230131	She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game.
2231291	2232212	I actually didn't touch it.
2232232	2233493	What a piece of crap.
2233753	2234713	Bullshit.
2234733	2237275	A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game.
2237615	2238836	You lie like a rug.
2240116	2241077	I didn't play it at all yesterday.
2243001	2244322	That's why so many of my sims hated me.
2244522	2249988	But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while.
2250008	2253451	Didn't they have Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials?
2254111	2254972	Oh, girls and women.
2255032	2257415	If Beyonce does it, then I've got to do that.
2257755	2261118	Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii, too.
2261739	2263140	Nintendo was just all about...
2264961	2278764	40% of the consumers out there, or 50% or 60% or whatever, are women, and we're not marketing to them, and you gotta sell to women, sell, sell, sell, recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell I'm like, you fucking people, have you seen the customers that come into my store?
2279545	2290027	99% male If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves No, that's not, that's not true Well, it's often true
2291698	2292259	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2303919	2306800	But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS.
2306900	2307920	In 3D.
2308240	2308841	3D boobies.
2309641	2312982	This will probably be the first time they ever see 3D boobies.
2313942	2314282	Alright.
2314702	2315563	No, no, no, I kid.
2316463	2319424	So, I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference.
2319484	2323285	Obviously there was a lot of focus on the Monster Hunter games that's coming out.
2323345	2329467	Games, because there's Tri-G and then there's 4 that they announced is going to be a Nintendo 3DS thing as well.
2329887	2358111	and then I gotta say I was totally thinking of DarkSakura because after the press conference there was like 15 minutes of Monster Hunter commercials that featured Gatchaman like for 15 minutes like all these little Gatchaman ads for Monster Hunter games that made me laugh okay I need this if there's Gatchaman involved I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral but what was very interesting that add-on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that they did for not Tokyo Game Show
2358633	2359754	I don't care about any of that.
2359774	2360796	You lost me at Gatchaman.
2361296	2362998	I'm totally being honest.
2363018	2364500	I should have called you when it was on.
2364600	2365981	I'm going to find them on YouTube.
2366202	2366682	You got to see this.
2366722	2367483	I'm going to find them on YouTube.
2367503	2368384	You might find them on YouTube.
2368404	2368704	You might.
2369085	2370807	They were all... It was funny.
2372566	2382271	Now, Kevin6L8 in our chatroom, maybe that's Kevin6L8 in our chatroom, says, In my store, about a good third of the people buying are teen to young adult girls.
2383391	2383911	Buying what?
2384532	2387313	I'm assuming like DS and related systems, or maybe Wii?
2387393	2389574	Of course, why not Xbox?
2389594	2393396	Yeah, that's the same thing I was watching, DarkSakura.
2393836	2394396	She brought it up.
2394476	2394856	What?
2396517	2398398	Just to preface, I worked at a game crazy.
2398819	2403942	And I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago, back before girls started playing games.
2404302	2406704	That's the scariest looking kaze I've ever seen.
2406804	2407925	She didn't even pay attention.
2408225	2408445	What?
2408625	2409286	Nobody cares.
2411647	2414409	It's a 70s show about a bird ninja team.
2416070	2417351	The science ninja team.
2418852	2424156	Alright, let's talk about the Vita a little bit, because there's a lot of news on the PlayStation Vita as well.
2425396	2432441	First off, at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already announced for the Vita.
2433061	2439966	Things like Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Katamari, DJ Maxx Technica...
2441787	2455621	Sound Shapes, Super Stardust Delta, Wipeout, Ridge Racer, Zone of Enders HD, Metal Gear Solid HD, Gundam Games, Super Robot Taisen Games, Tales of Innocence, etc.
2456361	2462768	It's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing everything they can to not fuck this up.
2464309	2489666	and they are trying to just punch Nintendo into jugular and I tell you what the delay of the Vita in the US I'm telling you is so that the lineup looks as strong here they are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done and everybody is saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3DS until Christmas and so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal of games so that when that thing launches here it's going to come out with a bang it's really interesting
2490126	2490746	Thanks for watching!
2511454	2511614	Right.
2512294	2515315	By the way, the Vita does come out December 17th.
2515535	2516896	The date has been announced in Japan.
2517536	2521557	They are cutting it really close there with the end of the year.
2521637	2525258	That would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season.
2525338	2526738	I still think it would sell tons anyway.
2527479	2533400	I think Sony's doing the right thing by waiting until next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever it launches here.
2533440	2534981	They did not announce the date here.
2535621	2547732	Although, something to think about, it was reiterated this week on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with Sony Computer Entertainment President of Worldwide Studios, Suhei Yoshida, has reiterated the Vita is region free.
2548072	2551516	So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go.
2551716	2552857	I'm getting the shakes already.
2556520	2561008	Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart.
2561069	2567821	They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in that we'll at least know a date.
2569999	2570979	I do agree.
2571259	2577200	But they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going to be the biggest battleground, I think, of sorts.
2577280	2577661	I don't know.
2578501	2581181	I'm not too worried about the 3DS in the U.S.
2581221	2588282	because I think the games that they have coming out, they have, was it Super Mario 3D Land in November?
2588342	2589023	That's really it.
2589543	2594184	And other than that, Mario Kart's coming out in December, but later on.
2595524	2595844	I don't know.
2595864	2596124	I mean...
2597164	2600206	Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller?
2600867	2602588	They're doing a Smash Brothers for that thing.
2603068	2605549	Yeah, they're doing a Smash Brothers for that thing.
2605749	2607951	At some point in time.
2608011	2612113	Do you know how many fucking people bought the Wii because they put Smash Brothers on it?
2612133	2613734	Yeah, I understand that, and that's fine.
2614295	2617777	All Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title.
2617937	2619638	That's what they've done with every system.
2620058	2623140	Every system people are just like, well, I don't know.
2623340	2624821	And then Nintendo comes out with that one.
2625341	2625822	One title.
2625862	2629365	Which on the original DS was like Nintendogs or something.
2629425	2631907	And everybody goes, I gotta have one of these fucking things.
2632247	2633428	Or fucking Brain Age.
2633749	2634389	Yeah, exactly.
2634429	2639493	What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their sack?
2640214	2643898	They're not gonna, I'm sorry, it's not gonna First off, Smash Bros.
2644098	2649524	at E3, which they shouldn't have even really announced at E3 They were like, yeah, hey, I'm thinking about working on a Smash Bros.
2649544	2650445	game Is it in development?
2650605	2652467	No Is it coming out anytime soon?
2652708	2661037	No But we're thinking about it, yeah Just like, we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the Wii?
2661097	2662178	Oh, that's never coming out
2662618	2663639	So Smash Bros.
2663679	2672944	for the 3DS, yeah, they promised that game's coming out now, but two years from now when it's like, hey, where's the Smash Bros.
2672984	2673664	game you promised us?
2673965	2678227	Yeah, we're going to put it on the next 3DS system that we're going to put out, so sorry.
2678407	2678627	The 4DS.
2680648	2684049	I still think the internet as a whole... Were you trying to say something, Jamie?
2684509	2684850	Not anymore.
2685810	2691352	I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo.
2691392	2692712	He said hard on.
2693112	2700275	But no, for real, because... Believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo as well, but I think the 3DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas.
2700395	2706317	I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario Kart and the Mario Land 3D games.
2706437	2707397	I think that's going to sell...
2707957	2711180	A lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being a Vita.
2711400	2716143	Don't get me wrong, the Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year.
2716403	2718585	That doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U.S.
2719405	2723448	I just think those, like Mario Kart especially, is huge.
2724289	2725490	I really think so.
2726350	2728552	I just think they need to bring out motion sickness pills with it.
2729753	2732555	I've gone through 10 holiday seasons in-game retail.
2733664	2734445	Second Analog Controller
2752324	2758167	Well, that's a whole other issue, but I'm just talking format stuff-wise, is the 3D movies.
2758687	2762489	They were showing off a lot of this at E3, the year that the 3DS was shown.
2762529	2766410	We have Netflix on the 3DS, but yet we don't have 3D movies yet.
2766691	2768471	Soon we're going to be able to record 3D movies.
2768611	2771493	Now, have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there?
2771533	2773313	Yeah, but little five-minute videos?
2773394	2773934	I'm talking...
2774734	2779075	When we were 83, they were talking about putting Tangled in 3D on a little cartridge.
2779495	2783897	The Lion King in 3D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend from 94.
2784537	2786177	They put that thing on a 3DS cart.
2786217	2787438	It's going to sell like crazy.
2788278	2790638	Because it's so much cheaper right now.
2790658	2792319	And they need to strike while the iron's hot.
2792419	2798901	It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the 3DS as a 3D device than go get a freaking 3D television and glasses.
2798921	2800561	But that's not going to be the case much longer.
2800941	2803182	Come a year from now, next holiday, I think 3D
2804162	2807925	Man, I can't wait.
2809026	2813489	I want a 3D TV because, kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology.
2814189	2817071	But at the same time, as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper.
2817291	2820193	So I'm just like, oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that.
2821766	2836115	Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better, you're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's just like, oh, hey, look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and it's cheaper.
2836155	2838197	It's like, oh, come on.
2838217	2844861	I even waited and waited and waited about my 120 hertz TV because 120 hertz was supposed to be the 3D rate.
2845181	2847563	It's like, on this TV now, we can do 3D.
2847703	2849364	When the 3D comes out, this TV will work.
2849404	2849684	I'm like,
2849884	2850244	Great!
2850544	2851164	Nah, fuck you.
2851204	2851604	It's gotta be 240.
2851825	2853705	Fuck you guys!
2854425	2855545	Fuck you right in the ear!
2855686	2856446	But that's okay.
2856846	2860987	Going to our chat at chat.orange.com, HitStun says, Netflix is in 3D, right?
2861267	2861967	Actually, it's not.
2862007	2862827	Not on the 3DS.
2863067	2868489	I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus, the content itself, not in 3D.
2868869	2869089	Yet.
2869289	2869609	Who knows?
2869689	2870389	Who knows what might happen.
2871190	2875491	And then Kevin68 in our chat at chat.orange.com says, I'm not really into 3D.
2875571	2876791	I mean, it's more of a novelty to me.
2877091	2885733	See, I'm kind of there too, and I feel a little weird talking about hyping up 3D and everything, but I think for games, 3D might actually kind of be neat.
2885834	2888534	Like, I got to admit, some of the 3DS stuff's kind of cool.
2889094	2895596	Like, it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it's neat, at least for a little while.
2895916	2900958	I think the Mario Kart game's going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will be a point where I'm like, okay, let's turn the 3D off now.
2902296	2906381	See, with Mario Kart, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong.
2907001	2912688	And Mario Kart, what they've done... Yeah, because every game only sells like 11-gajillion copies.
2913168	2916852	I understand that, because people are suckers and they're like, oh, it's a Mario game, I want to buy it.
2917633	2919015	No, that's not why it happens.
2919075	2921097	It's because the Mario Kart games are good.
2921898	2922158	Really?
2922218	2923199	They're not creative.
2924312	2930438	They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them.
2931119	2932920	And they just last.
2933061	2937505	The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to.
2937665	2940608	You know how they put out stuff and don't really do anything?
2940668	2944692	Like Animal Crossing, they change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system.
2945973	2946834	Wait, wait, wait.
2947034	2948776	In the new Animal Crossing you'll get to sit on a bench.
2949376	2949756	and Swim.
2950537	2951438	But that's fine.
2951698	2952318	Okay, two things.
2952879	2955140	And it's in a different camera perspective.
2955801	2956341	Whoop-dee-shit.
2957161	2960304	But one series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart.
2960324	2962565	I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was.
2962585	2963526	But Hang Gliders!
2964486	2965307	Yeah, Hang Gliders.
2965347	2966408	That's awesome.
2966848	2971611	Or, you know, they've ruined Battle Mode after the 64 versions.
2971731	2973472	Battle Mode was ruined after the first one.
2974133	2975254	No, it was good.
2975274	2976695	The 64 version was still fun.
2976715	2977175	It was so good on
2978447	2979751	Mode 7 Battle Screen.
2979791	2981015	It was so cool.
2982218	2984986	Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time on.
2987024	2989625	It was, Block Fort was awesome in Mario Kart 64.
2989905	2990846	I mean, that's where it was at.
2991206	2995147	But, you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard, I guess.
2995167	2999089	Because with Double Dash, it was like, oh, look, you can have a partner, you can switch back and forth.
2999129	3000029	No, that was terrible.
3000530	3002230	Double Dash was awesome.
3002290	3009033	And then now they have, like, oh, look, hey, we're going to have motorcycles and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things.
3009293	3009973	Who gives a shit?
3009993	3011134	It's a kart racing game.
3012385	3016107	One year that we set up like an eight-player system-linked Mario Kart game.
3016707	3017927	That was so great.
3018528	3023570	Somebody controlling the rear guy and just punching people in front of him was like amazing.
3023690	3026271	Let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here.
3026371	3030512	But Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting women.
3032393	3034814	What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas?
3035874	3037575	It's going to be good because it's a Nintendo system.
3037876	3040117	I mean, people buy Nintendo systems.
3040157	3040938	That's really it.
3041398	3043420	And people are going to buy the shit that comes out.
3043460	3046442	Like, imagine babies and fart monsters or something.
3046462	3049564	Do they have a game called Fart Monster 3D?
3052319	3055820	No, they have... Let's see what would be the closest thing to that.
3056941	3058241	They have pet zombies.
3058301	3059902	You can raise your own pet zombie.
3059922	3060542	That's kind of funny.
3060562	3061283	You're shitting me.
3061343	3061523	No.
3062083	3063904	That's awesomely bad.
3064624	3064884	All right.
3064924	3067345	I would play that because it's awesomely bad.
3067425	3070806	Now, we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita because... Go ahead.
3070926	3074888	I was going to say if they want to sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already.
3075788	3076068	Soon.
3076488	3076728	Soon.
3077589	3077889	Next year.
3078754	3083417	By the way, some of the chat is pointing out that Dan's audio is in and out.
3083677	3086079	He does have the busted mic right now.
3086759	3090542	I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan would come in here and yell random shit.
3090822	3094024	He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone.
3095365	3098267	But unfortunately, the only microphone we have is the half-busted one.
3098307	3100288	So I apologize for the shoddy audio quality.
3100828	3101289	We hear that.
3101329	3101729	Thank you, Dan.
3102770	3103370	Actually, now we can't.
3105080	3105481	There you go.
3105521	3106604	Just hold the cord in a little bit.
3106644	3107346	Yeah, you just have to do it.
3107386	3110493	You have to kind of just kind of push it together like it's falling apart.
3111275	3111556	All right.
3112498	3113501	More Vita news.
3113561	3114563	My husband's a prevert.
3116691	3139359	I mentioned this in the overview of what all games are coming out, but I just kind of want to revisit It was announced that Zone of the Enders HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid is coming to the Vita As well as Ninja Gaiden, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Katamari, and this was the huge bombshell that was dropped
3140936	3147138	Final Fantasy X Remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out.
3147178	3148998	We're going to do a remake of Final Fantasy.
3149378	3152539	Final Fantasy X. Yeah.
3152919	3154119	They don't go with one everyone wants.
3154159	3157560	They just go with one that all they have to do is update a few textures on and boom.
3158020	3159240	Well, I think you hit the nail on the head.
3159260	3163521	There's far less work to be done with Final Fantasy X and they can get it done a lot faster.
3163541	3164922	It's not even updating the textures.
3164982	3165702	It's just uprising.
3166018	3166719	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3192493	3195755	Yeah, it's just going to be up-res textures and polygons.
3196175	3199297	It's going to be Konami quality.
3201498	3208242	There was a lot of Twitter rage on 7 fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced, I noticed.
3208622	3209682	The answer seems obvious to me.
3209702	3212064	10 is just an easier thing to remake.
3212584	3214485	Both games are equally popular in Japan.
3214625	3240717	well yeah, um, up-rezzing it to HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game, you know, one is a lot easier to do than the other, so that's why you don't have a set, because if you up-rezz 7 it's gonna look like shit and I don't know why there's so many 10 haters I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu is like one of the most badass characters like in a video game I really like 10-2 I really like 10-2 10-2's okay 10-2's fun and festive
3244605	3246628	Some days you want to have crazy hat day.
3247309	3248210	It's the girl fest.
3248491	3248972	I love it.
3251069	3279728	especially because there was like this whole area like when you're on that long road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up super quickly like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you they might have 10 too give us 7 you whores here's my other question is and I don't know if you know this Loki but some people are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita that it's for the Playstation 3 as well yes it is wow
3280969	3282231	That's neat.
3282331	3283352	Kevin68 makes a good point.
3283552	3283852	What's that?
3284032	3284953	Arun was badass.
3285734	3286575	Yes, he was.
3286615	3289098	He was so badass they put him in Kingdom Hearts as well.
3289698	3290179	You know what?
3291260	3294783	He was like the only, because you know I leveled through the game so quickly.
3294883	3302311	Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly that by the time I got to that last, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair?
3303592	3310996	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they are making?
3311016	3313798	It's a 3DS, not a Vita game, but it's that Thetra Rhythm or whatever it was called?
3331770	3332791	It looked dumb.
3333632	3334253	Well, here's the thing.
3334593	3338037	If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you.
3341080	3346786	Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag rant because what are the Vita games going to be priced at?
3346806	3347467	Are they all going to be $40 too?
3347487	3347467	$50. $50.
3349711	3350852	Shut the fuck up.
3350972	3351532	For real?
3351632	3353053	Vita games are going to be $50?
3353894	3354334	Hello?
3354835	3355795	PSP games were fucking $50.
3355835	3356436	Oh my god.
3357336	3357957	Where have you been?
3358537	3359938	I don't know.
3359978	3361319	Apparently my head's been in the sand.
3361379	3362900	I didn't buy a whole lot of PSP games.
3362920	3363240	$50 and $40.
3363500	3365862	It'll be PSP priced, I think.
3367723	3368083	I don't know.
3368123	3368324	Maybe $60.
3368924	3373407	The only price I've seen so far is on Lego Harry Potter.
3374107	3376229	I think it was $50.
3376629	3377650	It was Seymour Guado.
3380413	3381155	That's right, it was Seymour.
3381175	3382418	Because you want to see more Guado.
3383742	3384504	I like fuckwad.
3384524	3385265	Seymour fuckwad.
3386151	3396158	But yeah, that's the only one that... Because the only two titles that I actually have info on were Lego Harry Potter 2 and Dragon something.
3396178	3397719	I don't remember the hell the other one was called.
3397899	3405285	Like Dragon Dust or... Suddenly buying the Magicka Uber Edition for $10 on Steam doesn't seem like such a bad idea.
3405365	3410128	Because, like, game pricing is so fucked up right now.
3410208	3410828	Like, I just...
3411969	3433067	it's we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history games have always kind of been around that same price but now we've got 99 cent Angry Birds versus $50 Vita games it's all about projection value though I mean look at look at the games that they're putting out now what they have to do they have you know Hollywood voice actors and not all games have that but they have you know
3434207	3435048	Thanks for watching!
3455422	3456482	What about movies?
3457022	3460103	Because the Blair Witch Project was made for what, like a nickel?
3460203	3464084	And then you had Titanic, and it cost the same to see both of those movies.
3464124	3471106	Now, I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now anyway.
3471206	3471586	Well, yes.
3471946	3481808	So I understand that movies, when they come to theaters, are all the same price, but that's up to the studios to make that decision whether they want to have a high-budget movie or a low-budget movie.
3482248	3482648	Thanks for watching!
3497580	3508348	It's because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else you consume your entertainment.
3508868	3513331	I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is though and how much you're into it.
3514032	3521477	And that's the interesting thing about Steam too is that it's kind of like one of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody that we think is going to buy it for 50 bucks, let's try to knock it down to 40.
3521657	3523579	We can name that tune.
3523819	3525500	I'll buy that game for 50 bucks.
3525820	3533866	But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible that's being sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's an up-res PlayStation 2 game.
3534406	3541591	Or, in the case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell it for $60 on the Wii.
3542572	3544333	I mean, dude, it's...
3545834	3549497	It's less production quality for that version of the game than it was the other ones.
3549737	3550918	Depends what you're talking about.
3550958	3555161	I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're talking about movies, then that's a different story.
3570603	3573384	Alright, let's move on with some more news stories.
3573525	3581669	We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day, seriously, if Civilization 6 was announced and they were going to charge $100 for it, I'd probably still pay it.
3584375	3585055	DarkSakura
3609568	3610108	You know what?
3610508	3612049	I didn't actually import that.
3612069	3615189	I bought it at an import store and I didn't pay that much for it.
3615269	3615829	Excusez-moi.
3615909	3617910	Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings?
3617970	3620470	Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out.
3620490	3623191	It comes in a quiver, a leather quiver.
3623211	3624251	I remember you mentioning that.
3624651	3627112	For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan.
3627872	3628472	The movies were okay.
3628512	3629792	Are you a fan of leather quivers?
3630092	3630312	No.
3630973	3637514	The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great, the stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off.
3638744	3639745	Are you a fan of guns?
3639765	3639845	Yes.
3639965	3642586	Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter.
3643086	3643666	You want a gun?
3643806	3644546	I want a gun.
3645347	3646047	I just made that up.
3646207	3647087	You totally made that up.
3647288	3648348	We actually went looking at guns.
3649048	3650829	I just want DarkSakura to get excited about a gun.
3650849	3651949	I want a gun.
3652430	3654290	I don't want DarkSakura to own a gun.
3655251	3655651	Why?
3655691	3656691	Because you'll shoot me.
3657252	3658172	I won't.
3659612	3660253	No, I won't.
3660293	3663454	Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun.
3664294	3665555	Yeah, but we're talking about you, though.
3667844	3668064	No!
3668524	3669965	It would be safely in a locker.
3670745	3672226	And I would go outside to shoot it.
3673367	3674007	You're red in the face.
3674027	3675808	We're waiting until you get outside of the house.
3676588	3679590	That way we can say you were a prowler.
3680570	3683912	The next time Shermie shits on the floor, she's gonna get it.
3684452	3684673	No.
3684713	3685854	Yeah, she can absorb a bullet.
3686014	3687656	She's right there.
3688657	3689658	Be nice to the cat.
3689698	3690619	I wouldn't shoot the cat.
3690659	3692460	I like her better than anyone else in this room.
3693161	3698066	As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass.
3699368	3700829	She's cultivating sleep right now.
3701009	3703592	DarkSakura, let's move on with some gaming news.
3704088	3711093	Sony or bitches, wait, they actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits.
3711393	3715416	It's actually a section called Binding Individual Arbitration.
3716296	3733608	So, to quote, it says, any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action as a named or unnamed member in a class consolidation, representative, or private attorney general action.
3734929	3738491	So basically, if you want to use our shit, you can't sue us in a class action.
3740232	3741013	But you can opt out.
3741801	3742882	Yes, you can opt out of it.
3742922	3746384	You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that.
3746864	3749106	I want to make specially made postcards to Sony.
3749166	3750407	That's a big middle finger.
3752128	3753248	Opt out of this, bitch.
3754229	3755050	Well, here's what it says.
3755430	3766637	If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy, or if you do not wish to enter into an agreement with Sony, you may decline the TOS and privacy policy, and we will close your account and return your funds.
3768357	3771359	Oh, so in other words, if you want to opt out, then fuck off.
3771400	3772741	You can't use our service at all.
3772861	3776423	So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday.
3776844	3781827	You know, the only reason I'm like, whatever, Sony, is because the PlayStation Network is free.
3782288	3783849	So it's kind of one of those, you know, whatever.
3783969	3786551	But at the same time, there is PlayStation Plus.
3786751	3787211	Well, it also...
3788272	3788492	Go ahead.
3788592	3789473	It says more, actually.
3789493	3789813	Okay.
3789833	3805243	It says, if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and the Sony entity, you have a dispute with each agreed to waive in that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury.
3805443	3811747	So in other words, this may not actually be legal and if it ends up being illegal, then forget I ever said anything.
3811767	3816170	But AT&T, there's a court case with AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal, so.
3816350	3816851	Wow.
3817091	3817251	Yeah.
3817751	3818452	Not much you can do there.
3819713	3820053	I don't know.
3820814	3821995	It does seem a little bit wrong to me.
3822035	3822496	Here's the thing.
3822716	3824418	When am I actually going to sue Sony?
3825118	3828301	What are they going to do to me that's really going to have me sue them?
3828482	3828782	Nothing.
3829402	3831945	You can sue them individually.
3832145	3834988	I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft.
3835028	3837070	I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony.
3838084	3841766	Well, it's basically saying... Sorry, go ahead.
3842467	3842747	Go ahead.
3843307	3847230	I was going to say, but you'd be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action.
3848010	3848130	True.
3848150	3849511	But Microsoft has nothing to do with Sony.
3850172	3850392	True.
3852153	3852753	That's the whole point.
3852813	3858317	It's like, you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money to sue them on your own and get, you know, maybe...
3860599	3862281	$15,000, I'm just using an arbitrary figure, $15,000.
3862321	3871410	Where as opposed to a class action lawsuit with maybe a million users and each of them get $5, that's 5 million bucks.
3872371	3873452	You know, think about that.
3874993	3877115	It's a way to basically save their assets.
3878276	3879558	Not asses, assets.
3880074	3886797	And also because they're a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff, they can just drag it out forever until you run out of money to fight it.
3887217	3888718	Right, it's kind of an intimidation thing.
3888758	3892980	It's kind of one of those, we're bigger than you are, so you can sue us and we'll just get scarier and scarier.
3893000	3894320	But guess who doesn't use PlayStation Network?
3896521	3906986	But, well, you may not use PlayStation Network, but as Loki said, AT&T set a precedent for this, so maybe Sony's setting a precedent for this in the gaming world, and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online service...
3911229	3912470	It'll have something like this as well.
3912650	3917534	And Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy when it does its whole little remodel.
3917694	3923919	So I think this really needs to be... Because basically it's like they're trying to manipulate the court system.
3924319	3932286	They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge...
3934557	3934997	I like this.
3935137	3940439	Salacious Pop is just rambling about this in our chat room, so I want to read some of these comments here at chat.orangelunchated.com.
3940899	3942200	That is embarrassingly dumb.
3942280	3951504	The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit going on on a wide scale.
3951824	3953324	That is the point of a class action.
3953444	3954065	Oh my God.
3954505	3959987	If you try to form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt-mad neckbeard, you'll be laughed out of court.
3960467	3966673	Class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings.
3967154	3972720	In an individual case, if you're in the right, yeah, you'll get paid well, but it won't be punitive damages kind of money.
3973060	3974982	So Sony is trying to protect their wallet.
3976283	3977124	That's exactly it.
3977244	3978425	I like butt-mad neck beard.
3980548	3982710	Makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at BlizzCon.
3984718	3985839	Well, that's exactly it.
3985899	3989240	I mean, that was pretty much the point I was trying to make.
3989280	3995182	They're trying to save money and not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're doing.
3996462	4000524	At the end of the day, I don't really like it, but I hit accept anyway because I wanted to play my games online.
4001861	4003924	Well, that's the problem.
4004105	4004766	What can you do?
4004906	4006108	That right there is the problem.
4006188	4008631	I mean, no offense or anything.
4008651	4009813	I'm not pointing at you.
4010254	4013659	But that's why they can get away with it.
4014100	4016283	Because people will say, oh, I just want to play my games.
4016403	4017064	I don't give a shit.
4018145	4020186	But that's how they're going to get away with it.
4020266	4021946	Because there's going to be too many people doing that.
4021966	4022626	What can you do?
4022966	4023567	What can you do?
4023667	4025307	How can you hold this company accountable?
4026207	4037190	I still believe, even though whatever AT&T set a precedent, if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again, I'm sorry, this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up.
4037651	4040571	Congress is investigating Sony for their fuck up.
4041372	4041932	You know what I mean?
4041992	4046133	Like they don't have a deficit or anything to worry about.
4046633	4047354	So, I don't know.
4047454	4056762	It's just... But the whole point is that by sitting around and doing nothing, they're going to get away with this as long as they can, and a lot of people are going to get screwed.
4056782	4058884	There is internet rage, DarkSakura.
4058924	4061546	That is how we're responding with internet rage.
4061646	4062827	I am very upset at Shoni.
4063757	4065579	Well, there actually is a number of things you can do.
4065639	4084895	You can write your, you know, your representatives to, you know, double check the legality of this because clearly they're not going to, you know, they'd have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of, you know, legal proceeding.
4085115	4087076	Or you can send Loki's card with the giant middle finger.
4088478	4089358	I'm trying to be serious.
4089599	4090099	I know, I know.
4091037	4094419	The whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed to pass.
4097140	4108124	Marisa Congusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part of in many areas that you don't even know of.
4108905	4109485	That's very true.
4109545	4115627	Very common like cell phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration clause in it.
4117368	4145955	this country I'd be interested though how does Sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that might hold a legal thing in the US but did they have to do the same thing in Canada or they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something hmm kind of interesting all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about this all night but
4147638	4150881	Final Fantasy X, the remake, is not the only Final Fantasy that's coming out.
4151622	4157006	There's also, well, Final Fantasy XIV, I guess, is never coming out, but never coming out working, that is.
4158628	4161930	But Final Fantasy XIII, too, though, is on its way out.
4162151	4166194	It is 90% complete as of Tokyo Game Show, and...
4167535	4170758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4187205	4187965	That'll be available.
4188686	4194109	And I guess the game itself will feature time travel, so that's kind of neat.
4194989	4206195	The game is launching next year on the North American region, January 31st, and also Europe is getting it February 2nd.
4206635	4209837	Japan is, though, seeing it this year on December 15th.
4210718	4214059	Plus, they're also launching in Japan with an exclusive...
4216061	4222707	PlayStation 3 system that's pink and black and it's got a laser etched lightning on it.
4223007	4233055	The Lightning Edition version 2 which will include a 320 gigabyte hard drive, the game, and a controller for the price of 37,960 yen or $495 dollars.
4238117	4238818	That's pretty awesome.
4238998	4239399	I don't know.
4239660	4244167	It does seem a little weird that they're releasing a whole new PlayStation, though.
4244367	4244768	I don't know.
4244788	4246190	It's just a limited edition.
4246390	4247252	I mean, whatever.
4247292	4248133	They did Call of Duty.
4248193	4251519	Wouldn't the Final Fantasy fans have already bought one for Final Fantasy 13, the original?
4251819	4252761	Which is me.
4254102	4255182	Yeah, maybe.
4255383	4255723	I don't know.
4256683	4262445	And of course, as we said earlier, Final Fantasy X, the remake for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3.
4262485	4264486	That'll be coming out later on.
4264746	4265786	My bad on that, Loki.
4265806	4266066	Sorry.
4266447	4266827	It's all right.
4266927	4267387	No big deal.
4268127	4269628	We had to mention it again because it's awesome.
4270913	4272674	It's something I'm going to probably pick up, no doubt.
4272694	4273735	You know what I would love to see?
4274055	4274495	What?
4274755	4284020	Obviously this won't happen until they kill off the PlayStation 2 version of it, but an HD remake version of Final Fantasy XI that's free to play would be awesome.
4284480	4285321	I could happen.
4285341	4288723	Didn't I talk about this a couple weeks ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the PlayStation 2?
4288763	4290283	Yeah, you did mention that.
4291044	4293485	Actually, hasn't there been a rumor about XI on the Vita already?
4293665	4294185	I think there has.
4294225	4294465	Yeah.
4295666	4297267	Can you imagine if that game goes free to play?
4297447	4298228	I don't know what I'm going to do.
4301329	4303230	The wife won't have a reason to stop you now.
4303330	4304211	Well, you know what?
4304371	4305272	See, here's the thing, though.
4305292	4309074	The only reason I stopped my subscription is because I don't get a lot of time to play.
4309454	4312616	So it may be an hour or two every few days.
4313256	4314717	But if it's free to play, who gives a shit?
4316238	4318639	So I don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever.
4318899	4319860	I'm not paying for it!
4321465	4329307	Let me go to this next story, which is, yeah, this is interesting, because this is about reviews.
4330087	4331927	And so we're going to talk about game reviews for a little bit.
4332088	4335728	As you know, Gears of War 3 is on its way out, and it's kind of a big deal.
4336148	4340189	Like, if you're into these types of shooter games at all, it's kind of a big deal.
4340269	4341470	And the game's getting good reviews.
4341570	4343870	It's getting a lot of great reviews, glowing reviews everywhere.
4344590	4350852	There was an article, however, with VG247.com that Cliff Baczynski, or Cliffy B., did.
4351372	4355013	Talking about Gears of War, let me read the little passage of the interview here.
4355753	4358294	Were you pleased with the review scores this morning?
4358634	4359554	Asked the website.
4360095	4363316	Cliff B. said, doing great, apart from a couple of haters.
4364036	4365356	Magazine asked, who were the haters?
4365796	4368557	And he said, a certain gamer of the Euro.
4369097	4371038	So kind of calling out Eurogamer.
4371818	4373199	And what was their problem with the game?
4373239	4376241	I haven't read the review, asked the magazine, to which Cliffy B followed up.
4376661	4378222	You know, I don't quite gather it.
4378662	4380343	I don't want to come across as defensive.
4380603	4381964	How do I phrase this properly?
4382264	4389209	When people rated Gear 2 higher than Gears 3, it kind of upset me because I know Gears 3 is a better game on every level.
4389829	4391050	Now, here's the punchline.
4391926	4394729	It sounds like Eurogamer really trashed the shit out of this game, didn't it?
4394769	4396050	Which they have done to some games.
4396371	4397792	And that they put this game in the toilet.
4398173	4401036	This game got an 8 out of 10 by Eurogamer.
4402237	4403939	And they are haters.
4404399	4405761	Because the game got an 8 out of 10.
4407022	4407683	That's stupid.
4408684	4409465	Care to elaborate?
4409505	4410245	Why is it stupid?
4411347	4412428	I want someone to start this off.
4412888	4416930	Because, I mean, 8 out of 10 is good.
4417010	4418271	It's well above average.
4419072	4425015	You know, maybe it's like, oh, I wanted a 9 out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 because it was exceptional, it was perfect, we can do no wrong, maybe.
4425635	4432159	It sounds to me like the issue is Gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website, and they dared to rate this game an 8.
4432619	4433200	Probably.
4435681	4436001	I mean...
4439989	4442731	Review scores you kind of have to take with a grain of salt anyway.
4442751	4444352	I mean, it's not like they rated a game a 4.
4445293	4450116	And there were some reviews out there on the internet that rated Final Fantasy XIII a 4 out of 10.
4450756	4451517	I'm sorry.
4451537	4452638	Look at Duke Nukem Forever.
4452878	4453618	Perfect example.
4453719	4456881	Like, there's a ton of shitty reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it.
4457819	4459700	You have to look at your reviewer.
4460640	4469302	That's why I always thought that one of the most fair reviewing systems was how GamePro used to do it.
4470162	4472463	With their little faces, emote icons?
4472483	4473263	No, no, no.
4473343	4477064	How they would pick one game and have five people score it.
4478240	4479141	Oh, that was an EGM thing.
4479161	4480322	Yeah, that was EGM, sorry.
4480422	4481703	Which is basically Famitsu.
4481863	4483645	Well, GamePro used to do two people.
4484045	4484366	Oh, did they?
4484686	4485146	Back and forth.
4485547	4495176	But I liked how you would have the main reviewer who would go over the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought of it and the average score is this.
4496237	4497017	That's fair.
4498178	4498679	I'm sorry.
4499800	4502262	First off, why does anyone give a shit what Cliffy B wants?
4502342	4503944	Because Cliffy B's a fucking douchebag.
4504680	4505581	That's what it comes down to.
4505661	4506922	He is a fucking douchebag.
4506942	4511344	He thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a few good games under his belt.
4511424	4511905	Yeah, great.
4511985	4514166	Okay, yeah, Epic Games makes some pretty cool shit.
4514586	4516388	And you act like a fucking douchebag.
4516468	4520670	So, wah, your game got an 8 on one website.
4521051	4523292	Go fucking cry in a corner then, you little bitch.
4523772	4527815	It's interesting, though, because if the game is that good, then the review shouldn't matter, right?
4528123	4529403	Well, here's the thing.
4529623	4537925	If you're so hard up on it getting an 8.0 and stuff, fine, why don't you blacklist Eurogamer then if you're going to take the high ground with that?
4538125	4539265	Well, my game was better.
4539365	4540845	I thought so because I made it.
4541285	4542866	Yeah, you know what?
4542886	4548167	I bet the people that worked hard on Duke Nukem have ever thought it was a great game too.
4548187	4549687	You don't see them fucking crying.
4549867	4556288	The number one movie at the box office every year is rarely the most well-reviewed.
4557642	4558243	Think about that.
4561190	4562532	Because a lot of people have no taste.
4563194	4564597	He is a fucking douchebag.
4566060	4566661	Plain and simple.
4567893	4596652	I don't really know the guy and I don't watch a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so I don't know I saw him once at E3 doing a demo I think at the first Gears of War game like a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever I don't got a problem but I don't think an 8 out of 10 makes somebody a hater I understand you know I understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if I made a fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else
4597052	4624186	I wouldn't care I'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like a 1 or something like that or if like they came out and said I fucking hate the Gears of War series so I'm gonna give it a 1 out of 10 or something like that then yeah he could be pissed off but 8 out of 10 is just fine I don't understand what the big deal is well it was like when the websites were giving Final Fantasy 13 a 4 out of 10 I was like okay these are the websites I can't trust their reviews ever again because they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games I like clearly remember
4624266	4624586	DarkSakura.com
4648377	4652843	Yes, but if you're a gamer that's like, well, this thing can get a 9 out of 10, I can't buy this game.
4653003	4655306	I'm sorry, I don't think there's anyone out there that's like that.
4655647	4661214	If you're going to buy Gears of War because you like Gears of War, it's not because someone gave it an 8 or a 9 out of 10.
4661615	4663177	And I think an 8 out of 10 is just fine.
4663457	4666381	But the fact that he just went out there and said, Wee!
4666621	4667521	Yeah!
4667541	4668422	8 out of 10!
4668662	4670002	That's what makes him a douchebag.
4670102	4670622	I'm sorry.
4671403	4677684	TigerClaw in our chatroom at chat.org.com says, You should never base your views on a game based on a game review.
4678045	4681666	You play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion about it.
4682446	4687127	I'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement, and in theory, that's a really good statement.
4687628	4689888	But the only thing is that games cost $60.
4691229	4695010	And if you're on the fence about a game, you gotta go off something.
4695410	4700877	I prefer that to be hands-on experience, be it game rental or game kiosk or something.
4701297	4710849	I mean, usually I only drop $60 on a game on launch day because I've either A, played it at a trade show, or B, really liked other games in the series, so I've got to get it.
4710889	4713171	Like Civ V, I bought right when it came out because I like...
4713857	4727397	the other Civ games Skyrim I will buy day one because it's an Elder Scrolls game I've seen all the stuff online I don't think it's going to disappoint me but games I'm on the fence about maybe I want to see some reviews on before I spend the money on it you know
4728393	4728553	Out of 10
4746371	4749253	You'll like this game if you like Japanese RPGs.
4749393	4750613	Otherwise, maybe.
4751214	4758397	And then sometimes there's a game where it's like, wow, I don't care what type of games you're into, you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does.
4758437	4758857	You know what I mean?
4759378	4762079	Like, I think that is the best way to sum up a game.
4762119	4767522	I think that's more fair, but the typical person wants to just say, oh, too long, didn't read, and go to the end.
4767662	4770423	You can't translate that into a Metacritic score, right?
4770784	4770984	So...
4771889	4773330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4794850	4796853	Do you... Well, hold on.
4797414	4800177	Metacritic's calling it an 80, but I don't know Destructoid's review scale.
4800197	4802079	That could also be 4 out of 5 stars.
4802180	4804122	Okay, that's still 4 out of 5.
4804442	4806986	It's not 5 out of 5 or 4 and a half out of 5.
4807406	4807867	That's still 80%.
4808988	4809809	Well, you know what?
4809889	4817235	I have a friend who basically, like, whenever, you know, we talk about a movie or something, he's always talking about, oh, well, Rotten Tomatoes rated this and blah blah.
4817255	4819477	I'm like, yeah, but what did they say about the movie?
4819757	4820818	What did they say about the acting?
4820838	4821558	What did they say about this?
4821579	4823560	Because I don't really give a crap what the score is.
4824021	4831947	I care what the part, because Vinny and you know me, I like, you know, movies that people have blasted, if there's fun parts in them, I'll watch the movie again.
4832107	4832988	I'll go see it again.
4833408	4835090	I don't care, because I enjoyed it.
4835822	4837663	My favorite movies are like stupid movies.
4838143	4840485	I like Mystery Science Theater 3000 types of events.
4840505	4841805	That's why I like Showgirls so much.
4842166	4845267	Showgirls is a terrible fucking movie, but it is so much fun to watch.
4845568	4845948	I know.
4846548	4847128	With friends.
4847208	4849230	Well, you remember my bachelorette party.
4849670	4850470	What did we watch?
4850730	4852151	Barbarella and Xanadu.
4852171	4853032	Yeah, I remember that.
4853332	4853732	That was great.
4853752	4854733	And then we went to the goth club.
4854753	4855773	That was great.
4856013	4858395	I think that was the last time I went to the goth club was your bachelorette party.
4858415	4860076	Honestly, I think that was the last time I went too.
4861316	4861577	Anyway.
4862017	4862997	Well, to that one anyway.
4863157	4863958	I went to the other ones.
4864239	4867621	let's move on, let's move on DarkSakura, you got a quick story for us and then release dates
4868095	4876818	Well, basically, Microsoft is saying that Windows 8 will support Xbox Live, but they're not really saying anything else about games for Windows Live.
4877318	4886201	They're just basically like, their actual spokesperson said, and I quote, we currently have nothing to announce beyond the statement that Major Nelson posted on his blog.
4887242	4895725	So, what I'm thinking is that you're going to be able to manage your Xbox Live account and maybe some games will cross over.
4896921	4903084	I think I could see some type of messenger or video chat tie-in or Skype or whatever ultimate direction they go in.
4903104	4908446	I think just a way for when you are signing into your computer, you are still within the Xbox Live network.
4908766	4917270	What I'm wondering about is that does this mean that they've talked about going more an app-style direction with Windows 8, which obviously is something that-
4918510	4919210	You can, you can.
4919470	4921991	But they're calling the desktop is like a type of app.
4922792	4923192	It's weird.
4923472	4928894	But obviously they're going that more Apple route, which is not too surprising, especially because this runs on tablets.
4928914	4929774	But here's my question.
4930234	4940478	Does that mean, and I'm totally inferring here, but does that mean that apps will be run in Microsoft Points and maybe your points are used across systems?
4940758	4941778	That would be very convenient.
4941798	4943339	Well, that's how they did it with Zoom, I thought.
4943459	4946140	The Zoom marketplace wasn't all together.
4946340	4947420	It could, yeah, and it could.
4947500	4951382	But at the same time, you know, games for Windows Live or whatever ran in real dollars.
4952302	4955503	The Xbox Live does use real dollars in one portion.
4955563	4957883	It's the buying the old games.
4958324	4958904	Yeah.
4958944	4959444	Games on demand.
4959504	4960304	Games on demand, thank you.
4960464	4962805	It uses real dollars as opposed to the Microsoft points.
4963405	4964446	So it could go either way.
4964626	4964967	I don't know.
4965047	4967409	Well, and with points, you know, you're always going to have leftover.
4967449	4968590	You're going to have an odd amount.
4968870	4972153	I think they've arranged it that way to where you buy them, you're going to have some leftover.
4972633	4975656	So if you want to get anything else, you've still got to have that odd amount.
4975736	4976737	Not anymore, actually.
4977158	4977718	Not anymore.
4978118	4981522	They have changed the denominations that you can buy.
4981542	4981942	Yeah.
4982042	4987286	Yeah, but depending on what you're buying, I still find myself left with like 80 points floating out there.
4987346	4992489	If you're buying a card or something like that where it's $20, $50 increments, then yes, you may be left over.
4992769	4994450	But they actually do have it now where you can buy 800, 400.
4996672	5000454	But they want you to do that where like, oh, I have 80 points in my account.
5001075	5004117	I could get this stupid little hat for my avatar for 80 Microsoft points.
5004177	5005158	I never think of that.
5005558	5006478	I never think that at all.
5006518	5006819	You don't.
5006839	5007739	But a lot of people do.
5007759	5008420	But a lot of people do.
5008920	5021513	My only crazy purchase I ever did on PlayStation Network was dressing my character up like a hobo Santa and I am still hobo Santa in home which I have not been to forever so probably dead hobo Santa at this point.
5021721	5026585	Well, and to be fair, I did buy the Taylor Swift microphone for my avatar on Xbox Live.
5026745	5032991	Actually, the only thing that I bought is I had leftover points and I bought one of the steampunk tops just because I thought it was really cute.
5033031	5035553	So we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit online.
5037175	5038376	But Hope Santa is not free.
5038916	5043801	Speaking of buying stupid shit, let's travel around the globe and talk about what games are coming out real soon.

5177674	5178534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

5260296	5261177	Not this week, though.
5261197	5261838	That's a ways off.
5261858	5263980	I just was reminded of it reading these dates.
5264981	5271687	On the Wii this week, a Biohazard Chronicles value pack that comes with Umbrella Chronicles and Darkside Chronicles.
5272268	5273689	These are Resident Evil games, of course.
5273729	5275391	They call them Biohazard over there in Japan.
5276411	5282333	On the 3DS this week, Loki's favorite, Frogger 3D comes out on the 3DS this week.
5282873	5292555	If you don't like that, maybe you'll like Senran Kagura, Shujotachi no Shine comes out this week, which is a, I don't know, what is this?
5292595	5295936	Little schoolgirls partying in 3D.
5296196	5297696	That's pretty much what it is, aren't they all?
5298256	5301077	All right, and I think that's it.
5302737	5303237	Yes, that's it.
5303297	5305298	So let's go to Europe.
5306824	5308385	In Europe, we have games.
5309106	5311447	And starting on, when does the week start again?
5311547	5312187	Oh yeah, today.
5312848	5326616	Starting on the 20th, we have Burnout Crash on 360 and PlayStation 3, Fallout New Vegas Lonesome Road on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, Gears of War 3, and Resident Evil Revival Selection.
5327537	5329438	On the 21st, we have Rotastic.
5330118	5333721	And the 23rd, we have Supremacy MMA, F1 2011, and that's it.
5337802	5343003	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
5343383	5344123	But first, Loki?
5344743	5355425	Yes, I think we talked a little bit about it last week, how there was a cable company in Canada that was actually throttling internet speeds with gaming on them.
5356105	5358546	And it's actually a little bit of a follow-up to that.
5358786	5364427	The Canadian Radio and Television Telecommunications Commission, that's a mouthful,
5365127	5380350	cited that Rogers' own policy which claims that the online games like World of Warcraft should not be throttled and telling the company it has now until September 27th to present a plan that keeps World of Warcraft traffic and that of other games unthrottled.
5381010	5382270	So I guess that's good news for Canada.
5382550	5393992	Wish we had people that actually had power over here in the United States do that kind of thing because internet cable companies are running like crazy and
5395356	5395957	GameAustralia GameAustralia
5419744	5420425	What the hell is this?
5442202	5447865	Clearly this is all just to be provocative and I'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried this yet.
5448326	5450527	Just getting people talking and so forth.
5451467	5453128	Really, that's really all there is to it.
5453168	5457551	It's just, you know, to look like a wiener and so forth.
5458007	5461109	However, it is drawing complaints, of course.
5461309	5462450	Not everybody likes this.
5462510	5465992	How dare you use two fingers to look like a butt in the cutout of the card?
5466673	5471996	Complaints have been filed with the ACCC, that is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
5472597	5475519	Game has not acknowledged or commented on these complaints.
5476359	5482303	When questioned about these cards, they just talk about how great the reward program is and all the stuff that they can get back.
5482784	5487367	We've decided to relaunch the reward card program with its extra benefits, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5487927	5489128	The Wiener is you
5509168	5516811	Alright, a winner is you right now because right now we're going to go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week.
5518412	5525374	Every week DarkSakura dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks, hey, you kids need to show this game more respect.
5525794	5527495	Screw the Vita and screw the 3DS.
5527915	5530736	Back in my day, this game was the bee's knees.
5531716	5532437	DarkSakura.
5533437	5536161	I can make better boobs in chat than Kevin68 can.
5537403	5539345	Seriously, my boobs are a lot better.
5541848	5543250	Today's game is The Sims.
5545794	5550560	Yes, The Sims, the game that started it all and why we're all playing that stupid game on Facebook.
5552580	5556504	Basically, The Sims is a game where... Is this actual game noises?
5556564	5556825	Sorry.
5556845	5558006	Yes, that's actual game noises.
5558066	5560589	And they're playing in a fast forward, which is like the best one I could find.
5560710	5560990	Okay.
5561931	5564815	But it's a life simulation game, pretty much.
5565055	5569620	It was designed by Will Wright, which you know what else he did.
5570161	5570622	SimCity.
5571082	5572763	Bob the Sim or something.
5599870	5603251	So you've got NPCs and you've got your actual Sim.
5603431	5606032	And your Sim can interact with the NPCs and get married.
5606092	5609514	You eventually will be able to control the Sim that they marry, blah blah.
5610374	5611774	But you have different stages of life.
5611814	5614635	You have an infant, a child, and an adult.
5615076	5616236	And that's just in the Sims.
5617296	5621198	Babies will grow into children and children and adults never age.
5621878	5632087	So that means that they can stay in their little lifespan indefinitely, but they can die from different stuff like burning to death, drowning in a pool, starving, dying from disease, and the Grim Reaper will come and take them away.
5632547	5640654	But you have to win against them in rock, paper, scissors, or your sin will actually die and stay dead and your tombstone will show up.
5642338	5646021	I like in Sims 3 how, you know, if you kill a Sim, they'll just start haunting the house.
5646041	5646702	It's pretty awesome.
5647482	5652787	Anyway, you've got Live Mode, which is where you do all your gameplay.
5652827	5656330	And then you have Build and Buy Mode, where Build Mode is where you build your house.
5656390	5662455	You start off with 20,000 simoleons, which is their money system.
5663255	5666458	And you've got Buy Mode, where you can buy house parts and do stuff.
5668163	5671307	So in your lives, your sims do have a little bit of free will.
5672008	5673770	They can, you know, autonomously do stuff.
5673790	5676814	You can control, I think, the level of their free will.
5679718	5682501	But basically, you still have to make them pee.
5682801	5686927	You have to make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and, you know, make babies and shit.
5688820	5689380	You!
5689621	5690481	Go make a baby!
5692521	5703765	I thought it was funny, because this actually mentions that their system of needs follow Maslow's hierarchy of needs, in which the physiological needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to.
5704546	5711888	So, you know, they'll piss on the floor if you don't tell them to go to the bathroom.
5711948	5714469	Or if you forget to build a toilet, which I had a friend do.
5715670	5717452	Or if they don't eat, they'll die of starvation.
5717472	5721275	And their needs, their physical needs are what govern their mood.
5721375	5726060	So the more that their needs are taken care of, the better mood that they'll be in.
5726140	5726941	I've got needs.
5727502	5734348	Or, for example, if you're playing the SimSocial, you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs are in the green?
5734969	5735429	Same diff.
5736110	5736811	Then you'll be happy.
5737210	5740471	I'm thinking I'm done with SimSocial and I'm going to block it on Facebook.
5740771	5741391	I like it.
5742291	5742932	I like my house.
5743052	5744792	I hate the spammy spam.
5744832	5746132	It's getting bad.
5747893	5754115	Do you know they put a feedback window where you can leave them feedback about not liking any of that?
5754795	5756595	So you might want to try leaving feedback first.
5756635	5757315	I got feedback.
5757475	5757876	Block.
5761388	5767791	Anyway, so basically, it's kind of like an artificial life program, if you look at it in that respect.
5768072	5769932	And you can keep playing and playing.
5770253	5772934	In the first Sims, I used to just kill people all the time.
5772954	5776756	I think everybody did that with the Sims at first.
5776776	5779497	You have to create creative death traps for your Sims.
5779598	5781298	It's a way of getting out of stress.
5781639	5783800	One of my friends actually had what she called the House of Death.
5785241	5789884	And like, it was all kinds of ways that, you know, they could set themselves on fire and things.
5790164	5791866	And she had a graveyard in front of the house.
5793487	5795068	It was Julie's house, Dan.
5795128	5797050	I'm sure you remember that.
5798611	5807698	So basically, with your kids, they can study at home and keep their grades up, but if they miss too many school days, they are transported to a military academy indefinitely.
5809341	5812868	and they can't prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless.
5814011	5815193	Children are useless.
5817128	5820712	So, I mean, basically, your sims can fight with other sims.
5820772	5821593	They do stuff.
5822314	5828601	And they can actually be locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed.
5829241	5834026	And so they'll keep interacting with other people, but they won't be able to leave.
5834667	5835508	They can't leave.
5835648	5836950	And they don't prune or anything?
5837410	5837991	They don't die.
5838371	5838992	They're just undead.
5840695	5845357	So basically, in the first Sims, it actually did use a combination of 2D and 3D.
5845457	5848738	The Sims themselves are 3D, but everything in it are pre-rendered.
5850559	5853080	So the game clearly has been a success.
5854240	5858882	It sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide.
5860043	5860563	And as of...
5864179	5868342	As of February 7, 2005, that's 16 million copies shipped worldwide.
5869362	5871784	And, of course, it's been highly pirated.
5872884	5878948	And the music in the game was done by Jerry Martin, Mark Russo, Kirk R. Casey, and Dick Spruce.
5879228	5882831	And these people have actually, I think, gone through and done all the other sim music.
5882851	5884612	So you can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music.
5885012	5887774	And it's got its own little unique, perky little style, you know?
5888474	5888994	It's cute.
5889635	5893396	Now, this is the part that I am interested in, in particular, is Simlish.
5894796	5901899	Which, they wanted to avoid a way to, um... They wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue.
5902559	5904680	So the best way for them to do it was to create a language.
5904780	5907481	Now Simlish... Can I play some of the songs in Simlish?
5907501	5908582	Because they're really bad.
5908962	5909822	Find the Lily Allen one.
5910682	5913884	Find the one for Smile, because it was actually really cute and the video is adorable.
5917227	5917567	Is that it?
5918308	5918528	Yes.
5918908	5920089	There's a Nelly Furtado one, by the way.
5920109	5922472	This kind of reminds me of Kidz Bop.
5922492	5924294	I don't know why.
5935944	5937565	The Nutley Furtado was actually kind of cool too.
5937625	5938665	Baby language bop.
5939406	5943647	Well, the whole point with Simlish, oh, and didn't Katy Perry do Hot and Cold?
5943667	5947808	Yeah, I was going to say, here's one for Salacious Pop, who I know is a huge fan of this artist.
5954871	5959492	Funny, that's what I hear when I hear this song.
5960133	5963974	If you play it backwards, it's devil speak, and that's why she's popular.
5965168	5967672	Honestly, they're... Listen, she's... Listen, play it backwards.
5968533	5971739	She's saying that she killed Michael Jackson to get that record.
5972961	5974303	So bad.
5974343	5976947	But actually, these little videos that they did for him were really cute.
5980818	5983559	Anyway, anyway, Simlish is really a bunch of gibberish.
5984140	5990803	But they were gonna actually base it, they created it by experimenting with Ukrainian, French, and Tagalog.
5991464	5999928	And he wanted to base it off of Navajo, but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections that you'd hear in everyday speech.
6000188	6002630	They really got those bitches to sing in a baby language?
6003130	6003510	Pretty much.
6005111	6007733	How did somebody convince Katy Perry that's a good idea?
6007753	6008293	Yeah.
6008533	6009254	Cha-ching!
6011336	6012758	You like money, bitch, right?
6012778	6013899	Here's some money!
6015060	6015921	There was a special about it.
6016602	6020747	I watched one of the behind-the-scenes for The Sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in Simlish.
6021407	6025772	And basically, they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song.
6026713	6028935	And they're like, you know, it was kind of fun.
6029115	6031818	And, you know, it's kind of neat to see the Sim version of me.
6031978	6036022	And, you know, so, like, besides being paid, I've seen a lot amounts of money.
6036042	6037203	You know, they said it was fun.
6037223	6039165	They just showed what the lyric sheet looked like.
6039185	6043329	And it was all, me ma boo, ma ma ma me, horgy wow.
6044029	6046812	You know, whatever they say in Simlish.
6048144	6060134	But, um... The different expansions were Live Enlarge, House Party, Hot Date, Vacation, Unleashed, Superstar, Superstar, and Make It Magic, which was the last one.
6060234	6061795	And then Sims 2 came out.
6063077	6064518	And then we have Sims 3 now.
6065238	6068041	And, honestly, I think Sims 2 was kind of better than Sims 3.
6068781	6069562	But I really like Sims 3.
6069862	6071764	Except it's so fucking slow!
6072725	6072825	Ah!
6072845	6072885	Ah!
6074113	6076835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6097671	6124216	in Sims 2 they had custom build the fucking universe they had a custom Sims maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff to them and now like in Sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's model modifiers built in like you can change all kinds of features on their face and everything but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and
6124756	6131741	There's even elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between Tolkien-style elven ears and WoW-style elven ears.
6132242	6133763	Or you can just give them really huge Dumbo ears.
6134664	6137506	So, that's just, you can farm.
6138627	6152737	You can, now, the first thing that I did whenever, in Sims 3 now, whenever I just, you know, met some random person and ended up marrying them, like, my Sim was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes.
6153878	6155400	for some time and finally ended up marrying some girl.
6155540	6156741	Sim slut.
6157802	6164868	Finally ended up marrying some girl, except her model was really crappy, so you can actually go into the stylist mode.
6164888	6168011	Are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery to fix her up?
6168271	6168972	Yes, I did.
6169592	6175277	I made my wife look not... Honestly, the original Sim faces in Sims 3 were really derpy.
6176758	6179521	Now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy.
6181682	6183463	But anyway, the first Sims is what started it all.
6183943	6184963	And I played a good bit of that.
6185004	6186084	And I played a lot of Sims 2.
6186384	6190585	Because Sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code and started having dirty things.
6191086	6196908	Like you could buy dildos and a rug that had butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff.
6197828	6204691	Well, this is a well-timed classic game of the week because, you know, The Sims is or was like the biggest PC game ever.
6204771	6207953	It might have got beat by World of Warcraft eventually, I don't know, or one of the Blizzard games.
6208033	6211134	But The Sims is still a huge, huge PC game.
6211174	6221139	And obviously with The Sims Social now being like a huge Facebook game, despite the fact that that thing spams the shit out of all your friends while on Facebook, it is topical to make sure you know where that comes from.
6222499	6225881	I'm sure everybody has that story about, you know, terrorizing Sims.
6226286	6231148	Now here's actually a little bit of news that I just found out I wasn't aware of.
6231649	6237612	On May 25, 2007, there's a Sims film rights were purchased by Twin Century Fox being written by Brian Lynch.
6237852	6239653	The fuck would you do in a Sims movie?
6239773	6240113	I don't know.
6240173	6241614	Here's a movie about life.
6242334	6244295	Everyone's walking around with a little plumbob over their head.
6244775	6247637	Unless it's like a cartoon or something.
6247897	6254000	And the original Sims site by Maxis has been disconnected for 11 years and is now replaced by the Sims 3 site.
6256198	6256458	Alright.
6257379	6258119	Is that it on Sims?
6258500	6259020	That's it.
6259160	6261282	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6261402	6262102	Bork Me Do.
6262503	6263063	The Sims.
6263143	6263743	Bork Me Do.
6264164	6267726	By Maxis for the PC, although now it's all EA.
6267766	6270788	It's all part of that big, you know, glomerate.
6271849	6274932	That's going to do it for Part A here of Orange Lounge Radio.
6274952	6275752	But don't go anywhere, guys.
6275772	6285540	We've got plenty more coming in Part B. We're going to talk a little bit about a new tablet coming out that's very interesting, something that Microsoft's launching at the end of the year, and somebody whining about secondhand sales.
6285780	6291765	Of course, the FUs of the week, your calls, rapid-fire news, and much more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6297831	6300372	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6300412	6307054	We are live on this September the 18th of 2011 with the 428th episode of our program.
6307495	6313777	We've had a pretty fun Part A so far, talking about the latest in 3DS as well as Vita and reviews.
6314037	6317678	Gosh, there was just a bunch of stuff in Part A tonight, so let's see if Part B will be as much fun.
6317698	6320719	Don't forget your phone calls coming up later in the show at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6322840	6325282	or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6325302	6332746	We're also going to get to those emails at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and Twitter topics, Twitter.com slash OLR.
6332806	6335528	So if you want to get in your Twitter topics now, it would be a great time.
6335588	6337650	It's kind of looking a little thin on Twitter right now.
6338070	6340571	I guess still everybody's being distracted by the Emmys.
6340852	6341792	Email's pretty thin too.
6341932	6342793	Let me just spoil it for you.
6342833	6344254	Modern Family won everything.
6344534	6345494	At least that's what I heard.
6345595	6345875	I don't know.
6345975	6346575	I didn't really read up.
6346995	6348977	It's a funny show though, I guess, if you're going to watch something.
6349657	6351938	All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news, Loki.
6352878	6357139	Saints Row III, of course, it was being shown at a Tokyo game show.
6357559	6369123	You know, really, it's a game that's kind of more for Western audiences, but one man in particular, though, in Japan, is very interested in the series, and he's kind of crazy himself.
6370063	6383896	Tomonobu Itagaki, you may remember him as the driving force behind Team Ninja and the Dead or Alive series and now his new game, The Devil's Third.
6385357	6386017	Thanks for watching!
6406804	6407184	Why not?
6407224	6407665	Gotta love it.
6407685	6408205	Why not?
6409126	6409686	So that's pretty sweet.
6410587	6413609	Some other cool stuff was being shown off at Tokyo Game Show.
6413669	6414669	Project Draco.
6415050	6423475	And what Project Draco is, it's kind of like a spiritual successor or inspired by Panzer Dragoon game.
6423895	6425417	And it's going to be a Kinect title.
6425437	6427478	It's going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
6428278	6429659	And looks pretty cool.
6430380	6435183	Very, very much like Panzer Dragoon based on the video that I've seen for it.
6437129	6437857	very very cool
6438837	6467343	and then this is kind of neat they've done a remake of Smash Brothers called Super Smash Land not Nintendo this guy named Dan Fornes he put out Super Smash Land features 11 different stages 6 brawlers including Mega Man classic arcade mode and multiplayer up to 4 people and they also have I guess a polygon team style endless mode as well
6468342	6469543	with online leaderboards.
6470084	6472125	So you can go check out the full game.
6472266	6479052	They have it available to download as well over at PixieGeek.com.
6488180	6489661	Get it now before the season desists.
6489701	6490561	Yes, exactly.
6490741	6495544	And it is done in the style of the Game Boy, so all that monochrome, grayish-green, I guess.
6497465	6504610	Let's try to get that chat to the chat room as well as the Tumblr, which I keep forgetting to plug, but it is there at orangelaundry.com.
6504630	6508912	There's a link on the left side called Extended Play.
6509353	6514536	There is a link to our Tumblr, orangelaundry.tumblr.com, because we're hipster as hell and have a Tumblr.
6516656	6517717	Oh, that's it for your news, too, isn't it?
6518417	6519638	Let me get to my rapid-fire news.
6519718	6520378	Rock Band!
6520398	6521199	Yay, Rock Band!
6521219	6523880	Nirvana has a bunch of songs coming out in Rock Band this week.
6524240	6526142	Heart-Shaped Box, Rape Me.
6526362	6527442	Oh, that's a family-friendly song.
6527883	6530404	All Apologies and You Know You're Right are all coming out.
6530424	6533446	Those are actually some really big Nirvana songs, so that's pretty cool.
6533806	6542291	It's a celebration of the 20th anniversary of Nirvana's Nevermind album, although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on Nevermind, but...
6542811	6549677	If I'm not mistaken, never mind, that whole album was already released into rock bands some time ago, maybe for the 15th or something, I don't know.
6550137	6558644	They are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of Nirvana songs, including Smells Like Teen Spirit, The Live Lithium, and Come As You Are Live.
6558945	6559825	All of those are getting upgrades.
6559845	6562928	There's actually like 10 songs getting upgrades, so...
6563208	6564528	So you can use all three chords?
6565669	6569769	If you are a Nirvana fan, you're going to have a happy week in Rock Band this week.
6570389	6573690	I heard DarkSakura give a little squee at this next story.
6574490	6579631	If you are a fan of Capcom fighters, one of the missing ones is coming out on the PlayStation Store.
6580091	6582252	Cyberbots Full Metal Madness.
6582832	6583392	Don't you know?
6583532	6585092	Cyberbots is Capcom's number one game.
6587133	6587373	Really?
6587733	6589913	That's a quote from Puzzle Fighter.
6590513	6590694	Oh.
6590854	6591434	From Devilot.
6591454	6592194	That's right.
6592254	6592554	All right.
6592574	6592914	There you go.
6593910	6597552	So anyway, that is coming out on the PlayStation Store.
6597992	6599313	Is that coming out in America too?
6599773	6601614	Or just Japan?
6602894	6604475	Well, I imagine it will probably come out in both.
6604975	6605936	Time to hook up to Saturn.
6605956	6606936	I think it's coming out in the U.S.
6606976	6607256	as well.
6607296	6610057	So if you like your Capcom fighters, that's going to be a pretty big deal.
6610197	6611978	It's not like they have a lot of Japanese change in it.
6613039	6617961	Tokyo Game Show produced from Square Enix this music sampler.
6618021	6619221	It's the music sampler CD 2011 Volume 6.
6620942	6621703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6643526	6665522	However, there's some interesting arranged music that has tracks on the sampler CD Piano Collections, Final Fantasy 1, 2, 3 An El Shaddai remix album called El Shaddai and the Astrals That's kind of interesting Also, I guess something called Cafe SQ Which is supposed to be some type of musical tribute to Second Detsetsu The 20th anniversary of that as well
6665842	6670045	So, pretty interesting there.
6670605	6671746	I think that's already being given out.
6671766	6676629	The sampler is being given out at Tokyo Game Show, but the rest of those CDs probably throughout the next couple quarters.
6677710	6678690	Moving on, DarkSakura.
6680491	6681832	Actually, I misquoted the line.
6682493	6682893	It's what?
6682933	6683733	You don't recognize me?
6684114	6685555	Cyberboss is Capcom's number one game.
6686895	6687136	Anyway.
6688476	6689317	50 points from Gryffindor.
6691889	6692950	Portal is free!
6693490	6697033	Very, very free on Steam until September 20th.
6697093	6702518	But go get it now because it's Steam and Portal and it's free and very short and makes me throw up.
6703699	6709764	Next up, Knights of the Old Republic is going down to £3.50 on Steam this weekend.
6709984	6716290	Actually, it's a whole half price on all of the Star Wars games and the same goes for the US only in dollars and cents.
6717871	6720073	So if you want to get your scrotour on, go for it.
6721847	6723248	Did you just call it Skrotor?
6723448	6723989	Yes, I did.
6724069	6724929	You're so mature.
6725290	6725810	I know, right?
6726531	6730614	Batman Arkham City will actually have another character in it, Deadshot.
6732815	6737339	And he will be in there to take out a series of high-value targets so Batman has to protect them.
6738079	6748687	And also other characters in there are Rocksteady and Joker, Hugo Strange, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Mr. Free Penguin, and the Calendar Man.
6749728	6750068	That's it.
6751294	6753575	That Arkham City game is going to be pretty sweet, I gotta say.
6753595	6753655	Yes.
6753935	6755755	It's going to be a lot of fun.
6755815	6755975	What?
6756216	6756716	Scrotor.
6757216	6757616	Shut up.
6758416	6760297	Alright, definitely get the free Portal.
6760537	6761577	I mean, it's free.
6761617	6763578	It's just obviously a draw to get more people on Steam.
6763618	6767779	I think everybody already got this like two years ago when it was free before... When it came out on Mac.
6768079	6770440	When Steam for Mac came out, then Portal came out for free.
6770560	6793826	But if for whatever reason you've been resistant to Steam or you didn't get it last time Or if somehow you're the one person that hasn't played Portal yet You really should just try it I'm not just saying that It is a pretty fucking rad game It's really awesome, it's super cool Even if you hate first person shooters, it's more of a puzzle game I don't like first person shooters and I play the hell out of Portal 2 And Portal 2 is so fucking good I know
6795337	6798458	Before we get back into some long-form news, I want to give a plug for this.
6798979	6808942	I didn't talk about this at the beginning of the show because I wanted the people that really stick with the show and who stick with it to really hear this because you're going to hear this on a lot of podcasts over the next few weeks.
6809543	6812464	It's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around, and I'm...
6813644	6814925	I'm always kind of on the fence about this.
6815145	6817566	I don't like that it's a gigantic popularity contest.
6817966	6823448	It was a lot more fun the first year, and I'm not just saying that because we won, although obviously that helped.
6824069	6826410	But it was more about independent shows then.
6826650	6832072	It seriously seemed like all of the independent video game podcasts that existed at the time...
6832392	6832952	and DarkSakura.
6855069	6856050	and possibly win.
6856190	6860655	I would really just... I mean, we've won before, so it's cool as long as some independent podcast wins.
6860996	6862037	I think that's really important.
6862237	6869926	And I don't want to see a bunch of corporate-funded, paid-for, commercialized podcasts get nominated.
6870046	6870306	So...
6871147	6877451	I'm going to just kind of bite the bullet and ask, would you consider nominating Orange Lounge Radio for Best Gaming Podcast?
6877491	6879672	It's www.podcastawards.com.
6880132	6884275	I believe nominations are open until like the 30th, so not too much longer.
6884295	6886516	This is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the show.
6886996	6888758	Please, if you like the show, it's free.
6889098	6890659	We don't shove commercials down your throat.
6890999	6892580	Just help us get this exposure.
6892820	6893660	It's all we really ask.
6893700	6897803	Head over to podcastawards.com and please consider nominating us for Best Gaming Podcast.
6898644	6902387	You can only nominate the show in one category.
6902707	6904709	You maybe can do Best Produced as well.
6905510	6909294	I don't even have delusions that we would get nominated in those categories.
6909314	6909974	Best Produced.
6910154	6911255	Yeah, right?
6911976	6916761	Well, somehow, many years ago, we got nominated for Best of Life 365 Best Station.
6917261	6918202	Well, I know how we did it.
6918262	6919563	It's because our fans are awesome.
6919783	6921845	And because not a lot of Life 365 stations had...
6923767	6924769	Thanks for watching!
6940911	6942152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6968198	6977306	Yes, he had the rock star type hair, you know, like the Bon Jovi style hair, you know, where they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut.
6978667	6979168	He had that.
6980789	6981450	And let's see.
6981530	6985133	Oh, Brad from PodCulture is in the chat saying, I don't mess with the podcast awards.
6985173	6986214	We don't stand a chance.
6986274	6989637	Well, then I'll say go nominate PodCulture for best sci-fi.
6989677	6990778	Is there like a sci-fi category?
6990798	6991479	There's got to be, right?
6991739	6993681	There's got to be like a fandom or sci-fi category.
6993721	6994922	Go nominate PodCulture for that.
6995422	6996102	We'll see you next time.
7025129	7027371	PodcastWars.com, nominate us for best gaming podcast.
7027791	7028732	Nominate us only once.
7029072	7029613	It's uploading.
7030533	7031354	Oh, the award that we won?
7031374	7032415	Yeah, on Pun Man.
7033095	7033376	Awesome.
7033636	7049328	It would also be kind of neat, I gotta say, I'm not gonna lie, it would be kind of neat to have won that award in 2005, and then if we get nominated again, if, big if, I don't think any other show, certainly no other gaming shows, could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart.
7049849	7049989	Yeah.
7050009	7050089	Yeah.
7050774	7073824	I don't know maybe what other shows from back then are still going I think Video Game News Radio is probably the only one I think they're still going I think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool I'd be happy for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the end of the day I'm happy but if freaking
7075322	7076103	Blank, blank, blank.
7076204	7077225	Corporate website wins.
7077285	7078127	I'm not going to be happy.
7078427	7080952	So let's at least push some indie to the top.
7081072	7082114	Okay, I've said enough about that.
7085859	7109166	I think it was four player podcast which I think actually I see some of them on Twitter so they are an indie thing I think they're like a Justin TV related thing they do a lot with that stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level I think they were the ones that won last year so that is definitely an indie show as well and if they win it again good on them good for them
7110342	7112203	Alright, let's move on though with more gaming news.
7112383	7113484	I don't want to talk about that anymore.
7113504	7114565	I've given it far too much time.
7114925	7115205	Loki.
7116406	7120509	Yes, so let's talk about GameStop.
7120529	7123091	You know how they have their streaming service coming.
7123931	7129835	Well, we know that because of the whole debacle with Deus Ex and that kind of stuff.
7130216	7132297	But there's a little bit more to that as well.
7132877	7139522	They've announced that they're going to be doing some sort of Android branded tablet thing.
7139822	7148127	or I guess there'll be an Android tablet that's GameStop branded that's going to be paired to the dedicated controller peripheral that's going to be coming out later next year.
7149168	7161216	And the thought is that the device will support, I guess, mobile apps and the goal is to allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet, kind of like on live or something like that.
7162037	7165321	Very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me.
7165501	7167143	But, eh, fine.
7167183	7168625	If you want to release a tablet, that's fine.
7168665	7173832	It's more power to you, but at the same time, the tablet market is pretty crowded.
7173952	7174753	So, meh.
7174833	7175694	I don't know.
7176696	7177757	I'll pass, thanks.
7178197	7178717	Exactly.
7180018	7181459	That's pretty much what I have to say on that.
7182259	7183580	Pass.
7185081	7185461	I don't know.
7186342	7191205	I think it's going to be difficult for them to do that, but if they want to try, fine.
7191245	7193486	You're not supposed to say the name of the company.
7193506	7193726	Whatever.
7193746	7194286	You know how we feel.
7202748	7205810	Alright, moving on to some other gaming news.
7206151	7214297	Actually, this isn't really gaming per se, but it's certainly that gaming device that you use for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device, if it's not already.
7214817	7218620	Microsoft is launching a TV service for the Xbox 360 this holiday season.
7218640	7226346	You kind of already knew that via E3, but it was confirmed by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a financial analyst meeting that happened this past week.
7226887	7232211	Microsoft is working with, quote, dozens or hundreds of additional video content suppliers.
7232671	7235312	There is a big difference between dozens and hundreds.
7235332	7238394	There you know, working with one or a million.
7256488	7257188	Somewhere in between there.
7257248	7259550	I guess it's probably hard because they don't have a lot confirmed right now.
7259610	7270976	But I wonder if this is like Xbox's kind of way to take a jab at Netflix while they're down, which is interesting because Netflix is a big – it's weird because Netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway.
7271036	7276719	But a lot of – Netflix has really had a hard past couple months, and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars.
7277300	7277640	So –
7278240	7280723	Yeah, their stock is tumbling.
7280823	7288290	If Microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that Netflix is losing, it could be the thing to have.
7288750	7289070	I don't know.
7289090	7289771	It's going to be interesting.
7291232	7295456	I wonder if their service is really popular if they just drop Netflix.
7296197	7296658	You never know.
7296718	7298479	It's possible.
7298820	7302843	Is there any interest in a Microsoft TV network?
7302863	7302924	No.
7303704	7304384	I'd check it out.
7304665	7308466	I mean, if it's going to be included as part of my gold subscription, then sure.
7308566	7309446	Hell yeah, free TV.
7310187	7311587	Especially if they have on-demand stuff.
7312027	7312828	Even if it's commercials.
7312908	7314688	If I get it for free, I'm fine.
7314769	7315889	I get limited cable now.
7316009	7320271	FX, I don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable.
7320631	7325373	And actually, my box has an error right now, so I don't get any on-demand whatsoever.
7326493	7328574	So yeah, I'd look forward to anything free.
7329514	7330615	Hell, cancel cable again.
7331475	7347110	I would even just be happy if I could watch like shows that are on CBS just later when I want and not have to go on to CBS.com but like watch it in HD on my TV I would really like that like just being able to watch Survivor like the next day because Wednesday nights are raid nights so I can't watch Survivor live shut up don't judge me
7348247	7375395	Cinderwolf is in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com a proud Canadian because he's saying and Canada gets shortchanged again as we have been with the internet TV feature included within Windows Media Center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like Europe and Britain specifically for some time like the Sky TV arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is just a step further where Microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a little further and
7375655	7377496	I would prefer the latter because, you know...
7397248	7399851	If I want to watch on-demand stuff, I can just do it through my TV.
7400731	7405876	If we're talking about my cable provider, I'd rather be Microsoft's own content.
7406477	7407618	Some original shows would be nice.
7408358	7411281	Or just 1 versus 100 coming back.
7412382	7413483	I'm never going to let up on that.
7414987	7421473	But I think Canada will probably get it eventually, but your way of thinking is probably right, because there's a follow-up comment here.
7421553	7426417	Cinderwolf says, content will be extremely changed and limited compared to US TV available online.
7426478	7427759	Sadly, he's probably right.
7428620	7433104	Canada will probably get it eventually, so will Mexico, so will wherever else Xbox does business.
7433464	7435406	Whatever, you still have tech TV, so stop bitching.
7435426	7435466	So...
7441101	7441941	I will swap you.
7442021	7448404	You can have all the crappy content that we have here and I'll take Tech TV.
7448664	7452705	You know, it would be kind of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some Canadian shows here.
7452725	7453966	Hell yeah.
7454026	7458507	Because of the content laws up there, they get a lot of localized versions of shows too.
7459428	7461548	Or they had So You Think You Can Dance Canada.
7461989	7463689	They had Canadian Idol and all that stuff.
7463709	7465290	I don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore.
7466170	7467291	I don't know.
7467311	7470472	It might be fun to watch tech TV and stuff.
7470792	7473074	There's many countries that have their own version of The Office.
7473254	7473914	Oh, yeah.
7474214	7475755	It'd be fun.
7476755	7477055	All right.
7477216	7479417	Anyhow, let's move on with some more gaming news.
7479457	7480617	DarkSakura.
7481057	7481738	Actually, no, I lied.
7481758	7482738	She's going to go to the mailbag.
7482938	7483178	Oops.
7483579	7484219	I'm on it tonight.
7485079	7485660	Yay, Rob.
7485720	7486160	Mailbag.
7486300	7487281	Best produced show.
7487361	7487921	That's right.
7488221	7490042	For your consideration, best produced.
7491707	7495390	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is where you guys send us email every week.
7495771	7499434	DarkSakura dives into the email bag and pulls out her favorites head first.
7499514	7501416	Unless there's not a lot to pick from.
7501516	7502257	We have one.
7503077	7503938	One email.
7504118	7504839	Yay.
7504879	7507762	From Holly D. Most popular podcast, apparently.
7508042	7509263	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7509283	7510704	This is to Loki.
7511665	7513327	You have the same birthday as my puppy.
7513447	7514408	She just turned one.
7514428	7515008	Smile face.
7515268	7515769	Happy birthday.
7516710	7517851	I will live longer than your puppy.
7518913	7519794	Oh my god!
7520494	7522096	What a rude thing to say!
7523037	7525480	You apologize right now to that poor puppy.
7526782	7532088	It's just... Well, actually, no, that's not a fact because I eat like crap, so I'm sorry, puppy.
7532348	7533890	Congratulations on your... There you go.
7534210	7534791	Much better.
7535430	7535971	Thanks for watching!
7562952	7566376	Mailbag at OrangeLawnStrader.com if you want to be insulted by one of the hosts.
7567137	7567978	Send us an email.
7569320	7570341	We'd really appreciate it.
7571222	7574986	We always like to follow up the email bag with the FUs of the week.
7575087	7576789	It's time to get ranty.
7577129	7577730	Rawr!
7592335	7595618	Hold on, I just gotta read some comments from chat real quick, though, because it's so important.
7595638	7596318	Fuck the chat.
7596338	7596698	No, kidding.
7596939	7600581	SalaciousPop says, the puppy is better at not piddling on the rug, though.
7601902	7605725	Brad says, from PodCulture, says, gonna burn in the special hell for that one.
7606386	7608187	And Randy says, aw, poor Holly.
7608207	7609428	So, Holly, you got fans in chat.
7609448	7610029	They got your back.
7611950	7612591	Rude, Loki.
7612611	7613631	I love puppies.
7613772	7615373	That's how you do.
7615433	7615713	All right.
7615733	7616634	All right.
7617577	7618358	You're a cat owner.
7618958	7620720	I have a cat.
7620940	7627665	I was a previous dog owner, since I'm a realist and I understand how much work it takes to have a cat versus having a dog.
7627986	7631749	Dogs are awesome, but dogs actually need work to keep them clean and fed.
7631789	7634331	Cats are awesome and they'll wake your baby.
7635212	7635772	Yes, they will.
7636213	7637574	Except Shermie, who doesn't give a shit.
7637774	7638615	Alright, FU's the lead.
7638815	7639535	Sorry, tangent.
7639856	7640276	FU's the lead.
7641537	7648063	Fuck you to my headache that is now trying to come back and the increasing volume in this room.
7649704	7651766	We don't know how to use our inside voices on LLR.
7651846	7652667	No, we don't!
7653868	7654969	This isn't my inside voice.
7657231	7658152	Loki, you're off music of the week.
7658592	7663116	Fuck you to the woman driving a Ford GT car with the license plate.
7663136	7664618	This is the best part right here.
7665038	7668241	The license plate said, accelerate, love to.
7670134	7670675	Great advice.
7670695	7673621	You should take it yourself because you're driving 30 miles an hour in a 45.
7675725	7676467	You're an old woman.
7677383	7680745	Maybe that Accelerate Love Tube, but I'm an old bat, so I can't do that.
7681025	7682666	So, yeah, fuck you.
7683046	7687668	Oh, yeah, and by the way, the topper of all that, she turned into the bingo parking lot.
7687688	7689129	So, yeah, she was going to bingo.
7689189	7689529	Nice.
7690150	7690470	Nice.
7690590	7692231	Awesome.
7692451	7694552	My FU of the week goes to stuff.
7695352	7697393	I don't want to talk about it.
7698374	7699034	So, stuff.
7699815	7701796	My FU of the week goes to vagueness.
7702556	7703617	That's right, vagueness.
7703697	7704317	I'm being vague.
7705239	7706520	I don't know how I feel about that, Rob.
7706600	7711145	That's right, neither do I. So let's get back into the show, get some more news out.
7711165	7713908	We'll get the Twitter topics and the Skype line coming very soon.
7714348	7715029	But first, Loki.
7715730	7723118	Yeah, we talked a little bit earlier in Part A about developers bitching and moaning about their games and how they're treated.
7724437	7725398	Poor my 8.0.
7726779	7727259	What did you get?
7727319	7727819	A 9.
7728079	7731081	Well, there's a different person bitching now.
7731581	7733742	Quadratic Dreams co-founder.
7734142	7735223	I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.
7735263	7735763	Some French guy.
7736163	7746008	Anyways, he estimates that the studio lost between 5 and 10 million euro due to second-hand sales.
7746909	7750350	Basically, we sold today approximately 2 million units.
7750450	7752852	We know from the trophy system that probably 3...
7753792	7757255	More than 3 million people bought the game and played it.
7758877	7762660	On a small level, it's a million people playing the game without giving me one cent.
7763781	7765542	Too fucking bad is what I say to that.
7765783	7773970	What about the rentals or friends loaning their copies to other friends or multiple PSN accounts on the same PlayStation?
7775231	7776412	Too fucking bad is what I say.
7776832	7777213	I don't care.
7777533	7778033	You know what?
7778234	7778454	That's...
7780135	7783397	Make an awesome game that people want to buy day one, you know what I mean?
7804767	7807270	Heavy Rain is a pretty good game.
7807470	7814920	Heavy Rain is alright, but it's... How much replayability is there really with Heavy Rain?
7814960	7816662	I mean, it's a pretty linear game.
7816922	7818184	Once you're done with it, you
7819373	7820313	It's like watching a movie.
7820714	7826199	Once you've seen it so many times, unless you're a super fan of the movie, you could probably get rid of it and be fine.
7826959	7831403	And his other comment is, now, are games too expensive?
7831663	7836167	I've always said that games are probably too expensive, so there's probably a right level here to find.
7836568	7839530	And we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that...
7840711	7850099	I would say reconcile consumer expectations, retail expectations, but also the expectations of the publishers and developers who make this business a worthwhile business.
7853182	7857185	But once again, though, I don't feel bad for you that your game sold used.
7857665	7858486	Too fucking bad.
7858886	7863610	Where are all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales from their games?
7864090	7864471	Suck it up.
7864531	7865211	Hey, you know what?
7865291	7866893	You sold a couple million copies.
7868499	7870401	That's better than most games do.
7894162	7898386	Hey, there's a game that I may be more interested in purchasing new, and it's by this development house.
7898847	7899928	Yeah, maybe I'm going to go buy it.
7900709	7915683	But just this type of mind frame and stuff, to me it seems like the next step is, oh, I'm going to try to find a way to prevent the second-hand sales, and then that's where we get into the whole other problems.
7915823	7917545	But it's not going to go away.
7919597	7922898	All right, well, let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought new.
7922938	7924479	I know a lot of people bought it new over here.
7924619	7927640	Or put out more DLC because then those people who bought it used it.
7927660	7928801	Way to ruin my transition.
7928841	7929721	Can buy the DLC.
7930001	7931502	I think there is DLC for Heavy Rain, isn't there?
7931522	7931962	Well, put more.
7932162	7932382	All right.
7932762	7935884	Anyhow, let's talk about Rock Band in Japan.
7936304	7943847	I didn't know this, that Harmonix was teaming up with Q Entertainment back in 2008 to actually put Rock Band out in Japan, but it didn't happen.
7944367	7945908	Q Entertainment actually walked away from it.
7946268	7950629	Now, apparently, Harmonix didn't end up ever putting the game out in Japan.
7951710	7961393	I guess there's been questions that have come up at Tokyo Game Show this week and so forth, because they did put out Dance Central, which is also coming out in Japan, Dance Central 2.
7962353	7986662	and in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the experience to the Japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country I guess proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course I kind of go well what about like Guitar Hero and excuse me Guitar Freaks and Drum Freaks and all that um
7988391	8007149	Harmonix I guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a musical experience and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um
8008760	8009421	Thanks for watching!
8030393	8030913	There you go.
8032154	8035115	Legend of Zaku in chat says, bullshit, Konami was trying to sue their ass.
8035155	8035595	That's why.
8036536	8037436	I don't remember that.
8037476	8039437	Wasn't the lawsuit, the lawsuit was never about Harmonix.
8039457	8040357	Wasn't it about Activision?
8040657	8041258	I think it was Activision.
8041278	8042158	I don't think it was Activision.
8042298	8043879	I don't remember.
8045239	8046760	It's all been so long ago now.
8046780	8048781	2008, that was like three years ago.
8049941	8050481	Good lord.
8051862	8052142	All right.
8052822	8053843	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
8055009	8055990	Just something about Oblivion.
8056930	8063375	The European Oblivion 5th Anniversary Edition release date, in fact, if anyone's interested.
8064175	8067878	It will be on September 23rd, and it will be £20 on PS3 and Xbox 360 and £18 on PC.
8072421	8085176	It's going to be the Game of the Year edition of Oblivion which has the download content, add-ons, Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine and in the box are the Making of Oblivion DVD and a color map of the world and the Shivering Isles.
8087193	8095080	So we've had the regular Oblivion, then we had Oblivion Game of the Year Edition, now we're having Oblivion 5 years of Oblivion Edition.
8095140	8096841	There's also a Skyrim video thrown in.
8097482	8097882	Oh, okay.
8098463	8102346	And it's not going to have the Steelbook casing in Europe, but it will in the US.
8103888	8107931	I wonder if it's that same walkthrough video that hit YouTube this past week for Skyrim.
8107951	8108772	That was a pretty good video.
8108872	8110994	No idea, but people like Oblivion.
8111465	8113966	I didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the U.S.
8114446	8116226	I thought it was just re-released with $10.
8117807	8120067	Is the anniversary edition coming out in the steelbook case?
8121668	8122328	In the U.S.?
8122648	8123088	In the U.S.
8123368	8124608	But it's already come out in the U.S.
8125269	8126169	It came out back in July.
8127009	8127929	Actually, the end of June.
8127949	8129110	Maybe this is a new new one.
8129950	8130910	Fifth anniversary edition?
8131110	8132390	It was the fifth anniversary edition.
8132490	8134311	Well, it said it had the steelbook case in the U.S.,
8135075	8136136	Whatever.
8136297	8136697	Maybe it did.
8137318	8138820	I bought the game like five years ago.
8138840	8141863	I'm not going to buy it again just because they threw in some extra shit that I already got.
8141883	8144646	Well, you get ten bucks off Skyrim if you buy the game too.
8147424	8149025	If you haven't played it, you know, it's good.
8177276	8178938	That's right, you can punch sheep in the face.
8178998	8179638	That's what I'll say.
8180559	8181520	Or let Loki say for me.
8182400	8184362	You can join guilds and rob them blind.
8185123	8186584	All the fun stuff you can do in Oblivion.
8188446	8190547	Some folks in chat are like, wow, Oblivion's that old?
8190688	8192069	Yeah, that's the same reaction I had.
8192109	8193570	I was like, shit, I remember when that came out.
8194351	8196773	It was delayed from the original Xbox launch.
8196793	8198054	It was supposed to be a launch title.
8198114	8198634	It didn't make it.
8199475	8200096	Anyhow, Loki.
8202398	8203739	Grand Theft Auto is a lot...
8204399	8205640	Not a big surprise.
8205900	8206940	Big game series.
8207541	8217905	The fourth expansion, Grand Theft Auto 4, surpassed 22 million units shipped, which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped since 1997.
8218525	8221507	That's pretty amazing.
8222207	8224748	And apparently surpassed San Andreas.
8225328	8230171	San Andreas sold 21.5 million units, and this, of course, 500,000 over that.
8233698	8234278	Grand Theft Auto V
8255515	8260397	It's basically, you know, obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay.
8260717	8264239	Basically, people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want.
8264359	8281826	You can drive around, be a criminal, and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars, shooting people, and then just, you know, recently with the PSP and then the, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 and the episodes from Liberty City and stuff, you know, the multiplayer has been pretty cool.
8282786	8282927	Um...
8284227	8285228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8307586	8318520	San Andreas especially that was a great game and then of course the new one 5 is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place in San Andreas again so that'll be freaking awesome
8319614	8338457	Alright, well I got one more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio but this is a very important story because I've been waiting like a year and a half, maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that I'm like particularly the biggest fan of this game but...
8339758	8340959	This just takes me back.
8341239	8351623	And thanks to the Australian Classification Board listing, apparently an HD remake has been spotted of a certain racing game.
8352404	8353484	Guess what racing game?
8355925	8356566	Derby Owners Club.
8357226	8357566	That's right!
8357586	8358767	Daytona, USA!
8358807	8359247	Daytona!
8371994	8376015	And if it doesn't have this song in it, fail.
8376495	8376875	Absolute fail.
8376915	8377695	Do not purchase.
8377715	8378575	Do not purchase.
8378595	8380236	Demand that this song be included.
8381276	8385056	We know that the lyrics are taken out for the Sega Racing Classic.
8385316	8386317	No!
8386617	8391998	It's still the music, but... Do you at least get the do-do-do-do-do-do part?
8392058	8392318	Yeah.
8392338	8397739	Well, that's the most important part right there.
8397859	8398159	I guess.
8402517	8410342	Ah, so we don't know when the release date is, but clearly it looks like something that's probably going to come out for Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network, something downloadable.
8410502	8413524	Because there already was like a Sega racing game earlier this year, right?
8413744	8423190	Yeah, and I know that there are no announcements, and as far as I'm aware, no plans whatsoever to bring this game to consoles or portable systems.
8423270	8427712	But if you do a Carmen Sandiego game, it's got to have the theme song from the game show.
8428193	8428753	I'm just saying.
8433311	8435492	Alright, one more time before I open up the skyline.
8435512	8441953	Just please, one more bit of Daytona, at least until a couple weeks when it gets confirmed to have a release date.
8441993	8443594	Then I can play the song again.
8444154	8444474	Here we go.
8445054	8446394	Come on, put up the horns.
8464278	8468761	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8469202	8473925	However, I may make people sing the Daytona theme song tonight.
8475486	8480670	I may need our listeners to call in and give us at least a do-do-do-do-do-do a little bit.
8480690	8481210	No, I don't know.
8481230	8481550	We'll see.
8481951	8482571	It depends who you are.
8483031	8485553	If you're someone that calls the show every week, I'm going to make you sing.
8485573	8490016	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8490497	8492218	Give us a call and we will...
8494238	8495098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8521391	8521932	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8545018	8546258	DarkSakura, you'll love this one.
8547439	8553160	A mother of five met her online lover who was 16 in New York.
8553820	8556361	They met on the game World of Warcraft.
8556441	8562702	She was a 35-year-old mother of five, and she allegedly lured a minor for sex after meeting him in an online video game.
8562982	8565383	Here's my favorite passage of the whole story, though.
8565403	8566083	I love this part.
8566903	8578746	Jenkins, who's the suspect, Angie Jenkins, allegedly made contact with the 15-year-old boy with the World of Warcraft video game, where players can talk with each other, according to the U.S.
8578806	8579266	attorney.
8580767	8581727	You don't say.
8581947	8583267	It's an MMO.
8583507	8586428	It's an online game where you're shitting me.
8586448	8587868	They talk to each other now?
8588508	8590069	Like, in inter...
8590882	8593063	But let's be real, no one uses voice chat on WoW.
8593724	8596485	They built that whole feature in and ain't no one using it.
8596505	8596926	Ventrilo.
8596946	8599427	Everybody's on Ventrilo.
8600568	8601228	I love this too.
8601648	8604810	The boy's parents took away his cell phone.
8605271	8605891	So what happened?
8605911	8608993	She bought him a new one and then drove to New York to have sex with him in a parking lot.
8609493	8610214	Classy!
8611803	8612724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8633465	8637769	footage of the cancelled Avengers game apparently made its way to the internet.
8637989	8639810	And this is in a tweet that Tigerclaw sent us.
8640391	8641672	I have not seen this at all.
8642132	8642733	God damn it.
8642773	8644394	God damn these fucking sponsor messages.
8644434	8644695	Hold on.
8644715	8648458	I gotta get through these messages.
8648518	8649999	Let's come back to this after we take a call.
8650019	8651560	I wanna feel the force.
8652081	8653142	You do not wanna feel the force.
8653162	8654122	You wanna feel this phone call.
8654162	8655023	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8655043	8655303	Who's this?
8655323	8655524	Yeah.
8656524	8656904	C.D.
8656965	8657305	Thunder
8680455	8682056	What do you want to say about Dead Island?
8705653	8714666	and then it's almost like an RPG because you can upgrade things but it's pretty interesting.
8715587	8721094	So like you might have a gun in Dead Island and heaven forbid you actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore?
8721815	8723877	What do you mean when you say artsy?
8741732	8747255	You know how, like, that trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion.
8747275	8749216	It was very artsy, like, the way they did it.
8749596	8753078	But, like, the game at the end of the day is a zombie first-person shooter, right?
8753258	8756080	Or is it, like, did they try to class it up a bit?
8756120	8757421	I don't know how to explain it.
8758021	8761923	Well, I didn't see the trailer, but it's very colorful.
8761943	8766986	I mean, it's set like a jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condo things.
8768187	8768307	Mm-hmm.
8769468	8771389	Well, how does it compare to other zombie games?
8771469	8773850	Is it as good or does it suck or what?
8774190	8787557	Well, I haven't actually played it, but it looks really good, but I think I might want to play it if I could.
8789098	8790359	I just assumed that he'd played it.
8790399	8791259	That's all right, that's all right.
8791279	8793520	All right, well, what do you want to say about Driver San Francisco?
8794101	8796782	Have you played Driver San Francisco or is this just like you want to?
8798411	8800192	It's like another want to thing.
8800272	8800892	All right.
8800972	8802733	Why do you want to play Driver San Francisco?
8802993	8812538	I've actually heard a lot of good things about Driver San Francisco, especially the multiplayer, which is interesting because the last Driver game I remember playing was Driver 3, which was lol.
8813218	8815199	Lol.
8815259	8815820	That game is fun.
8815860	8816060	All right.
8816080	8817460	What do you want to say about Driver San Francisco?
8820395	8829699	One of the things I really like about it is there's parts where your body is floating above the city and you go into other vehicles and you take over another person's body pretty much.
8830500	8835542	And when you talk, it's actually the person talking, but you're making them say whatever you want.
8836972	8838513	Isn't that the whole thing about Driver?
8838714	8840195	You get to possess people?
8840275	8844479	You kind of float from car to car and you could possess a cop car and all that stuff?
8844599	8845039	Off a cliff!
8845119	8845580	Off a cliff!
8845640	8846020	Off a cliff!
8846540	8848402	That's how you want to play, right?
8848502	8853867	There's a mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor.
8856843	8861944	So he had to make his heartbeat go up to this number of beats per second.
8862245	8870727	And he says stuff like, oh, if you stop doing this now, take 20% off your next driving lessons, which there will be a lot of.
8871847	8875228	Kevin68 in our chat says, Driver San Francisco is actually good.
8875508	8876949	Well, then why did they call it Driver?
8878029	8878469	I'm just kidding.
8878489	8884151	Well, because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around doing these different things, different missions.
8884651	8884831	Mm-hmm.
8886249	8888051	So, I think that's why it's called Driver.
8888231	8890713	Oh, okay, because it's that same concept that's been around since the beginning.
8890733	8893175	Because you can't get out of the car you're driving.
8893275	8895136	You're stuck in the car forever.
8896357	8901481	Until you drive it off cliff and then... Well, CD Thunder, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8901521	8902863	Any other games you're looking forward to?
8904164	8904244	Um...
8906161	8908984	There's one I'm really looking forward to, that Rise of Nightmares.
8910045	8911387	Mm-hmm.
8911447	8912348	Why Rise of Nightmares?
8913129	8916913	Because I like creepy games like House of the Dead and all that type of thing.
8918935	8922999	I'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan.
8923680	8924401	Yeah, a little bit.
8924521	8925242	Not completely.
8926543	8926984	All right.
8927004	8927064	And...
8930097	8934062	So I've only seen parts of it, but it's not actually that scary.
8934082	8937687	It might scare other people, but it's got very creepy atmospheres.
8938508	8939549	It's also incredibly gory.
8940090	8947459	Well, before we let you go, CD Thunder, I've got to let you go so we can get more calls, but we have folks in chat requesting, could we get a few bars of the Daytona theme song?
8948066	8955170	Day, Daytona, let's go racing, Daytona.
8955650	8956570	Beautiful, beautiful.
8956590	8957791	I liked it.
8957811	8959212	He had a little bit of vibrato in his voice.
8959252	8959692	I liked that.
8960512	8960772	Thank you.
8960933	8962153	All right, have a good one, buddy.
8962733	8963094	Thank you.
8963894	8965015	Suddenly I'm Simon Cowell.
8965155	8967336	You reminded me of something.
8967896	8968216	What's that?
8968456	8973139	There were some previews, people talking about Silent Hill Downpour and how terrible it is.
8973679	8974559	It got delayed to next year.
8975980	8977122	Interesting.
8977723	8979165	Won't make it for Halloween, huh?
8979185	8979806	No, it's terrible.
8980647	8982830	Well, if that's what they got to do to make it really good.
8982850	8983371	They got to polish it up.
8983391	8984092	That's why it's going next year.
8984112	8984552	You know what?
8984753	8985894	That's probably a good thing then.
8986415	8987877	At least that's what I've heard.
8987897	8992844	I haven't seen the official move yet, but yeah, it's next year.
8993635	8996417	Alright, let me get to this Avengers preview.
8996457	8998758	I've been making DarkSakura wait here for so long.
8998798	9000759	Let's take a look at this here.
9002100	9005041	This is some of the Avengers game that was cancelled.
9005261	9009323	So if this game looks cool to you, like this whole flying around as Iron Man, guess what?
9009343	9010224	You're never going to play it.
9011224	9015987	If you want to give us a call, by the way, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9016047	9016907	It's all first person.
9017748	9019709	Yeah, it'd probably make me throw up, but it looks pretty cool.
9020731	9021952	It might be fun to watch someone else play for a while.
9021972	9027035	Unfortunately, Sega's probably going to have a license for the Avengers game and it'll be a crappy brawler beat-em-up like the other games have been.
9027655	9031717	Actually, I would really like for them to do an Avengers game like they did Ultimate Alliance.
9032458	9034979	That would be really fun because I love Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
9035159	9039682	I do kind of like the way that they've done this where it's like you really become the superhero.
9039722	9041223	That's kind of neat.
9041243	9042623	And you fight Super Skrulls.
9043544	9046646	I'm trying to see if there's any other clips other than just the Iron Man.
9047266	9048046	Oh, there's Hulk.
9048086	9048987	Yeah, it's clear that's Hulk.
9050043	9050543	That's kind of neat.
9051263	9053184	With Captain America, you see the shield on one arm.
9053824	9054204	Very cool.
9054504	9055845	Thanks for sharing that with us, TigerClaw.
9055905	9060546	Let's go to one more tweet from TigerClaw at twitter.com slash OLR.
9060566	9062567	And I think this is sadly the last tweet we got tonight.
9063487	9066168	But this is about a... Oh, you guys will love this.
9066548	9067849	An Unreal Tournament 3 mod.
9070229	9071270	What they've modded on this?
9071831	9072551	Nyan Cat.
9073592	9076235	That's right, they've modded Nyan Cat in Unreal Tournament.
9076515	9079457	Hold on, because we're getting another call, but we'll come back to Nyan Cat in a little bit.
9079517	9080318	First, we got another call.
9080358	9081239	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
9081259	9081619	Who's this?
9083081	9084041	It's me.
9084061	9085263	Hi, me.
9085323	9087745	What would the listeners rather know you as?
9088445	9089186	Oh, whatever.
9089226	9090547	Miklatov, Shane.
9090887	9092829	Hi, Miklatov, Shane, whatever.
9093109	9094330	How about Shane Latov?
9094691	9095331	Shane Latov.
9095351	9097073	What did you call in to talk about tonight, Shane Latov?
9099200	9108247	I called in to talk about how awesome NeoWiz is and they released Tapsonic this week on the iPhone or iOS and it's really, really fun.
9108528	9109949	Oh yeah, I forgot to talk about that game.
9109989	9111650	I downloaded that on iPhone.
9112031	9112931	It's neat.
9113091	9114613	NeoWiz, what else do they make?
9114953	9115914	Because you said they're awesome.
9115934	9116534	DJ Max.
9117235	9118476	Oh, I didn't realize it's the same company.
9118636	9120318	They're partially responsible for that.
9120338	9124561	That's why you see a lot of DJ Max songs when you're actually playing Tapsonic.
9125182	9126663	One of the free songs is
9130136	9132558	I just thought it was because they were both Korean games.
9132759	9133119	I don't know.
9134500	9134921	Sure, sure.
9149544	9152985	Tell the listeners about this game a little bit for those that have no idea what TapSonic is.
9154465	9157426	The game is free to check out, sort of.
9157446	9159487	There's microtransactions at the butt in the game, right?
9161768	9166069	If you want to play for real, you have to use those microtransactions.
9166949	9175592	Because, as I was unaware, when you spend... If you were one of the first 1,000 people that downloaded it, you got 300 million points.
9177376	9203559	and use those music points to purchase songs or so I thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's awesome I go back later I can just get a preview because I'm out of points wow that's kind of shitty though I gotta say I don't like that but I noticed the free songs rotate what's that?
9205306	9207046	I'd be okay with it if it was cheaper.
9207426	9214528	I guess the Korean version, our rates for song purchases are four times what they are in Korea.
9214648	9216348	So we're really getting screwed here.
9216648	9217688	That's a little ridiculous.
9217768	9219869	I can't recommend it past the free songs for that.
9219889	9221789	But it's worth to check out the free version for the free songs.
9222029	9223229	The free songs rotate.
9223309	9224510	That's one thing I noticed.
9224590	9228850	I had a song show up the first day that I wanted to play again, and now it was a pay song.
9229110	9230551	And a different song had showed up instead.
9230571	9231771	So I think they rotate a little bit.
9232887	9233628	Oh really?
9233868	9234909	I haven't noticed that yet.
9234969	9235769	I've only seen the same free songs.
9235789	9236690	Yeah, I'll probably do that.
9236750	9237290	I do love it.
9257822	9264866	It kind of looks like a sound Voltex if you're following Konami games, in a way.
9265727	9273492	Because it's got that Guitar Hero Hallway-style notes falling at you, and, well, I guess that's really about it.
9274573	9275213	And it's musical.
9276737	9305739	so would you recommend people check out Tapsonic or no it's too damn expensive even though it's free to at least play the Mozart songs awesome I would say download the free thing and if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying 30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you'd probably get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end so it's not so bad alright well any other games you want to mention
9307985	9309565	Um, I don't think so.
9310266	9310986	I don't remember.
9311286	9313626	I only called to talk about that since you failed to.
9313946	9317987	Alright, well, I'm sorry, so just shame on me forever.
9318147	9320008	You should be, pretty much.
9320208	9322688	Before we let you go, Miklatov, can we get a few bars of Daytona?
9322868	9324969	No, no, no, no.
9324989	9326369	I don't even know that song.
9326509	9327910	What, do-do-do-do-do-do?
9327950	9328630	How hard is that?
9328950	9330130	How hard is do-do-do-do-do-do?
9330150	9331950	You're my hero for not playing along.
9335074	9335915	No, it's cool.
9336035	9338336	I'm not going to make that big a fool out of myself.
9338396	9340238	I'll let other people that call in do that.
9340838	9341339	You suck.
9342920	9343180	Yeah.
9343660	9348924	So since you refused to play along with the Daytona, you're going to get a failure noise.
9352226	9352987	That's the chat room.
9353007	9353467	Thanks to you.
9354248	9354668	There you go.
9354908	9355709	That's okay.
9356269	9356810	I don't mind.
9356870	9357750	I'll give you a golden wow.
9357770	9359271	I'd rather do that than make noise.
9359732	9359952	All right.
9360352	9361313	Bye, Miklatov.
9362554	9362954	Goodbye.
9363328	9364828	Watch how he dies though
9387461	9389402	Oh, Nancat survival not guaranteed.
9389882	9391763	High quality rainbow trail.
9392483	9396545	Just watch this when they actually nail him.
9396565	9397846	He explodes in color.
9398046	9399887	He explodes in a barf of color.
9400147	9400507	Love it.
9400827	9402067	It's fantastic.
9402127	9402808	Let's go to the phones.
9402828	9403788	We got more calls coming in.
9403848	9404769	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9404789	9405149	Who's this?
9407650	9411632	Hey, it's... You're breaking up a little bit.
9411672	9412572	I'll give you another shot there.
9412612	9413232	Hey, who's this?
9413533	9413933	What's your name?
9414855	9415736	It's CinderWolf.
9416016	9416556	Much better.
9416616	9417697	Hey, CinderWolf, what's on your mind?
9418838	9419659	Not too much.
9420299	9424783	I just, you know, thought I'd call in first night I'm listening to the podcast and really loving it.
9425183	9426104	Great job so far.
9426324	9427205	Thank you very much.
9427805	9428486	Appreciate it.
9428526	9429246	What's on your mind?
9429266	9430888	What do you think of the stories we've been talking about tonight?
9431926	9434049	The stories today have been great.
9434150	9443083	It's awesome watching and listening to the conversation moving from side to side, top to top, going all over the place.
9443143	9444325	I find it's really laid back.
9444365	9446988	I'm really impressed with the setup you guys have going on here.
9447449	9448210	Well, thank you so much.
9448630	9453074	It's almost like he called just to inflate our egos tonight, and I really appreciate that.
9453174	9457218	I already have a headache because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego.
9458720	9459160	Well, no, it is.
9459340	9463524	Hopefully it's not going to get too much larger than the studio.
9464105	9466127	This isn't a very big room.
9466747	9468028	Yeah, I know, right?
9469429	9476491	I think it's important to note, if folks have only ever listened to the podcast feed and never joined us for a live show, the chatroom is a lot of fun.
9476511	9479711	And even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat than it usually is.
9480251	9480791	Stupid Emmys.
9481132	9482412	Yeah, stupid Emmys.
9483172	9491154	The topic will sometimes be about the show, but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things to look at.
9491194	9492874	It's almost like its own little stumble upon.
9493354	9493854	or Tumblr.
9493894	9494614	Exactly.
9494674	9498135	It's kind of like a domino effect of just sheer awesomeness.
9499516	9499896	Absolutely.
9500156	9509598	In fact, right now, somebody is asking for the Nyan Cat video, so I said I would link that to me, Rob, and I'll put it on the Tumblr because we're putting stuff on the Tumblr now.
9509819	9511159	Oh, of course, of course.
9511199	9511439	Hold on.
9511559	9512999	So that people will visit our Tumblr.
9513059	9513399	There you go.
9513480	9513700	All right.
9514660	9515180	You get both.
9516020	9520982	Well, what do you think about 3DS versus Vita, Cinderwolf, since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight?
9521042	9522322	Are you a 3DS owner by chance?
9523690	9525811	Actually, I'm not an owner of the 3DS.
9526092	9530954	I've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times through colleagues, coworkers down at the office.
9531395	9532615	I'm really liking it.
9533616	9541740	I do love the option of adjusting the intensity of the 3D feature just because it's accommodating to everybody.
9542081	9547824	The people that typically suffer from things like headaches or migraines with the 3D technology
9548690	9553271	So Nintendo definitely made a great choice in adding that intensity feature.
9554112	9558513	You can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache.
9558733	9560393	To like slurpy headache.
9560413	9566795	I was going to say, going from migraine headaches to I drank a slurpy too fast headache.
9567115	9567856	You know, that type of thing.
9568816	9569236	Exactly.
9571032	9572013	Well, what about the Vita, though?
9572033	9573374	Because the Vita's coming out pretty soon.
9574615	9577317	I don't know if you're a PSP owner or if you're into Sony stuff.
9577337	9579238	What do you think about what Sony's doing over there?
9579838	9587683	Well, I do like Sony's hardware and even Sony's gaming repertoire, but I'm not particularly a fan of their marketing mode.
9587823	9592266	I mean, they tend to wait for the competition to see what they can improve on, and that's always a great strategy.
9592747	9597710	But I find that because they're not trying to stay ahead
9598409	9604511	in the push everything out first mode, I think they're losing a lot of the possible potential fan base.
9605631	9619255	What I mentioned earlier in the chat room was that Sony waited for Microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have been more 360 consoles sold than the Sony PlayStation 3s.
9620456	9624337	Xbox seems to have that much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to
9624827	9625428	Except in Japan.
9625448	9626169	Except in Japan.
9633829	9636390	Well, yeah, I suppose that is kind of true.
9638071	9653179	But I find that, you know, comparing the 360 repertoire to the PlayStation, you know, there really are maybe only five or six games so far, say for the PS3, for example, I'm really interested in that I haven't had a chance to play yet.
9653999	9661322	But, you know, it seems like Microsoft is hawking, you know, a new game every week that seems to be catching my and Eric's attention too.
9661343	9662063	Mm-hmm.
9663495	9666358	so I'm feeling it'll be similar with the Vita
9683714	9686855	Let me ask you one other quick question since you are a first time caller of the show.
9687355	9690036	What was that?
9690236	9692156	I always ask this of listeners.
9692236	9695537	This kind of helps me understand what kind of a gamer our listeners are.
9695977	9702379	What would you say is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one, one of your favorite video games of all time?
9704263	9716279	Um, favorite game of all time right now, it's an old game, I think it was released back in 1990 on the TurboGrafx-16 console by NEC, it was called Newtopia 2.
9718020	9722123	It was sort of NEC and Hudson Soft's attempt at a Zelda killer.
9722584	9725186	The TurboGrafx released a year before the Super Nintendo console.
9726007	9731672	And it really has a lot of the traditional RPG elements in it, like the old Zelda games.
9731972	9736096	You know, great soundtrack too, even more so than, say, the old Zelda games.
9736956	9741499	and I don't know, I find it a fun run right from start to finish.
9741879	9746502	You can do it in a handful of hours, five, six hours, but it's just very addicting I find.
9746942	9749063	I absolutely remember the Nootopia series.
9749103	9750624	Haven't you covered that on the show before, DarkSakura?
9750644	9751145	I could be wrong.
9751305	9752525	I have indeed covered Nootopia.
9752726	9754767	So yeah, it's good times.
9754987	9757748	So one of the highlights of the TurboGrafx-16.
9758529	9763472	I think you brought up TurboGrafx in chat earlier, so you must have been a big fan many years ago.
9765110	9765711	Actually, I did.
9765871	9770314	See, growing up, my family, you know, we didn't have the standard Nintendo or Super Nintendo console.
9770614	9776378	Dad had the old ColecoVision and Ataris, and then we jumped right into the TurboGrafx mode sort of deal.
9776438	9778639	So I kind of grew up playing a lot of that.
9779500	9785424	And actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago, so it's soaked up to the HDTV.
9785484	9785844	Nice.
9786344	9787445	Have you had a duo before?
9790004	9791565	No, I haven't, actually.
9791725	9796746	I've wanted to find one, but other costs and other bills are kind of trumping that right now.
9797187	9806550	Well, I can tell you right now, if you're looking to play any of the imports, that it actually is going to... We had some converter, but the converters hardly ever work.
9807270	9809051	But you can get the core graphics really cheap.
9810491	9811671	Yeah, that is true.
9812071	9825814	Yeah, and I mean, although I do like the idea of the duo, it's kind of funny, my little brother back home actually hooked me up with a lot of the old ROMs and emulators, actually, that I can just, you know, I play on my own time here.
9826154	9826934	It's the Magic Engine?
9828815	9830315	Yes, actually.
9830495	9834796	I use the Magic Engine actually for all the TurboGrafx games that are out there so far, so...
9836237	9839518	Well, you have a fan in chat because GameGuru says Newtopia is awesome!
9839738	9840798	Newtopia is pretty cool.
9840878	9842059	Yeah, it's a good series.
9842299	9843119	I've played it once, too.
9843559	9847880	There's just a number, if you're really into TurboGrafx, there's a number of duo games that you've got to check out.
9850301	9851361	I'm pretty sure there were two.
9851441	9857463	Actually, my younger brother back home, a bit more of a classic-slash-hardcore old school gamer than myself...
9858604	9860765	He's constantly telling me about the older titles that he's finding.
9861865	9870128	But just one of the funniest things that might actually throw you guys off, that the one game on Utopia 2, the actual copy on eBay, $256.
9870828	9871488	You're kidding me.
9872589	9872789	Nope.
9873349	9875850	Is that like just the HuCard?
9876650	9878591	Is that just the HuCard or like with everything?
9879737	9886544	That's the original CD case that came in on the HuCard itself, the little game booklet, everything.
9886664	9889467	It's used, obviously, but yeah, $256.
9889948	9891750	Wow, I think we got ours in a stack of games.
9893289	9899636	Oh yeah, well, I'm sure my dad's going to kick himself in the ass when he finds out what it's going for, because I think we paid five bucks for it back in the day.
9899976	9900437	I bet.
9900697	9901618	Good gosh.
9901838	9902159	All right.
9902559	9908686	Well, I let this call go on a little long, but that's okay, because he's a first-time caller, so those of you that call every week can just deal.
9909046	9911709	But before I let you go, can we get a few bars at Daytona?
9913690	9915471	Alright, alright, alright.
9915711	9919572	I can only do the beginning because, again, I never decided to play the game.
9919592	9921013	Never really peaked my interest back in the day.
9921373	9924834	But from what I heard, it's Daytona!
9924974	9926034	You know, that's about it.
9926995	9928335	That was kind of the jazzy version.
9928575	9929756	It's Daytona!
9929916	9931076	It's kind of a little bit jazzy.
9931116	9932297	Alright, I like that.
9932517	9932877	A+.
9933017	9937659	Alright, well thank you so much for your call and thanks for enjoying the show and tuning in live and all that good stuff.
9937699	9938779	So, thanks so much.
9940041	9943023	I'll be around for the foreseeable future, guys.
9943043	9944023	So thanks for letting me stay on.
9944384	9944764	Awesome.
9945664	9946205	Take it easy.
9946465	9946945	Take care, buddy.
9948706	9953629	We love Canadians, and we love... Clearly, I mentioned he was from Canada earlier.
9953649	9954770	He's in the chat.
9954790	9955470	That's Cinderwolf?
9955530	9956651	His accent was Canadian, too.
9956691	9956871	Yeah.
9958292	9960433	And we love TurboGrafx fans, too.
9960533	9962534	So very, very cool.
9963151	9963771	DarkSakura.com
9987709	9988990	So what the heck?
9989111	9989971	Let's do this one.
9990111	9992354	It's a mod that he sent us.
9992854	9994876	It's Super Pixel Brothers.
9995517	9996457	I guess what is this?
9996798	10000681	It's a playable Super Mario Brothers, but it's only 64 pixels?
10002603	10007806	I guess it's an 8x8 LED board that does Super Mario Bros.
10007866	10010828	But I can't imagine this at all looks pretty.
10010908	10012630	Like it's gotta be terrible.
10012710	10013050	Let's see.
10013090	10014271	I want to see what this looks like here.
10014991	10019474	So I'm trying to load up the video in chat, but it's... Here we go.
10019494	10019814	There we go.
10022608	10032130	You get points for hitting blocks, and under certain blocks, and I've actually made it random, you get 5 points, whereas just normal blocks you get 2.
10035509	10037751	Now another feature I've added is Firepower.
10037931	10039872	Different colored blocks.
10039932	10045816	I don't think it's literally the Nintendo ROM, but it looks like somebody made their own version of it.
10047117	10053962	Imagine one of those old school LED games where there's only so many places you can have a cutout.
10054943	10063529	It's basically these colored lights and the little Mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and jump on top of things.
10064589	10068292	I gotta say, this is much more impressive than what I was thinking it was going to look like.
10068752	10070294	And these levels are... It's sad.
10070374	10073496	I recognize these levels based off of the real game.
10074176	10075778	It's been translated really well.
10076578	10079600	So that's... I gotta say, that's pretty cool.
10080641	10081182	Yeah, not bad.
10081562	10084244	So I guess, DarkSakura, I got one more link for you.
10085185	10085445	Okay.
10085705	10088507	So why don't you go post that on the Tumblrs.
10089208	10091429	People who are watching Tumblr are going to say, it blew up tonight.
10092730	10093050	Alright.
10094474	10096235	Well, that does it for the Twitter tonight.
10096535	10102619	And before we wrap up the show, I always like to check in with Loki and DarkSakura and see if they have any last-minute stories.
10104280	10104460	No.
10106081	10106461	Not really.
10107001	10107241	Wow.
10107261	10112744	I mean, there is an Overclocked Remix album I think someone made for Mega Man 9.
10113445	10120889	It's all guitar and metal versions of the song, so I believe that's free to download on the Overclocked Remix site.
10121303	10123365	Overclock puts out some good stuff, so that's good.
10123625	10125647	Good to hear.
10126547	10129830	Well, that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10130210	10135034	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and supporting it and telling friends about the show.
10135054	10135995	That's what we really appreciate.
10137304	10139025	We don't have a big budget behind this show.
10139125	10142407	We don't have commercials and what have you.
10142768	10146870	All we ask, if you enjoyed Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
10147391	10151093	And if you're like, but I have no friends to tell about the show, then tell an enemy.
10151313	10154415	Or you can leave us a nice review on iTunes.
10154756	10156037	Help us spread the word around the internet.
10156077	10158018	That whole nomination for podcast award thing I was talking about.
10158278	10159259	Just help us spread the word.
10159279	10160119	That's all we ask.
10160580	10166123	And we'll get more listeners next week, just like we had Cinderwolf tonight, who seemed to enjoy this program very much.
10166203	10166924	So thank you very much.
10167684	10171949	Before we wrap it up, though, for good, I need to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10172349	10173530	So, let's see.
10173570	10174611	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
10174631	10175352	What's your final thought?
10175919	10178600	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
10178981	10183123	I want to know why my scroll lock button keeps turning on when I don't press anything to turn on my scroll lock
10206257	10207857	It's one of those great mysteries of space.
10208277	10209218	The world may never know.
10209358	10209778	I'm in space.
10210958	10211398	That does it.
10211418	10213419	Thank you guys so much for downloading us.
10213679	10215579	I will see you in like three weeks.
10215739	10216959	Oh my God, that's kind of sad.
10217539	10219460	Sorry guys, but I'll be having fun.
10219840	10224021	But DarkSakura and Loki will be back here next week with Tiara to bring you more gaming news.
10224181	10228302	So tune in and we'll do it all again in one more week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
