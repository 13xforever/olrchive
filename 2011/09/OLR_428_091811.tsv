0	20020	Today, September 18th, 2011, Nintendo reveals the future of the 3DS and its pink.
20020	24620	The PlayStation Vita preps many games for launch, and Sony adds a controversial new
24620	31620	section to the PSN terms of service.
31620	35580	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35580	39660	where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39660	44760	My name is Rob Roberts and joining you live here on this September 18th, 2011 for episode
44760	50860	number 428 with my co-hosts, first off, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie
50860	51860	Summers.
51860	54360	We're also the show where every gamer has access to chicken.
54360	55460	You can ask him if you want.
55460	56460	I see.
56460	57460	Yes.
57460	58460	Dark Sakura's eating chicken.
58460	61320	Tech master Loki is in the house over here as well and he's eating chicken.
61320	62320	Yeah.
62320	63320	And I am chickenless.
63320	64320	But I do have-
64320	65320	You can have some chicken.
65320	66320	I do.
66320	67320	No, it's okay.
67320	68320	I actually don't really want chicken.
68320	69320	I have a pumpkin spice frappuccino.
69320	70320	So I'm good.
70320	71320	I had a pumpkin spice latte.
71320	74660	I had one of those brunches that was so big, like I'm still full.
74660	76980	So I'm just like, I'm not even hungry.
76980	77980	It's weird.
77980	78980	I can't explain it.
78980	79980	Okay.
79980	80980	Anyhow.
80980	84580	By the way, I'm still laughing my ass off over that Cracked article.
84580	86340	Which was, what is this article you were reading about?
86340	91420	It was one of those little photo shop things where they do rejected book covers and one
91420	94740	of them was, it's okay to be a douchebag by Ayn Rand.
94740	97460	You know what's interesting about that website is they have really made, you know, I'm not
97460	98460	knocking it.
98460	99460	This is just what I've noticed about them.
99460	102660	An observation, if you will, they really seem to have made a name for themselves.
102660	106500	I always thought, wasn't Cracked like a magazine, like the answer to Mad Magazine like 20 years
106500	107500	ago?
107500	108500	I think so.
108500	109500	It was Mad Magazine Lite.
109500	110500	Does that still exist?
110500	111500	Mad Magazine.
111500	112500	I don't even know.
112500	115540	But now what I notice is that Cracked is on like dig in those websites all the time because
115540	118740	it's like they specialize in top 10 lists or something like that.
118740	119740	I think it's awesome.
119740	121460	That's all they do is like lists.
121460	123500	I'm going to do one for them.
123500	125020	Do they take user submitted articles?
125020	129100	They, well they do, but they also, the better, like the better that they are, like they'll
129100	130980	start paying you for them or something.
130980	131980	There you go.
131980	132980	Okay, cool.
132980	133980	New industry for you.
133980	137480	Hey, I want you to join our chat room at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
137480	141920	We do tape our show live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
141920	147060	live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
147060	150760	Although to be fair, Bobby had the night off tonight, but nevermind if you're listening
150760	154300	on the podcast and you've never heard a live show before, he'll be back next week.
154300	157380	So again, if you are listening to us live at All Games Radio though, join us in the
157380	158380	chat room.
158380	163140	Again, that's chat.orangelaungeradio.com where we do often read comments from chat tonight,
163140	167660	which actually I got to admit, chats a little more dead than I usually see it.
167660	171060	And I don't know if that's just, we didn't have a lead in tonight cause Bobby was off
171060	173140	or is it the Emmys?
173140	174880	Like is everybody off watching the Emmys?
174880	175880	Like I know that's our competition.
175880	178600	We are always up against some stupid award show.
178600	183280	Like Sunday night is like the night to have an award show in Hollywood and et cetera.
183280	184280	And tonight it's the Emmys.
184280	185280	The shmemmys.
185280	188940	I don't know the Emmys or whatever.
188940	190620	I barely watch any TV.
190620	195020	I can't wait till it's over so I can see Kathy Griffin's roast of the Emmys.
195020	196500	Is that a thing she does now?
196500	200340	She's doing something now where she like bashes the Emmys when it's over.
200340	204100	Didn't she get all that hate mail one year cause she said something at the Emmys?
204100	206660	She said, Jesus has nothing to do with me winning this award.
206660	207660	Oh yeah, yeah.
207660	208660	Oh boy.
208660	209660	All right.
209660	210660	Crazy lady.
210660	211660	Uh, anyhow.
211660	215180	Uh, also speaking of Emmys, actually Emmys kind of had me thinking about like video game
215180	219660	television today and kind of like how, you know, I don't think we'll ever see a video
219660	223660	game show nominated for an Emmy, although I'm sure there's some type of technical award
223660	224660	or something.
224660	229780	Some has won, but what part of the shmemmys, what is it about video game TV?
229780	233660	Like why hasn't there really been a lot of good video game TV?
233660	238740	And I know, I know some folks out there are fans of X play and some folks might be fans
238740	240580	of attack of the show, although I don't know.
240580	243660	I don't even know if attack of the show is really like a gaming show anymore, more than
243660	249340	it is just like a testosterone filled young guys kind of show.
249340	250340	I don't know.
250340	254820	Like the last video game show I remember myself getting really excited about was Nick arcade.
254820	258540	Like that was an awesome or star K do you want to go like way back back in the eighties
258540	261000	like the video game game shows.
261000	262000	So I don't know.
262000	266220	Are there any video game TV shows you guys have ever been into or are into?
266220	273000	I was, um, I watched that one and I can never remember the name of it where, um, they would
273000	280020	send the team through this like labyrinth with, uh, these Velcro vests and they would
280020	281540	attach the prizes to their vest.
281540	283260	I vaguely remember that.
283260	284260	Yeah.
284260	285260	Yeah.
285260	286260	Yeah.
286260	287260	And it was on Saturday morning after my cartoons.
287260	291880	So I would watch it all the time and I was like, you can't stick a turbo graphics to
291880	293300	your front, put it on your back.
293300	294980	They were empty boxes.
294980	298340	Probably it was just props or something like that, but I needed to grab games and stuff
298340	299340	and it was pretty cool.
299340	300340	Yeah.
300340	301660	I know what you're talking about.
301660	306580	I can't remember the name of it was, um, that was like something like labyrinth or something.
306580	309940	But no, it wasn't that it was, it had this guy.
309940	312780	I'm sure somebody in chat was probably JD Ross.
312780	316400	He's in every goddamn eighties game show.
316400	317740	Do you know what he's done now?
317740	318740	Thank you.
318740	319740	Wikipedia.
319740	320740	Do you know what he does now?
320740	321740	The big show that he's a producer, right?
321740	324940	Yeah, he's a producer, but there's a really big show on TV that he, you can thank him
324940	325940	for.
325940	328420	The biggest loser is his thing.
328420	330220	Well, how appropriate for him.
330220	335180	There was another show that was on to that he will always be fun house to me.
335180	336180	I'm sorry.
336180	337180	Okay.
337180	338180	That's what it was fun.
338180	339180	No way.
339180	340180	It wasn't fun.
340180	341180	The fun house was like the double dare turned up to 11.
341180	346540	Um, but it was also, um, well you remember that, that show, what was it?
346540	349980	The quest of the kingdom or something that, but that's not one of the thing of, there's
349980	355140	another guy who had Brown hair, he'd always wear like a member's only jacket.
355140	356140	This was the eighties.
356140	357140	Is that John Davidson?
357140	360180	Wasn't he on Hollywood squares?
360180	364660	He sat in a chair that looked a lot like captain Kirk's chair.
364660	370180	And I remember the show very much because they did a big special on the Neo Geo and
370180	373940	about taking the cards and switching them out, you know, putting them in the machine,
373940	377320	saving your game and coming home and playing it at home.
377320	381780	And I, for the life of me, I cannot remember what the name of the show was.
381780	384740	Let me ask this question while you guys try to think of the show or while the chatters
384740	387300	that shout it out.
387300	392540	Why, why is it that video game, video power, why is it that video game television hasn't
392540	393540	really seemed to work?
393540	397200	And I mean, there, there has been a few exceptions, like, you know, I know some of you guys dig
397200	398200	X play.
398200	401140	I know there's that show on spike TV that gets to break a lot of exclusives.
401140	404300	The one that Jeff Keeley does, you know, there's been a few things here and there, but like,
404300	408580	you know, G4 TV was supposed to be all about video games, but you know, it didn't work
408580	412660	cause it went like this whole different direction where it's aimed towards young guys.
412660	416260	Like is it just that, you know, we're too busy wanting to play video games, then watch
416260	418440	people talk about it on the TV?
418440	421320	Like why doesn't it work?
421320	425080	It's because it's too niche of an audience and it's hard for them to convince people
425080	430040	to sponsor the shows or put advertisements on the show because they're not getting as
430040	435260	many views as normal, especially in nowadays, you know, it's kind of irrelevant to have
435260	440180	a video game show unless you can lock in those kinds of exclusive interviews and sneak peeks
440180	445920	and stuff like that, that you can't do on the internet because you know, internet's
445920	451700	faster than TV or print media and that's just the way it is unless they're breaking news.
451700	452700	That's kind of the way it goes.
452700	455140	I'm positive one of them was video power.
455140	457140	You know, we have a story coming up later tonight.
457140	461620	I'm not going to totally get into it now, but you know, one of the big consoles is launching
461620	465180	a TV related thing and we'll talk more about that later.
465180	468460	But that does kind of seem to be like the future, especially when we talk a lot about
468460	474620	like a video on demand and how huge Netflix and Hulu and all that stuff has been on PlayStation
474620	476380	as well as Xbox.
476380	480780	And do you think it's possible that as these consoles become more like entertainment devices,
480780	484380	like almost for some people may be replacing cable someday.
484380	485380	I don't know.
485380	488420	Do you think we'll see more gaming related content on those consoles?
488420	493340	Well, yeah, if it's on a console, I can imagine that they're going to try to put some gaming
493340	494740	related content on there.
494740	498980	They'll probably feel like infomercials more than anything like kind of like the, you know,
498980	502940	majors minute on Xbox 360 is as nice as that is.
502940	503940	Let's let's be real.
503940	506780	It's just a product awareness thing for for Microsoft, right?
506780	507780	Yeah.
507780	512820	Well, I'm trying to find there is an article I saw talking about some new video game shows
512820	517180	coming and it was by the guy that did like The Room or something like that.
517180	520860	Not Silent Hill The Room, but like actually like the horrible cult movie The Room.
520860	521860	Yes.
521860	522860	The horrible cult movie.
522860	523860	It's actually him.
523860	524860	Yeah.
524860	525860	And it looks so fucking terrible.
525860	529500	I can't remember what the parody or it's a joke or something.
529500	531300	I don't think it is all to take too seriously.
531300	532820	I am your something.
532820	533820	Interesting.
533820	534820	I don't remember what it was.
534820	536380	It's just retarded for the record.
536380	539620	The show, both shows I was thinking of is actually the same show, but different seasons
539620	541820	of it.
541820	544660	It's video power, video power because it started off as like a tip show and then it became
544660	545660	a game show.
545660	546660	Oh yeah.
546660	547660	I remember that one.
547660	548660	Yeah.
548660	549660	It was like game show.
549660	550660	It had tips.
550660	551660	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
551660	552660	But no, it started off I think it's just tips.
552660	553660	Interesting.
553660	554660	And it was like 1990, 1991.
554660	555660	I thought it was earlier than that.
555660	556660	Yeah.
556660	557660	It was like in the mid 80s.
557660	558660	I'm going to double check.
558660	559660	I don't know.
559660	560660	Um, let's see.
560660	561660	What else do I want to say?
561660	567660	Oh, Oh, I know what I wanted to say about like television on the consoles and so forth.
567660	571700	Like this, this is still a sore point for me to this day.
571700	572700	1992.
572700	573700	Wow.
573700	574700	Was it really?
574700	575940	In two different formats from 1990 through 92.
575940	576940	Gosh.
576940	577940	I'm, I'm with Dan in the other room.
577940	579340	I thought it was way earlier than that.
579340	582620	Of course Wikipedia is always right 100% of the time, right?
582620	584220	Directed by Stevie Piskoski.
584220	586300	I'm going to double check IMDB.
586300	588860	Um, let me, let me hit on this.
588860	592340	I want to mention this and that is, you know, one thing that I think would have made an
592340	600420	awesome television show would have been, um, the one versus 100 on Xbox 360.
600420	605580	Like I really feel like Microsoft was sitting on a gold mine with that and they let it go.
605580	609500	And I don't know if it's because of licensing reasons or what have you, but man, I know
609500	611380	so many people that were so into that.
611380	613000	It's really weird that they let it go.
613000	617600	And it really made me think like, why hasn't like game show network tried to pick up like
617600	620380	an actual game show that runs through consoles or something?
620380	621380	I don't know.
621380	622380	All right.
622380	623380	I found it.
623380	628260	It's called the Tommy Wee Show and it's featuring Tommy Wiseau.
628260	635460	And basically it's supposed to be this weird, I don't know, uh, they're saying it's, it's
635460	638940	going to be, um, presented by Makima.
638940	646060	And it's basically, it follows him as he repeatedly gets abducted by different races of mysterious
646060	651060	aliens transported to distant planets where he's forced to test popular video games.
651060	656900	So it's, it's a terrible idea ripped off of Mystery Science Theater 3000 with this guy
656900	660460	that looks like he's the undertaker or something like that.
660460	661460	It's just ridiculous.
661460	662460	I don't know.
662460	664660	Hey, guess what?
664660	665660	No one care.
665660	666660	All right.
666660	670340	So the screen, like where the screen freezes, he looks like he's about to throw up or you
670340	671980	know, fall asleep or something or both.
671980	675300	It's wherever this, that guy is very strange.
675300	676300	Anyhow.
676300	681700	Um, yeah, so I'm, I'm a little upset that, that Microsoft kind of let that thing go,
681700	683780	but I guess it wasn't very profitable for them or whatever.
683780	687180	They're probably losing money on it, but I think they should still revisit it at some
687180	688180	point.
688180	691380	Oh, one other, uh, we'll get into our gaming weeks here in a minute, but one other like
691380	697020	game slash TV related thing that I can think of that I know is coming soon is the whole,
697020	702540	um, uh, sci-fi TV show that's supposed to be like tied into an MMO.
702540	704060	Like I can't, I just, it popped in my head.
704060	705660	It was something I think they had talked about at E3.
705660	706820	Do you remember anything about that?
706820	707820	Loki?
707820	708820	It was like some time.
708820	709820	I know what you're talking about, but I don't know what the hell it's called.
709820	712660	And nor do I care.
712660	713660	It's a sci-fi show.
713660	715660	I mean, come on.
715660	719820	Um, one game series that I actually watched while there was a bunch of old ones, you know,
719820	724140	back in the eighties and nineties and stuff, game shows, you know, for sure.
724140	733020	Um, but I watched, um, well X play when, um, or extended play back when it was, you know,
733020	735820	tech TV, I used to watch that all the time.
735820	740460	Um, even next play, I used to watch it when it was G4 tech TV.
740460	747060	Um, and then of course, Starrcade, which was, you know, rerun like hell on that network
747060	750900	before it started sucking, um, and they got rid of it.
750900	755460	Um, what was the other one that was, yeah, portal was kind of lame.
755460	757060	They had that on there.
757060	761820	Um, I just watched all the online reviews now.
761820	765500	It's called Dave, where you go running around in MMOs and they do mock you.
765500	768260	Wasn't that the one that Wil Wheaton hosted or was that?
768260	769260	No.
769260	770260	Oh.
770260	776300	I just really watch YouTube like, like the Angry Video Game Nerd and you know, uh, crap.
776300	779740	What's that other one that you watch?
779740	780740	Classic Game Room.
780740	781740	Classic Game Room is pretty cool.
781740	782740	Maybe that's it.
782740	786660	Everybody's turning to YouTube now and amateur programming such as, uh, the show you're listening
786660	791060	to right now, although we're more radio than TV, but hey, we have a YouTube channel.
791060	792980	We just don't like really do anything with it.
792980	794220	There you go.
794220	799820	So I use mind of post pic, uh, videos of Shermy and, uh, my best friend's son.
799820	800820	Hmm.
800820	806220	I post grants that thought of related videos and one video that had an uploaded trailer.
806220	809300	So I can link it on a newsletter I was doing.
809300	813460	Funny enough, that trailer got more comments than most of my other videos I put on there
813460	816260	because it's some really crappy hunting game.
816260	818860	Hey, you know what?
818860	819860	I don't care if it sucks.
819860	821620	I had to put the trailer up there.
821620	822620	All right.
822620	827140	Tiger call mentioned, um, something about a Gun Stringer game that was put out by Troma.
827140	829340	You know what Troma did, right?
829340	830340	Toxic Avenger movies.
830340	834060	I was gonna say they do all the like really campy B movie stuff, like Troma and Juliet
834060	835260	and stuff, right?
835260	836460	It's just, it's SARS.
836460	837460	What's his name from?
837460	838460	Troma.
838460	842460	Um, Lloyd McCoffin or Kaufman or whatever.
842460	843460	He's in there.
843460	844460	Um, yeah.
844460	845460	All right.
845460	852100	Let's stop trying to get into the stories that we make up for later on bastard.
852100	853100	Let's move.
853100	854100	You listen, you don't control the show.
854100	855100	Okay.
855100	856100	Now I don't care.
856100	857760	We don't, I don't think we're even talking about that tonight.
857760	858760	Let's move on.
858760	859760	Let's talk about our gaming week.
859760	862860	So I always like to start off the show talking about what kind of games we've been playing
862860	863860	this week.
863860	864860	Dark soccer.
864860	865860	Wow.
865860	866860	Wow.
866860	868820	As in the worlds of Warcrafts.
868820	869820	Wow.
869820	870820	Nerd.
870820	871820	Wow.
871820	872820	You're a nerd and sound get a life and Sims.
872820	874820	I've been playing Sims three.
874820	875820	Okay.
875820	881780	And um, I played some tiny tower and of course these are all the same games I play, but I
881780	885220	like to make and I played as Espa galuda.
885220	890140	I can never say it as blue to two on my phone.
890140	892180	Did you check out radiant silver gun on X-Box yet?
892180	893380	That seems like something will be up your alley.
893380	899500	I know that came out this week got like, but don't you want to see the super Uber HD version
899500	900500	prettiness?
900500	901500	I don't think that we got it yet.
901500	902500	Now that I think about it.
902500	903500	Yeah, that came.
903500	905820	I just, I was thinking to you when I saw that on X-Box live the other day, I was like, oh,
905820	907340	I want to play the crap out of that.
907340	911500	Well, I was actually going to sit down and play, um, some, uh, symphony of the night
911500	915300	today, but I've had a bad headache for most of the day.
915300	917060	Damn Dracula causing those migraines.
917060	918060	Yeah.
918060	919380	Damn him.
919380	923500	It is not by my hand that I was once again given my migraine.
923500	924500	Loki.
924500	925500	How was your gaming week?
925500	926500	Um, it was all right.
926500	928340	Didn't really play a whole lot of stuff.
928340	933500	Um, mainly just three things, uh, earth defense force, insect Armageddon, played lots of that.
933500	942540	Uh, I think I have my jet guy now almost level seven, um, and Grand Theft Auto, we went back
942540	947260	to Lawson Dam again cause they got, they got tired of getting punked in, um, Battle of
947260	951500	the Gay Tony, so now they're getting punked in Lawson Dam, so, you know, mixing it up
951500	953700	a bit, I guess.
953700	961140	Um, and then I played Zelda on, um, virtual console on the 3DS, so I've been playing that
961140	962140	right now.
962140	970980	I'm on the fifth dungeon, and, um, it's, it's fun, um, you know, the virtual console stuff's
970980	974640	all right, but it does make you realize one thing, and I don't know if anyone's really
974640	981940	covered it before, I'm sure they have, um, but, man, that D-pad, I mean Nintendo is known
981940	985700	for pretty good D-pads, you know, especially with the NES and stuff like that, you know,
985700	994140	great D-pad, or, no, I think pretty flawlessly, but that D-pad on that 3DS is terrible, and
994140	1000380	that, what do they call it now, the circle pad or whatever, not good either, so, it's
1000380	1004260	just kind of like, okay, which terrible control method do I want to use?
1004260	1011140	So I end up using the circle pad for most things, but it is not, not good at all, um,
1011140	1017740	aside from that, though, the emulation's good, it's just that D-pad is terrible, but no D-pad
1017740	1018740	look good?
1018740	1019740	The one on the Vita.
1019740	1023180	Yeah, there's a lot of neat looking things about the Vita, I gotta say, but I guess we'll
1023180	1026340	get into that a little later, because there's lots and lots of news about handhelds, it's
1026340	1030180	like, this is like handheld week, there's tons and tons of news about both, we'll get
1030180	1031180	into that a little later.
1031180	1032180	Is that it for your gaming week?
1032180	1033180	Sounds like it?
1033180	1034180	Yeah.
1034180	1038340	My favorite game of the week, um, was mostly uneventful, I played a lot of the same stuff
1038340	1042700	like WoW and so forth too, I had to really talk myself down from buying Magica on Steam
1042700	1046300	today, although the game looks kind of fun, I might still buy it when I get home, it's
1046300	1053360	like, only like 9 bucks for the Uber edition right now on Steam, or you can get like the
1053360	1059220	buy 4 copies of the game for 7 dollars, it's like, it's some obscene sale going on on Steam
1059220	1064420	right now, and man, I love and I hate Steam, you know what I mean?
1064420	1068300	Like I love that I'm getting so many games super cheap, I hate that I keep spending money
1068300	1071460	on games I'll play like once or twice and then it'll be all like, oh I gotta go back
1071460	1072460	to WoW.
1072460	1077060	As far as other games I've been playing, I've been playing more L.A. Noire on the consoles,
1077060	1080960	did a couple other cases and so forth, and found that I'm really horrible at the action
1080960	1085260	sequences and I'm so thankful that the developers decided to put in a way you could just skip
1085260	1089920	the action sequences, cause like I just wasn't getting it, like, let me put it this way,
1089920	1094220	at the end of one of the cases, you finally figure out who the suspect really is, and
1094220	1098260	the suspect just bolts, suspect starts running, and the suspect ends up running around the
1098260	1104180	corner and taking a hostage, and you have to shoot the suspect before he shoots the
1104180	1108820	hostage, and like literally that scene started and I was like, shit, I forgot what button
1108820	1112680	fires the gun, I'm like, is it R2 or was it L1?
1112680	1116980	So I'm like hitting all the buttons, and I don't know, I screwed up one time, then I
1116980	1119980	screwed up the other time because I thought disarming the suspect meant you shoot him
1119980	1121980	in the hand.
1121980	1125060	I thought you would shoot him in the hand, you shoot him in the leg, but no, I shot him
1125060	1129860	in the hand that was holding the gun, and by some miracle of God, he shot the hostage
1129860	1132300	anyway, so I don't know how that works.
1132300	1134900	So finally it was just like, do you want to skip this action sequence, and I was like
1134900	1139620	God yes, because the thing I like best about that game is going to look at the clues and
1139620	1144180	going to investigate the suspects, or excuse me, interrogate the suspects, and put that
1144180	1145180	all together.
1145180	1146180	And investigating.
1146180	1151420	It's kind of like, you know, like putting together the pieces of a logic puzzle or something,
1151420	1156660	and it's amazing how exhilarating or how frustrating it can be when you hit the button, like I
1156660	1160700	literally sit there, and it's like being on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, and it's like,
1160700	1169020	your final answer is truth, and then it goes, doo doo doo, fuck, I knew the bitch was lying.
1169020	1174700	They just have a casual mode in there where you pull back a slingshot and launch a bird
1174700	1177660	at the guy.
1177660	1181040	But I gotta say, as far as Rockstar Game goes, I don't usually get into the Grand Theft Auto
1181040	1184140	games and all that stuff, but I'm like, I'm really liking L.A. Noire.
1184140	1190180	I like the detective thing, and I'm all into the stories and the 40s stuff, so yeah, I'm
1190180	1191940	gonna play some more of that one.
1191940	1192940	It's really cool.
1192940	1197540	Some comments on Magica in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
1197540	1201300	And Fanell, I hope I said that right, says, Magica is crazy fun.
1201300	1204500	And Kaijuto says, Magica is crazy lag for me.
1204500	1206860	Make sure they fix that lag before you buy.
1206860	1210860	I wonder if that's for everybody or if it's like a system-related thing.
1210860	1211860	Interesting.
1211860	1214820	So yeah, I've been playing that.
1214820	1218980	Now, there's another game I've been playing quite a bit of this week, and I didn't know
1218980	1222780	if I wanted to talk about it on the show tonight, because I'm gonna kind of like open Pandora's
1222780	1225580	Box here by saying what I've been playing.
1225580	1229080	But I figure, what the hell, I'm not gonna be here the next two weeks anyway, so if any
1229080	1232140	hate mail comes in, I wouldn't see it anyway.
1232140	1236020	So if you've listened to this show for any length of time, I told you guys, I don't pirate
1236020	1237020	games.
1237020	1241540	I don't download a lot of games, I don't pirate games, except I have downloaded in the past,
1241540	1244900	like during the PlayStation 1 era, I downloaded a lot of the Bamani games.
1244900	1246660	Damn it, I was gonna bring you something.
1246660	1248460	I was gonna bring you President Cat.
1248460	1250580	I forgot both things.
1250580	1251580	That's different, that's different.
1251580	1256540	But I was gonna play the, or I used to back in the day, I would download the, cause I'm
1256540	1259540	not paying 80 bucks to import like all these games.
1259540	1264420	My mindset is, if you want my money, release the game in my territory, and I'll buy it.
1264420	1268940	So that being said, I've played quite a bit of Xenoblade Chronicles this week, and I'll
1268940	1270940	leave it at that.
1270940	1275860	I don't wanna talk a little bit about Xenoblade Chronicles, because it's interesting.
1275860	1277420	The game is very interesting.
1277420	1279820	First off, is the game a good game?
1279820	1280820	Yes.
1280820	1283420	Is it something the Wii needs on its system?
1283420	1284860	I think so.
1284860	1287940	But here's the honest reaction I had playing Xenoblade Chronicles.
1287940	1290460	The first thing out of my mouth, cause Salacious Pop, you know, I was sitting down playing
1290460	1293660	it for a couple hours, and Salacious Pop goes, well how was it?
1293660	1295540	And I said, you know what?
1295540	1301060	It feels like a really, really awesome PlayStation 2 game.
1301060	1303300	And that's kinda how I felt about it.
1303300	1309220	Is that the graphics, really not up to par with what you see on the 360 and the PlayStation
1309220	1310220	3.
1310220	1311220	It's understandable.
1311220	1312220	It's the Wii.
1312220	1315260	The game itself feels a lot like, I don't know, it's kinda like Final Fantasy XII, with
1315260	1321380	MMO elements, and a pretty neat battle system reminiscent of the other, you know, Xeno games.
1321380	1324100	So there's a lot to do in the game.
1324100	1325240	There's a lot of quests.
1325240	1329980	There's a lot of things you can do in the game, and the world is vast, and it's really
1329980	1330980	something else.
1330980	1336460	And if you're an RPG fan, you really have a right to be mad that they're not putting
1336460	1337700	the game out here.
1337700	1341700	And quite frankly, if they're not gonna put it out here, you should do what I did.
1341700	1343060	Don't miss out on a great game.
1343060	1346700	Sorry, I know I might get hate mail for encouraging that, but you know what?
1346700	1352460	I will happily buy this game when they release it in this country.
1352460	1353660	There you go.
1353660	1359020	Here's what I think might happen.
1359020	1365060	And this is maybe fan wank speculation, but if my honest reaction to the game was, you
1365060	1370020	know, this game needs to have, like, better graphics to really be competitive.
1370020	1372900	Maybe they're holding back and releasing it on the Wii U.
1372900	1377300	Because I could see this game really easily being adapted for the Wii U.
1377300	1381740	There's a lot, like the menu system, there's a lot to it, there's a lot of sub screens.
1381740	1386740	You could use that second device, or the little controller, very easily to do a lot of that,
1386740	1388960	and then you could have the really nice souped-up graphics.
1388960	1393500	And to be honest, if Nintendo, you know, maybe I'm giving them too much credit here, but
1393500	1396060	it would be a kick-ass launch title.
1396060	1398600	Especially in the, like, it would be a kick-ass launch title.
1398600	1403100	You don't usually see a lot of very vast RPGs as launch titles.
1403100	1406180	What did the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have?
1406180	1410740	I think Enchanted Arms was like the only remote RPG available for like six months.
1410740	1411740	Oblivion?
1411740	1412740	Oh yeah.
1412740	1417420	But I'm thinking Japanese RPG, I'm not thinking, there's a big difference in my mind between
1417420	1422020	a game like Final Fantasy, Enchanted Arms, Xenoblade, and Oblivion.
1422020	1424580	Oblivion's its own thing.
1424580	1428420	But yeah, you're right, you're right, Oblivion is a pretty kick-ass RPG launch title.
1428420	1429420	I should have thought of that.
1429420	1430420	No, here's what they're gonna do.
1430420	1431420	Come on.
1431420	1434620	I mean, yeah, this is Nintendo, and yeah, I can see them doing that, because you know
1434620	1435620	what?
1435620	1438420	They have nothing to bring to the table right now for the Wii U.
1438420	1444300	They've got nothing, so they gotta, they can't hold back Zelda Skyward Sword any longer,
1444300	1447580	because people will just be really pissed off then.
1447580	1449140	But here's what they're gonna do.
1449140	1451980	All they're gonna do is they're gonna fucking upscale that shit.
1451980	1453740	They're not gonna redo the graphics.
1453740	1458380	They're gonna upscale the polygons, and you're gonna have low-res textures, you know, like
1458380	1463040	you've seen with the Metal Gear Solid HD collection.
1463040	1464940	There's different ways that they do HD.
1464940	1470060	Some of them, they'll actually go to the Microsoft, you know, Halo route or whatever, and you'll
1470060	1475620	see where it's redone in a whole new engine, but it's the same, you know, levels and that
1475620	1478100	kind of stuff, and everything's kind of redone in a new engine.
1478100	1483420	Or they go the route where, oh, we're just gonna up-res all the polygons, and the textures,
1483420	1486460	well they're just gonna look kind of fuzzy and smoothed out, but hey, you know what,
1486460	1490740	at least it's not all jaggy like it was, you know, in the older systems.
1490740	1494700	That's all they're gonna fucking do, and they're gonna maybe add some support for the Wii U
1494700	1497260	tablet thing, but you know what?
1497260	1499920	People will be like, oh my god, that's amazing, that's great!
1499920	1500920	But that's what they're doing.
1500920	1505820	They're holding out so that they go, lookit, we understand what the hardcore fan wants,
1505820	1510900	and we brought it to you with the Wii U, and you're supposed to go, oh my god, Nintendo,
1510900	1511900	my savior!
1511900	1513860	I'm gonna go buy your system now!
1513860	1517120	But you need to see through this shit, and you say, fuck them, they're just trying to
1517120	1520540	hold this little carrot in front of my nose, so I buy another fucking system that they
1520540	1525180	end up catering to the goddamn masses for, and make all these casual games, and completely
1525180	1529800	forget about the hardcore user that actually buys product for their damn system.
1529800	1534020	Here's the thing though, like, I agree and I don't, because the thing is, at the end
1534020	1540140	of the day, it's not just about the graphics, and the game itself is pretty freaking awesome,
1540140	1544740	especially, like if you like JRPGs at all, or you like these kind of like, you know,
1544740	1550500	very open world, do the side quests and battles in real time without going into cutscenes
1550500	1555020	for battle and all this, you know, the presentation of the game is great, and the game itself,
1555020	1557500	story and everything, is pretty awesome.
1557500	1562380	I don't think they need to do, I mean, the graphics do look dated, but even upresing
1562380	1566540	or whatever little tweaks they can make to it, that bring it a bump up, I think it's
1566540	1567540	okay.
1567540	1570340	Because at the end of the day, the game itself speaks for itself.
1570340	1573340	System's only as good as the games that are on it, buh buh buh buh buh, right?
1573340	1574340	So-
1574340	1576780	Well then if that's the way they want to go, they want to, you know, bring it out over
1576780	1579440	here, they need to bring it out on the Wii, like it is now, because it's done.
1579440	1583660	It can be put out now, and then they can do a special edition later on that has better
1583660	1588400	graphics or an HD version, and that'd come out like a year later.
1588400	1589400	What's the problem with that?
1589400	1592020	You get to sell it twice, and people may buy it twice.
1592020	1598540	The problem is, and I'm just being real with y'all here, the more Nintendo, I feel like
1598540	1603020	they're ignoring the type of game that I want to play, the more it makes me want to turn
1603020	1604740	to the dark side to do it.
1604740	1610860	And how easy was it to do when major gaming websites are posting, here's how to play Xenoblade
1610860	1614660	in the US, like Nintendo is just being fucking deaf.
1614660	1620260	And that's fine if their ultimate grand scheme plan thing is to release it on the Wii U,
1620260	1622640	but I think they should have announced that by now.
1622640	1624580	And like, I would have waited to play this game.
1624580	1627660	If they'd announced it on the Wii U, I would have said, cool, it'll give me a launch game
1627660	1631300	that sounds like it'll be pretty kick-ass based on everything I've read online.
1631300	1633940	But seeing as I'm getting to this point where I'm like, you know what, this game is never
1633940	1640780	going to come out, and I really want to play it, so gosh, there's this ABC how to run these
1640780	1644540	games on my Wii right in front of my face, I'm doing it.
1644540	1647980	I want to play this game.
1647980	1651420	So be mad if you want, but I'm just being real.
1651420	1653360	I'm not the only one out there.
1653360	1656820	Or major gaming websites will not be publishing how to get away with it.
1656820	1661700	To be honest, it was just how to play the import copy of the game.
1661700	1670940	Well, yeah, no, and that's fine, and I understand that, but let's be real.
1670940	1673100	Let's be real.
1673100	1678020	You surely, you know, there's the thought of what you're really telling people, come
1678020	1681980	on, don't be, don't be ignorant, and I say that to everybody.
1681980	1684280	So it is what it is.
1684280	1686320	It's that, you know.
1686320	1690300	So will I buy the game if it comes out on Wii U?
1690300	1691300	Probably.
1691300	1693300	But, I don't know.
1693300	1695780	It depends if we want to buy it on the Wii U.
1695780	1700340	Yeah, right now the question is, will I buy a Wii U, and I don't know.
1700340	1702660	Well, here's the thing with the Wii U.
1702660	1705580	I mean, look at some of the games that they're talking about coming out of the system.
1705580	1708380	There's like Batman Arkham City.
1708380	1709820	Why?
1709820	1714260	You're gonna release a game that's been out for a year now, you know, on that system?
1714260	1715780	I mean, who cares?
1715780	1719100	I just don't even see a point.
1719100	1720780	Release Skyward Sword on there then.
1720780	1724620	I mean, because no one's gonna fucking care because it's been out for a year.
1724620	1727140	I just, I don't know.
1727140	1732020	Right now they just don't have much to bring to the table for that, and I, I'd be surprised
1732020	1733500	if that system comes out next year.
1733500	1735300	All right, well we'll see.
1735300	1737540	All right, well that's it.
1737540	1739020	That's all I'm gonna say for my gaming week.
1739020	1743860	But yeah, Xenoblade Chronicles is a great game, and it's really too bad that Nintendo
1743860	1744860	won't release it here.
1744860	1745860	What else can I say?
1745860	1751300	So, all right, let's move on and get some quick housekeeping before we get into tonight's
1751300	1752300	stories.
1752300	1754260	I will not be here for the next two weeks.
1754260	1755500	Yeah, two weeks.
1755500	1761620	I'm actually, after last week's show I realized, oh crap, I've got the concert next week and
1761620	1765380	then I actually have a scheduled trip to LA the week after that, and it's the one I do
1765380	1766380	every year.
1766380	1768100	So, yep, I'm taking a little break.
1768100	1769100	Sorry guys.
1769100	1775740	But I believe the one and only Tiara is gonna be here covering, at least next week, if not
1775740	1776740	both weeks.
1776740	1777740	I don't know yet.
1777740	1778740	Just next week.
1778740	1779740	Just next week.
1779740	1784380	So, there will be some type of live shows, so tune in as always, and I'll miss you guys.
1784380	1789820	But at the same time, damn, we need vacations once in a while, give me a break.
1789820	1790940	Let's get into some gaming news.
1790940	1791940	Oh yeah.
1791940	1792940	Facebook.
1792940	1793940	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1793940	1795260	Add us on Facebook please.
1795260	1796260	And Twitter.
1796260	1800460	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. Now we can get into some gaming news.
1800460	1801940	We'll start it off with Loki.
1801940	1805700	I don't take vacations at all.
1805700	1812380	So Nintendo announced a lot of stuff at their pre-Toku game show press event.
1812380	1815820	Some of the stuff they announced, hey, you know those big games that you're waiting for
1815820	1817900	and ones that you may have purchased a system for?
1817900	1820660	Yeah, they're not coming this year.
1820660	1826980	Kid Icarus Uprising has been delayed to 2012, and that's for all regions.
1826980	1831500	And of course, you know, it's critically acclaimed, and yeah.
1831500	1832500	Looks amazing.
1832500	1836380	You know, they had new video footage for it, but yeah, not coming out this year.
1836380	1837940	Too bad.
1837940	1845180	Of course, there's gonna be a new system update coming for the 3DS in November, and this is
1845180	1849860	gonna add 3D video capture as well.
1849860	1855260	And definitely kind of a cool thing, you know, because I know the 3D photos are pretty cool.
1855260	1857640	Yeah, actually that sounds all sorts of awesome.
1857640	1862340	Like I'm really all about the 3D video capture, but the only problem is the resolution on
1862340	1864020	those cameras is kind of shit.
1864020	1865740	That's terrible.
1865740	1867660	So that's kind of unfortunate.
1867660	1871860	Like if those cameras were just a slight better quality, it would be awesome, but you know
1871860	1878320	that next year when there's the 3DS Lite or the 3DS XL or whatever crap they come up with,
1878320	1879660	there's gonna be better cameras in it.
1879660	1883700	I'm sure that will help with the 3D, because let's be real, like not a lot of people have
1883700	1887500	3D cameras or 3D video cameras right now, so Nintendo could kind of get a jump on that,
1887500	1890860	you know, whole thing, the 3D craze by implementing that.
1890860	1894280	I'm really surprised it didn't have video at launch.
1894280	1896180	Not surprised at all that it's being patched in.
1896180	1898180	You're surprised?
1898180	1902620	The device didn't have all the features that they, you know, they talked about.
1902620	1904620	Oh yeah, eShop, you want to buy stuff?
1904620	1906380	Ehh, that's not coming for a few months.
1906380	1907380	Who's sharing?
1907380	1908940	Oh hey, you want to browse the internet?
1908940	1912820	Yeah, we didn't put the web browser in there, it wasn't quite done yet.
1912820	1917740	Ahh, Rush, no, we didn't rush the system, what are you talking about?
1917740	1920820	This was always planned like that.
1920820	1921820	Yeah.
1921820	1929100	So, November, because you know, they don't like the Rush things, they're taking their
1929100	1930100	time.
1930100	1936740	Of course, one of the things that came out was this god-awful ugly circle pad attachment
1936740	1943060	for Monster Hunter Tri-G, and of course, it's been announced that several titles will actually
1943060	1950660	support it, including Resident Evil Revelations, Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater 3D, Ace Combat
1950660	1957900	3D, Dynasty Warriors Versus, and Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance.
1957900	1962180	And of course, this device is going to require an additional AAA battery to use because it's
1962180	1969340	got to communicate with the 3DS via the infrared port on the back, and it will also add a couple
1969340	1973540	extra shoulder buttons, and of course the circle pad.
1973540	1978620	Funny thing about the circle pad is, it's not needed for Monster Hunter.
1978620	1983300	In fact, all the demo kiosks at Tokyo Game Show didn't have it.
1983300	1984740	Interesting.
1984740	1989320	This thing is so interesting because, well A, the whole fact that it requires a separate
1989320	1993420	battery to run, like you could just hear the facepalming going on across Twitter and the
1993420	1997140	blogs and so forth when that was announced, so I'll just kind of let that speak for itself
1997140	2000860	and the whole, yeah, yeah, sure, they plan to do this the whole time, I'm really sure,
2000860	2004060	because they thought about adding that port on the back that could interface with this
2004060	2006700	and power it, but oops.
2006700	2009780	Of course, then again, you don't want anything else sucking the power out of the 3DS because
2009780	2013460	it's not like it holds a lot to begin with, right?
2013460	2018980	But it really is sounding more and more like this is the 3DS's version of MotionPlus, only
2018980	2021860	it's happening a lot faster.
2021860	2025180	And I really wonder how long it's gonna be before this thing is mandatory.
2025180	2031180	And you know on the remake next year, there's gonna be better cameras and the second analog
2031180	2032180	pad.
2032180	2037420	Look at that, second analog pad can go right there, nice little home for it right on the
2037420	2038420	device.
2038420	2041780	No, because the way it looks right now is just like a Wii U controller.
2041780	2049140	Yeah, but see, I believe that the buttons are, well actually, the buttons are above,
2049140	2052700	are below the thing, well fine, they'll move the buttons down and then they'll put the
2052700	2054700	circle pad there.
2054700	2062580	Hey, but they got you the BIOS system because they dropped the price, right?
2062580	2063900	Haha, suckers!
2063900	2066900	And then you'll buy it again!
2066900	2069980	That's what Nintendo likes to do, sell you hardware over and over and over again.
2069980	2072540	Remember Game Boy?
2072540	2078540	Coinora Chatroom at chat.orangelandrader.com, Randy says, that 3DS attachment makes the
2078540	2081380	thing look like a Game Gear.
2081380	2082380	A little bit.
2082380	2086140	I think the battery life might be a little better on a Game Gear though, not sure.
2086140	2090260	And then of course, you know, the best way to target your female audience is to put it
2090260	2091700	out in pink.
2091700	2097140	So they have a 3DS coming out in pink in October.
2097140	2103100	Yeah, uh, cool.
2103100	2104660	Not necessarily in the US.
2104660	2106380	Not in the US, in Japan only.
2106380	2107660	Are people really that shallow?
2107660	2112260	I mean, I understand people like pink things, but it's like, oh, I'm not buying that system.
2112260	2113260	Oh, it's in pink!
2113260	2114260	Oh, okay.
2114260	2116020	Yes, people are that shallow.
2116020	2119300	Just accept it and move on.
2119300	2121260	I shake my head at you guys.
2121260	2124100	See, this is how they get away with all that shit.
2124100	2125900	Put out a pink box for a game, huh?
2125900	2129380	Whenever blue systems come out, Megalotov's right there ready to buy one.
2129380	2131140	So I don't know what to tell you.
2131140	2132140	It's on, Dan.
2132140	2134140	What do you want to say?
2134140	2135140	Whoops.
2135140	2136140	Except it's muted.
2136140	2137140	Sorry about that.
2137140	2138140	Go ahead.
2138140	2139580	Pink systems, giant sellers at Christmas time.
2139580	2140580	Are they really?
2140580	2141580	Oh yeah.
2141580	2145060	You can't get the like the pink DS light.
2145060	2147540	You couldn't bag bar or steal one of those at Christmas time.
2147540	2150100	And the other time of the year, nobody fucking wanted them.
2150100	2151100	Isn't it really?
2151100	2154380	Well, remember when I got my, um, uh, GBA?
2154380	2156740	Oh, dear God, no.
2156740	2157740	My pink GBA.
2157740	2158740	What about it?
2158740	2160700	And no one else could find them?
2160700	2161700	No.
2161700	2164700	But you know, it's not really just...
2164700	2166680	GBA, that was a long time ago.
2166680	2168060	It's not pink and hard to find.
2168060	2169980	It's not really just about the colors though, right?
2169980	2172900	Like, I don't know how many of you guys were watching the press conferences that was going
2172900	2178900	on, but they followed up this conversation on pink 3DSs with the girl tailored games,
2178900	2181280	which were, they looked really creepster to me.
2181280	2184340	Like I didn't get it, but of course, you know, it's a different culture, whatever.
2184340	2186900	Some comedian based game, I think was one of them.
2186900	2190180	They have a lot of girl based games already.
2190180	2194860	I mean, Ubisoft puts out a ton of girl games.
2194860	2197740	I mean, there is tons of DS games.
2197740	2202060	I want to preface by saying like tween girl games.
2202060	2207540	Like I don't want to infer, cause dark soccer might kick my butt, that girls like play different
2207540	2208540	games.
2208540	2211740	And like, you know, all girls hate Metroid and things like that.
2211740	2217080	But like, you know, the ones that are aimed at like the little girls, I'm going to punch
2217080	2222500	you with this microphone.
2222500	2223780	Although let's be real.
2223780	2226260	She did say she played a lot of Sims 3 this week.
2226260	2228180	I'm just kidding.
2228180	2230580	She's stuck on that Facebook Sims game.
2230580	2232340	A lot of people actually didn't touch it.
2232340	2233900	What a piece of crap.
2233900	2234900	Bullshit.
2234900	2237660	A lot of people are stuck on that Facebook game.
2237660	2240020	You lie like a rug.
2240020	2243220	I didn't play it at all yesterday.
2243220	2244540	So many of my Sims hated me.
2244540	2249900	But the DS, they did really try to market the DS at girls for a while.
2249900	2255520	Like didn't they have like Beyonce and Carrie Underwood doing commercials and Beyonce does
2255520	2257940	it then I've got to do that.
2257940	2261660	Girls and women were a huge marketing push with the Wii too.
2261660	2266980	Nintendo was just all about, you know, 40% of the consumers out there are 50% or 60%
2266980	2267980	or whatever are women.
2267980	2269100	And we're not marketing to them.
2269100	2270260	You've got to sell to women.
2270260	2271260	Sell, sell, sell.
2271260	2274900	Recommend games for girls, girls, girls, girls, sell, sell, sell.
2274900	2276460	I'm like, you fucking people.
2276460	2279260	Have you seen the customers that come into my store?
2279260	2281260	99% male.
2281260	2285580	If there's a girl in my store, they stay out until the girl leaves.
2285580	2288460	No, that's not true.
2288460	2290180	Well, it's often true.
2290180	2292060	It's because I don't know what to do around a woman.
2292060	2296060	If there's a girl in the store selling on the other hand, oh shit, unless she's the
2296060	2300260	world's worst salesperson, she could sell whatever it's because that's the only way
2300260	2302020	they'll ever see a woman in real life.
2302020	2303980	That's what I was saying.
2303980	2309780	But now they can see women in 3D on the 3DS in 3D, 3D boobies.
2309780	2312500	It's probably the first time they ever see 3D boobies.
2312500	2316500	All right, no, no, no, I kid.
2316500	2319700	So I don't know how many of you guys again watched Nintendo's conference.
2319700	2323820	Obviously there was a lot of focus on the monster hunter games that's coming out games
2323820	2328340	because there's tri-G and then there's four that they announced is going to be a Nintendo
2328340	2329980	3DS thing as well.
2329980	2333800	And then I got to say, I was totally thinking of Dark Sakura because after the press conference,
2333800	2338600	there was like 15 minutes of monster hunter commercials that featured Gachamon.
2338600	2343280	Like for 15 minutes, like all these little Gachamon ads for monster hunter games that
2343280	2344280	made me laugh.
2344280	2345860	Okay, I need this if there's Gachamon involved.
2345860	2350940	I watched them all thinking that that's when they were finally going to show that 3DS peripheral.
2350940	2356260	What was very interesting, that add on completely absent from Nintendo's press conference that
2356260	2358380	they did for not Tokyo game show.
2358380	2359780	I don't care about any of that.
2359780	2361660	You've lost me at Gachamon.
2361660	2362980	I'm totally being honest.
2362980	2367460	I should have like called you and it was on YouTube.
2367460	2368460	You might find them on YouTube.
2368460	2369460	You might.
2369460	2371460	They were all funny.
2371460	2377580	Now, uh, Kevin 6L8 in our chat room, maybe that's Kevin68 in our chat room says, uh,
2377580	2383500	in my store about a good third of the people buying our team to young adult girls buying
2383500	2384500	what buying?
2384500	2388940	I'm assuming like DS and related systems or maybe we are, of course.
2388940	2389940	Why not expo?
2389940	2392300	Yeah, that's, that's, that's the same thing.
2392300	2393460	I was watching our soccer.
2393460	2396660	She's, she brought it up.
2396660	2397660	Just a preface.
2397660	2402080	I worked at a game crazy and I also worked at a store, you know, a few years ago back
2402080	2404420	before girls started playing games.
2404420	2406800	That's the scariest looking kate I've ever seen.
2406800	2408620	She didn't even pay attention.
2408620	2411660	Nobody cares.
2411660	2416020	It's a 70 show about a bird ninja team.
2416020	2417740	The science ninja team.
2417740	2418740	All right.
2418740	2423220	Uh, let's talk about the Vita a little bit cause there's a lot of news on the PlayStation
2423220	2424660	Vita as well.
2424660	2430940	Um, first off at their conference, they had this slide talking about 100 titles already
2430940	2432660	announced for the Vita.
2432660	2439100	Uh, things like a Ninja guidance, Sigma, ultimate moral, Marvel vs Capcom three, Katamari, DJ
2439100	2445780	max technica, um, the sound shapes game, super stardust, Delta wipeout Ridge racer, of course
2445780	2446780	always has to be there.
2446780	2452540	Zone of Enders, HD, metal gear, solid HD, uh, Gundam games, super robot, Tyson games,
2452540	2454700	tales of innocence, et cetera, et cetera.
2454700	2460140	So lots, I mean, it's very interesting watching the Sony conference because they are doing
2460140	2463400	everything they can to not fuck this up.
2463400	2468180	They and they are, they are trying to just punch Nintendo in the jugular.
2468180	2472440	And I'll tell you what, the delay of the Vita in the U S I'm telling you is so that the
2472440	2474240	lineup looks as strong here.
2474240	2477220	They are doing what everybody says Nintendo should have done.
2477220	2480940	And by, I mean, and everybody's saying Nintendo should not have launched a 3ds until Christmas.
2480940	2484220	And so what the Vita is doing is the Vita is waiting and it's building up an arsenal
2484220	2485220	of games.
2485220	2488460	So now when that thing launches here, it's going to come out with a bang.
2488460	2490260	It's it's really interesting.
2490260	2495700	It is actually, I mean, I wasn't too interested in, because before, you know, granted before
2495700	2499780	during E3, all they were showing was like, here's uncharted and then here's a bunch of
2499780	2501420	other crappy games that you don't give a shit about.
2501420	2505580	Oh, and wipe out for the, you know, the Vita I was like, eh, I don't really care for any
2505580	2506580	of that crap.
2506580	2510820	But now they're showing all the third party games for the Vita and it's looking nice,
2510820	2511820	right?
2511820	2516980	Uh, by the way, the Vita does come out December 17th, the date has been announced in Japan.
2516980	2520620	So it's very, they are cutting it really close there with the end of the year.
2520620	2525260	And uh, you know, that would be way too late here in America to make the holiday season.
2525260	2528780	I still think it would sell tons anyway, but I, I think Sony's doing the right thing by
2528780	2532640	waiting till next year because they're just going to dump a crap ton of games whenever
2532640	2533640	it launches here.
2533640	2537700	They did not announce the date here, although something to think about, it was reiterated
2537700	2542940	this week in on Twitter, in a Twitter conversation with, um, Sony computer entertainment president
2542940	2548100	of worldwide studios, Suhei Yoshida has reiterated the Vita is region free.
2548100	2551620	So if you want to import one of those fuckers on December 17th, you're good to go.
2551620	2556700	I'm getting the shakes already.
2556700	2561060	Giving Nintendo an unopposed holiday season is not smart.
2561060	2566300	They need to at least, I mean, I'm sure that before the holiday season really kicks in
2566300	2568500	that we'll at least know a date.
2568500	2574620	Uh, I, I do agree and they're not, but they're not going opposed in Japan, which is going
2574620	2577220	to be the biggest battleground I think of sorts.
2577220	2578220	I don't know.
2578220	2583060	I, I'm not too worried about the 3ds in, in the U S because I think, you know, the games
2583060	2588380	that they have coming out, they have, was it a super Mario 3d land and November and
2588380	2589620	that's really it.
2589620	2595620	And other than that, it's a Mario karts coming out in December, but later on and I don't
2595620	2596620	know.
2596620	2600940	So it's Mario definitely is a draw, but is it a system seller?
2600940	2602940	They're doing a smash brothers for that thing.
2602940	2605800	Yeah, yeah, they're doing a smash brothers for that thing.
2605800	2610460	And people are at some point in time, they have how many fucking people bought the Wii
2610460	2612260	because they put smash brothers on it.
2612260	2613260	I understand that.
2613260	2618020	And that's fine if they buy Nintendo needs to do is find that one fucking title.
2618020	2620180	That's what they've done with every system.
2620180	2621180	Every system.
2621180	2623380	People are just like, well, I don't know.
2623380	2628540	And then it comes out with that one title, which on the original DS was like Ninten dogs
2628540	2629540	or something.
2629540	2632220	And everybody goes, I got to have one of these fucking things.
2632220	2633620	So what fucking brain age?
2633620	2634620	Yeah, exactly.
2634620	2639220	What happens if at Christmas that one title comes out and Sony's just left holding their
2639220	2640340	sack?
2640340	2641540	They're not going to, I'm sorry.
2641540	2645940	It's it's not going to, first off smash brothers at E3, which they shouldn't have even really
2645940	2646940	announced at E3.
2646940	2649700	They're like, yeah, Hey, I'm thinking about working on a smash brothers game.
2649700	2650700	Is it in development?
2650700	2651700	No.
2651700	2653580	Is it coming out anytime soon?
2653580	2654580	No.
2654580	2655580	But, but we're thinking about it.
2655580	2656580	Yeah.
2656580	2657580	Just like we're thinking about doing a Pikmin game.
2657580	2660940	Where the fuck is your new Pikmin game that you promised us two years ago for the week?
2660940	2662700	Oh, that's never coming out.
2662700	2664940	So smash brothers for the three DS.
2664940	2665940	Yeah.
2665940	2669540	They promised you net two and you know, they promised that games coming out now, but two
2669540	2673220	years from now when it's like, um, Hey, where's the smash brothers game?
2673220	2674220	You promise us?
2674220	2675220	Yeah.
2675220	2677060	We're going to put it on the next three DS system that we're going to put out.
2677060	2679060	So, uh, sorry.
2679060	2684340	Three DS, I still think the internet as a whole, were you trying to say something Jamie?
2684340	2685340	Sorry.
2685340	2686340	Not anymore.
2686340	2687340	Okay.
2687340	2691540	I still think the internet as a whole is being a little hard on Nintendo because it's hard
2691540	2696620	on, he said hard on, but no, for real, because, and believe me, I have my issues with Nintendo
2696620	2700280	as well, but I think the three DS is going to sell bucket loads this Christmas.
2700280	2705100	I think a lot of people are seriously underestimating the power of that Mario cart and the Mario
2705100	2706340	land three D games.
2706340	2710740	I think that's going to sell a lot of systems this holiday, especially with there not being
2710740	2711740	a Vita.
2711740	2712740	Don't get me wrong.
2712740	2716340	The Vita is going to be an impressive thing and going to have a huge launch next year
2716340	2720900	that doesn't do anything for this Christmas here in the U S I just think those like Mario
2720900	2724460	cart, especially is huge.
2724460	2726220	I really think so.
2726220	2729660	I just think they need to bring up motion sickness pills with it.
2729660	2733740	I've gone through 10 holiday seasons and game retail.
2733740	2740180	No Nintendo system has been a shelf warmer at a Christmas time, except for the virtual
2740180	2743220	boy, but that was before my time.
2743220	2744220	Very true.
2744220	2745220	Very true.
2745220	2749620	I think the one thing that the three DS is lacking that Nintendo should have jumped on
2749620	2752100	sooner somehow second analog controller.
2752100	2756420	Uh, well that's a whole nother issue, but I'm just talking like, you know, format stuff
2756420	2758700	wise is the three D movies.
2758700	2762320	They were showing off a lot of the city three, the year that the three DS was shown.
2762320	2766820	You know, we have Netflix on the three DS, but yet we don't have three D movies yet.
2766820	2768640	Soon we're going to be able to record three D movies.
2768640	2771580	Now have you checked out the Nintendo video service that they've got on there?
2771580	2776180	Yeah, but what little five minute videos I'm talking when they, when we were 83 they were
2776180	2779520	talking about putting tangled in three D on a little cartridge.
2779520	2783500	They could, the lion King in three D was the number one movie at the box office this weekend
2783500	2786240	from 94 they put that thing on a three DS cart.
2786240	2790900	It's going to sell like crazy, you know, because it's so much cheaper right now and they need
2790900	2792500	to strike while the iron's hot.
2792500	2797180	It's so much cheaper right now to invest in the three DS is three D device, then go get
2797180	2800860	a fricking three D television and glasses, but that's not going to be the case much longer
2800860	2802260	come a year from now.
2802260	2803260	Next holiday.
2803260	2805420	I think three D three D TVs are going to be huge, man.
2805420	2806740	I can't wait.
2806740	2808900	Are you waiting to get a three DTV?
2808900	2814700	I want a three DTV because kind of like Matt, I'm a sucker for technology, but at the same
2814700	2817300	time as I've gotten older, I've gotten cheaper.
2817300	2821980	So I'm just like, Oh man, I am not going to spend $3,000 on that.
2821980	2825500	Especially as fast as technology is getting better and better.
2825500	2831400	You're definitely in a better position to wait because as soon as you buy one, it's
2831400	2835460	just like, Oh, Hey look, we came up with this technology that's even 10 times better and
2835460	2836460	it's cheaper.
2836460	2837460	It's like, Oh, come on.
2837460	2841560	Well, when I even, you know, I haven't waited and waited and waited about my 120 Hertz TV
2841560	2845180	because 120 Hertz was supposed to be the three D rate.
2845180	2848620	It's like on this TV now we can do three D when the three D comes out.
2848620	2849620	This TV will work.
2849620	2850620	I'm like, great.
2850620	2851620	Now.
2851620	2852620	Fuck you.
2852620	2853620	It's gotta be two 40.
2853620	2854620	Fuck you guys.
2854620	2855740	Fuck you right in the ear.
2855740	2856960	But that's okay.
2856960	2861480	Going to our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com hit stun says Netflix is in three D right?
2861480	2862960	Actually it's not, not on the three DS.
2862960	2866860	I know you would think it would be, but outside of the title screen and I think the menus,
2866860	2869260	the content itself, not in three D yet.
2869260	2870260	Who knows?
2870260	2871260	Who knows what might happen?
2871260	2874600	Uh, and then, uh, Kevin six eight in our chat at chat.orangestonsready.com says, I'm not
2874600	2877100	really into three D. I mean, it's more of a novelty to me.
2877100	2878400	See, I'm kind of there too.
2878400	2881580	And I feel a little weird talking about like hyping up three D and everything, but I think
2881580	2885840	for games three D might actually kind of be neat.
2885840	2889140	Like I got to admit some of the three DS stuff's got cool.
2889140	2894900	Like it's a little bitty screen and so forth, but it is, it's, it's, it's neat at least
2894900	2895900	for a little while.
2895900	2898560	I think the Mario Kart game is going to be kind of neat, but I think there probably will
2898560	2902280	be a point where I'm like, okay, let's, let's turn the three off now.
2902280	2908300	See with Mario Kart, it's just, it's a perfect example of what Nintendo does wrong and Mario
2908300	2912980	Kart, what they've done is every game only sells like 11 D gajillion copies.
2912980	2916220	I understand that because people are suckers and they're like, Oh, it's a Mario game.
2916220	2917460	I want to buy it.
2917460	2918460	Fine.
2918460	2919460	That's not why it happens.
2919460	2921500	It's because the Mario Kart games are good.
2921500	2922500	Really?
2922500	2924340	They're not creative.
2924340	2931780	They're not innovative, but they're always super fun and anyone can play them and they
2931780	2933060	just, they just last.
2933060	2938700	The one series that Nintendo really doesn't need to do anything to, you know how, you
2938700	2941580	know, they put out stuff and don't really do anything like animal crossing.
2941580	2945100	They change absolutely nothing and they put out the new game on another system and Hey,
2945100	2946980	wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2946980	2950620	In the new animal crossing, you will get to sit on a bench and swim.
2950620	2951620	But that's fine.
2951620	2952620	Okay.
2952620	2953620	Two things.
2953620	2956660	Um, and it's in a different camera perspective, whoopty shit.
2956660	2960180	Um, but one of the series that they don't really need to do anything to is Mario Kart.
2960180	2963980	I mean, Mario Kart was always good as it was hang gliders.
2963980	2964980	Yeah.
2964980	2965980	Hang gliders.
2965980	2966980	That's awesome.
2966980	2972780	Um, or you know, they've ruined battle mode, you know, after the 64 versions after the
2972780	2973780	first one.
2973780	2975300	No, it was, it was good.
2975300	2977060	A 64 version was still fun.
2977060	2979780	Good on like that flat out with seven battle screen.
2979780	2981100	It was so cool.
2981100	2986140	It was, Mario Kart 64 is an awesome game that I haven't spent enough time with.
2986140	2989740	So it was blocked for, it was awesome in Mario Kart 64.
2989740	2994740	I mean, that's where it was at, but you know, now they're just, they're trying too hard,
2994740	2995740	I guess.
2995740	2998980	Cause with Double Dash it was like, oh look, you can have a partner, you can switch back
2998980	2999980	and forth.
2999980	3000980	No, that was terrible.
3000980	3005980	And then now, and then now they have like, oh look, hey, uh, we're going to have motorcycles
3005980	3009300	and monster trucks and hang gliders and underwater sub things.
3009300	3010300	Who gives a shit?
3010300	3011300	It's a kart racing game.
3011300	3015740	If you ever come over the one year that we put up like an eight player system like Mario
3015740	3016740	Kart game.
3016740	3017740	No.
3017740	3018740	That was so great.
3018740	3020780	It was like, I'm going to be controlling the rear guy and just punting people.
3020780	3023420	It was like amazing.
3023420	3026420	Let me, let me, let me try to kind of move on the conversation a little bit here, but,
3026420	3030220	but Jamie, Jamie, I want to hear from you for a minute because Nintendo is targeting
3030220	3032460	women.
3032460	3035940	What do you think the 3DS's chances are this Christmas?
3035940	3037780	It's going to be good cause it's an Nintendo system.
3037780	3040280	I mean people buy Nintendo systems.
3040280	3041280	That's really it.
3041280	3045860	And people are going to buy the shit that comes out, like imagine babies and fart monsters
3045860	3046860	or something.
3046860	3050580	Do they have a game called fart monster 3D?
3050580	3056980	No, they have, um, let's see what would be the closest thing to that.
3056980	3058340	They have pet zombies.
3058340	3060020	You can raise your own pet zombie.
3060020	3061020	That's kind of fun.
3061020	3062020	Shitting me.
3062020	3063020	No.
3063020	3064020	That's awesomely bad.
3064020	3065020	All right.
3065020	3067460	I would play that cause it's awesomely bad.
3067460	3070780	Now we got to get back to some of this stuff on the Vita cause go ahead.
3070780	3075300	I was going to say if they want to, you know, sell me one, just give me my Kid Icarus already.
3075300	3076300	Soon.
3076300	3077300	Next year.
3077300	3078300	All right.
3078300	3081980	Uh, by the way, cause some of the, uh, audio or excuse me, some of the chat is pointing
3081980	3083700	out that Dan's audio is in and out.
3083700	3084700	He's using the shit.
3084700	3088940	He does have the busted mic right now cause I had to put a mic by the door so that Dan
3088940	3090860	would come in here and yell random shit.
3090860	3095980	He might be encouraged to pick up a mic and say it into the microphone, but unfortunately
3095980	3098320	the only microphone we have is the half busted one.
3098320	3100840	So I apologize to the shoddy audio quality.
3100840	3101840	We hear that.
3101840	3102840	Thank you Dan.
3102840	3103840	No, actually now we can't.
3103840	3104840	There you go.
3104840	3106340	Just hold the cord.
3106340	3107340	Yeah.
3107340	3108340	You just have to do it.
3108340	3109340	You have to kind of just kind of push it together.
3109340	3110900	Like it's a falling apart.
3110900	3112620	All right.
3112620	3113620	More Vita news.
3113620	3116260	My husband's a prevert.
3116260	3121980	I mentioned this in the, uh, over overview of what all games are coming out, but I just
3121980	3123140	kind of want to revisit.
3123140	3129240	Uh, it was announced that zone of the enders HD collection and metal gear solid is coming
3129240	3136540	to the Vita, uh, as well as Ninja Gaiden, ultimate Marvel versus Capcom three Katamari.
3136540	3141100	And this was the huge bombshell that was dropped.
3141100	3147300	Final fantasy 10 remake or HD version or whatever they're calling it is coming out.
3147300	3151300	We're going to do a remake of final fantasy final fantasy 10.
3151300	3152300	Yeah.
3152300	3155360	They don't go with when everyone wants, they just go with one that all they have to do
3155360	3158100	is update a few textures on and boom.
3158100	3159340	Well I think you hit the nail on the head.
3159340	3163100	There's far less work to be done with final fantasy 10 and they can get it done a lot
3163100	3164100	faster.
3164100	3165100	Not even updating the textures.
3165100	3166100	It's just uprising.
3166100	3167100	I don't know though.
3167100	3168340	No, I've given that too much.
3168340	3174920	Uh, I'm being too hard on them because the, you know, um, Ico shadow class collection
3174920	3176920	is actually pretty good.
3176920	3179460	So all this is a third part.
3179460	3180460	Is that out?
3180460	3185300	I need to get that out this it's either this week or next week.
3185300	3186300	I got to get that.
3186300	3187620	But anyways, no, actually I'm sorry.
3187620	3189720	That is a third party company and so it's not Sony.
3189720	3196220	So yeah, it's just going to be up res textures, um, and polygons.
3196220	3203320	It's going to be Konami stuff or Konami quality, which there was a lot of like Twitter rage
3203320	3206980	on seven fans versus 10 fans this week when the remake was announced.
3206980	3209900	I noticed it was just kind of like the answer seems obvious to me.
3209900	3212780	Ten's just an easier thing to remain in both games.
3212780	3214700	Both games are equally popular in Japan.
3214700	3219500	Well yeah, um, uprising into HD is a little different than remaking the whole damn game.
3219500	3221680	You know, one is a lot easier to do than the other.
3221680	3225340	So that's why you don't have a set because if you all press seven, it's going to look
3225340	3226340	like shit.
3226340	3228980	And I don't know why there's so many 10 haters.
3228980	3232380	I don't know if it's because of like the whiny emo voice acting and stuff, but like Lulu
3232380	3234940	is like one of the most bad-ass characters like in a video game.
3234940	3237260	I really like 10 too.
3237260	3239300	I really like 10 too.
3239300	3240300	10 two's okay.
3240300	3244700	I was like, yay, 10 too is fun and festive.
3244700	3247380	Some days you want to have crazy hat day.
3247380	3248380	It's the girl fest.
3248380	3250740	I love it.
3250740	3253980	So especially because there was like this whole area, like when you're on that long
3253980	3258260	road that you could just cycle back through your dress fears and like level them all up
3258260	3261980	super quickly, like over and over again if you had a couple hours to spend on it.
3261980	3265700	Well who knows if Final Fantasy 10 sells well enough in a remake edition or what have you,
3265700	3266700	they might have 10 too.
3266700	3269580	Give us seven you whores.
3269580	3273620	Here's my other question is, uh, and I don't know if you know this Loki, but some people
3273620	3277220	are saying that this Final Fantasy 10 remake is not just for the Vita, that it's for the
3277220	3283660	PlayStation three as well as that was, wow, that's, Kevin 68 makes a good point.
3283660	3284660	What's that?
3284660	3285660	Aaron was bad ass.
3285660	3286660	Yes, he was.
3286660	3287660	He was so bad ass.
3287660	3289740	They put him in kingdom hearts as well.
3289740	3290740	You know what?
3290740	3291740	Hmm.
3291740	3294700	He was like the only, cause you know, I leveled through the game so quickly.
3294700	3298300	Well, I went through the game without leveling so quickly, but by the time I got to that
3298300	3305220	last, uh, um, what was that fucker's name with the blue hair that started with a G.
3305220	3306220	Ject?
3306220	3309500	No, the bad guy with the blue hair that tried to marry Yuna.
3309500	3310500	Oh, fuckwad.
3310500	3311500	His name is fuckwad.
3311500	3317480	By the time I got to fuckwad again, after the glyph mine battle, I was like dead and
3317480	3322140	he was the only one that lived cause I didn't level, but he was a bad ass.
3322140	3325800	Uh, tiger claw in our chat room says, what about that Final Fantasy musical game they
3325800	3326800	are making?
3326800	3329740	What is it on, it's, it's a three ds, not a Vita game, but it's that that's her river
3329740	3331820	rhythm or whatever it was called.
3331820	3332820	It looked dumb.
3332820	3334620	Well, here's the thing.
3334620	3341100	If the game was like $20 maybe, but $40, no thank you.
3341100	3345800	Listen to last week's show and the whole price tag grant because I want, what are the Vita
3345800	3350920	games going to be priced out of there all going to be 40 bucks to 50 shut the fuck up
3350920	3351920	for real.
3351920	3353820	Vita games are going to be 50 bucks.
3353820	3354820	Hello.
3354820	3356980	PSP games were fucking 50 bucks.
3356980	3359260	Oh my God.
3359260	3360260	I don't know.
3360260	3361260	Apparently my head's been in the sand.
3361260	3365460	I didn't buy a whole lot of PS 1540 it'll be a PSP price.
3365460	3366460	I think.
3366460	3368940	Um, I don't know, maybe 60.
3368940	3374140	The only price I've seen so far is on, um, Lego Harry Potter.
3374140	3376600	And that was, I think it was 50.
3376600	3380540	It was Seymour Guado.
3380540	3381540	That's right.
3381540	3382540	It was Seymour.
3382540	3383660	You want to see more Guado?
3383660	3385460	I like fuck wad, Seymour fuck wad.
3385460	3389940	Um, but yeah, that's the only one that, cause the only two titles that I actually have info
3389940	3396180	on were, um, Lego Harry Potter two and um, dragon something.
3396180	3397940	I don't remember the hell the other one was called.
3397940	3400560	Like dragons, dragon dust or I don't know.
3400560	3404660	Suddenly buying the Magica Uber edition for 10 bucks on steam doesn't seem like such a
3404660	3410280	bad idea because like game pricing is so fucked up right now.
3410280	3417180	Like I just, it's, we're in such this crazy state that we haven't been in gaming's history.
3417180	3420580	Games have always kind of been around that same price, but now we've got 99 cent angry
3420580	3422580	birds versus $50 Vita games.
3422580	3423980	It's all about production value though.
3423980	3427040	I mean, look at, look at the games that they're putting out now.
3427040	3428040	What they have to do.
3428040	3432540	They have, you know, Hollywood, um, voice actors and not all games have that, but they
3432540	3437300	have, you know, teams of hundreds of people, you know, putting these things together for
3437300	3441500	a long period of time versus angry birds, which could have been made by one or two guys
3441500	3442500	in maybe a weekend.
3442500	3447660	I mean, that's why that's 99 cents and that's why those games are 60 bucks because they
3447660	3449460	also have to advertise.
3449460	3450460	They have to do all that stuff.
3450460	3454020	And yes, they can go the different route and try to do more casual stuff and stuff that
3454020	3455020	costs less.
3455020	3457180	But what about movies?
3457180	3460340	Because like, you know, the Blair Witch project was made for what, like a nickel and then
3460340	3464140	you had like Titanic and it costs the same to see both of those movies.
3464140	3467260	Now I guess I understand now that with the 3D is throwing this interesting monkey wrench
3467260	3471100	into it, you're not going to see independent 3D movies right now or right now anyway.
3471100	3472100	Well, yes.
3472100	3475500	So I understand that they're, you know, movies when they come to the theaters are all the
3475500	3479420	same price, but that's, you know, up to the studios to make that decision whether they
3479420	3483340	want to have a high budget movie or a low budget movie, you know, being put in there.
3483340	3486540	And yeah, it's all gonna be the same price, but you know, they're charging these theaters
3486540	3491620	a hell of a lot of money to put them in there and then they sell them on DVD and you know,
3491620	3497580	yeah, DVD prices are, you know, it fluctuates depending on where you buy them, but it's
3497580	3501400	because they've already had it out there and they've already made some money back from
3501400	3506700	it already before they've gone and sold it on DVD or video on demand or however else
3506700	3508740	you consume your entertainment.
3508740	3512860	I guess it really just depends on what the quality of the game is, though, and how much
3512860	3513860	you're into it.
3513860	3516420	Like, and that's the interesting thing about Steam, too, is that it's kind of like one
3516420	3520220	of those, well, once we've sold it to everybody, we think it's gonna buy it for 50 bucks, let's
3520220	3521220	try to knock it down to 40.
3521220	3522220	Like it's-
3522220	3523220	Yeah.
3523220	3524220	We can name that tune.
3524220	3525220	Where I have-
3525220	3526220	I'll buy that game for 50 bucks.
3526220	3529220	But at the same time, though, I have a problem with a game that's terrible, that's being
3529220	3534980	sold for $60 when it clearly looks like it's like an up-res PlayStation 2 game, or in the
3534980	3539880	case of Activision and EA, where they put out Rock Band and Guitar Hero and they sell
3539880	3548060	it for 60 bucks on the Wii, I mean, dude, it's less production quality for that version
3548060	3549860	of the game than it was the other ones.
3549860	3554340	Cinderwolf in our chatroom at chat.orangetowntrady.com says, as a retailer, the greater profit is
3554340	3562260	in selling 200 copies at $30 rather than 50 copies at $50.
3562260	3563260	Depends what you're talking about.
3563260	3567700	I mean, if you're talking about games, there's no money to be made anywhere, but if you're
3567700	3570740	talking about movies, then that's a different story.
3570740	3571740	All right.
3571740	3573520	Let's move on with some more news stories.
3573520	3577260	We could talk all night about how games are really expensive, but at the end of the day,
3577260	3580420	like seriously, if Civilization VI was announced and they were gonna charge a hundred bucks
3580420	3584740	for it, I'd probably still pay it.
3584740	3585740	It just really depends on the game.
3585740	3586740	You're part of the problem, Rob.
3586740	3587740	Yeah, I am.
3587740	3588740	That's fine.
3588740	3589740	Okay.
3589740	3594620	Hey, some people spent 150 bucks on these limited edition, like Call of Duty's, World
3594620	3601780	of Warcraft's, Oblivion, or excuse me, Skyrim, you know, whatever game, so they make hundreds
3601780	3603080	of bucks off people somehow.
3603080	3606060	Some people imported games for a lot of money too.
3606060	3608620	Yeah, who imported the game that came with a fucking dish?
3608620	3609620	Dark Sakura.
3609620	3610620	You know what?
3610620	3614820	I didn't actually import that, I bought it in an import store and I didn't pay that much
3614820	3615820	for it.
3615820	3618180	Hey, are you a fan of Lord of the Rings?
3618180	3620780	Because they've got a Lord of the Rings War of the North thing that's coming out, it comes
3620780	3622980	in a quiver, a leather quiver.
3622980	3624700	I remember you mentioning that.
3624700	3627920	For the record, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan.
3627920	3628920	The movies were okay.
3628920	3629920	Are you a fan of leather quivers?
3629920	3630920	No.
3630920	3634960	The movies were okay and the books, the stories were great.
3634960	3638780	The stories, but Tolkien's writing pisses me off.
3638780	3639780	Are you a fan of guns?
3639780	3640780	Yes.
3640780	3643140	Because there's a Red Dead Redemption coming out with a six shooter.
3643140	3644140	You want a gun?
3644140	3645220	I want a gun!
3645220	3646220	I just made that up.
3646220	3647340	He totally made that up.
3647340	3648740	We actually went looking at guns.
3648740	3652380	I just want Dark Sakura to get excited about a gun.
3652380	3653380	I want a gun.
3653380	3654380	I don't want Dark Sakura to own a gun.
3654380	3655380	Why?
3655380	3657380	Because you'll shoot me!
3657380	3659680	I won't.
3659680	3660680	No I won't.
3660680	3663780	Just because someone has a gun doesn't mean that they'll use a gun.
3663780	3668540	Yeah but we're talking about you though.
3668540	3673460	It would be safely in a locker and I would go outside to shoot it.
3673460	3674460	You're right in the face.
3674460	3680620	We're waiting until you get outside of the house so that way we can say you were a prowler.
3680620	3684140	The next time Shermie shits on the floor she's gonna get it.
3684140	3685140	No.
3685140	3686740	Yeah she can absorb a bullet and be fine.
3686740	3687740	She's right there.
3687740	3688740	Bounce right off her.
3688740	3689740	Be nice to the cat.
3689740	3690740	I wouldn't shoot the cat.
3690740	3692740	I like her better than anyone else in this room.
3692740	3699460	As they put it in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she's cultivating mass.
3699460	3701180	She's cultivating sleep right now.
3701180	3704180	Dark Sakura let's move on with some gaming news.
3704180	3705740	Sony are bitches.
3705740	3706740	Wait.
3706740	3711460	They actually amended their online terms to block class action lawsuits.
3711460	3716340	It's actually a section called binding individual arbitration.
3716340	3722660	So to quote it says any dispute resolution proceedings whether in arbitration or court
3722660	3727780	will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in the class or representative action
3727780	3732820	as a named or unnamed member in the class consolidation representative or private attorney
3732820	3734980	general action.
3734980	3740300	So basically if you want to use our shit you can't sue us in the class action.
3740300	3741900	But you can opt out.
3741900	3742940	Yes you can opt out of it.
3742940	3746780	You can send Sony a postcard or whatever and opt out of that.
3746780	3749380	I want to make specially made postcards of Sony.
3749380	3752260	That's a big middle finger.
3752260	3754300	Opt out of this bitch.
3754300	3755440	Well here's what it says.
3755440	3759340	If you do not agree with the new terms of service or privacy policy or if you do not
3759340	3764180	wish to enter into an agreement with Sony you may decline the TOS and privacy policy
3764180	3768580	and we will close your account and return your funds.
3768580	3771420	So in other words if you want to opt out then fuck off.
3771420	3772900	You can't use our service at all.
3772900	3776880	So it's not just a opt out because I want to sue you someday.
3776880	3781380	You know the only reason I'm like whatever Sony is because the PlayStation Network is
3781380	3782380	free.
3782380	3786180	So it's kind of one of those you know whatever but at the same time there is PlayStation
3786180	3787180	Plus.
3787180	3788180	Go ahead.
3788180	3793860	It says more actually says if the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable
3793860	3797860	the entire section 15 will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court
3797860	3802020	and you and the Sony entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive.
3802020	3805460	In that instance to the fullest extent allowed by the law in a trial by jury.
3805460	3808960	So in other words this may not actually be legal.
3808960	3813300	And if it ends up being illegal then you never said anything but there is a court case of
3813300	3815960	the AT&T that already set precedent that this is legal.
3815960	3816960	So wow.
3816960	3819660	You know not much you can do there.
3819660	3820660	I don't know.
3820660	3821660	That's just it does seem a little bit.
3821660	3822660	Here's here's the thing.
3822660	3824100	What am I actually going to sue Sony.
3824100	3826460	I mean what are they going to do to me.
3826460	3828380	That's really going to have me sue them.
3828380	3829380	Nothing.
3829380	3831360	I mean you know my cause I see them individually.
3831360	3832760	I'm still waiting on your own.
3832760	3834940	I'm still waiting for money back from Microsoft.
3834940	3838220	I'm more likely to sue them before I sue Sony.
3838220	3841540	Well it's basically saying you're sorry.
3841540	3842540	Go ahead.
3842540	3843540	Go ahead.
3843540	3844540	I was going to say.
3844540	3848540	But you'll be suing on an individual basis and not as a class action through Microsoft
3848540	3852260	has nothing to do with Sony true.
3852260	3855480	That's the whole point is like you can hire an attorney and you can spend all the money
3855480	3861020	to sue them on your own and get you know maybe 15000.
3861020	3866060	I'm just using an arbitrary figure 15000 dollars were as opposed to a class action lawsuit
3866060	3872420	with maybe a million users and each of them get five dollars that's five million bucks.
3872420	3874660	You know think about that.
3874660	3880820	It's it's a way to basically save their assets not assets assets and also because they're
3880820	3884780	a bigger company and they have money to throw at this type of stuff they can just drag it
3884780	3887420	out forever until you run out of money to fight it right.
3887420	3890700	It's kind of an intimidation thing it's kind of one of those where bigger than you are
3890700	3898100	so you can sue us and we'll just get scary scary station network but well you may not
3898100	3903060	use PlayStation Network but as Loki said AT&T set a precedent for this so maybe Sony setting
3903060	3906500	a precedent for this in the gaming world and by the time the Wii U comes out with its online
3906500	3915940	service it'll have something like this as well and Xbox Live may adopt a similar policy
3915940	3921640	when it does a little remodel this really needs to be because basically it's like they're
3921640	3924340	trying to manipulate the court system.
3924340	3934500	They should have no jurisdiction in determining how someone can legally challenge.
3934500	3937980	I like this salacious pop is just rambling about this in our chat room so I want to read
3937980	3941020	some of these comments here at chat dot orange on twitter dot com.
3941020	3942300	That is embarrassingly dumb.
3942300	3945660	The only reason why you'd ever need to be approached to be part of a class action and
3945660	3950140	having that class action go to trial is because there's obviously clearly incompetent shit
3950140	3954860	going on on a wide scale that is the point of a class action oh my god if you try to
3954860	3958820	form a class action and you don't have a case and you're just a butt mad neckbeard you'll
3958820	3963280	be laughed out of court class actions are the only real way you can make a company pay
3963280	3968580	huge punitive damages as punishment for their shady dealings in an individual case if you're
3968580	3972900	in the right yeah you'll get paid well but it won't be punitive damages kind of money
3972900	3980580	so sony is trying to protect their wallet that's exactly it i like butt mad neckbeard
3980580	3985580	makes me think of those guys that get up and ask questions at blizzcon well that's exactly
3985580	3990880	it i mean that was pretty much the the point i was trying to make they're trying to save
3990880	3994860	money and you know not basically have to take any responsibility for the shit that they're
3994860	3999300	doing at the end of the day i don't really like it but i hit accept anyway because i
3999300	4005260	wanted to like play my games online so well that's the problem what can you do that right
4005260	4010300	there is the problem i mean not no offense or anything i'm not like pointing at you but
4010300	4015460	that is that's why they they can get away with it because people will say oh i just
4015460	4020040	want to play my games i don't give a shit but that's how they're going to get away with
4020040	4023700	it but because there's going to be too many people what can you do what can you do how
4023700	4028100	can you hold this company accountable like i i still believe like even though whatever
4028100	4033700	at&t said a precedent if they fuck up on the scale of the network breach again i'm sorry
4033700	4039540	this little passage 15 isn't going to hold up you know congress is investigating sony
4039540	4044820	for their fuck up you know what i mean like if like you know they don't have a you know
4044820	4051300	deficit or anything to worry about so i don't know it's just but the whole the whole point
4051300	4055060	is that by sitting around and doing nothing they're going to get away with this as long
4055060	4059100	as they can a lot of people are going to get serious internet rage dark soccer that is
4059100	4064400	how we're responding with internet rage i am very upset at sony well there actually
4064400	4068140	is a number of things you can do you can write your you know your representatives to you
4068140	4073740	know double check the legality of this because uh clearly they're not going to you know they'd
4073740	4077860	have to evaluate it on a state-by-state basis too to see if any of that's going to fly because
4077860	4084060	they have to deal with state laws as well and they can't stand in the way of you know
4084060	4088780	legal proceeding or you can send loki's card with the giant middle finger i'm trying to
4088780	4093100	be serious i know i know the whole point is that it's something that should not be allowed
4093100	4100820	to to pass uh marisa con gusto in our chat room says there is pending legislation about
4100820	4105460	word salad legal agreements but this won't stop arbitration clauses which you are a part
4105460	4110500	of in many areas that you don't even know of that's very true very common like cell
4110500	4115040	phone agreements and just all sorts of anything you sign probably has some stupid arbitration
4115040	4122060	clause in it this country that that that that that that that i'd be interested though how
4122060	4127980	does sony protect themselves in other countries because if they were to screw up again that
4127980	4134820	might hold a legal thing in the u.s but did they have to do the same thing in canada or
4134820	4141740	they'd probably do whatever the equivalent law is you know have something kind of interesting
4141740	4145300	i don't know all right let's move on with some more gaming news we could talk about
4145300	4150340	this all night but so final fantasy 10 the remake is not the only final fantasy that's
4150340	4155820	coming out uh there's also well final fantasy 14 i guess is never coming out but um never
4155820	4162220	coming out working that is haha um but final fantasy 13 too though is on its way out it
4162220	4168980	is 90 complete as of tokyo game show and um they're showing some cool stuff including
4168980	4174380	there's going to be some bonus um features if you have a safe game for the original 13
4174380	4179800	game also there's going to be 150 monsters to raise and chocables uh will be writable
4179800	4187340	anywhere in the game and i guess they also have a series unique red chocobo as well that'll
4187340	4194380	be available and um i guess the game itself will feature time travel so that's kind of
4194380	4203100	neat um the game is launching uh next year on the north american region uh january 31st
4203100	4209260	and also uh europe is getting february 2nd japan is though seeing it this year on december
4209260	4217700	15th um plus they're also launching in japan with a exclusive uh playstation 3 system that's
4217700	4224540	pink and black and it's got a laser etched uh lightning on it the lightning edition version
4224540	4232520	2 which will include a 320 gigabyte hard drive the game and a controller for the price of
4232520	4240820	37,960 yen or 495 that's pretty awesome i don't know does seem a little weird that they're
4240820	4245860	releasing like a whole new playstation though like i don't know it's just it's just a limited
4245860	4249380	edition i mean whatever they did call dude wouldn't the final fantasy fans have already
4249380	4257020	bought one for final fantasy 13 the original um yeah maybe i don't know um and of course
4257020	4262500	as we said earlier uh final fantasy 10 the remake for playstation vita and playstation
4262500	4268140	3 that'll be coming out later on my bad on that loki sorry that's all right no big deal
4268140	4272100	we have to mention again because it's awesome it i it's something i'm gonna probably pick
4272100	4275700	up no doubt no i would love to see what i mean obviously this won't happen till they
4275700	4282540	kill off the playstation 2 version of it but uh an hd remake version of final fantasy 11
4282540	4286260	that's free to play would be awesome i could happen didn't i talk about this a couple weeks
4286260	4289740	ago on the show that they were investigating dumping the playstation 2 you yeah you did
4289740	4293860	mention that but actually hasn't there been a rumor about 11 on the vita already i think
4293860	4297820	there has yeah oh can you imagine if that game goes free to play i don't know what i'm
4297820	4304660	gonna do the wife won't have a reason to stop you now well you know what see here's the
4304660	4307860	thing though the only reason i didn't have i stopped my subscription because i don't
4307860	4313460	get a lot of time to play so it may be like maybe an hour or two every few days but if
4313460	4318940	it's free to play who gives a shit so i don't play for a few days or weeks or whatever i'm
4318940	4326980	not paying for it let me go to this next story which is uh yeah this is this is interesting
4326980	4331620	because this is about reviews uh and so we're gonna talk about game reviews for a little
4331620	4336460	bit as you know gears of war 3 is on its way out and it's it's kind of a big deal like
4336460	4340540	if you're into these types of shooter games at all it's kind of a big deal and the game's
4340540	4344620	getting good reviews it's getting a lot of great reviews glowing reviews everywhere uh
4344620	4351620	there was an article however with vg247.com that cliff basinski or cliffy b did talking
4351620	4356500	about gears of war let me read the little passage of the interview here were you pleased
4356500	4361920	with the review scores this morning asked the website cliff b said doing great apart
4361920	4367460	from a couple of haters magazine asked who were the haters and he said a certain gamer
4367460	4373140	of the euro so kind of uh calling out euro gamer and what was their problem with the
4373140	4377420	game i haven't read the review asked the magazine to which cliffy b followed up you know i don't
4377420	4382100	quite gather it i don't want to come across as defensive how do i phrase this properly
4382100	4387180	when people rated gear 2 higher than gears 3 it kind of upset me because i know gears
4387180	4392980	3 is a better game on every level now here's the punch line it sounds like eurogamer really
4392980	4396620	trashed the shit out of this game didn't it which they have done to some games and that
4396620	4403300	they put this game in the toilet this game got an 8 out of 10 by eurogamer and they are
4403300	4409820	haters because the game got an 8 out of 10 that's stupid care to elaborate why is it
4409820	4415900	stupid i don't know why would someone just start this off because i mean 8 out of 10
4415900	4421980	is good it's well above average you know maybe it's like oh i wanted a 9 out of 10 or 10
4421980	4425980	out of 10 because it was exceptional it's perfect we can do no wrong maybe it sounds
4425980	4430540	to me like the issue is gears 2 must have got a 9 or a 10 from the same website and
4430540	4441260	they dared to rate this game an 8 probably i mean i review scores you kind of have to
4441260	4445780	take with a grain of salt anyway i mean it's not like they rated a game of four and there
4445780	4449980	were some reviews out there on the internet they're rated final fantasy 13 a four out
4449980	4454860	of 10 i'm sorry look at duke nukem forever perfect example like there's a ton of shitty
4454860	4460300	reviews and there's a ton of really good reviews for it you have to look at your reviewer you
4460300	4465220	know that's why i always thought that one of the most fair um reviewing systems was
4465220	4473420	how um game pro used to do it so with their little uh faces emoticons no no no no how
4473420	4479180	they would have like pick one game and have five people score it oh that was an egm thing
4479180	4483260	now yeah that was egm sorry which is basically for me too well game pro used to do um two
4483260	4489220	people back and forth but i liked i liked how you would have the main reviewer who would
4489220	4493420	go over the the major points in the game and then you'd have what everyone else thought
4493420	4501060	of it and the average score is this that's fair i'm sorry first off why does anyone give
4501060	4505260	a shit what cliffy b wants because cliffy b is a fucking douchebag that's what it comes
4505260	4509220	down to he is a fucking douchebag he thinks he's a goddamn rock star because he has a
4509220	4514340	few good games under his belt yeah great okay yeah epic games make some pretty cool shit
4514340	4521560	and you act like a fucking douchebag so wow your game got an eight on one website go fucking
4521560	4525180	cry in a corner then you little bitch it's it's interesting though because like if the
4525180	4529640	game is that good then the review shouldn't matter right well here's the thing then if
4529640	4535340	you're so you know hard up on you know getting an 8.0 and stuff fine why don't you blacklist
4535340	4539280	eurogamer then if you're gonna take the high ground with that well my game was better i
4539280	4544100	thought so because i made it yeah you know what i bet people that thought you know i
4544100	4548060	bet the people that worked hard on duke nukem forever thought it was a great game too you
4548060	4553340	know you don't see them fucking crying the number one movie at the box office every year
4553340	4562620	is rarely the most well reviewed think about that because a lot of people have no taste
4562620	4569940	no he is a fucking douchebag plain and simple i don't really know the guy and i don't watch
4569940	4574300	a lot of television which we talked about earlier video game related stuff so i don't
4574300	4579340	know i i saw him once at e3 doing a demo i think at the first years of war game like
4579340	4583780	a long time ago he seemed fine to me whatever i don't i don't got a problem come on but
4583780	4589100	i i don't think an eight out of ten makes somebody a hater i understand you know if
4589100	4592700	i understand he's passionate about his game that's fine but you know what if i made a
4592700	4597340	fucking game and one site reviewed it you know a point lower than everybody else i wouldn't
4597340	4601280	care i'd be like okay that's their opinion fine you know what if everybody rated it like
4601280	4605460	a one or something like that or if like they came out and said i fucking hate the gears
4605460	4608780	war series so i'm going to give it a one out of ten or something like that then yeah he
4608780	4612740	could be pissed off but eight out of ten is just fine i don't understand what the big
4612740	4616300	deal is well it was like when the websites were giving final fantasy 13 of four out of
4616300	4620420	ten i was like okay these are the websites i can't trust their reviews ever again because
4620420	4624220	they're smoking crack over there they don't like the same games i like clearly remember
4624220	4629020	there were multiple websites that were bombing final fantasy 13 because it was too linear
4629020	4633060	but but i obviously didn't play uh far enough to find out when the game opens with the same
4633060	4639440	time though yes that's fine and it's up to the people reading i mean if you're dumb enough
4639440	4643560	to just go okay well this guy didn't like the game so i'm not gonna like it well yes
4643560	4649020	if he likes a similar type of games that you like and he didn't like it then yes but if
4649020	4652460	you're a gamer that's like well listen you can get a nine out of ten i can't buy this
4652460	4656680	game i'm sorry i don't think there's anyone out there that's like that if you're gonna
4656680	4659920	buy years of work because you like years of war it's not because someone gave it an eight
4659920	4664440	or nine out of ten and i think eight out of ten is just fine but the fact that he just
4664440	4671320	went out there and said wow eight out of ten that's what makes him a douchebag i'm sorry
4671320	4676320	tiger claw in our chat room at chat.org says you should never base your views on a game
4676320	4681200	based on a game review you play these games with an open mind and form your own opinion
4681200	4686440	about it i'm mostly inclined to agree with that statement and in theory that's a really
4686440	4692600	good statement but the only thing is that games cost 60 and if you're on the fence about
4692600	4698320	a game you gotta go off something i prefer that to be hands-on experience be it game
4698320	4704440	rental or game kiosk or something i mean usually i only drop 60 on a game on launch day because
4704440	4710040	i've either a played it at a trade show or b really liked other games in the series so
4710040	4714080	i've got to get it like civ 5 i bought right when it came out because i like the other
4714080	4718960	civ games skyrim i will buy day one because it's an elder scrolls game i've seen all the
4718960	4724560	stuff online i don't think it's going to disappoint me but games i'm on the fence about yeah maybe
4724560	4729080	i want to see some reviews on before i spend the money on it you know but i also think
4729080	4733640	the out of 10 system is kind of screwy anyway i just like if i were to review games i don't
4733640	4736960	write a lot of game reviews because i think i'm a better talker than i am a writer but
4736960	4740880	like if i were to do reviews like this like well we here on this even show we talk about
4740880	4744800	our gaming weeks we don't really give games scores uh i just kind of like to summarize
4744800	4751080	in a couple sentences you'll like this game if you like japanese rpgs otherwise maybe
4751080	4754440	and then sometimes there's a game where it's like wow i don't care what type of games you're
4754440	4758360	into you've got to check this out because it is doing something that no other game does
4758360	4762500	you know what i mean like i think that is the best way to sum up a game i think that's
4762500	4768280	more fair but the typical person wants to just say oh too long didn't read you can't
4768280	4775160	translate that into a metacritic score right so there you go all right anyhow i just wanted
4775160	4778560	to talk reviews for a little bit thought that would be a fun little tangent i'm gonna read
4778560	4784120	it seven out of ten are you going on a metacritic to read it seven i would know i was just gonna
4784120	4788880	see i want to see what the actual lowest review is on oh critic for sure i just want to see
4788880	4793560	if you know if anybody bombed it worse than eurogamer destructoid gave it an eight out
4793560	4798880	of ten as well do you do they well hold on it's metacritic is calling it an 80 but i
4798880	4802200	don't know destructories review scale that could also be four out of five stars could
4802200	4805960	be an eight okay that's still four out of five it's not five out of five or four and
4805960	4811500	a half out of five that's still 80 well you know what i have a friend who basically like
4811500	4815520	whenever you know we talk about a movie or something he's always talking about oh well
4815520	4819360	rotten tomatoes rated this and blah blah i'm like yeah but what did they say about the
4819360	4822080	movie what did they say about the acting what did they say about this because i don't really
4822080	4827720	give a crap what the score is i care what the part vinny and you know me i like your
4827720	4832000	movies that people have blasted if there's fun parts in them i'll watch the movie again
4832000	4837240	i'll go see it again i don't care because i enjoyed it my favorite movies are like stupid
4837240	4840760	movies like i like i like mystery science theater 3000 types of events that's why i
4840760	4845480	like showgirls so much showgirls is a terrible fucking movie but it is so much fun to watch
4845480	4852280	i know with friends well you remember my bachelorette party what did we watch barbarella in xanadu
4852280	4856160	i remember that that was great and then we went to the goth club that was great i think
4856160	4860960	that was the last time i went to the goth club that was the last time i went to good
4860960	4865040	time anyway well to that one anyway i went to the other ones let's move on let's move
4865040	4869120	on uh dark soccer you got a quick story for us and then release dates well basically um
4869120	4874480	microsoft is saying that um windows 8 will support xbox live but they're not really saying
4874480	4880200	anything else about games for windows live they're just basically like um uh they're
4880200	4884080	actual their spokesperson said and they quote we currently have nothing to announce beyond
4884080	4889840	the statement that major nelson posted on his blog so what i'm thinking is that you're
4889840	4896640	going to be able to manage your xbox live account and maybe some games will cross over
4896640	4901800	i think i could see some type of like messenger or video chat tie-in or skype or whatever
4901800	4905640	ultimate direction they go in i think just a way for like when you are signed into your
4905640	4910420	computer you are still within the xbox live network yeah what i'm wondering about is that
4910420	4915200	does this mean that you know they've talked about going more an app style direction with
4915200	4919520	windows 8 which you know obviously although you can use the classic you can you can but
4919520	4924020	they're calling like the desktop is like a type of app yeah saying it's weird but obviously
4924020	4928000	they're going that more apple route which you know is is not too surprising especially
4928000	4932280	because this runs on tablets but here's my question does that mean and i'm totally inferring
4932280	4938980	here but does that mean that apps will be run in microsoft points and maybe your points
4938980	4943400	are used across systems that would be very well that's how they did it with zoom i thought
4943400	4948440	zoom marketplace wasn't a all together it could yeah and it could but but at the same
4948440	4953400	time you know games for windows live or whatever ran in real dollars the my the xbox live does
4953400	4959400	use real dollars in one portion it's the uh uh buying the old games yeah uh games on demand
4959400	4963880	games on demand thank you it uses real dollars as opposed to the microsoft points so i could
4963880	4967360	go either way i don't know well and with points you know you're always gonna have leftover
4967360	4970380	you're gonna have an odd amount they've i think they've arranged it that way to where
4970380	4974000	you buy them you're gonna have some leftover well so if you want to get anything else you've
4974000	4980640	still got to have that not anymore actually not anymore uh they have changed the denominations
4980640	4984300	that you can buy uh yeah but depending on what you're buying you still i still find
4984300	4988400	myself left with like 80 points if you're buying you know if you're buying a card or
4988400	4991580	something like that where it's twenty dollar you know fifty dollar increments then yes
4991580	4996840	you may be left over stuff but they actually do have it now where you can buy 800 400 but
4996840	5001480	they want you to do that we're like oh i have 80 points in my account i i could get this
5001480	5006600	stupid little uh little hat for my avatar i never think of that i never think that you
5006600	5011640	don't but a lot of people do a lot of people do my only crazy purchase i ever did on playstation
5011640	5017380	network was dressing my character up like a hobo santa and i am still hobo santa in
5017380	5022420	home which i have not been to forever so probably dead hope santa at this point well and and
5022420	5027280	to be fair i did buy the taylor swift microphone for my avatar on xbox live actually the only
5027280	5032060	thing that i thought is i had leftover points and i bought one of the steampunk tops just
5032060	5034920	because i thought it was really cute so we've all been guilty of buying some stupid shit
5034920	5041320	online i hope santa is not free speaking of buying stupid shit let's travel around the

5330200	5338600	the 23rd we have supremacy mma f1 uh 2011 and uh that's it all right just a few more
5338600	5345080	stories before you guys before we get to the classic game of the week but first loki yes
5345080	5349400	um i think we talked a little bit about it last week how there was a cable company in
5349400	5356880	canada that was actually throttling uh internet speeds with uh gaming on them and it's actually
5356880	5362680	a little bit of a follow-up to that they've uh the canadian radio and television telecommunications
5362680	5369840	commission that's a mouthful uh cited that rogers own policy which claims that the online
5369840	5374240	games like world of warcraft um should not be throttled and telling the company has now
5374240	5379000	until september 27th to present a plan that keeps world of warcraft traffic and that of
5379000	5385260	other games unthrottled so i guess that's good news for canada wish uh wish we had people
5385260	5391080	that actually had power over here in the united states to do that kind of thing because internet
5391080	5396640	cable companies are running like crazy and pretty much have full power to throttle over
5396640	5401120	the fuck they want well they got the smackdown so that's a good little follow-up to what
5401120	5406480	we were talking about last week hooray yeah all right i want to talk about this this is
5406480	5411440	uh also in foreign country news this is about australia and one of the retailers they are
5411440	5419560	game australia they have a new customer rewards card uh and it's kind of interesting because
5419560	5427160	what the hell is this you use your fingers in place of naughty bits for example imagine
5427160	5431800	there's a guy standing on the card looking down towards his crotch and there's a hole
5431800	5436600	there for you to put your finger through and you can make it a little winky or you could
5436600	5442640	put two fingers through as you could hear on this little card and have a butt clearly
5442640	5447300	this is all just to be provocative and i'm kind of surprised no one over here has tried
5447300	5452600	this yet just getting people talking and so forth uh really that that's really all there
5452600	5459640	is to it it's just you know to you know look like a wiener and so forth however it is drawing
5459640	5464360	complaints of course not everybody likes this how dare you use two fingers to look like
5464360	5469360	a butt in the cutout of the card uh complaints have been filed with the accc that is the
5469360	5474540	australian competition and consumer commission game has not acknowledged or commented on
5474540	5479360	these complaints uh when questioned about these cards they just talk about how great
5479360	5483880	the reward programs is and all the stuff that they can get back we've decided to relaunch
5483880	5487800	the reward card program with its extra benefits blah blah blah blah blah and your finger's
5487800	5493720	a wiener no they haven't said anything about that of course i will say this there is that
5493720	5498480	kind of hidden you know undertone and that is when the major media reports on this it
5498480	5506440	just makes gamers look like a bunch of immature assholes of course you said ass and hole remember
5506440	5513160	the wiener is you all right a winner is you right now because right now we're going to
5513160	5519300	go through the gaming archives and find a classic game of the week every week dark sakura
5519300	5523760	dives into the gaming vault and pulls out a game that she thinks hey you kids need to
5523760	5529440	show this game more respect screw the vita and screw the 3ds back in my day this game
5529440	5537760	was the bee's knees dark sakura i can make better boobs in chat than kevin68 can seriously
5537760	5543120	that's right a lot better chat um the today's game is the sims
5545600	5550400	yes the sims the game that started it on while we're all playing that stupid game on facebook
5550400	5558000	um basically the sims is uh a game is this actual game noises sorry yes that's actual game noises
5558000	5562800	and they're playing in a fast four which is like the best one i can find okay but it's a
5562800	5569200	life simulation game pretty much it's um was uh designed by will wright which you know what else
5569200	5576880	he did sim city so basically you can control and spore you can control your little sim person or
5576880	5584640	some people or sim family in their little lives and suburbs and so uh that's really the game but
5584640	5591040	it's on all kinds of expansion packs and stuff and now we're on the sims 3 which i've been playing
5591760	5596080	so basically the way that your sim let's just say that you've got one sim you may
5596080	5602240	name him you know bob the sim or something so they've got you've got npc's and you've got your
5602240	5607520	actual sim and your sim can interact with the npc's and get married you eventually will be able to
5607520	5612480	control the sim that they marry blah blah but you have different stages of life you can make an
5612480	5618960	you have an infant a child and an adult and that's just in the sims um babies will grow into children
5618960	5624240	and children and adults never age so that means that they can stay in their little lifespan
5624240	5628960	indefinitely but they can die from different stuff like burning to death drowning in a pool
5628960	5633200	starving dying from disease and the grim reaper will come and take them away but you have to win
5633200	5639120	against them in rock paper scissors um or you will actually die your sim will actually die and
5639120	5644880	stay dead and your tombstone will show up i like in sims 3 how you know if you kill a sim they'll
5644880	5650720	just start haunting the house it's pretty awesome anyway um you've got uh live mode which is uh
5650720	5655200	where you do all your you know your gameplay and then you have build and buy mode where build mode
5655200	5662320	is where you build your house you start off with 20 000 simoleons which is their uh uh money system
5663040	5669920	and you've got buy mode where you can buy house parts and do stuff so in your lives your sims do
5669920	5674880	have a little bit of free will they can you know autonomously do stuff you can control i think the
5674880	5682960	level of their free will and but basically you still have to make them pee you have to
5682960	5686880	make them find a job and pay their bills and work out and you know make babies and shit
5688080	5695120	but basically you go make a baby i thought it was funny um because this actually mentions
5695120	5700480	that their system of needs follow maslow's hierarchy of needs in which the physiological
5700480	5708080	needs must be satisfied before other needs can be attended to so you know they they'll piss it you
5708080	5712160	know they'll piss on the floor if you know you don't tell them to go to the bathroom or if like
5712160	5717280	you forget to build a toilet which i had a friend do or if they don't eat they'll die of starvation
5717840	5722880	so they're and their needs their physical needs are what govern their mood so the the more that
5722880	5728320	their needs are taken care of the better mood that they'll be in i've got needs or for example
5728320	5733680	if you're playing um the the sim social you know how you don't get inspired until all your needs
5733680	5739120	are in the green same diff then you'll be happy i'm thinking i'm done with sim social and i'm
5739120	5745680	gonna block it on facebook i don't like it i like my house i hate the spammy spam like it's getting
5745680	5751120	bad yeah like there's a little do you need to put a feedback window where you can leave them
5751120	5757360	feedback about oh really not liking any of that so you might want to try to leave i got feedback
5757360	5767040	block well anyway so basically it's kind of like an artificial life program if you look at it in
5767040	5771760	that respect and you can keep playing and playing and like i used to in the first things i used to
5771760	5776320	just kill people all the time and um my friend had a great everybody did that with the sims
5776320	5780720	at first you have to create creative death traps for your sims like it's just it's a way of getting
5780720	5785760	out stress well one of my friends actually had what she called the house of death and like it
5785760	5790560	was all kinds of ways that you know they could set themselves on fire and things and she had
5790560	5798640	a graveyard in front of the house it was it was julius house dan i'm sure you remember that um so
5798640	5803440	basically um now if with your kids you can they can study at home and keep their grades up but
5803440	5807680	if they miss too many school days they are transported to a military academy indefinitely
5809040	5814960	and they can't um prepare food or earn money so basically they're useless children are useless
5814960	5823840	so i mean basically your sims can fight with other sims they do stuff and they can actually be uh
5823840	5830000	locked into an undead state by keeping them from leaving the hot tub or the bed and so they'll like
5830000	5837360	keep interacting with other people but they won't be able to leave they can't even they don't they
5837360	5844000	don't die they're just undead so basically um in the first sims it actually did use a combination
5844000	5851200	of 2d and 3d the sims themselves are 3d but everything in it are pre-rendered so the game
5851200	5860880	clearly has been a success it uh sold more than 6.3 million copies worldwide and as of uh
5863920	5870480	as of february 7 2005 had 16 million copies shipped worldwide and of course it's been highly
5870480	5878560	pirated and um the music in the game was done by jerry martin mark russo kirk r casey and dicks
5878560	5882960	bruce and these people have actually i think gone through and done all the other sim music so you
5882960	5886880	can actually buy soundtracks of all the sim music and it's got its own little unique perky little
5886880	5893360	style you know it's cute now this is the part that i am interested in in particular is simlish
5893360	5900640	which they wanted to avoid a way to um they wanted to avoid localization of spoken dialogue
5900640	5905440	so the best way for them to do it was to create a language now simlish can i play some of the songs
5905440	5910160	in simlish because they're really bad find find the lily allen one find the one for smile because
5910160	5918000	it was actually really cute and the video is adorable um is that it yes there's an elifertado
5918000	5928720	one by the way
5928720	5932400	this kind of reminds me of uh kids bop i don't know why the nelifertado was actually kind of cool
5932400	5938320	too baby language bop well the whole point was with simlish oh and didn't katie perry did yeah
5938320	5942640	i was gonna say here here's one for uh salacious pop who i know is a huge fan of this artist
5942640	5950480	it's funny that's why you hear when it hears the song if you play it backwards it's devil's speak
5950480	5957520	and that's why she's popular listen she's listen play it backwards she's saying that she killed
5957520	5974080	michael jackson to get that record but actually these little videos that they did for him were
5974080	5980240	really cute anyway anyway simlish is really a bunch of gibberish but um they were gonna actually
5980240	5989680	base it they created it by experimenting with ukrainian french and tagalog and he wanted to
5989680	5996400	base it off of navajo but instead just went for gibberish that sounds like the same inflections
5996400	6000720	that you'd hear in everyday speech they really got those bitches to sing in a baby language
6000720	6005440	pretty much i was watching how did somebody convince katie perry that's a good idea
6005440	6014080	cha-ching you like money bitch right here's some money there was a special about it um i watched
6014080	6018080	like one of the behind the scenes for the sims 3 about them recording some of the songs in simlish
6018080	6022720	and basically they are just nonsensical things that fit the phrasing of the original song
6023520	6028480	and they're like you know it was kind of fun and you know it's kind of neat to see the sim version
6028480	6033920	of me and you know so like besides being paid i've seen a lot about the songs that i've seen
6033920	6037440	besides being paid i've seen a lot amounts of money you know they said it was fun they just
6037440	6044240	showed what the lyric sheet looked like and it was all me my moo my mama me horgy wow you know
6044800	6052080	whatever they say in sim simlish but um the different expansions were living large
6052720	6060160	house party hot date vacation unleashed superstar superstar and making magic which was the last one
6060160	6067520	and then sims 2 came out and then we have sims 3 now and honestly i think sims 2 was kind of better
6067520	6075440	than sims 3 but i really like sims 3 except it's so fucking slow ah but now keep in mind there's
6075440	6082480	also a ton of mods out there in fact i think maxis really doesn't give a shit about the modding
6082480	6086400	community i mean they've tried they say oh people want special stuff so they've got their own sim
6086400	6091760	store and everything now but really the modding community is just crazy and there's even like
6091760	6096320	special modding tools now for for like universe makers and they've released their own custom
6096320	6102800	universe maker and since too they had um custom build the fucking universe they had a custom sims
6102800	6108320	maker where you could try on skins and different things and really just do all kinds of neat stuff
6108320	6115040	to them and now like in sims 3 you can adjust their boob size there's there's um uh model
6115040	6119600	modifiers built in like you could even change all kinds of features on their face and everything
6119600	6124640	but people have gone further and made boob modifiers and butt modifiers and hip modifiers and
6124640	6128480	there's even um elven ear modifiers where you can give them a combination between
6128480	6134720	tulcan style elven ears and wow style elven ears or you can just get really huge dumbo ears so
6135760	6143680	it's just you can farm you can and now the first thing that i did whenever uh in sims 3 now
6143680	6149680	whenever i just you know met some random person and ended up marrying them like um they my sim
6149680	6154160	that was carrying around like a relationship with five girls and two dudes like for some time
6154160	6159040	finally ended up marrying some girl sim slut so it's finally ended up marrying some girl except
6159040	6164800	her model was like really crappy so you can actually go into uh um the the stylist mode
6164800	6169920	are you saying you bought your wife a ton of plastic surgery yes i did yes i did i made my
6169920	6175200	wife look not not because honestly the original sim faces and since they were really derpy
6176080	6179520	so and now there's all kinds of special skins and hairs and stuff that doesn't look too derpy
6180960	6185280	and but anyway the first sims is what started it all and i played a good bit of that and i played
6185280	6189360	a lot of sims 2 because sims 2 was the one where they figured out how to crack the animation code
6189360	6194000	and started having dirty things like you could buy dildos and a rug that had like you know
6194640	6199600	butt sex animation and all kinds of stuff well this is a well-timed classic game of the week
6199600	6205520	because you know the sims is or was like the biggest pc game ever it might have got beat by
6205520	6209440	world of warcraft eventually i don't know or one of the blizzard games but uh the sims is still
6209440	6214240	in a huge huge pc game and obviously with the sim social now being like a huge facebook game
6214240	6218560	despite the fact that that thing spams the shit out of all your friends with all facebook
6218560	6224160	it is topical to make sure you know where that comes from well i'm sure everybody has that story
6224160	6229840	about you know terrorizing sims now here's actually a little um bit of news that i just
6229840	6235120	found out i wasn't aware of on may 25th 2007 there's a sims film rights were purchased by
6235120	6239840	twin the century fox being written by brian lynch what the fuck would you do in a sims movie i don't
6239840	6244880	know a movie about life everyone's walking around with a little plumb bob over their head which is
6245600	6251600	unless it's like a cartoon or something and the original sim site by max has been disconnected
6251600	6259120	for 11 years and is now replaced by the sims 3 site all right is that it on sims that's it
6259120	6266320	there it is your classic game of the week pork me do the sims pork me do by maxis for the pcl though
6266320	6272720	now it's it's all ea it's all part of that big you know glomerate so that's going to do it for

6358080	6363280	it's a game that's kind of more for western audiences but one man uh in particular though
6363280	6371120	in japan uh is very interested in the series and he's kind of crazy himself uh tomanobu
6371120	6379520	itigaki you may remember him as uh the uh driving force between and uh team ninja and uh you know

6389760	6395280	um and he's also in saints row the third as a playable character so that's pretty awesome
6395280	6398720	didn't really say god they just keep shoving more and more in this game don't they didn't really see
6398720	6404880	who who his character is but uh he apparently took control of his character um and was punching
6404880	6411440	people in the crotch so why not gotta love it um so that's pretty sweet uh some other cool stuff
6411440	6417600	uh was being shown off at toku game show project draco and what uh project draco is it's kind of
6417600	6425280	like a spiritual successor or inspired by panzer dragoon game and it's gonna be a connect title

6432000	6439360	uh panzer dragon based on the video that i've seen for it so um very very cool and then um

6523040	6528880	band this week heart-shaped box rape me well that's a family-friendly song all apologies and
6528880	6532400	you know you're right are all coming out those are actually some really big nirvana songs so
6532400	6538560	that's that's pretty cool it's a celebration of the 20th anniversary of nirvana's nevermind album
6538560	6543840	although it's weird because none of those tracks were actually on nevermind but if i'm not mistaken
6543840	6548400	nevermind that whole album was already released into rock band some time ago maybe for the
6548400	6554080	15th or something i don't know they are doing pro guitar and bass upgrades for plenty of nirvana
6554080	6559280	songs including smells like teen spirit the live lithium and come as you are live all those are
6559280	6564080	getting upgrades there's like actually like 10 songs getting upgrades so you can use all three
6564080	6570000	chords if you if you are a nirvana fan uh you're gonna have a happy week in rock band this week
6570000	6575200	uh i heard uh i heard dark soccer give a little squee at this next story uh if you are a fan of
6575200	6581680	capcom fighters one of the missing ones is coming out on the playstation store cyberbots full metal
6581680	6589040	madness don't you know cyber bosses capcom's number one game really that's a quote from
6589040	6594880	uh puzzle fighter oh from devilot that's right all right there you go uh so anyway uh that is
6594880	6601520	coming out on the uh playstation store is that coming out in america too or just just japan
6602720	6606320	well i imagine it'll probably come out in both time to hook up the saturn i think it's coming
6606320	6609760	out in the us as well so if you uh like your capcom fighters that's gonna be a pretty big
6609760	6615520	deal it's not like they have a lot of japanese change in it uh tokyo game show produced from
6615520	6622080	square enix this music sampler it's the music sampler cd 2011 volume 6 it might have spoiled
6622080	6628000	some of the upcoming cd releases from squenix now you know there's going to be a final fantasy 13 2
6628000	6633040	soundtrack of the final fantasy type 0 soundtrack that's no surprise but the announced for the ds
6633040	6638800	bravely default yes that was a name of a ds game that was announced 3ds game uh that is getting a
6638800	6643840	soundtrack apparently as well as is theta rhythm which isn't really a surprise either uh however
6643840	6649520	there's some interesting arranged music that has uh tracks on the sampler cd piano collections
6649520	6655600	final fantasy one two three an el shaddai remix album called el shaddai and the astral's that's
6655600	6662080	kind of interesting uh also uh i guess something called cafe sq which is supposed to be some type
6662080	6667440	of musical tribute to second at tetsu the 20th anniversary of that as well so pretty interesting
6667440	6672320	there that'll uh i guess we i think that's already being given out the sampler is being
6672320	6676560	given out at tokyo game show but the rest of those cds probably throughout the next couple quarters
6677520	6684240	moving on dark sakura i was actually i misquoted the line is what you don't recognize me cyber
6684240	6694080	boss is kalcom's number one game anyway 50 points from griffin door by me portal is free very very
6694080	6700800	free on steam until september 20th but go get it now because it's steam and portal and it's free
6700800	6707040	and very short it makes me throw up next up knights of the old republic is going down to
6707040	6712320	three pounds 50 pence on steam this weekend actually it's a whole half price on all the
6712320	6718080	star wars games and the same goes for the u.s only in dollars and cents and uh so if you want
6718080	6725680	to get your scrotor on go for it and just call it scrotor yes i did you're so mature i know right
6726320	6733200	batman arkham city will actually have another character in it deadshot ooh and he will be in
6733200	6738880	there to take out a series of high value targets so batman has to protect them and also other
6738880	6746000	characters in there are uh rock steady and joker hugo strange two-faced harley quinn riddler
6746000	6752400	poison ivy mr free penguin and the calendar man that's it that arkham city game is looking to be
6752400	6759440	pretty sweet i gotta say yes but rob a lot of fun what scrotor shut up all right uh definitely get
6759440	6763520	the free portal i mean it's it's free it's just obviously a draw to get more people on steam i
6763520	6767360	think everybody already got this like two years ago when it was free before when it came out on
6767360	6771680	mac yeah when steam for mac came out then portal came out for free but if for whatever reason you
6771680	6776960	just you've been resistant to steam or and you didn't get it last time or if somehow you're like
6776960	6781680	the one person that hasn't played portal yet you you really should just like try it like i'm not
6781680	6786000	just saying that it is a pretty fucking rad game it's really awesome it's super cool even if you
6786000	6789520	hate first-person shooters it's more of a puzzle game i don't like first-person shooters and i play
6789520	6795760	the hell out of portal 2 yeah yeah and portal 2 is so fucking good i know uh before we get back
6795760	6799520	into some long form news i want to give a plug for this um i didn't talk about this at the
6799520	6803440	beginning of the show because i wanted you know the people that really stick with the show into a
6803440	6807600	uh who stick with it to really hear this um because you're gonna hear this on a lot of
6807600	6811760	podcasts over the next few weeks it's that time of year where the podcast awards are coming around
6811760	6816400	and i'm i'm always kind of on the fence about this like i don't like that it's like a gigantic
6816400	6821600	popularity contest it was a lot more fun the first year and i'm not just saying that because we won
6821600	6825680	although you know obviously that that helped uh but it was more about like independent
6825680	6830800	shows then like it seriously seemed like all of the independent independent video game podcast
6830800	6835920	that existed at the time this is a long time ago uh this is like six years ago were nominated that
6835920	6842240	year um i don't think we've been nominated since and let's be real as much as i don't like that
6842240	6848160	it's a popularity contest and you hear about this on every single show it is really good exposure
6848160	6854080	for the show and kind of helps us stand out in a very crowded field of uh podcasts if we do get
6854080	6859120	nominated and possibly win i would really just i mean we've won before so it's cool as long as
6859120	6863680	some independent podcast wins i think that's really important and uh i don't want to see
6863680	6870080	a bunch of corporate funded paid for commercialized podcasts get nominated so
6870880	6876000	i'm gonna just kind of bite the bullet and ask would you consider nominating orange lounge radio
6876000	6882080	for best gaming podcast it's www.podcastawards.com i believe nominations are open until like the
6882080	6886160	30th so not too much longer this is probably the only time you're going to hear us mention on the
6886160	6891120	show please if you like the show it's free we don't shove commercials down your throat just
6891120	6895920	help us get this exposure it's all we really ask head over to podcastawards.com and please consider
6895920	6902800	nominating us for best gaming podcast um you can only nominate the show in like one category you
6902800	6908080	maybe can do best produced as well yeah i'm not i i don't even have delusions that we would get
6908080	6914320	nominated in those categories yeah right so i don't well somehow many years ago we got nominated for
6914320	6919760	best of life 365 best station well i know how we did it it's because our fans are awesome and
6919760	6926320	because not a lot of life 365 stations had rabid fan bases like ours we may not have thousands of
6926320	6932080	listeners we have loyal listeners and that is that is an awesome feeling above all else like
6932080	6937040	even if we don't get nominated oh wells you know we still have you guys that turn up on sunday
6937040	6941760	nights and then download our podcast every week that makes it worthwhile but i'm just gonna say
6941760	6947680	if you like the show help us get the exposure get us the nomination we'll go to the stinking
6947680	6951920	ceremony maybe adam curry will be there again dark soccer went to the first award ceremony
6951920	6956000	what is it to that she has the award sitting up on the desk yeah 2005 podcast awards for
6956000	6962400	i'll put the picture up on to go addition with uh next to and you saw adam curry's hair right
6962400	6966880	oh your mic just literally fell apart live on air that's why we're not going to get nominated folks
6968080	6973600	yes he had he had um the rock star type hair you know like the bon jovi style hair you know where
6973600	6979120	they did have really long bushy 80s hair and then got it cut into that 90s cut he had that
6980080	6984720	uh and uh let's see oh brad from pod cultures in the chat saying i don't mess with the podcast
6984720	6989280	awards we don't stand a chance well then i'll then i'll say go nominate pod culture for best
6989280	6992640	sci-fi is there like a sci-fi category there's got to be right there's got to be like a fandom
6992640	6997280	or sci-fi category go dominate pod culture for that i would say nominate bobby but he would be
6997280	7002000	he would be kind of competition so he would if he gets nominated we don't definitely vote for him
7002880	7008480	uh no you know what nominate bobby for best produced because he's a one-man band and he works
7008480	7013280	his ass off every week to do and he's juggling his whole little drum thing that he does with the
7013280	7019200	football nfl with his show so nominate him for best produced we don't we just we just want people
7019200	7022960	more people to hear about our show because we can't afford to advertise in magazines and all
7022960	7028880	that good stuff so podcastwords.com nominate us for best gaming podcast nominate us only once
7028880	7035040	it's uploading oh the award we won with unpun man awesome it would be it'd also be kind of neat like
7035040	7039280	i gotta say i'm not gonna lie be kind of neat to have won that award like in 2005 and then like if
7039280	7046800	we get nominated again if big if i don't think any other show maybe certainly no other gaming shows
7046800	7053680	could claim that they've been nominated that many years apart yeah i don't know maybe what other
7053680	7057600	shows from back then are still going i think video game news radio is probably the only one
7058560	7061600	i think they're still going i think they're still live or they're not live on all games they do the
7061600	7066640	tape thing on all games so maybe they they could get in there too which would be cool i'd be happy
7066640	7071440	for them it's another indie show those guys work hard yeah so as long as an indie show wins at the
7071440	7077600	end of the day i'm happy but if freaking blank blank blank corporate website wins i'm not going
7077600	7082240	to be happy so let's at least push some indie to the top okay i've said last year
7085680	7092240	i think it was four player podcast which i think actually um i i see some of them on twitter so
7092240	7096640	they are an indie thing i think they're like a justin tv related thing they do a lot with that
7096640	7100880	stuff which we used to do the video broadcast but they've taken it all to the next level i
7100880	7105520	think they were the ones that won last year so that that is definitely an indie show as well
7105520	7111600	and and if they win it again good on them good for them all right let's move on though more
7111600	7116240	gaming news i don't want to talk about that anymore i've given it far too much time loki uh
7116240	7123360	yes um so let's talk about gamestop you know how they have their streaming service coming
7123360	7129440	um well we know that because the whole whole debacle with uh you know deus x and that kind
7129440	7135200	of stuff but uh there's a little bit more to that as well um they've announced that they're
7135200	7141120	going to be doing some sort of uh android branded tablet or i guess there'll be an android tablet
7141120	7146160	that's gamestop branded that's going to be a pair to the dedicated controller peripheral that's
7146160	7152240	going to be coming out later next year and the thought is that the device will support i guess
7152240	7160320	mobile apps and the goals allow full streaming of release titles to the tablet kind of like on live
7160320	7167360	or something like that very interesting and very unsettling creepy to me but yeah fine if you want
7167360	7173040	to release a tablet that's fine it's more power to you but at the same time the tablet market is
7173040	7181680	pretty crowded so i'll pass thanks exactly that's that's pretty much what i have to say on that i
7181680	7191120	just pass i i don't know i i think it's gonna be difficult for them to do that but they want to try
7191120	7195360	fine dart has to be in our chat room at chat.org saying you're not supposed to say the name of the
7195360	7205760	company whatever you know you know how we feel all right uh moving on to some other gaming news
7205760	7210160	or actually this isn't really gaming per se but it's certainly that uh gaming device that you use
7210160	7213440	for gaming that's sitting in your living room that's soon going to be your entertainment device
7213440	7218720	if it's not already microsoft is launching a tv service for the xbox 360 this holiday season you
7218720	7224000	kind of already knew that via e3 but it was confirmed by microsoft ceo steve balmer at a
7224000	7229120	financial analyst meeting that happened this past week microsoft is working with quote dozens or
7229120	7235760	hundreds of additional video content suppliers how to dozens or hundreds what how does that even work
7235760	7242240	well whatever um xbox tv is going to use the connect it's going to use bing and all that stuff
7242240	7247760	you know like you were seeing in that demo at e3 uh and uh yeah it's there's a big difference
7247760	7252080	between dozens and hundreds there is a big difference between dozens and hundreds there
7252080	7257920	you know working with one or a million somewhere between that i guess it's probably hard because
7257920	7261920	they don't have a lot confirmed right now but i wonder if this is like xbox's kind of way to take
7261920	7267040	a jab at netflix while they're down which is interesting because netflix is a big it's weird
7267040	7272320	because netflix is a big part of the 360 right now anyway but a lot of you know netflix has
7273040	7277120	really had a hard past couple months and it's just going to get worse for them when they lose stars
7277120	7284800	so yeah their stock is tumbling if microsoft pays out the anus to get all these agreements that
7284800	7291520	netflix is losing it could be the thing to have i don't know it's gonna be interesting so wonder
7291520	7298720	if their service is really popular if they just drop netflix you never know it's possible so is
7298720	7305840	there any interest in um um a microsoft tv network i'd check it out i mean if it's gonna be included
7305840	7311200	as part of my gold subscription then sure hell yeah free tv i especially if they have on-demand
7311200	7316240	stuff even if it's commercials if i get it for free i'm fine i get limited cable now fucking
7317120	7321440	fx i don't get that anymore because they're paying for limited cable and actually at my
7321440	7327680	box as an error right now so i don't get any on demand whatsoever um so yeah i look forward to
7327680	7334400	anything free i'll cancel cable again i would even just be happy if i could watch like shows
7334400	7340000	that are on cbs just later when i want not have to go on to cbs.com but like watch it in hd on my tv
7340000	7343760	i would really like that like just being able to watch survivor like the next day because wednesday
7343760	7348800	nights are raid nights so i can't watch survivor live shut up don't judge me uh cinderwolf is in
7348800	7354080	our chat room at chat.orangeandre.com a proud canadian because uh he's saying and canada gets
7354080	7358960	short changed again as we have been with the internet tv feature included within windows
7358960	7365840	media center well hasn't this similar feature been out in like europe and britain specifically
7365840	7369920	for some time like the sky tv arrangement or is this like is this even beyond that like this is
7369920	7374640	just a step further where microsoft is now like trying to be the cable provider they're going a
7374640	7379120	little further because before like i've heard a bunch of things i've heard one they're talking
7379120	7384800	about working with your own cable con like basically it would be like a portal to the
7384800	7390320	on-demand content that you have with whatever cable provider they have um to that they are
7390320	7395040	going to be the content provider for all that stuff i would prefer the latter because you know
7395920	7401120	i if i want to watch on demand stuff i can just do it through my tv you know if if we're talking
7401120	7406800	about my cable provider if you know i i rather be microsoft's own content you know some original
7406800	7413440	shows be nice or you know i or just one versus 100 coming back i'm never gonna let up on that
7414240	7419120	um but i think canada will probably get it eventually but you're you the way of thinking
7419120	7422960	is probably right because there's a follow-up comment here cinderwolf says content will be
7422960	7427920	extremely changed and limited compared to us tv available online sadly he's probably right
7427920	7432000	is that canada will probably get it eventually so will mexico so we'll you know wherever else
7432000	7442400	xbox does business yeah whatever you saw tech tv so stop bitching so i will swap you you can have
7442400	7449280	all the crappy content that we have here and i'll take tech tv that would you know it would be kind
7449280	7453520	of cool if it would work the other way and we could get some canadian shows here like oh yeah
7453520	7458160	they get because of the content laws up there they get a lot of localized versions of shows too like
7458160	7463360	they have uh or they had so you think you can dance canada they had canadian idol and all that
7463360	7468160	stuff i don't think they have a lot of these shows anymore and but uh i don't know it might be fun to
7468160	7473360	watch like tech tv and stuff there's many countries that have their own version of the office so that
7473360	7479360	would be kind of oh yeah yeah be fun all right anyhow let's move on with some more gaming news

7704240	7708320	i don't know how i feel about that rob that's right neither do i so let's get back into the
7708320	7713280	show get some more news out we'll get the twitter topics and skype line coming very soon
7713280	7719920	but first loki yeah we talked a little bit earlier part a about yeah developers bitching and moaning
7719920	7727600	about their games and how they're treated poor poor my 8 8.0 what'd you get at nine well there's
7727600	7734240	a different person um bitching now quadratic dreams co-founder i'm not even trying to pronounce
7734240	7741040	his name some french guy anyways uh he estimates that the studio lost between um five and ten
7741040	7748800	million euro um due to second-hand sales um basically we sold today approximately two
7748800	7754960	million units we know from the trophy system that probably three more than three million people uh
7754960	7760640	bought the game and played it um a small level it's a million people playing the game without
7760640	7767200	giving me one cent too fucking bad is what i say to that what about the rentals or friends loaning
7767200	7774240	their copies to other friends or multiple psn accounts on the same playstation or you know
7774240	7780960	too fucking bad is what i say i i don't care you know what that's that's a fact of any business out
7780960	7787760	there there's going to be a second-hand market for it cars appliances electronics movies games
7787760	7794960	furniture whatever you suck it up that's part of the economy is that there's going to be secondhand
7794960	7800960	sales and if you try to prevent it no one's gonna buy your product first hand make an awesome game
7800960	7805840	that people want to buy day one you know what i mean heavy rain although heavy rain is a pretty
7805840	7813200	good game heavy rain is all right but it's you know people get how much replayability is there
7813200	7818960	really with heavy rain i mean it's a pretty linear game once you're done the thing you know it's like
7818960	7823520	watching a movie i mean once you've seen it so many times unless you're a super fan of the movie
7823520	7830000	you can probably get rid of it and be fine um you know and his other comment is all now uh are games
7830000	7834240	too expensive i've always said the games are probably too expensive so there's probably a
7834240	7839200	right level here to find and we need to discuss this all together and try to find a way that i
7839200	7845280	would i would say reconcile consumer expectations retail expectations but also the expectations of
7845280	7849520	the publishers and developers who make this business uh worthwhile business
7852400	7858000	but once again though i i don't feel bad for you that your game sold used too fucking bad
7858000	7863360	where all the other publishers bitching about secondhand sales you know from their games
7863360	7868880	suck it up hey you know what you sold a couple million copies people are interested maybe that's
7868880	7873680	better than most games do if you know if you have three million people play your game and you
7873680	7878800	release a sequel maybe they'll those three million people will buy it new instead of buying it used
7878800	7883520	but you know what there's always gonna be people buying your game used and i think that's a good
7883520	7888240	thing because at least they're buying your game or interested in your product and they may become
7888240	7893760	fans of your publishing comp or your you know development house or whatever and let me see hey
7893760	7897600	there's a game that i may be more interested in purchasing new and it's by this you know development
7897600	7906480	house yeah maybe i'm gonna go buy it um but you know i i just this type of mind frame and stuff
7906480	7911040	it just to me it seems like the next step is oh i'm gonna try to find a way to prevent the
7911040	7916720	secondhand sales and then that's where we getting the whole other problems but it's not gonna go
7916720	7922240	away all right well let's move on to a story about a game that maybe some folks would have bought
7922240	7926720	new i know a lot of people bought it new over here or put out more dlc because then those people
7926720	7931040	about you way to ruin my transition can buy the dlc i think there is dlc for heavy rain isn't it
7931040	7937280	put more all right anyhow let's talk about uh rock band in japan i didn't know this that harmonix
7937280	7942880	was uh teaming up with q entertainment back in 2008 to actually put rock band out in japan but
7942880	7948000	it didn't happen uh q entertainment actually walked away from it now apparently um harmonix
7948000	7952720	uh didn't end up ever putting the game out in japan uh they said that they were i guess there's
7952720	7956160	been questions that have come up at tokyo game show this week and so forth because you know they
7956160	7962240	did put out dance central which is uh also you know coming out in japan uh dance central too and
7962240	7965280	in an interview this week they were saying that they were very much interested in bringing the
7965280	7970160	experience to the japanese market but there were just some challenges a lot of it had to do with
7970160	7975120	the fact that you know trying to get all those plastic peripherals to an island country i guess
7975120	7980080	proved difficult just the fact that people have smaller homes and all that stuff of course i kind
7980080	7985280	of go well what about like guitar hero and or excuse me uh guitar freaks and drum freaks and
7985280	7992880	all that um harmonix i guess at one point was looking at arcades as a way to do it but they
7992880	7997200	said that arcades are very very noisy and if you're trying to make something that's really a
7997200	8003120	musical experience it uh and you've got 37 other arcade machines all turned up to full volume it
8003120	8010400	kind of impairs the musicality of the experience um i don't know konami's done pretty well at least
8010400	8014640	in the past didn't guitar you see i thought that rock band always had come out in japan but i guess
8014640	8018960	not i guess it was guitar hero did guitar hero came out over there they got the exact same game
8018960	8023120	we got you see here's the answer to that you know if it's louder you put more speakers in your
8023120	8027840	cabinet that's it so it's louder that's right more louder
8030160	8034960	there you go uh legend of zaku and chat says bullshit konami was trying to sue their ass
8034960	8039520	that's why i don't remember that wasn't the lawsuit lawsuit was never about harmonix wasn't
8039520	8046640	about activision i think it was activision i don't remember it's all been so long ago now
8046640	8053760	2008 that was like three years ago good lord all right uh dark soccer what do you got for us
8054800	8061600	just something about oblivion the european um oblivion fifth anniversary edition release date
8061600	8068480	in fact if anyone's interested it will be on september 23rd and it will be 20 pounds on ps3
8068480	8075760	and xbox 360 and 18 pounds on pc it's going to be the game of the year edition of oblivion which has
8075760	8081440	the download content add-ons shivering aisles and knights of the nine and in the box are the making
8081440	8088800	of oblivion dvd and a color map of the world and the shivering aisles so we've had the regular
8088800	8093840	oblivion that we had oblivion game of the year edition now we're having oblivion five years of
8093840	8099600	oblivion edition there's also a skyrim video thrown in oh okay and it's not going to have
8099600	8105440	the steelbook casing in europe but it will in the us i wonder if it's that same walkthrough video
8105440	8110480	that hit youtube this past week for skyrim that was a pretty good video no idea but people like
8110480	8115360	oblivion i didn't know that was in a steelbook case in the us i thought it was just re-released
8115360	8120000	with to be coming out and it's the anniversary edition is coming out in the steelbook case
8121440	8126080	in the u.s in the u.s but it's already come out in the u.s it came out back in july
8126800	8131440	actually in the june maybe this is a new new one yeah fifth anniversary edition it was the fifth
8131440	8137280	anniversary huh well it said it had the steelbook case in the u.s whatever um maybe it did i i
8137280	8141040	bought the game like five years ago i'm not gonna buy it again just because they threw in some extra
8141040	8148160	shit well you get 10 bucks off uh skyrim if you buy the game too i mean if you haven't played it
8148160	8152640	you know that's good oh yeah if you've never played oblivion it's worth checking out it is i mean
8152640	8159040	it's not like a job it's not fucking final fantasy it is not final fantasy but it is it's well way
8159040	8163280	more fallout but i always say fallout is more oblivion i don't know it's just it's so different
8163280	8170720	it's like that first person it plays much more like an older pc rpg like it's more ultima than
8170720	8175760	it is final fantasy and that's that's still a stretch i don't know what else to say you can
8175760	8179600	punch sheep in the face that's right you can punch sheep in the face that's what i'll say
8180320	8186080	or let loki say for me you can join guilds and rob them blind all the fun stuff you can do in
8186080	8192160	oblivion some folks in chat are like wow oblivion's that old yeah that's the same reaction i had i was
8192160	8197200	like shit i remember when that came out it was delayed from the original xbox launch supposed
8197200	8204640	to be a launch title that didn't make it anyhow loki um grand theft auto it's a lot not a big
8204640	8211920	surprise um big game series the um fourth expansion grand theft auto 4 surpassed 22 million units
8211920	8217520	shipped and uh which brings the total for the entire franchise to 114 million units shipped
8217520	8226960	since 1997 that's pretty amazing and uh apparently surpassed uh san andreas uh san andreas sold 21.5
8226960	8234960	million units um and this of course 500 000 over that now we need our grand theft auto 5 announcement
8234960	8243120	anytime now please it'll be next year what causes i'm just let opening this wide up to you being a
8243120	8248960	rampant fanboy but i don't care why is this game so popular why is the grand theft auto series
8248960	8256160	do so well why is it like just such a huge important game in the industry it's basically
8256160	8261360	you know it's you know obviously it kind of came up with the whole sandbox gameplay basically
8261360	8266480	people buy the gameplay because you can do whatever you want it you can drive around be
8266480	8273360	a criminal and do all sorts of crazy stuff with cars um shooting people and then just you know
8273360	8278960	recently with the psp and then the you know grand theft auto 4 and uh the episodes from
8278960	8284960	liberty city and stuff you know the multiplayer has been pretty cool um not a lot of people play
8284960	8292400	multiplayer anymore but uh actually still quite a you know good community one it first launched and
8292400	8298880	stuff um but i mean it's just kind of going from there and you know they also have pretty good
8298880	8303360	storylines they go along with everything and you know their own brand of kind of parody for
8303360	8309280	everything so i think that's why they're pretty popular um sandress especially that was a great
8309280	8314960	game um and then of course the new one five is supposed to be kind of like at least taking place
8314960	8322240	in sandrais again so that'll be freaking awesome all right well i got one more news story for you
8322240	8327040	guys and then we're going to open up the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username
8327040	8330880	on skype is orange lounge radio but this is a very important story because i've been waiting like
8331600	8336480	a year and a half maybe two years to report on this story and it's not that i'm like particularly
8336480	8343280	the biggest fan of this game but uh this just takes me back and uh thanks to the australian
8343280	8351520	classification board listing uh apparently an hd remake has been spotted of a certain racing game
8352320	8356560	guess what racing game uh derby owners club
8356560	8360080	oh
8364000	8366240	that's right daytona usa
8371760	8378080	and if it doesn't have this song in it fail absolutely do not purchase do not
8378080	8383520	purchase demand that the song be included you know that the lyrics are taken out for the
8383520	8391600	um sega racing classic no it's still the music but do you at least get the the doo doo doo doo doo
8391600	8398080	part yeah well that's the most important part right there i guess
8401840	8406400	uh so we don't know when the release date is but uh clearly it looks like something that's probably
8406400	8410400	going to come out for a xbox live arcade or playstation network something downloadable
8410400	8414960	because there already was like a sega racing game earlier this year right yeah and and i know that
8414960	8420480	there are no announcements and as far as i'm aware no plans whatsoever to bring this game to
8420480	8425760	uh consoles or portable systems but if you do a carmen san diego game
8425760	8428640	it's got to have the theme song from the game show i'm just saying
8433040	8437200	all right one more time before i open up the skyline just one just please one more

8648560	8653200	come back to this after i want to feel the force i will you do not want to feel the force you want
8653200	8658080	to feel this phone call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's cd thunder hey cd
8658080	8665280	thunder what's on your mind buddy uh not much uh i want to wish low-key happy belated birthday
8665280	8671760	thank you you're welcome um the two games i want to talk about tonight are driver san francisco
8671760	8677200	and dead island ah some uh pretty new games that have a lot of people talking all right so tell us
8677200	8682480	about uh we'll start with dead island what we'll start with dead island what do you want to say
8682480	8691360	about dead island oh dead island uh it sort of reminds me of dead rising a little bit except uh
8691360	8701520	you were and uh the uh except the weapons once you use them for a while they are become they become
8701520	8712080	useful they become useless and then um it's almost like an rpg because you can upgrade things but uh
8713360	8718640	it's pretty interesting but uh so like you might have a gun in dead island and heaven forbid you
8718640	8724400	actually run out of bullets and you can't use that gun anymore pretty much oh my gosh that's jank all
8724400	8729600	right well i guess it makes you force you to think outside the box a little bit i mean it does is the
8729600	8735760	game itself as artsy as that first trailer that they put out for it was or was that just like a
8735760	8742880	thing um it's uh when you say what do you mean when you say artsy you know how like that that
8742880	8748240	trailer that they put out had that sad little song and it was all in slow motion it was very artsy
8748240	8752640	like the way they did it but like the game at the end of the day is a zombie first person shooter
8752640	8757360	right or is it like did they try to class it up a bit i don't know i don't know how to explain it
8757920	8762800	well i didn't i didn't see the trailer but it's very colorful i mean it's set
8762800	8766880	like a general jungle setting where you have all these different apartment and condos things
8769280	8774480	well how does it compare to other zombie games is it as good or does it suck or what well i
8774480	8783680	haven't actually played it but um it looks it looks really good but it um
8785680	8790800	i think i might want to play it if i could so i just assumed that he played it that's all right
8790800	8794160	that's right all right well what do you want to say about driver san francisco is it have you
8794160	8800160	played driver san francisco or is this just like you want to it's uh like another one two thing
8800160	8804080	all right why why do you want to play driver san francisco i've actually heard a lot of good
8804080	8807680	things about driver san francisco especially the multiplayer which is interesting because
8807680	8813360	the last driver game i remember playing was driver 3 which was lol lol
8814640	8817920	ah that game was fun all right what do you want to say about driver san francisco
8817920	8824560	um one of the things i really like about it is there's parts where you your body is floating
8824560	8829200	above the city and you go into other vehicles and it like you take over another person's body
8829200	8834640	pretty much and when you talk it it's actually the person talking but you're making them say
8834640	8839360	whatever you want wasn't that yeah isn't that the whole thing about driver like you get to possess
8839360	8843840	people like that's you kind of float from car to car and like you could like possess a cop car and
8843840	8848720	all the cliff off a cliff off a cliff that's how you want to play yeah the real one there's a
8848720	8853840	mission where you have to take possession of this guy and scare his driving instructor
8853840	8863680	so he had to make his heartbeat go up to this a number of beats per second and uh he says stuff
8863680	8870000	like oh if you stop doing this now take 20 off your next driving lessons which where there will
8870000	8875760	be a lot of uh kevin68 in our chat says driver san francisco is actually good well then why
8875760	8881760	did they call it driver i'm just kidding well because you're a guy who's a cop who drives around
8881760	8887920	doing these different things different missions so i think that's why it's called driver but
8887920	8891760	okay because it's that same concept that's been around since because you can't get out of the car
8891760	8898400	you're driving you're stuck in the car forever and so all right drive it off cliff and then well
8898400	8901440	well cd thunder anything else you want to share our listeners tonight any other games you're
8901440	8908320	looking forward to um there's one i'm really looking forward to that rise of nightmares
8908320	8913600	why why rise of nightmares because it i like creepy games like house of the day i know that
8913600	8922400	type of thing and uh so i'm thinking you're kind of a zombie fan yeah a little bit not completely
8922400	8931600	all right and uh so i've only seen parts of it but it it's not actually that scary might scare
8931600	8938400	other people but it's got very creepy atmospheres all right incredibly gory well before we let you
8938400	8941920	go cd thunder i've gotta i gotta let you go so we can get more calls but we have folks in chat
8941920	8951760	requesting could we get a few bars of the daytona theme song day daytona let's go racing daytona
8952560	8956880	beautiful i like it i like he had a little bit of vibrato in his voice i like that
8956880	8961840	thank you all right all right have a good one buddy thank you suddenly i'm simon cowell you
8961840	8968160	reminded me um something um what's that there was some uh previous people talking about silent hill
8968160	8974720	downpour and how terrible it is uh-huh it got delayed to next year interesting won't make it
8974720	8980240	for halloween no it's terrible well if that's what they got to do they gotta polish it up that's why
8980240	8984560	it's going you know what that's probably a good thing then so all right let's get back to the
8984560	8989600	that's probably a good thing then so i at least that's what i've heard uh i haven't seen the
8989600	8995920	official move yet but yeah it's next year all right let me uh let me get to this uh avengers

9006640	9011360	this whole like flying around us iron man guess what you're never gonna play it if you want to
9011360	9016000	give us a call by the way 1877 game olr or a username on skype is orange lounge radio it's
9016000	9021200	all first person yeah it'd probably make me throw up it looks pretty cool it might be fun to watch
9021200	9024320	someone else unfortunately say he's probably gonna have a license for the avengers game and it'll be
9024320	9029120	a crappy brawler beat him up like the other games have been actually i would really like for them to
9029120	9033920	do an avengers game like they did uh ultimate alliance that would be really fun because i love
9033920	9037920	marvel ultimate alliance i do kind of like the way that they've done this where it's like you
9037920	9043760	really become the superhero that's kind of kind of neat and you fight super scrolls i'm trying to
9043760	9047920	see if there's any any other uh clips other than just the iron man there's hulk oh there's hulk
9047920	9052720	yeah it's clear that's hulk that's kind of neat with captain america you see like the shield on
9052720	9057200	one arm very cool thanks for sharing that with us tiger claw let's go to one more tweet from tiger
9057200	9063920	claw at twitter.com slash olr and i think this is sadly the last tweet we got tonight uh but this is
9063920	9070960	uh about a oh you guys will love this an unreal tournament three mod the what they've modded on
9070960	9077200	this nyan cat that's right they saw this cat in unreal tournament hold on because we're getting
9077200	9080160	another call but we'll come back to the nyan cat in a little bit first we got another call
9080160	9087440	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's me hi me what would the listeners rather know you
9087440	9095200	as oh whatever miklatau shane hi miklatau shane whatever what about shane latov yeah shane latov
9095200	9101520	what'd you call in to talk about tonight shane latov um i called in to talk about how awesome
9101520	9108240	neo wiz is and they released tap sonic this week on the iphone or ios and it's really really fun
9108240	9112640	and yeah i forgot to talk about that game i downloaded that on iphone it's it's it's neat
9112640	9117680	what neo wiz what else do they make because you said they're awesome dj max oh i didn't realize
9117680	9122640	the same company they're partially responsible for that that's why you see a lot of dj max songs when
9122640	9130240	you're actually playing taps on it where the free song is like the end song from dj max 2 i just
9130240	9135680	thought it was because they were both korean games i don't know no that would be cool though if all
9135680	9142560	the korean games got together and made it like some uber game like you like losing in dj max or
9143200	9150560	something awesome and pump it up i don't know sure sure um uh tell tell the listeners about
9150560	9155200	this game a little bit for those have no idea what tap sonic is because it was a the game is free
9156000	9159440	to check out sort of there's there's microtransactions at the butt in the game right
9159440	9166240	and you if you want to play like for real you have to use those microtransactions um because
9166880	9173280	as i was unaware when you spend like if you were one of the first i think it was 1000 people that
9173280	9179920	downloaded it you got 300 million points and use those music points to purchase songs or so i
9179920	9185360	thought you actually use those music points to play songs and you do not get to keep those songs
9185360	9190960	once you spend the money on them so every time you play a song you're spending points so it's
9190960	9196800	awesome i go back later i can just get a preview because i'm not a point wow that's kind of shitty
9196800	9202640	though i gotta say i don't like that but i noticed the free songs rotate cheaper what's that
9203920	9209920	i said i'd be okay with it if it was cheaper i guess the korean version like our rates for
9209920	9215520	song purchases are like four times what they are in korea so we're really getting screwed here
9215520	9219360	that's a little ridiculous i can't recommend it past the free songs for that but it's worth to
9219360	9223520	check out the free version for the free songs the free songs rotate that's one thing i noticed like
9223520	9228080	i had a song show up the first day that i wanted to play again and it was and now it was a pay song
9228080	9232960	and a different song had showed up instead so i think they rotate a little bit oh really yeah i
9232960	9236800	haven't noticed that yet i've only seen the same free song go back in and look because one of the
9236800	9243280	songs i played the first day was suddenly a pay song it was weird so um i'll probably do that but
9243280	9247840	the game itself the game itself it's like it's kind of like beatmania with the or guitar hero
9247840	9252160	with the falling notes and you have to tap on the bottom of the screen what i think is really cool
9252160	9257680	for ios is that there's certain notes that you tap hold and drag which i thought was kind of neat
9257680	9265520	it kind of looks like a sound voltex if if you're following konami games in a way because it's got
9265520	9273920	that guitar hero hallway style notes falling at you and well yes that's really about it and it's
9273920	9279440	musical uh so would you recommend people check out tap sonic or no it's too damn expensive even
9279440	9284480	though it's free to at least know it promotes our songs awesome i would i would say download the
9284480	9289920	free thing if you like it and you want to spend money on it go ahead it's not like you're paying
9289920	9295760	30 bucks to play three songs or something like that if you buy the points you know you probably
9295760	9301920	get a good week's worth of play time if you don't play it like for hours and hours and hours on end
9301920	9309760	so it's not so bad all right well any other games you want to mention um i don't think so i don't
9309760	9315360	remember i only called to talk about that since you failed to all right well my i'm sorry so just
9315360	9320080	shame on me forever you should read me pretty much before we let you go miklotov can we get

9440480	9445200	the place i find it's really laid back i'm really impressed and i'm really excited to be able to
9445200	9449600	ask what the setup you guys have going on here well thank you so much well it's almost like he
9449600	9454320	called just to inflate our egos tonight and i really appreciate that i already have a headache
9454320	9460480	because my skull's not big enough to hold all of my ego well no it is and i think hopefully go
9460480	9465840	ahead hopefully it's not gonna you know get too much larger than the studio this isn't a very big
9465840	9471840	room um yeah i know right uh i think it's important to note if if folks have only ever
9471840	9475840	listened to the podcast feed and never never joined us for a live show the chat room is a
9475840	9478960	lot of fun and even on a night like tonight where it's kind of a smaller turnout in chat
9478960	9486400	than it usually is stupid emmys yeah stupid emmys uh they the the top topic will sometimes be about
9486400	9490720	the show but then it kind of goes into these related topics and lots of links and fun things
9490720	9496000	to look at it's almost like its own little stumble upon or tumblr exactly it's kind of like a domino
9496000	9502960	effect of just sheer awesomeness absolutely in fact right now somebody is asking for the nyan cat
9502960	9508240	video so i said i would uh well relink that to me robin i'll put it on the tumblr because we're
9508240	9512480	putting stuff on the tumblr now oh of course of course hold on so that people will visit our
9512480	9518640	tumblr there you go all right you get both well what do you think about 3ds versus vita cinder
9518640	9522320	wolf since that's one of the big topics we got into tonight are you a 3ds owner by chance
9522320	9527760	uh actually i'm not an owner of the 3ds i've had the pleasure of playing with it a few times for
9527760	9533760	uh you know colleagues co-workers down at the office uh really liking it um i do love the option
9533760	9539440	of you know the intensity adjusting the intensity of the 3d feature uh just so just because it's
9539440	9544480	accommodating to everybody you know the people that typically you know suffer from things like
9544480	9550400	headaches or migraines with the 3d technology uh so nintendo definitely made a great choice in uh
9550400	9557360	not in that intensity feature you can go from like super gigantic headache to just minor headache to
9557360	9563600	like to like slurp even like i drink i was just saying to going from like migraine headaches to
9563600	9570320	i drank a slurpy too fast headache you know that type of thing exactly so well what about the vita
9570320	9574560	though because the vita's coming out pretty soon if you are i don't know if you're a psp owner or
9574560	9579040	if you're into sony stuff what do you think about what sony's doing over there well i i don't know
9579040	9584880	i well i i do like sony uh sony's hardware so and even sony's gaming repertoire but i'm not
9584880	9589920	particularly a fan of uh their marketing mode i mean they tend to wait for the competition to see
9589920	9596720	what they can improve on and that's always a great strategy but i find that uh because they're not
9596720	9602400	trying to stay ahead uh in the push everything out first mode i think they're losing a lot of
9602400	9608960	the possible potential fan base uh because you know what i mentioned earlier in the in the chat room
9608960	9615760	was that sony waited for microsoft to launch their 360 console and now worldwide there have
9615760	9621520	been more 360 consoles sold than the sony playstation 3's uh xbox seems to have that
9621520	9628480	much wider game repertoire to kind of cater to sort of all game or all gamers uh of all ages
9628480	9636320	except in japan teen and adults except in japan well yeah that i suppose that is kind of true
9637920	9644880	but uh i i find that that you know comparing the 360 repertoire to the playstation um you know
9644880	9651040	there really are maybe only five or six games uh so far i say for the ps3 for example i'm really
9651040	9656160	interested in that i haven't had a chance to play yet uh but you know it seems like microsoft is
9656160	9662880	hawking you know a new game every week that seemed to be catching my attention too um
9664160	9670240	it'll be similar with the uh the vita all right well we'll see we'll see what kind of develops
9670240	9673840	especially as we start to hear more about the north american launch because you know we've
9673840	9677360	heard a lot about the japanese launch but just because certain games are coming out at launch
9677360	9681120	over there doesn't mean the launch window games are going to be the same it's going to be very
9681120	9685360	interesting to see what happens with that um let me ask you one other quick question since you are
9685360	9692080	a first time caller of the show what was that sure oh okay um i always ask this of listeners
9692080	9696560	this kind of helps me understand what what kind of a gamer our listeners are what would you say
9696560	9700960	is your favorite video game of all time or if you're having trouble picking just one one of
9700960	9709520	your favorite video games of all time um favorite game of all time right now uh it's an old game i
9709520	9715520	think was released back in 1990 on the turbo graphics 16 console by nec it was called
9715520	9722480	newtopia 2 um it was sort of nec in hunts and soft's attempt at a zelda killer uh the
9722480	9727520	turbo graphics released a year before the super nintendo console um and it really has a lot of the
9727520	9733920	traditional rpg elements in it like the old zelda games um you know great soundtrack too even more
9733920	9740560	so than uh say the old zelda games and i don't know i just i find it fun a fun run right from
9740560	9745200	start to finish uh you can do it in you know a handful of hours you know five six hours but it's
9745200	9749600	just very addicting at fun i absolutely remember the newtopia series haven't you covered that on
9749600	9753520	the show before dark sucker i could be wrong but i have indeed covered newtopia so yeah it's a good
9753520	9758400	good uh good times so one of the one of the highlights of the turbo graphics 16 so you i
9758400	9762720	think you brought up turbo graphics in chat earlier so you must have been a big big fan
9762720	9768240	many years ago uh actually i did see growing up uh my family you know we didn't have the
9768240	9772640	standard nintendo receiver nintendo console uh dad had the old calico vision and ataris and then
9772640	9777920	we jumped right into the the turbo graphics uh moments for the deal so i kind of grew up playing
9777920	9782400	a lot of that uh and actually had the pleasure of finding one in a flea market about three years ago
9782400	9792480	so it's soaked up to the hdtv nice have you had a duo no i haven't actually i've wanted to
9792480	9797440	find one but uh you know other costs and other bills kind of trumping that right now well i can
9797440	9801280	tell you i can tell you right now if you're looking to play any of the imports that uh
9801280	9806880	it actually is gonna it was we had a like some converter but the converters hardly ever work
9806880	9812800	um you can get the core graphics really cheap the pc engine yeah that is true yeah and i mean
9812800	9817840	although i do like the idea of the duo um my it's kind of funny my little brother back home actually
9817840	9824560	hooked me up with uh a lot of the old roms and emulators actually that i can just you know i
9824560	9831040	play on my own time here it's a magic engine uh yes actually oh the ma i i use the magic
9831040	9836640	and actually for all the turbo graphics uh games that are out there so far so cool well you have
9836640	9841440	a fan in chat because game guru says utopia is awesome utopia is pretty cool yeah it's a good
9841440	9845120	good series i've played it once too it's good there's just a number if you're really into
9845120	9850880	turbo graphics there's a number of duo games that you gotta check out uh i'm i'm pretty sure there
9850880	9856080	were two actually my uh younger brother back home a bit of a more of a classic slash hardcore old
9856080	9861760	school gamer than myself he's constantly talking about the older titles that he's finding uh
9861760	9866320	but um just one of the funniest things that might actually throw you guys off that uh the one game
9866320	9874400	on utopia 2 the actual copy on ebay 256 bucks you're kidding me nope is that like just the
9874400	9880720	card 12 hours ago is that just the hue card or like with everything and that's that's the
9880720	9886080	original like uh the cd case that it came in like on the hue card itself the little game booklet
9886080	9891680	everything it's used obviously but yeah 256 bucks wow i think we got ours like in a stack of games
9892960	9896960	wow oh yeah well it's fun i'm sure my dad's gonna kick himself in the ass when he finds out what
9896960	9902400	it's going for because i think we paid five bucks for it back in the day i bet good gosh all right
9902400	9906640	well i i let this call go on a little long but that's okay because he's a first-time caller so

9969920	9974800	in that mailbag for dark soccer to read next week make her work damn it mailbag at orange
9974800	9980960	lounge radio.com or you could send us more tweets like one more i usually have a two tweet limit on
9980960	9986000	twitter but i'm being super nice tonight because this is another video and it's from tiger claw
9986000	9992640	and he usually sends good stuff so what the heck let's do this one it's a a mod that he sent us
9992640	9999200	it's super pixel brothers i guess what is this it's a it's a playable super mario brothers
9999200	10007840	but it's only 64 pixels i guess it's an eight by eight led board that does super mario brothers but
10007840	10013440	i can't imagine this at all looks pretty like it's gotta be terrible let's see i want to see what
10013440	10019520	this looks like here so i'm trying to load up the video in chat but it's it's um here we go there
10019520	10027360	we go guys oh my gosh he's playing blocks and under certain blocks and i've actually made it
10027360	10032080	random oh he's got a nice accent i'm gonna try this out five points whereas just normal blocks to get
10032080	10039280	to now another feature i've added is five different colored blocks yeah so if i can
10039280	10044240	explain to you guys i don't think it's literally the nintendo rom like but it looks like somebody
10044240	10051760	made their own version of it on this like imagine like one of those old school led games where
10051760	10057200	there's only so many places you can have a cutout and he's it's basically these colored lights and
10057200	10062480	the little mario is like an orange square that kind of goes around and you can break blocks and
10062480	10067680	jump on top of things i gotta say this is much more impressive than what i was thinking it was
10067680	10073440	gonna look like and these levels are it's sad i recognize these levels based off of the real game
10074160	10079520	it's been translated really well a website run by enl so that's i gotta say that's pretty cool
10079520	10086400	yeah not bad so i guess uh dark sakura i got one more link for you okay so why don't you go uh
10087360	10091360	post that on the tumblers people are watching tumblr are gonna say it blew up tonight
